budgie vs finch please answer i want to get a bird to keep my cockatiel company while im at school during the day time i was thinking of a couple of finches in the cage next to her but i also want to be able to hold the bird i get i don't want to have to give up time playing with the cockatiel by spending it with the new bird do you think i should get a budgie or a couple of finches to live in the cage next to my cockatiel to keep her company and ifi get a budgie can their wings be clipped u should definately get a budgie they are way more calm and tame i think finches are too wild and can't be held budgies wings can be clipped but be sure to ask the people at the petstore to show u how budgies are prettier for the most part they can also learn to talk and all finches do is fly around their cages u will see what i mean when u go to the petstore and see the budgies calmly sitting and playing with their toys the finches will most likely be flapping around like an insane creature if u do get a budgie be sure to get a young one the young ones are easier to train to sit on your finger the young budgies will have small stripes from the back of their head all they way to their beak good luck Cockatiel Budgerigar Finch Darwin's finches Mealy Parrot Chicken Bird The Creatures Ferret Parrot To Kill a Mockingbird Falconry Canary Hamster The Ashlee Simpson Show Budgie (band) Shannara creatures Piccolo Junior Saga Salad Fingers Paragliding Helicopter Gal__pagos Islands Chaffinch Chocobo Pterosaur Pet April Fool's Day Conure John Cage Charles Darwin RuneScape quests Seabird Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fixed-wing aircraft Creatures in Bionicle Comanche Treehouse of Horror V Cockatoo Bird song Condor Dog training Bird flight Gliding The Amber Spyglass Wing Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Inception of Darwin's theory Late Night with Conan O'Brien Judas Priest Seneca College Reservoir Dogs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Equine conformation Gesture Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Capercaillie Psittacosis Charge (heraldry) The Silence of the Lambs Sarah, Duchess of York Tenchi Muyo!
