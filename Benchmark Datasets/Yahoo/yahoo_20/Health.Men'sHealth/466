chest work out after protein drink after i work out my chest my chest gets big and i can do the dance with my chest but after i drink my protein drink after a while i can't do it and its not as big as it was should i stop drinking it or what after you work out your chest or any body part at that you get a pump this means your muscle expands gets bigger for a little while it has nothing to do with the protein drink go work out your bicep and they will enlarge pump and then eventually go back to normal this happens because when you work out your muscle breaks down and then rebuilds itself in a way in the process it's trapping water and blood to help with the cooling down as you would say the pump is purely water thats it has nothing to do with the protein eventually when you get more muscle in your chest you will be able to do the dance all you want but in order to do that gain muscle in your chest then protein drink will be your best friend take a protein drink protein carbohydrate even better before you work out maybe minutes and tehn one right afterward and one in the morning when you first wake up when your body needs to be replinished the most protein as you may know is the building block of muscles so when your body breaks down the muscle to build it back up again it needs protein as protein is literally a building block of muscle sole purpose of it is to build muscle with that said you also need good quality food protein drink is a supplement and should only be used as such a supplement nothing beats quality food but protein drinks help bridge the gap stick with tuna eggs and meat among other things good luck and good dancing Bodybuilding Weight training Veganism Biochemistry Atherosclerosis Milk Myocardial infarction First aid Chicken Brewery Cirrhosis Insulin Coronary heart disease Protein-energy malnutrition Sin City Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Atkins Nutritional Approach Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia Glucose Nutrition Vegetarianism Heart Lung Cardiac cycle Honeybee Puberty Piccolo Junior Saga Insect Muscle Gelatin Creatine Conker's Bad Fur Day Multiple sclerosis Blood Professional wrestling holds Marathon (sport) Breastfeeding Water Fasting Obstetrics Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Alzheimer's disease Ice cream Zinc Tooth enamel Urinary incontinence Myasthenia gravis Warm-blooded Cancer Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) House music Hypomagnesemia Thyroid Wound healing phases Jackass: The Movie Respiratory system Wing Chun Healthy eating Ventricular fibrillation Carbon dioxide Vitamin C Nutrient Glucocorticoid Soy protein Anabolic steroid Sarcomere Aztec Autonomous building Signal transduction Reptile In-N-Out Burger Potassium Naruto jutsu Low-carbohydrate diet Glycogen storage disease type I Surimi Spider Growth hormone treatment Equine conformation Eye Morphogenesis Testosterone Hydrochloric acid Fugu Anemia Allergy Inclusion body myositis Diabetes mellitus Caffeine Water purification Food Cocaine Stem cell
