physical checkups ok im afraid when i go to the doctor for my physical that i get a b ner when she checks my penis how can i prevent a b ner during my physical p s im only i forgot to mention she's hot and has huge boobs x x you could try to go to a male doctor if a female one makes you too nervous you could drink plenty of cold water an hour before you have to be examined this would cause you to urinate just before being examined the kidney's need to evacuate urine will cause the penis to remain flacid non erect try a test run at this to see what is your reaction to drinking a lot of water and how long it takes before you need to urinate use this as your guide for your exam you could visualize that she is really a wrinkly old man a transvestite is the ugliest woman you ever saw or has some gnarly disease that you wouldn't want to have sex with her under any circumstances but mosty get a grip on your imagination and emotions take control and realize that this is just a medical exam not a sexual opportunity believe me by this time in her career she has probably seen her fair share of penis' erect or otherwise and one looks pretty much like any other and has told her fair share of males to turn their head and cough don't think about it and don't worry about it and you'll be okay Prostate cancer Penis Condom Medicine Medical analysis of circumcision Herpes simplex virus Premature ejaculation Cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Orgasm Sexual intercourse Physical examination Hypoglycemia Dead Like Me Combat stress reaction Human penis size Penis envy Castration Gonorrhoea Masturbation Transgender Birth control Multiple sclerosis Diabetes mellitus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Erectile dysfunction Intersex surgery Oral sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Jam (TV series) First aid Domestic violence History of male circumcision Urine Social rule Pneumonia Sin City Friends Sex assignment Abortion debate Safe sex Urinary system Recurring South Park characters Kidney Human sexual behavior Puberty Hyperthermia Erection Female genital cutting Sigmund Freud Jon Secada Dehydration Ben Johnson (athlete) Strap-on dildo Milton H.
