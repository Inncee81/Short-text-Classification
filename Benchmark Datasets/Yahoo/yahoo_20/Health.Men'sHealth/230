does anybody know how to build massive traps besides shoulder shrugs also what foods to eat before bed and post workout i hit traps along with shoulders and do shrugs as well as another exercise that i don't know the name of i am including my whole workout if you are interested as for food i eat a sandwich orange and banana right after the work out and eat my regular dinner about hours after that if you are bulking eat rice and beans potatoes meat and vegetables like chard and broccoli here s what i do and it has been working for me obviously a workout needs to be tailored to the individual but these exercises may help arms lying dumbbell triceps extensions standing barbell curl behind head reverse hammers one arm preacher curl close grip pushdowns incline dumbbell curl parallel bar dips hammer curl single arm reverse grip pushdowns reverse grip ez bar rope push downs super light dumbbell curls chest dumbbell incline presses pullovers and presses dumbbell bench presses narrow grip bench presses incline dumbbell flyes barbell incline presses push ups between benches cable standing incline flyes cable standing decline flyes back barbell row dumbbell row lat pull downs cable row lower back machine forearms lite wide lat pulldowns supermans shoulders lateral raises bent over lateral raises no rest front raises shrugs military presses front raises rotator cuffs superlight lateral raises on incline bench with lbs dumbbells st facing forward bring dumbbells up from sides to parallel to ground palms inward slow repeat for ten reps nd facing bench bring dumbbells up from sides backwards as far as you can palms inward slow repeat for ten reps rd stand up with dumbbells and do lateral raises th back in position raise arms so they are forward palms inward arms bent in a semi bear hug position and parallel to ground bring to sides and back to center for reps i usually do lbs here because this exercise is hard trapps do this set three times with out rest the third set i change to all lb movements all of this is slow pace like second up and one second down legs squats leg extentions leg curls adductors abductors calf lifts glute machine leg lifts i also do crunches per night my idea is to hit a variety of ranges and movements in order to work the muscle to the maximum i tend to use a weight i can do for reps and for reps on the last two movements apart from this i do minutes or cardio every day and stretch before and after the workout as well as frequently during stretching is very important to muscular growth because not only does it help prevent injury and alleviate recovery pain but it also stretches out the fascia tissue that surrounds the muscle and inhibits its growth when you are pumped and you stretch is when you get the best stretch of the fascia lastly rest and nutrition are every bit as important as the workout itself eating enough protein for the muscle to recover and grow as well as enough carbohydrates to replenish diminished glycogen stores in the muscles and liver is vital for repair and being ready for the next time you tax those muscles Bodybuilding Humerus Breaststroke Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Bench press Professional wrestling aerial techniques Fast bowling Volleyball Boxing Swingout Arm Bicycle Powerbomb Clean and jerk Glossary of climbing terms Squat (exercise) Front crawl Scapula Parade (military) Swimming Exercise DDT (professional wrestling) Anchor Deadlift Internal ballistics Ulna Diving Tetrapod Glossary of ballet terms Horizontal bar Dieting Elbow-joint Insulin Carpal tunnel syndrome Massage M16 (rifle) Salute Muscle Mixed martial arts Pole vault Dairy Figure skating Glossary of American football Lindy Basic Casualty lifting Obedience training Neckbreaker Urinary incontinence Sailing Cat Bruce Lee Weightlifting Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Leaf Puberty Horse Terminal ballistics Backbreaker Eye Wing Chun Combine (Half-Life 2) Coffee Aikido Heckler & Koch G3 Marching band Drill bit Piledriver (professional wrestling) Tyrannosaurus rex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Comanche The Time Machine Chair Food Marathon (sport) Abdomen Anatomical position Fancy rat Spanking Breakfast Milton H.
