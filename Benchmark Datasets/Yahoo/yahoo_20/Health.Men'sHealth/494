sexploration tell me anything and or everything about sexploration first realize that your genitals are among your body's most sensitive parts their skin is the thinnest of any the younger you are the more sensitive it seems to be but it's easy for anyone to irritate or damage that skin there are types of injury that you risk temperature burns chemical burns abrasion scuffing or chafing the skin and for males damaging the circulation system in your genitals if you heat anything in a microwave oven or on a stove intending to put your penis into it or put it into your vagina test it first on your cheek or the inside of your wrist realize that anything such as vapo rub or alcohol that mildly stimulates the thicker skin on your hands arms or legs especially if it contains alcohol or menthol is likely to burn your genitals a surface that may feel smooth to the touch of a finger still could be rough enough to scrape the skin of an erect penis or the membranes that line a vagina tying a string or putting a rubber band around the base of your penis or scrotum if drawn tightly can easily damage the blood vessels inside you need those blood vessels to get and keep an erection although rare it's possible to twist a testicle around inside your scrotum so the testicle's blood supply is cut off the only fix is to go immediately to the emergency room where the scrotum is cut open and the testicle physically untwisted so as to restore blood flow there are normally no bacteria in urine semen or pre cum but your anus abounds in bacteria take great care to keep anything you use for anal stimulation away from other body parts particularly your or a friend's vagina until you can clean it absolutely do not trade anal toys with anyone furthermore understand that although not everyone enjoys anal stimulation people who do can be heterosexual homosexual or bisexual liking anal stimulation is not an indicator of sexual orientation safe lubricants commonly available at home include baby oil kitchen cooking oil vaseline and k y jelly often better when supplemented with water enjoy your body's responses to sexual stimulation but do so responsibly and with respect so you can continue to enjoy that response throughout your life Masturbation Prostate cancer Gay slang Intersex surgery Androgen insensitivity syndrome Orgasm Human sexual response cycle Puberty Erectile dysfunction Methamphetamine Erogenous zone Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fisting Gender role Sex organ Penis enlargement Anal masturbation Violin Transmission (medicine) Birth control Cryptorchidism Sexual differentiation Testicle Intravenous therapy Vagina Medical analysis of circumcision Female genital cutting Human anatomy Male reproductive system (human) Pneumonia Domestic violence Body piercing Scrotum Vulva Anus Bondage (BDSM) Skin Herpes simplex virus Child sexuality Diving suit Menstrual cup Stroke Human sexuality Urinary incontinence Drill bit Genital wart Salad Fingers Acne Cat Psoriasis Massage Cancer Erection Dildo Castration History of intersex surgery Bleeding Pubic hair Solar power Cookware and bakeware Butt plug 2005 trial of Michael Jackson First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma AIDS Gonorrhoea Physical intimacy Knife Pain Hazing Smegma Eczema Portable stove Brewery Breastfeeding Premature ejaculation Penis removal Carbon dioxide Hand grenade Wound Motor oil Intersexuality Testicular torsion
