'adult' circumcision i was wondering does this hurt i didn't have my skin cut when i was born for some personal reasons and well i don't really think girls like the skin on it from what i hear and i was wondering if i get it cut how much would it hurt do they put you under anesthesia or whatever for it i'm so i'd probably get a bunch of erections which i thought would make it hurt a lot more i'm also a bit embarrassed to tell anyone i want it cut but i really want it done well unlike newborns you won't scream your guts out discussed later on with links because you can be put to sleep but recovery can be painful for some for especially the first two weeks especially with erections as it disturbs the wound make sure you research it well because once you have it done you can't go back if you don't end up liking it most guys in the world are uncircumcised and in some american states its pretty common since circumcision rates have fallen a lot circumcision is a traditionally jewish and muslim procedure although it was introduced and encouraged to the western developed world as a way to stop masturbation especially with the help of dr kellogg see link however although scientific studies have discovered that circumcision harms masturbation by up to over needless to say it doesn t completely stop masturbation many circumcised guys find it more convenient to use a commercial lubricant as a result since the typically moist foreskin that is like the eyelids is not present to rub the glans with most developed nations quickly rejected circumcision after noticing its ineffectiveness against masturbation and as a result the united states remains the last developed nation doing it to a significant percentage of newborns this was done as a result of the for profit american health care system promoting myths about benefits of circumcision such preventing penile cancer a b preventing hiv c d despite the usa being the developed nation with the highest hiv rates and circumcision rates e and preventing stds d f as a result circumcision is now brings in hundreds of millions of dollars to doctors and the american health system however circumcision has been becoming less popular as years have passed by in the s over of guys were circumcised in the usa now circumcision rates are as low as in some states more and more parents are discovering that circumcision carries more risks than benefits and realize that by leaving their sons uncircumcised they have the choice of choosing what they d like since the surgery is irreversible circumcision risks include the loss of sexual pleasure according to multiple studies those studies take into effect many sensation points including the foreskin and they involve many participants there have been other studies that claim no difference but they don t even take into effect the nerve endings on the foreskin which as seen in one study are some of the most sensitive points on the penis one study even found an increase in erectile dysfunction rates after circumcision a in another study it was found that females ended up reaching orgasm with and preferring uncircumcised males in out of cases b in addition circumcision is extremely painful on newborns and you risk many bad conditions such as a buried penis when too much foreskin is removed and limits the size of the penis or adhesions or skin bridges that develop from the head to the shaft when the skin heals after the surgery meatal stenosis occurs in up to of circumcised males when the opening of the penis becomes irritated from too much exposure and rubbing and begins to close up and meatal ulcers all those risks are of course not including the possibility of having too much skin removed which can cause discomfort during erections due to lack of skin to allow the penis to expand and could consequently cause a hairy penis by pulling pubic hair and skin to the shaft often a circumcision scar develops around the penis after circumcision in addition circumcision has negative effects on breastfeeding to conclude here is a link that describes the anatomy of the foreskin and the development of the foreskin with infants a link especially helpful for parents a ultimately one survey found that although uncircumcised guys are a bit more satisfied percentage wise it s within the margin of error the only difference is that those unsatisfied uncircumcised guys can simply get circumcised and end up satisfied either way in addition in one survey it was found that up to half of circumcised guys expressed concerns on wishing to have had the choice themselves that along with the risks and negative effects that are being seen more with the help of the internet may be what is bringing down circumcision rates Hormone
