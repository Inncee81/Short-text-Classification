gaining weight a big mystery for me hi all my height is ' and weighs kg age i m very skinny i eat well but i can't gain weight and most of the time feel embaresment when some one says you r very thin and skinny wht shud i do so tht i gain weight at least kg more regards i had this problem until i was a year older than you are now for the life of me i just couldn't gain weight i finally managed to do so when i was my best answer eat well lots of carbs and work out eating well if you want a bigger fire you put more material in to burn if you want a bigger body you need to put plenty of food in it so it can build carbs are used by the body as long term energy meaning they will be stored longer and keep your weight up working out means both aerobically and anaerobically aerobic so the carbs you're adding don't turn to fat trust me you're better off being skinny than being fat anaerobic because lifting weights will build your muscles muscles have a pretty high density which will bulk you up and help you gain weight there are some products on the market that are considered weight gainers if you hit up a local health shop they should be able to recommend something but if you're not eating right first then it's not going to help Atkins Nutritional Approach Weight training Low-carbohydrate diet Swimming Exercise Obesity Dieting Muscle Anorexia nervosa Milk Bodybuilding Aerobic exercise Food Piccolo Junior Saga South Beach diet Sewage treatment Binge eating disorder Waste management Cellular respiration Human height Ramen Glycolysis Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hydrogen economy Diabetes mellitus Bong Body mass index Diving Marathon (sport) Uranium Magnesium Dodge Charger Aspartame Brown Bear Fecal incontinence Ketosis Growth hormone treatment Chocolate Dairy Cheese Super Size Me Soil life Internal ballistics Tocopherol Nutrition Body type (exercise) Hamster DDT Adjustable gastric band Flatulence Urinary incontinence Nuclear weapon design Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cannabis (drug) Creatine Norway national football team Toyota Corolla Wall Street Explosive material Mattress Depleted uranium Veganism Vermicompost Terminal ballistics Weight Puberty Raw food diet Nuclear fusion Fat Hamburger Mass Pork M60 machine gun Guinea pig Renewable energy Garfield M16 (rifle) Biochemistry Wood Professional wrestling throws Insulin Skin Feeder (fetish) Birth weight InuYasha (character) Sauerkraut Domestic rabbit Potassium Space elevator Mercury Cougar Dualism (philosophy of mind) Babe Ruth Ford Thunderbird Growth hormone deficiency Fancy rat
