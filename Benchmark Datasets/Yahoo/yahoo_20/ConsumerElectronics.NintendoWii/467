is the mod chip installer for the wii trustworthy the guy has the website adress www phuongmods com please answer im dying to know if he is putting a mod chip inside any console is a risk if it requires soldering work the installer could damage the motherboard or other critical components with the soldering gun heat the question is whether or not this particular installer is trustworthy i have personally never used his services what i recommend is contacting the installer and asking him for references for some of his install work of course he's only going to give you references of people who got working consoles back then contact the references and ask how their experience went there is always a possibility even with good references that he could fry your wii and it could end up dead adding a mod chip to any console automatically voids the warranty so you should also keep that in mind good luck Modchip Xbox Windows 2000 Modding Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Printed circuit board Case modding Solder Overclocking Team Fortress Classic Super Nintendo Entertainment System Drill bit Computer and video games PlayStation 2 PHP Epoxy Universal Serial Bus Halo 2 Doom 3 IBM PC compatible PlayStation 3 Solar cell Commodore 64 AmigaOS Heat sink Mozilla Firefox Unreal Halo: Combat Evolved Starsiege: Tribes Quake II Half-Life 2 Thermal power station Airbag TRS-80 Color Computer MOS Technology 6502 Counter-Strike M16 (rifle) Cheating in Counter-Strike Surface-mount technology Copy protection Xbox 360 SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Video game music Dynamic random access memory Fallout (computer game) Radeon Nuclear power Hubble Space Telescope Quake III Arena ATI Technologies Poker jargon Microprocessor Hard disk Galactic Civilizations Condom Mozilla Application Suite Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Philip J.
