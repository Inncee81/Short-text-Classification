how do i connect my wii to a wired connection i have a sbc modem it can b wireless or wired but i think were set up w the wired connection im not sure and i don't no how to find out what kind of security we have i am really confused so if some could just take me step by step through the process i'd be really gratefull for that thanx the wii itself will take you thru the process it will search for a wireless connection and if it finds one it will ask you for your password assumng you do have security set up if it doesn't then you will need to connect the cable that came with the wii to the router you have if your modem is only a modem and not the one that includes a wireless router then you are stuck hard wiring it or buying a wi fi router qwest has a wifi router that plugs into its modem that is your easiest solution if your wii doesn't find a wifi signal when it searches you can also buy a router at wal mart Wi-Fi Wireless LAN Modem Router Voice over IP Digital Subscriber Line Password Xbox Wireless access point Universal Serial Bus IEEE 802.11 Ethernet Bluetooth Telegraphy Cisco Systems Denial-of-service attack Local area network RS-232 Power line communication Wireless HomePNA Computer surveillance ITU-T Enigma machine Broadband Internet access AT&T Mouse (computing) Wireless community network Advanced Technology Attachment Hotspot (wifi) WiMAX Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing ZigBee Television Nintendo DS Null modem Nintendo GameCube USB flash drive Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis General Packet Radio Service Computer forensics Surveillance AirPort 3Com Corporation Internet fraud Internet security Atari 8-bit family Burglar alarm Spyware Nintendo Revolution Alcatel Integrated Services Digital Network Hayes command set SBC Communications Software-defined radio Serial port Radio U.S. Robotics Xbox 360 Drill bit Computer network Computer bus Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Differentiated services Electricity meter Serial communications Digital circuit Bombe Communications protocol Hearing aid IEEE 802.11i System/36 ALOHAnet IMac TIA-568A/B Cisco IOS GSM services Embedded system Verizon Communications Telephone company Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line X.25 MAC address Novell NetWare Malware Lag Home cinema PDP-11 Texas Instruments Netfilter/iptables Telephone exchange Internet Laptop 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines
