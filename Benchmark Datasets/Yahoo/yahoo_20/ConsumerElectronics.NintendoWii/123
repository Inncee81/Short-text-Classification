wii console getting kinda slow i have a nintendo wii and have the first channel screen filled with icons and a few saved game data games i have noticed that when i return to the main screen its taking a lot longer than it use to and sometimes when i start a channel like photo it can take nearly just to start up meanwhile all i see is a black screen i am aware its not the powerhouse of console's but anyone else have any details btw fantastic console i've got all the available channels games downloaded and i've never encountered this trouble i've had mine since launch and never had one single problem out of it i'd call up nintendo and ask them about it they do have good customer support if you registered your wii they extended the warranty on it so if you haven't done it yet register it at www nintendo com either way be sure to call and find out it is toll free so you don't have anything but time to loose Game Boy Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo 64 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo Nintendo DS Nintendo Revolution Handheld game console PlayStation Portable Xbox PlayStation 2 Nintendo GameCube Super Mario Bros. 3 RISC TurboGrafx 16 Game Boy Advance PlayStation 3 Advance Wars: Dual Strike Pok__mon (video games) Sega Master System Nintendo Power Video game music The Sims 2 Xbox 360 Super Mario 64 PC Engine Final Fantasy VI Final Fantasy (video game) Computer role-playing game Video game console Mozilla Firefox N-Gage Commodore 64 Sega Saturn Super Mario Bros.
