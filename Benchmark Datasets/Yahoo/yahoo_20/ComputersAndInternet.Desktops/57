my pc logs me off a second after i log in plzz help me i had problems with viruses recently i can't even see my desktop bcoz after i login the pc automatically logs me off i have already tried safe mode and log on as an administrator but the pc still logs me off plzz help t t with a name like computer n b im going to assume the same of your real life persona there are things you can do but unless you have time and patience to learn it proper your best bet is to take it to a reliable repair person either a qualified friend a qualified friend not your tinker happy best friend and have them help if you have to take it to a proffessional do what you can to retrieve the files you need to keep music if not take the plunge and send it in before you do though take a snapshot of the inside of your computer ive heard more than one incident of a pc repair shop stealing pc parts from customers and swapping them with junk if you want to fix it yourself then you will have to burn a cd operating system puppy linux is a good example and boot your computer from the cd drive potentially you should be able to run some antivirus programs out of the linux os and hopefully clear out the problem its more complicated than im stating though so be sure you want to take this step first and be ready to do some research on it Computer virus Windows XP Linux Windows 2000 Anti-virus software Microsoft Windows Virtual memory IBM PC compatible Rootkit OS/2 RSTS/E Embedded system Skype Booting Knoppix Redundant array of independent disks LiveCD Partition (computing) Computer Steam (content delivery) Bluetooth Spyware Debugging Hard disk Modchip Operating system DragonFly BSD MS-DOS Filename extension Mandriva Linux Software engineering File Allocation Table NX bit Kernel (computer science) Modem Mach kernel File system Software bug Linux distribution Windows Vista Puppy Linux OpenBSD 64-bit Enterprise content management Unix AmigaOS Control-Alt-Delete Database DOS Mainframe computer Malware X Window System Windows Server 2003 USB flash drive Stopping e-mail abuse Linux kernel CPU design NeXT Novell NetWare Pretty Good Privacy IA-32 E-mail Digital circuit Supercomputer Personal computer PDP-11 Hubble Space Telescope Wget Java programming language History of the graphical user interface GNOME Thread (computer science) Opera (web browser) Microsoft Object Desktop Mozilla Firefox Public-key cryptography PowerPC E-mail spam FreeDOS Quantum computer Buffer overflow C programming language Windows 95 Surveillance L4 microkernel family Apollo Guidance Computer PaX Trusted computing Scientology beliefs and practices Forth programming language Web crawler Windows 3.x Universal Serial Bus Sun Microsystems Master Control Program
