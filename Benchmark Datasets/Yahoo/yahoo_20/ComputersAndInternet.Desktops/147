why wont my computer stay on my computer will sometimes turn on but only for about seconds it will go to the boot up screen where i have choices of how to start it but it never stays on long enough for me to figure anything out also when i go to turn it on it will only work once in awhile what is the problem how can i fix it i haven't added anything to it it will shut off no noises or anything and no it doesn't get past the boot up screen it sounds like a memory issue if you have the resources try replacing your memory with different modules and see if that fixes your problem make sure to read up on your motherboard to make sure that it is the right memory bootup problems are very hard to debug Booting Windows 2000 Atari 8-bit family Debugging Computer virus Atari ST Windows XP Commodore 64 AmigaOS Embedded system Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Blue screen of death ZX Spectrum DragonFly BSD Computer forensics IBM PC compatible X Window System Virtual memory Apple IIGS Nintendo Entertainment System Modchip Trusted computing SAM Coup__ Optimization (computer science) IPod System 7 (Macintosh) BIOS Hard disk Mach kernel Assembly language Commodore 128 Bootstrapping Architecture of Windows 2000 Amstrad CPC IBM PC System/36 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction PlayStation 2 Sampler (musical instrument) Computer Compiler optimization Software bug Digital photography Oscilloscope FreeDOS MiniDisc Fritz-chip MSX AMD TRS-80 X86 assembly language OpenBSD Amiga Toyota Prius Knoppix IP (complexity) Forth programming language IA-32 Cray-1 Computer bus Mouse (computing) John Titor Commodore PET Sound effect Desktop computer Tandy 1000 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Microsoft Windows Magic number (programming) Modern naval tactics Apollo Guidance Computer Apollo 6 Advanced Technology Attachment System/34 History of Microsoft Windows Overclocking PowerBook Partition (computing) C programming language Objective-C Apple II family Redundant array of independent disks MAME Computer storage Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Quantum computer Sound Blaster Radiation hardening Sonic the Hedgehog 2 INMOS Transputer Super Mario Bros. 3 MOS Technology 6502 Year 2000 problem File Allocation Table Floppy disk Complexity classes P and NP Universal Serial Bus Video Graphics Array Computer security
