which is better sli or crossfire i'm building a top end gaming pc and was going to use two evga e geforce ultra black pearls in sli my question is do ati do a crossfire equivilent that matches or would better this setup i have a very large budget as i've just recieved a large sum of money from my insurance after crashing my supercar unfortunately i'll have to get a smaller car to get insured again but good news is i'll have about grand to spend building my new pc and so want the absolute best from what i've read crossfire is actually more feature rich as when one card isn't doing anything it works on antianalysing where as sli does nothing the only thing is i don't think there are any cards by ati better than the nvidea ultras ps i have had both nvidea and ati cards before and am unbiased to either company i think they are both good brands and would prefer this question to look at the facts and not become a personal slagging match over who thinks which manufacturer is better the s have been performing better in benchmarks than the ati equivalent but the transfer into gaming performance will be unnoticeable to be honest same with sli v crossfire at the level of card you are looking at anything you can throw at it will work fine what we don't know a great deal about is actual directx performance as this is going to be the main driver for graphics development over the next couple of years i would hold off getting your cards for a few months until some decent games come out which will really use the technology and allow a more objective assessment if you really need want your pc up and running now why not buy an interim card so that you don't have to stare at that unused case in the corner depending on which option you go with you could get a relatively low spec card and re sell it once you have had a chance to make a firm decision will also give you an idea how the rest of your set up performs prior to fitting a grand or more's worth of gfx hope this helps and whatever you go for i'm sure that it is going to be an excellent system Radeon NVIDIA GeForce 6 Series 3dfx GeForce FX GeForce Poker jargon IBM PC compatible Radeon X Series GeForce 2 Doom 3 Windows Vista OpenGL Xbox Nintendo Revolution CPU cache Scalable Link Interface DDR2 SDRAM Graphics card Counter-Strike Nintendo Nintendo GameCube Microeconomics GeForce 7 Series The Sims 2 NForce4 Blackjack Hard disk GeForce 3 PlayStation 3 Doomsday argument GeForce 256 Ethics Yu-Gi-Oh!
