processer help i have a socket lga the processor that came with my computer is a p extreme i just found a good deal for a intel core quad q ghz for do these even come close to the core extreme i also dont want to spend anymore money on cooling products i already have mm fans intake on side panal top exhaust and back exhaust i want to know if thats enough for a hog quad core yes it does have cores woo hoo but not everything can use two cores let alone so in a great many cases the core extreme will outperform the q and if you are talking about the quad core core extreme of course it will be better since it is faster that said don't pay for a core extreme just too much money the slight performance gain is not worth an extra no way as for cooling as long as you don't overclock you should be fine lastly make sure your motherboard will support the core s just because it is socket does not mean it will support them Athlon Pentium 4 Overclocking Celeron AMD PC motherboard Xeon Pentium M VIA C3 Opteron NVIDIA AMD K6-III Pentium III RISC GeForce 6 Series PowerPC Pentium D Central processing unit Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis 3dfx Microprocessor Cyrix ATI Technologies Northbridge (computing) Athlon 64 Radeon Dual-core PR rating CPU cache Pentium Pro Front side bus IA-64 VIA Technologies Duron Intel iAPX 432 Athlon 64 X2 Jet engine Power Mac G5 IMac AMD K6-2 NForce4 Mac OS X v10.4 Socket 939 AMD 5x86 Itanium 2 Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Personal computer DEC Alpha Commodore 128 Casting CPU design ABIT Coprocessor Turbofan PowerPC G4 Apple Intel transition GeForce 4 64-bit Cray-1 Motherboard Two-stroke cycle Timeline of computing 1990-forward Sempron Mac mini Hyper-threading Computer workstation Carburetor Novell NetWare Outsourcing Capacitor plague IBM POWER Mac OS X Quake III Arena Supercomputer Pentium II Apple Computer Sand casting Intel 80386 PowerBook Wintel Armored Core Clock rate CDC 6600 Atari ST Intel i860 Cell (microprocessor) Turbocharger Burroughs B5000 Radeon X Series INMOS Transputer NX bit Graphics processing unit Computer Sound Blaster Computer case Benchmark (computing) Windows XP Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Drill bit History of Microsoft Windows
