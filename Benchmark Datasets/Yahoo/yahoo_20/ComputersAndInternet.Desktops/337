should i get a mac or pc for highschool college i'm looking to buy a new computer for my highschool senior year and to use throughout college i haven't used a mac in years or so which is why i'm asking i've heard that macs are usually more user friendly towards students and don't really know too awful much about the new vista feel free to offer me the pros and cons of both operating systems i only want real answers not losers giving answers like mac sucks get a pc or the like thanks in advance it used to depend on what field you were going into when my friend was getting her phd in chemistry all the software she needed was only mac compatible so she had to get a mac i am a mac user but as a graphic designer who has worked on both platforms i find the mac offers a more stable environment but i digress i would suggest a mac is the best bet since you can use boot camp to install both mac and windows operating systems on it if you find the need to have windows only software with the usability of a mac you'll have an easier time accessing wireless networks at whatever your choice of colleges turns out to be as well as having a great suite of built in software in the ilife bundle to maintain photos videos music and even a personal web site if you choose bonus if you play music or want to mix music the garageband program is a great way to start hope this helps make the decision easier Apple Macintosh Mac OS X Apple Computer Linux IBM PC compatible ITunes Microsoft Windows Microsoft Office Windows Vista ILife Windows 2000 X Window System Computer virus History of the graphical user interface History of Microsoft Windows OpenOffice.org Operating system Java programming language Mac OS X v10.4 Amiga AmigaOS QuickTime HyperCard Timeline of computing 1990-forward Mouse (computing) Portable Document Format Mac OS Microsoft Windows 3.x Perl Windows Server 2003 Wi-Fi OpenBSD Commodore 64 Pretty Good Privacy File system IPod Opera (web browser) Visual Basic Common Unix Printing System System 7 (Macintosh) MSN Messenger Mac OS history Berkeley Software Distribution PlayStation Portable Mac mini IMac NeXT Floppy disk Unicode Education in Romania Atari ST Mach kernel Computer Windows API Computer and video games KDE Mozilla Firefox Web browser DOS Kernel (computer science) WordPerfect FreeBSD FileMaker Unix Booting Library (computer science) Software testing Xbox 360 Wintel AOL Instant Messenger TeX Spyware MS-DOS Ashton-Tate WebObjects Emacs Personal computer GNU General Public License OS/2 Internet Explorer GNU Computer software MAME Sun Microsystems Blue screen of death Atari 8-bit family DR-DOS GNOME Objective-C Bluetooth
