dual quadcore xeon system w o sli or single quadcore extreme w sli which would be better for gaming im going to buy a computer and im trying to decide which of these would be better since xeon server boards have the immense cpu support but lack sli support and the socket boards have sli but only one extreme processor i hope someone can help me with this the socket would be better since video cards have a far greater impact on performance than cpus so you would be much better off running in sli than having the cores now as the first person pointed out you are going overkill with either one of these setups cores is overkill at this point for gaming cores is just ridiculous the only time sli is really a good investment is if you are getting two top of the line cards which right now will run you in the area of which is not a great investment since in about months you could buy a single card that would outperform them but if you have money simply burning a whole in your pocket and you want to have both the cores and the dual video cards wait a few months and amd will have their new dual socket board out that will support two quad cores and multiple video cards Pentium 4 3dfx GeForce 6 Series Xeon Opteron AMD ATI Technologies NForce4 PC motherboard RISC Dual-core NVIDIA Microprocessor Personal computer Pentium D PowerPC Athlon Athlon 64 CPU design Symmetric multiprocessing Pentium M Athlon 64 X2 Apple Computer CPU cache 64-bit IBM PC compatible GeForce 7 Series Computer workstation Front side bus TurboGrafx 16 NX bit History of Microsoft Windows IA-64 CDC 6600 Radeon Computer Pentium Pro PlayStation 2 X86 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Mac OS X Pentium III MIPS architecture IBM PC Windows XP Socket 939 Overclocking VIA C3 Poker jargon Nintendo Entertainment System Thread (computer science) Computer multitasking Nintendo Revolution VIA Technologies Celeron Mac OS X v10.4 Timeline of computing 1990-forward AMD 5x86 IA-32 Laptop Wintel Power Mac G5 INMOS Transputer Computer bus Embedded system PC Engine Console wars Sound Blaster PlayStation 3 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Apple II family NeXT Amiga Apple Macintosh Original Amiga chipset BBC Micro IBM POWER Zilog Z80 UNIVAC Graphics processing unit Acorn Computers Microsoft Windows Pentium Sound card Apple IIGS Supercomputer Silicon Graphics
