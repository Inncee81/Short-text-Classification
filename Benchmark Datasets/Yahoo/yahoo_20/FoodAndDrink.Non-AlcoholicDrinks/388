are there really any health benefits to drinking diet soda it bugs me that people always insist on drinking diet soda all the time even if they don't need it when i say if you want to stay healthy just drink water diet soda is unhealthy they reply um duh diet soda is healthy why do you think it's called diet i know that water is a better beverage than diet soda but are there really any health benefits to drinking diet soda instead of regular or is diet soda just disgusting toxic waste filled with artificial stuff the only benefits are to your teeth unless you are diabetic or otherwise sensitive to sugar it is called diet because most people cut back on calories while they are dieting dieting is probably the worst thing someone can do to themself all they do is induce mild starvation which increases fat storage and reduces metabolism i e gain weight now harder to lose later if i were you i would cut out the soda and any unnatural looking juices they regular kind are essentially a liquid candy something that should be enjoyed on occasion not a staple and i could not have described diet soda any better than you did artificial sweeteners like sugar induce the glycemic response the body's reaction to an expected sugar rush in other words it causes sugar crashes and the increased storage of fat adequate exercise counteracts this as the net calories do not increase but combined with inactivity will cause weight gain in fact most artificial sweeteners have more serious health risks saccharin pink causes cancer in larger doses not proven in humans aspartame blue causes intense pain for those born with phenylketonuria very rare though i have met and breaks down into several poisons including formaldehyde sucralose yellow actually has more calories than sugar though the body cannot absorb it easily if an intestinal bacteria ever figures out how to convert it to sugar it will become the next aspartame then there are sugar alcohols for the most part they are natural extracts that do not have as many calories as sugar i doubt there are serious health risks but some are used as laxatives for a reason Milk Dieting Obesity Healthy eating Breastfeeding Diabetes mellitus Insulin Hypoglycemia Sugar Low-carbohydrate diet Saccharin Veganism Coffee Alcoholic beverage Tocopherol Hamster Dietary fiber Coca-Cola Folic acid Chronic fatigue syndrome Tea Poison Vegetarianism The Coca-Cola Company Food Vitamin C Anorexia nervosa 7 Up Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mountain Dew Cancer Fecal incontinence Tooth enamel Calorie restriction Crohn's disease Cocaine Diet Coke Word of Wisdom Biochemistry Raw food diet Foodborne illness Growth hormone treatment Paracetamol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Carbon dioxide Cheese Weight loss Glycemic index Mosquito Prostate cancer Ice cream Urolagnia Diarrhea Insulin resistance Colorectal cancer Alcohol fuel Addiction Alcohol consumption and health Swimming Xylitol Hyperglycemia Pneumonia Stomach cancer Vitamin Hypertension Polycystic ovary syndrome Alcohol Soy milk Junk food Glycogen storage disease type I Animal testing Glucokinase Clinical depression Vegetarian nutrition Dr Pepper Methamphetamine Enzyme Chlorpromazine Aloe Carnivorous plant Sucrose Glycerin Super Size Me
