why is it that when people say o'doul's still has a little alcohol in it they fail to realize that that the alcoholic content of o'doul's is generally around according to their website which is similar to the alcoholic content of orange juice a study recently performed by the university of indiana demonstrates that orange juice tends to have an alcoholic rating of to and even newly bought grape juice can have a rating as high as so why am i being carded for o'doul's amber but not being carded for orange juice or grape juice there is no rational reason for this to continue the phrase but there is still a little bit of alcohol in it is already addressed by the alcohol in orange juice it promotes underage drinking is the most idiotic thing i've ever heard if you want to drink for the sake of drinking you don't buy fake beer would somebody tell me why this idiocy is permitted to continue please actually john you can i recently wrote a letter to the board of alcoholic beverage control in utah one of the most alcohol strict states in the country about the o'doul's dilemma the presumably mormon representative who answered informed me that o'doul's is not an alcoholic beverage according to the law it is as alcoholic as orange juice or grape juice like you said and that is why legally a minor can purchase and consume drinks like o'douls the problem however is that your average grocery store clerk isn't actually aware of this they're trained to treat it like real beer because that's what managers think it is the problem is in store policies not legislation although some conservative counties and cities may have laws against minors purchasing and drinking o'douls they are rather the exception to the rule why you'd want to drink an o'douls is beyond me but if you really want to go for it just take a copy of the necessary legislation with you and be prepared to fight with a skeptical manager over it good luck Alcoholic beverage Prohibition Mothers Against Drunk Driving Word of Wisdom Legal drinking age Soft drink Pisco Microeconomics Rum Supermarket Digital rights management Binge drinking Systembolaget Motion picture rating system Alcoholism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cider Sake Coffee Drink Absinthe Alcoholics Anonymous Blood alcohol content Economics Champagne (beverage) Contract Gun politics Tobacco smoking Video game controversy Theory of conduct Gun politics in the United States ITunes Music Store Beer Pong Driver's license Kosher foods Food Stamp Program South African Breweries Breastfeeding Coca-Cola Medical prescription Scientology beliefs and practices Fanta Traumatic incident reduction Breakfast Coffeehouse Culture of France The Coca-Cola Company Convenience store Grog Drinking culture Health insurance Copy protection Milk Government of Maryland Cigarette President (game) Tax Public house Drunk driving (United States) Prohibition (drugs) Australian words Alcohol Same-sex marriage in the United States Internet fraud Veganism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses French cuisine Gin Distilled beverage Commodity markets Guinness Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.
