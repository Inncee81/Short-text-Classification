how to tame a hamster i have a new hamster and i want to tame it could you tell me what to do or any tips thanks wash your hands after holding food they can smell the food on you and will bite you if they think you smell like food do not wear any body spray or colougne when you pick i up or touch her she will not recognize the scent and it may confuse and scare her causing her to bite you if she does bite you go get some bitter apple spray petco or petsmart and put it on the area she bites you in if she is not biting you hard she is just realizing that you are not edible and it will go away if you don't have the bitter apple spray and she bites you tell her no in a deep voice with eye contact and put her back in the cage for a while don't pick her up at first stick your hand in the cage and let her sniff and crawl in it then try to scoop your hand under her belly and pick her up that way or use two hands to scoop her up if you grab her from above she may be startled also when you go to pick her up talk to her in a calm voice if all else fails pick her up with the scoop teqnique lie down on the floor and let her crawl on you for to minutes twice a day for two days it takes much patience and love to get them to trust you completely sometimes it is best to offer food and then while she's eating to pet her this shows her that you ill not hurt her and will train her to trust you Hamster Social rule Milton H.
