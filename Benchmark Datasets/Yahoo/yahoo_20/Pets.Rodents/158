i think my russian dwarf hamster has wet tail what can i do if it is can it be passed between cage mates one of the symptoms is that his tail and tummy area is moist and he also has a cage buddy is wet tail bad could he die from it he is also spitting out all his food from his pouches like whole seeds laying on the wheel and keeping his eyes closed while walking thank you every one for your info unfortunately we were too late with a vet appointment for today and my hamster passed away last night it was for sure wet tail i had to medicate animals at petsmart and wet tail was a common thing that we had to treat my advice is that you go to a pet store and try to find something called dritail it's going to give some antibiotics to him you want to find something with probiotics as well probiotics are normally given after administering the antibiotic this is because your animal is loosing the good bacteria in his intestines as a result of the wet tail and the antibiotic if the hamster has no good bacteria in his belly then the wet tail will just keep on and it could kill him you want to separate the two hamsters when you are medicating them its ok to have a small cage so like a travel cage will be ok to keep the sick guy in but just don't keep him in there that won t be good wet tail is normally caused by stress they get so stressed out it makes them sick and the result is the nasty diarrhea or wet tail therefore you might want to start limiting the amount of startling things that he is suffering from anything from a tv to clapping or loud voices can set them off in the beginning it is better to have them in a quieter area the reason for separating is for good measure and to keep track of him it's a quarantine tank if you are medicating an animal and not the other one it is easier to administer the medication when he is alone that way the healthy one doesn't get any unecesary medication once he gets better you can move him back to the other tank you want to give him lots of water he is loosing a lot of water because of the wet tail you want to make sure that he doesn't get dehydrated another thing to try is to give him oats in his food the oats help suck up the extra moisture that shouldn't be there another thing is that you don't want to change their diet suddenly if you just got them from a store then they were most likely on something called block diet if you are just feeding seed after just getting your animals that could cause wet tail too i highly suggest slowly changing them back to the block diet if they are eating seed block is more nutritional and it provides something to chew on but don't go changing up your little hamster s diet now that he has wet tail that would be a bad idea i'll give you some links to the products i recommend be sure to follow the directions of the medication thoroughly this first link is for a product called oasis wet tail plus it comes in tablet form and it has probiotics if you can get your pet to drink water then this one works well however don't try to administer this medication in a water bottle it would be better to place a small dish in his area http www petsmart com global product detail jsp product c eprd id folder c efolder id assortment c east id content c ecnt id bmuid itemno in small pet n ne this second link is to the product i mentioned above it is a liquid that comes with a dropper it could be necesary to do the liquid because your animal is refusing to drink which can happen if this is the case use a dropper to administer water but if they are at this point it probably wouldn't hurt to find a vet and sometimes animals will refuse to drink the water because they can taste the medicine in it for whatever reason this is your other choice http www petsmart com

other day or as needed and make sure to clean out the healthy guys cage to remove any nastiness and to ensure he stays healthy as i said wet tail more commonly happens when the animal is under stress or has had a change in diet this is the most common reason when the animal becomes stressed it loses some of its good bacteria which causes the other normal microbiota normally found in the intestines to over grow this results in an infection your animal has a whole bunch of bacteria in his intestines but when wet tail occurs it flushes out some of that good bacteria which lowers some of the other bacteria's competition so it makes it easier for the other bacteria to grow this results in an overgrowth the antibacterial will knock down those extra bacteria in the intestines so that the other bacteria have a chance to build back up which is where the probiotic comes into play the antibacterial has lowered the number of bacteria that was causing him to be sick the probiotic will help add that bacteria that should be there i hope that clears up why it happens i had to take a microbiology class in college Fancy rat Nutrition Stomach cancer Common cold Chicken Crohn's disease Acne Dairy
