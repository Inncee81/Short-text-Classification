how do i tell a fancy mouse from other varieties how can i tell the difference between other varieties and the fancy mice what are the fancy mice there are various mouse species one of which is mus musculus there are various m musculus varieties types each named after their particular coat type or colour or marking to describe one single mouse you need several variety names e g a black and white patched mouse with sort of curly fur would be called a black and white although i believe the white is usually left out broken marked rex some m musculus are wild a k a house mice others are referred to as lab mice or pet mice or feeder mice they're all the same mouse species fancy mice is a confusing term which is used for different groups of mice by different people fancy mice can have any coat colour marking whatsoever for me it's just a term used by petstores to differentiate between mice they've raised to be sold as pets and those they've raised to be sold as feeders both are the same species you just hope they've actually spent some time handling the fancy ones which unfortunately isn't true for every petstore despite the fancy name they give these mice for others however fancy mice is the term used for mice who are bred specifically to be the best example of their variety combination they are often a lot bigger bodied and bigger eared than other mice these are the mice that are taken to shows and judged and win prizes etc as such these mice are sometimes also referred to as show mice which i think is a better clearer term see for example the pic halfway down this article http www fancymice info whymice htm the reason i think show mice is a better term is because if i tell people that i have fancy mice some will think i have very large mice with excellent markings etc but i don't my mice are only fancy mice in the way of not being feeders i e they're pets they're not show mice i hope that answers your question greetz cyzahhe House Mouse Mouse Fancy rat Cat Labrador Retriever Domestic rabbit Hamster Horse Species Coat (dog) Cheetah Dog Color Blue Whale Monster Rancher monsters Rat Mouse (computing) Brown Rat Taboo food and drink Gene Shetland Sheepdog Ferret Red Fox Gray Wolf Border Collie Black panther Knockout mouse Stoat Human Tortoiseshell cat Cat coat genetics Livestock Tasmanian Devil Domestication Leopard Patent Havanese EastEnders The Secret of NIMH Discus (fish) Pottery Heraldry Dobermann Cultivar Chess opening Pet store Alaskan husky John Steinbeck Island Fox Tiger English plural Great Dane Shen Gong Wu Diamond Griffon Bruxellois Keeshond Senescence Trademark Mink Microsoft Model organism Panthera hybrid Fault (dog) Casting Hiberno-English Live 8 Computer Software testing Chinese language Domestic goat Trapping Diablo II Siberian Husky Elephant European Rabbit Neopets The Joker's Wild Patricia Ford Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Dog show Poodle Tarantula Quotation mark Pet skunk City of Heroes Black (people) Mickey Mouse IMac Common bean AmigaOS Pet Shop Boys Universal Serial Bus MapleStory B-side
