im getting a rat and i need some hints how do you hold a rat what do u feed it i go on to lots of rat websites and some of them say that they dont like fruit some are saying they can have human food and i need some help please before anything else please please please do not get a lone rat to get a lone rat is cruelty at the start rats are sociable animals that live in large groups to get a lone rat would be like you living your whole life in solitary confinement amongst aliens with no one to snuggle or cuddle or understand you for your rats' happiness and a longer life get a same sex pair at minimum where to get your rat a breeder is preferable you wil get a well bred fed socialised ratling but will probably have to go onto a waiting list but failing that presuming your in uk there are many ratlings for rehoming here http www fancy rats co uk community viewforum php f and transport can often be arranged to get them to you us based http www goosemoose com component option com smf itemid forum rat board you can get a petshoppie and they are just as deserving of a home as any other rat but do so in the knowledge that petshop rats come from mass breeders who care very little for the welfare of their stock they view them as a commodity much like a clothes shop views cheap t shirts and all rats bred by them not deemed pretty enough for the pet trade go to the reptile trade for food pet shop rats are less socialised so more scared smaller and more prone to illness than breeder rats having said that my two longest lived nearly both came from petshops my last choice for a new to rats owner would be a rescueshelter however this is only because the rats there have often got healthproblems old socialisation probs and can be too much for anyone without experience how to pick up a rat if its small then scoop the whole rat into your cupped hands as it gets bigger put your hand over the shoulders and fingers under armpits lift slightly and put other hand under bum to cradle him when you have picked him her up then cradle them next to your body or pop on shoulder lap and let wander expect squirming expect to have your fingers hands explored once your rat is used to and confident with you he she will happily run onto your hand to come out handle them every day as much freetime as possible mine have an hour morning spot clean time and after pm the door is left open and they come and go til my bedtime but remember rat proof your room first they will chew everything as is their nature and if they can get their head though a gap their body will follow diet well the first thing to remember are that rats are omnivores and can eat pretty much what we do and like us they do get bored with food so although rat nuggets or lab blocks are a complete food full of everything the need its would be like us eating rice crackers everyday pretty boring this is a good site http www fancy rats co uk home go here for diet http www fancy rats co uk community viewforum php f there is a list of good fruit veg and cereal here too or http www ratsrule com diet html if us based huge thing to always remember though is no citrus or mangoes for boys and that a rats food should be dried mix and fresh food daily and that whatever your eating they can have a little off as long as no salt is added for example i cooked spag bog last night and they had their own portion of that as i cook all meals no salt young rats need loads of daily protein for good growth bananas avocadoes boiled scramble egg porridge made with soy milk never ever use dairy chicken wings and thighs with bones tuna in fresh water sardines pilchards mackeral in fresh water or tom sauce top tip feed fish the night before big clean day tinned beans chickpeas a good indicator of good growth and food is the tail is it nice and plump and round near the body or does it have a squareness to it that indicates lack of protein start to cut back the daily protein from about months until you are only
