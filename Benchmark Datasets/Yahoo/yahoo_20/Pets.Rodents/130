is it true rats die an agonising death how long do they live and how do they die am asking about pet rats here not wild ones i love rats i've never kept them myself but my aunt has always had them and i'd like one of my own but hers died in rather bloody wways and i wanted find out first so i was prepared if i did have one or two even well i had three rats i will explain their death and you can decide whether or not you think that it's agonizing winifred was the first to go even though i took great care of my rats and fed them twice a day she was very very skinny this happened suddenly she would sit in the corner and make huffing sneezing noises like she had an upper respitory infection a few days later i found her dead between one wall of the cage and one wall of their plastic house sguiggle died second he was acting completely normal but one day my mom went in there and found him dead in the shavings with blood in the cage walls near the cage soaked in the shavings and on him he had hemmoraged or had internal bleeding that caused him to explode for lack of a better word bertha died last which is kind of suprising because she was the oldest and the mother of the other two bertha's eye started to pop out farther than her other eye it got worse and worse and eventually i could see part of a brown lumpy growth pertruding from her eye i figured she had cancer pressing on the inside of her eye causing it to come out soon she developed tumors on her sides and stomach it got worse and worse and she got skinny and sick because all the blood was going to the tumors she wasn't properly nourished we took her to the vet and it was definetly cancer mammory cancer i already knew it was cancer that was taking her life because before i got rats i purchased a book about their care and it mentioned that a very common disease in rats is cancer the vet said that if we hadn't decided to put her to sleep which we decided that she would eventually explode this is because she was getting so big from the tumors and they were holding so much blood personally i think this is agonizing to some extent animals die many ways but i thought i'd tell my story Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Fancy rat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Colorectal cancer Hamster Metastasis Lung cancer Ferret EastEnders Skinny Puppy Sin City Blood (computer game) Malignant melanoma Animal testing Kodocha Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Garfield Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Happy Tree Friends Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pitaten Stroke The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Star Wars Holiday Special YuYu Hakusho Characters in the Smurfs Rat Androgen insensitivity syndrome First aid The Marshall Mathers LP Bleeding Rat Park Breast cancer Vitamin C Lauren Bacall Tocopherol Aspartame Bubonic plague Rabies Black Death Paul Is Dead Mesothelioma The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Chemotherapy Cat Apoptosis Traumatic brain injury Cervical cancer Tasmanian Devil Tuberculosis Equine conformation Night (book) Cephalic disorder Piccolo Junior Saga Urinary incontinence The Subtle Knife Radiation therapy Common cold Raw food diet Blood Professional wrestling match types Time Out of Mind Ovarian cancer Sperm Whale Fever Endometriosis Prolactinoma House of M Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Esophageal cancer Dog Shark Obstetrics Radiation poisoning Kaposi's sarcoma Pneumonia Vampire Hypoglycemia RuneScape quests Oncology Babe Ruth Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Brain tumor Cancer of the larynx Daredevil The League of Gentlemen (comedy) 613 mitzvot
