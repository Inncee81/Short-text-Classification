question about my rat hi we just got a rat last month and i noticed her nails were getting alittle long what should i use to trim them you can get small animal trimmers from the pet store for about dollars i used to use small finger nail clippers as well when i couldn't find the pet ones lol they work just as well however sometimes these pinch the nail before cutting and you have to be extra careful make sure you wrap him her up in a towel and have some styptic powder or baking soda near by just in case you make them bleed just clip the very tip if the nail is white you will be able to see the quick where the blood is also you can put down sand paper near the water bottle this way when they go to get some water they natually help to wear down the nails get the plain kind not the kind with the sticky glue bottom good luck Manicure Hamster Bread Upholstery Knife Lawn mower Nine Inch Nails Bong Professional wrestling match types Cocaine Cat Horseshoe Violin Ferret Alum Naruto jutsu Fancy rat Drill bit Salad Fingers Characters of Naruto Stoat Pedicure Chocolate Callus Plastic Barbed wire Ice cream Puff pastry Textile manufacturing Piccolo Junior Saga Rat Basic English Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pet skunk Dumpling Internal ballistics Collecting fossils Floppy disk Shaving Autopsy Seismic retrofit Harp Flax Mattress Kim Possible Anal sex Shroud of Turin Chicken Pancake First aid Poodle Wound Japanese tea ceremony Chinchilla Pet store Clinker (boat building) Domestic rabbit Tattoo 1957 World Series Equine conformation Menstrual cycle Glossary of firefighting equipment String trimmer Handloading Necktie Tack Shark Domesticated turkey Manhunt (video game) Sushi Niddah Howard Hughes Customs and etiquette of Japan Happy Tree Friends Guinea pig Glass The Dalek Invasion of Earth Guitar English longbow Bleeding Cyanoacrylate Stairway Tooth Shock 1986 World Series Blood (computer game) Reed (music) Carbonated water Carbon dioxide Pencil Dairy Nail disease Vending machine Brewery Tenshinhan Skunk
