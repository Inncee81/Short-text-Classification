i just asked a question every said the babie hamster are play fighting no they are not they are actually biting each other and squeeling one guy said not to touch them well they are nearly weeks and i have and they are fine also he said dont seperate them until they are weeks so i will have inbreeding what a load of crap so my question was they are fight biting each other and screaming noises are being made they are weeks and days do i seperate them but they cant drink water yet but they are hurting each other hey i will help you i had the same problem has you when the babies got to weeks old they started to fight each other so i had to separate them into different tanks males in one females in the other its there solitary nature developing which enables them to fight over territory when they get bigger by days the hamsters should have started to take from a drip feeder that was put lower enough for them to reach when they were being weaned off the mothers milk but i don't think it makes a difference really because they will learn eventually and the baby hamsters are older enough to be put in to single sex groups now they should be put in here until they are to weeks old and then they can go to there new homes good luck hope it helps Hamster Breastfeeding Craps Ron and Fez Platypus The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Iggy Pop Beatles for Sale Atomic Kitten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jennifer Lopez Spice Girls Whitney Houston Roxette Elephant Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Red Squirrel Good Morning, Vietnam Tom Jones (singer) Rod Stewart Golden Hamster 1957 World Series Sexual reproduction OutKast Koala The Beach Boys Frankie Laine Billboard Hot 100 Joke What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
