how big do pet rats grow i just bought two beautiful boy rex rats i think they are about weeks just wondering how big they will actually grow oh and any negative comments please don't bother i don't care for negativity thx lol not sewer rats pet rats you know the nice ones it really depends on where you keep them and other environmental factors as someone else mentioned boys do grow quite a bit bigger than the females if you keep your rats in a small or medium cage and they do not get much time out then they will stay quite small but if you have a large cage and give them the amount of exercise and outside time that they need then they will be more healthy and will grow larger just like when you have a goldfish in a small tank it will stay relatively the same size but if you then move the same fish into a huge tank you will notice a lot of growth they adapt to the space that they are given basically my girls spend a lot of time in the bathroom and get a digging box bedding food and water in there with them they love this time when they can run around and play i will usually go in and sit and read while they play or watch them run around and laugh at them p you should be giving them at least an hour of exercise time each day and congratulations on your new owners d Hamster Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Goldfish Sea-Monkey Sewage treatment Fish farming Electrophysiology Sin City Brewery Ferret The Shining (film) Ron and Fez Chinchilla Cliff Richard Discus (fish) Billboard Hot 100 Sleep Pet store The Catcher in the Rye Urinary incontinence Social rule Urban sprawl Theory of conduct Autonomous building Capital accumulation Rat Cat The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dairy Pet skunk Brown Rat Avenue Q Paul Is Dead Tyrannosaurus rex Shaggy dog story Equine conformation The Ashlee Simpson Show The Brady Bunch Sears Holdings Corporation Coconut crab Pok__mon Live!
