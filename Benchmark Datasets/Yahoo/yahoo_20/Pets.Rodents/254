mouse is losing her hair help my little mouse in going completely bald and she has scabs near her ears she is getting old approx years but i don't want her to suffer i have no idea what is wrong with her any advice would wonderful she is probably nearing the end of her life because this is what happened to some of my mice before they died if you want you can take her into a vet to have her treated or just let her quietly live out the rest of her life just because she has lost fur does not mean neccessarily that she is suffering or in pain but if you are really concerned then see a vet sometimes loss of hair in great quantities indicates a tumor in the mouse before my mouse died she lost a little bit of fur and also stopped moving around so much she partially buried herself in the bedding and just in general stayed away from the other mice if your mouse is doing this she is also probably nearing the end of her life Guinea pig Fancy rat Stem cell Baldness Animal rights Ferret Prostate cancer Stomach cancer House Mouse Radiation therapy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cat The Secret of NIMH Baldness treatments Aspartame Flea Repetitive strain injury Three Stooges Hair Fantasia (film) Vomiting Wound healing phases Tuberculosis James Herriot Radiation poisoning Bat The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Domestic rabbit Avenue Q Mickey Mouse Club Tasmanian Devil Theory of conduct Pet skunk Zhao Yun Monoclonal antibody Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Charles Darwin's illness Shaggy dog story Special relativity Taboo food and drink Cancer Traumatic brain injury Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Shadow the Hedgehog Garfield Vladimir Peter Tytla 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kender Wolfrider The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases W.I.T.C.H.
