a way of approaching a new guinea pig i adopted two guinea pigs today and i was wondering some good approaches for the new pigs one is very calm and the other is pretty hyper and scared i'm also guessing it's normal for them to hide in their tubes and pigloo's right yes guinea pigs are prey animals by nature in the wild they stay still for up to minutes and hide amongst the long grass when predators are near by but also if they are feeling scared what your guinea pigs are doing is something to the same sort of effect hiding in their tubes and pigloos because they are scared and afraid of predators as they are new they are also getting used to their surroundings the new sounds smells and people this would be making them very skittish the best thing to treat this is time and a whole lot of patience aproach the cage slowly and quitely but at the same time let the guinea pigs know that you are there by talking in a soft voice each movement must be taken slowly as quick movements will scare them and most importantly bring a vegetable parsley romaine lettuce treat each time you go to the cage leave them alone for at least hours i know how hard it is you can see them during this period just do not pick them up after this period you can have your first cuddle start with minutes per piggy and work your way up from there you should also start floor time after this period to start with choose a small room and make it piggy safe after doing floor time in a small room for about week give or take try using a bigger room good luck Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Chinchilla Cat Fancy rat Pig Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Unreal Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Professional wrestling match types John Cage Social rule The Time Machine Coprophagia Coconut crab Blood on the Tracks The League of Gentlemen (comedy) USS Tunny (SS-282) Animal rights The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Tyrannosaurus rex Swingout Blonde on Blonde Milton H.
