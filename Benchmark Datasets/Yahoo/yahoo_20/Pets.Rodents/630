suddenly evil rat i've had my rat for about a month and never has she bitten sure she'd rather run around than be with me but she still has never harmed anyone however just yesterday i tried to pick her up she was not sleeping just sitting on a wooden block in her cage and she bit my finger i thought maybe i just surprised her so i gently placed my finger on her back and she bit me again i didn't want to be hurt anymore so i stopped later that day my brother's girlfriend tried to pick her up and it bit her for the first time as well what's happened any help would be appreciated and she is the only rat in the cage but i usually take her out to play like hours a day also i fed her a peanut today and she was nipping at my finger and also bit the peanut oh and a peanut a day is not her regular diet btw she always has a full food dish xd hmm i must admit it's strange just to be safe i'd wash your hands before handling her to get rid of any food smells how often have you been handling her if she'd rather stay in her cage than be with you then maybe she's just a naturally aggressive rat or you haven't handled her enough edit never mind hours a day should be enough to make her friendly towards people it's also possible that she's sick so look for any signs of listlessness or pain if she were male then neutering him would fix the problem male rats can grow bitey when they hit a certain age unless neutered but i'm pretty sure you're able to tell her gender for certain Cat Ferret Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Milton H.
