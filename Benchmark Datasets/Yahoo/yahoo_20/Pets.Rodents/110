am i ready for a ferret i have toys lots water bottle feeders plus food hammock cage collar leash harness carriors litter plus litter box bedding shampoo nail clippers ear cleaning care treats am i all set let me first of all say i love ferrets it sounds like you have everything you need to take care of a ferret now lets see if you have enough knowledge to make an informed decision about getting one are you ready to raise a toddler when i say that i mean ferrets are literally like toddler children they are very cute and very curious they need close supervision when they are not in their cage otherwise like a toddler they can get themselves into trouble and they do need lots of attention and exercise outside of their cage they are very social animals and enjoy lots of interaction with their owners they will always have a slightly musky scent to them but if taken care of properly they should never stink they are a lot like cats and pretty much clean themselves you may have to bathe them two or three times a year at most washing them more frequently than that can actually make that musky scent stronger they are more expensive to take care of than say cats or dogs they need good ferret food which even at walmart can cost for a small box that will last about a week and i use a paper bedding that walmart also carries for a small bag i have a large cage and it takes two bags to fill the bottom i take meticulous care of the cage and completely change the bedding once a week so on average i spent about a week ferrets have a very short digestive system so they poop every two hours so get ready to scoop a lot of poop on the brighter side of the pooping ferrets' poop has very little odor but if you leave it in the cage for days it will start to smell i did a lot of research before i bought my ferret so i could make an informed decision i made the decision to buy mine when he was just weeks old and i've never regretted getting him even once ferrets are a hoot they have such cute personalities and they can be so much fun just one more thing they tend to be little thieves they like to take things from around the house and hide them shoes keys wallets etc pretty much anything laying out so put up what you don't want to search for later lol if you decide to get a ferret i believe you will really enjoy one just be the best ferret owner around because they deserve only the best have a lot of fun Ferret Fancy rat Pet skunk Guinea pig Japanese tea ceremony Dog Social rule Domestic rabbit Dog training Cat Sento Customs and etiquette of Japan Garfield Professional wrestling match types House Mouse Poker jargon Glossary of nautical terms Emergency preparedness Characters in the Smurfs Chinchilla The Apprentice 2 Trapping Kakapo Happy Tree Friends Pitaten Sea-Monkey RuneScape quests Milton H.
