introducing a new rat i adopted two rats from a pet store in april and they seemed relatively healthy the white one however was sneezing and i suspected it had mycoplasma on thursday she seemed a bit lethargic but still active when i checked on her on saturday i was out of town for one day she was dead the brown rat still seemed somewhat active but depressed she has also been sneezing my question is i know it's bad to introduce a new rat if the brown one also has mycoplasma but she seems so sad without her friend and it breaks my heart to see her like that what should i do should i just spend more time with her thanks virtually all domestic rats have the mycoplasma organism in their system our vet says it's relatively unusual for a pet rat not to have least one flare up during his or her lifetime the quarentine period is to make sure that your rats don't have other diseases that they could give each other you might want to bring your girl to the vet to make sure that there aren't any other health problems possibly to start her on medication since her sneezing could indicate a flare up sorry for your loss your other girl most likely is depressed that her friend is gone i've seen this in our own rats it would help if you can give her extra attention it would be wonderful if she could have a new rat friend too just be sure to quarentine the new girl for a few weeks introduce them carefully on neutral ground also be patient it took our hairless about weeks to accept our hooded girl but now they're wonderful friends Fancy rat Mycoplasma Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Sin City Guinea pig Rabies Ferret Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pneumonia Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Pet skunk Rat Tuberculosis Clinical depression Sneeze Folic acid Urinary incontinence The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Traumatic brain injury Health insurance Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Common cold Kim Possible Prostate cancer Dead Like Me Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Quarantine Domestic rabbit Blood (computer game) Hypoglycemia AIDS Sleep Tocopherol Billboard Hot 100 Aspartame Brown Rat Bipolar disorder Dog Kender The Suffering (game) Dieting Group A streptococcal infection Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Medicine Jam (TV series) Death Anorexia nervosa Characters in the Smurfs Vigabatrin Disease Drug addiction Philadelphia Eagles House Mouse Frank Sinatra The Beach Boys Kurt Cobain Cat National Football League Rat (zodiac) Cytomegalovirus Hearing impairment Gregorian calendar George W.
