how long till a rat recognizes her name will she turn around to look at me once she does i've always had cats so i'm not too sure how this whole pets responding to their names thing works i've had olive for about a week now she's months old i spend around ten hours a day with her because she's been riding around on my shoulder how will she react when called how long should it take first rat the problem with having a second is that i won't play with either of them i had two cats for a while and wouldn't play with either because the other would stare at me longingly the other problem with getting two is that at least one would be spending at least hours a day by herself while i take the other around rats are very smart if you want to speed it up call her name and reward her when she responds yogurt treats work well my rat has a shoebox home when i call her she runs out and sits on top best thing you can do is repitition mixed in with treats if you want her to come when she is called if her ears perk up when her name is called it means she is starting to make the connection most rats will turn to face the direction of their name Fancy rat Guinea pig Dog training Cat Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Friends Shaggy dog story Ben Johnson (athlete) Social rule Maka dai dai shogi House Mouse Hamster The Pet Sounds Sessions Dairy Perk__nas Yoghurt Ferret Horse Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pet Sounds Dilbert Minor Discworld characters Taikyoku shogi Chinese calendar Behaviorism Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Hikikomori Kim Possible Meaning Aladdin (1992 film) Blonde on Blonde Flea Andr__s Galarraga Garfield Dog Phoebe Buffay's songs Feral cat Hearing impairment Leon White Professional wrestling throws The Contender (television series) Chinese astrology Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Tai shogi 1957 World Series Time Out of Mind Tour de France Rat (zodiac) Mike Alfonso Softball Egyptian Ratscrew Professional wrestling attacks Saturday Night Live commercial Volleyball Jade Emperor Anatoly Karpov Ron Weasley IBM PC compatible Live Aid Green Day 24 Hours of Le Mans Care Bears Long-term potentiation InuYasha (character) Diazepam Gregorian calendar Rayleigh scattering The Apprentice 3 Goodness and value theory Obedience training Eddie Guerrero Pet skunk Seabird Tokyo Mew Mew Triage Lostprophets Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling slang Baseball Indianapolis 500 Sin City Powerbomb Felis sapiens Pet Splinter (TMNT) Till Lindemann Eye XML Salah 2004 World Series Carolina Panthers Vehicular cycling Denis Law Houston Astros Paintball Medical prescription Swingout Baldrick Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
