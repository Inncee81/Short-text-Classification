why do ppl feel ashamed embarassed when someone witnesses them having sex or going to the bathroom these two acts are completely natural history reveals that this puritanical approch has not always been embraced by many cultures and i'm sure there are societies today that feel the same way it seems to me this kind of ethos facillitates governments that are quick to enact regulations that inhibit limit citizen's rights approach the reason these are private issues is because this is the way we are raised some societies recognize these acts as natural and don't view them as something that has to be done in private although they may have a choice let alone passing laws against them in public our society might see sex in public as exhibitionism whereas other cultures don't even know what that is they would say what's wrong w that i'm not suggesting anything that would pose a health hazzard these acts are natural as in nature what other ways of nature involve embarassment or shame when witnessed if an et were to land on earth and was being educated about the ways of mankind he would not understand this chichi maybe you're ashamed of your genitals i am certainly not ashamed of mine i may be slightly disappointed in dimension because i know what potential the jumbo size has to offer but i was never taught to be ashamed of them jen i don't see how i answered my ques my ques deals w the unnatural stigma attached to bodily functions i have alluded to the puritans as the source and quite frankly disagree w this mindset that they have so successfully managed to brainwash into their generation and have it proliferate as it permeated ea subsequent generation i also feel despite many good qualities that this religion stood stands for they are extremist and have helped facillitate a government that is fast to initiate more legislature which in turn makes that government unnecessarily larger and more powerful over the citizens the republican debacle that so thoroughly embarassed our country in the eyes of most of the world by putting our president clinton on the stand was a direct result of puritanical influence why do you think the puritans were so badly persecuted in europe that they felt forced to immigrate to the new world no where have i stated that i want to view these acts i don't have to look in fact the only reason ppl feel compelled to look is the infrequency to which this possibility occurs hopey how often does vulnerability compel any creature to seek a more private location to do their business you are right i remember being in mixed washrooms in europe and nobody thought anything of it and in china your bathroom activities are quite public it is about the way we are raised but these are deeply ingrained ways and very difficult for most people to overcome i've never really had a problem if someone caught me in the middle of a sex act i'm not an exhibitionist but hey it's natural Separation of church and state Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Same-sex marriage Human sexual behavior Marriage Plame affair Infantilism Ethics Democracy Property (ownership right) Liberalism Coercion Simone Weil Theory of conduct Same-sex marriage in Canada Freedom of speech Status of religious freedom in France Homophobia Republic Alexander Technique Politics of the United States Objectivist philosophy A Course In Miracles Transsexuality Economy of the United States Theodicy Moral Politics Appeal Subud John Howard Yoder Constitution of Ireland United States Constitution Determinism Fundamentalism Homosexuality and Christianity Franz Boas Corporation Anarcho-capitalism Religious conversion American exceptionalism Civil rights Privacy Capital punishment Falun Gong Confucianism Criticism of libertarianism Sexual abstinence Capitalism Hikikomori Non-aggression principle Puritan Intelligent design Gay rights Christianity Child pornography Originalism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Baptist Abington School District v.
