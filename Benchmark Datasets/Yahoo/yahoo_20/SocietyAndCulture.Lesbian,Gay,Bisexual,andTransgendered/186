is is ever going to be normal to be gay because there are a lot more people coming out know and it is an issue that is coming more out into the open i was looking at some polls and it was showing that people in the weren't very accepting at all of homosexuality but a the age decreased the more accepting people were of it i think in the age group it was something like were accepting of it is it just going to become more and more acceptable until it is completely normal in our society i understand that not everyone would be because there are still people who are against rights for african americans and women i think it will eventually become accepted by the majority we're still a few decades from that happening but people are being exposed to homosexuality more and more and as a result are becoming educated about it and they're realizing that the only difference between gays and straights is the gender in which they fall in love with prior to ellen coming out in what was it ' discussing homosexuality on tv wasn't done all that much and for a well known person to come out was a huge risk to their career as ellen learned for herself when her show was shortly after canceled in just short years look how far we've come not only is homosexuality less of a taboo subject so that people are no longer afraid to talk about it but states and major businesses are recognizing the need for same sex couples to have the same security and benefits as heterosexual couples enjoy one state has even legalized marriage years ago that probably would've been way beyond what anyone would expect to happen so soon despite the right wing and neo christian groups trying to hold us back and keep us second class citizens they seem to be on the losing side and i think that basic human rights will win out eventually but it's going to take time Same-sex marriage Human sexual behavior Marriage Sexual orientation Gay rights Homosexuality Same-sex marriage in Canada Homophobia Religion and sexuality Homosexuality and Christianity Age of consent Bisexuality Gay Lesbian Gender role Same-sex marriage in the United States Heterosexuality Religion and sexual orientation Lawrence v.
