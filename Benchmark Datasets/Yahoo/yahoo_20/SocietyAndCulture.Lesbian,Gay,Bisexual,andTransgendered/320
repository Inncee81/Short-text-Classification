am i wrong or is he right im bi and my bf and i have been together for yrs i was hanging out with my friend today since we both had off work she is lez by the way so i told my bf my plans since he had to work and couldnt join us after we hung out and he was out of work he called me really mad because we hung out in his mind its not right for me to hang out with a lez unless were in a group bc i'm bi we are just friends and nothing more nothing happened or will ever happen between us i have never cheated on my bf and always tell him who i am hanging out with before hand am i wrong to hang out with a lez bc i am bi he sees it the same way as him hanging out with a girl hes straight i just dont see it the same way actually you are both right and both wrong here's why first if its ok for you to be friends and hang out with another girl then it should be ok for him to hang out with another girl as long as they are just friends no way if either one is interested in each other but just friends is ok question is how would you feel if he hung out with a girl who was a friend would it bother you or would you be ok with it does he have all of your trust in that situation or would you be suspicious if you put yourself in his place and ask yourself how you would feel if the situation were reversed somewhat then you can maybe understand how he feels if you are ok with him hanging out with a female friend who is a friend only then you'll need to tell him this before he can understand that you give him the same freedom you take for yourself i can understand how you feel you have your friend and you know you're innocent but your boyfriend is treating you like you're guilty or that you might be guilty someday i hate to take his side in this kind of thing but it really is only fair if he can do the same things as you do he might be straight but you're not and that means that your lesbian friend could be a rival at least in his eyes the question is are you willing to give him the same rights as you have or can you resist hanging out with your friend unless in a group i know these choices suck don't they still i think it has to be fair both ways or it can't exist at all besides that you've probably heard many rumors already where the ignorant claim that all bisexual people cheat that they think they deserve one person from each gender i know they're not true but your boyfriend probably has and probably doesn't like the idea of having to share your affections for whatever reason he has he's worried about losing you that part is good because it shows you have value to him but it will make things rough as you two come to an agreement i know the female friend idea isn't great but somehow you both have to come to a compromise and figure out if you each trust each other or not if the trust or lack thereof is the problem then work on that first before you move on to this question good luck Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Sexual orientation Theodicy God Emperor of Dune Little Britain Avenue Q EastEnders Ex-gay Philosophical skepticism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Capital punishment Polyamory Jon Secada Gender role Something Positive Plame affair Milton H.
