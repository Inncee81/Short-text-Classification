dangerous foreplay my year old lover terri and i have been a couple for a year we met while playing football with a group of lads he was on one team i was on the other his team won he told me in confidence that his uncle sexually abused him as a child and make him do things that no human should make another human do terri wants me to beat and bite him during sex foreplay as far as i know i am the only person he has told this to what can i do to help him from this nightmare and can i take the law into my own hands by hunting down his uncle i have never met terri's family yet terri is one very messed up person he used to drink all the time and take drugs from the early age of and used to 'work on the streets' until he was i really do want to help him but this is way over my head and to be honest i am kinda afraid of being with him but will it be wrong to break up with him should i have him a chance under no circumstances should you take the law into your own hands his uncle is a pig but you going after him would probably land you in some trouble as for terri what he needs is therapy if he feels comfortable with you maybe you could recomend that you go jointly but ultimately he will ahve to go alone to get the really personal stuff off of his chest and as for the question about leaving him do you love him if you love him and care enough about him try sticking with him to ensure he gets the propper attention he needs if you are not quite at the stage of love it is a difficult choice and you'll have to pick which will ultimately bring you more happiness i am assuming that since you have been together for a year that you do love him so my personal advice is to stick it out try to get him to go to therapy and just be there for him Sin City One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Laura Schlessinger EastEnders Human sexual behavior Social rule Rape Transsexuality Pitaten Polyamory Abortion debate The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Norway national football team Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Pedophilia Alcoholics Anonymous Dead Like Me Oasis (band) Boston Public Poker jargon Ethics Hey Jude Sex and the City Ultimate Spider-Man Neighbours Brian Close Ex-gay Shaggy dog story 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Human Stain Serial killer Zoophilia Milton H.
