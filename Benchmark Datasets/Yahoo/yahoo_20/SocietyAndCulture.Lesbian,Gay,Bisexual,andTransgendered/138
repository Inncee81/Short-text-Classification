advice please my wife hates her job not because of what she does but because of her hours she works pm to am days on days off days on days off and the hours are really starting to get to her so i told her like any good wife would to start job hunting so she has and has two job prospects one with my old employer for significantly less money than she is making now but it's something she wants to do in the healthcare industry the other is with a major corporation doing a job similar to what she does now but with better hours the money would be comparable to what she makes and the benefits are phenomenal i am a paper chaser so i say go where the money is good you can go to school to get the education you want for the healthcare in the field you want and we won't have to take a break in pay i know job happiness is important however this would put a significant difference in our income and we are trying to move and have a baby i don't want to be selfish gareth ignore the thumbs down ron we have a civil union so all companies in our state are supposed to offer benefits to us but as we can see in nj that's not always true but as far as i know they do also the second job opportuntity which offers comparable money also has better hours so i'm not asking her to keep working those hours that's not to you specifically ron that's just an fyi oh and i almost forgot smooches to you chef xxxxxoooxx i don't think you're being selfish rather your being realistic and pragmatic whilst job satisfaction is a key factor in choosing a new job it is important to think about the financial situation none of us would ever say that the reason we want a job in a job interview was because we wanted the money but it's what we are all thinking about money doesn't make the world go round but it sure makes life easier what i think you should do is sit down with your wife and discuss the financial implications of each job as well as the other pro's and con's but don't expect her to take on too much at once changing jobs moving house and having a baby adds a lot of emotional strain onto someone whether they have someone to share it with or not i think you need to decide which is the most important first and do them all in a gradual process ultimately i do think it has to be your wife's decision as to which job she goes for because she is the one who has to do that job i wish you luck with it edit oh my i got a thumbs down for giving some good advice sheesh thanks Microeconomics Economic inequality Friends Poker jargon Breastfeeding Economics EastEnders Altruism The Amazing Race Theory of conduct Capitalism Publicly funded medicine Divorce Wal-Mart Plame affair Graduate school 401(k) Craps Charles Dickens Gross domestic product Inflation Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Insurance Labour economics Life insurance Objectivist philosophy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Free trade Extreme Programming Politics of Canada Health insurance Tax Arturo Frondizi Goodness and value theory FairTax Trade union Blackjack Law of value Milton H.
