help i'm and never had a relationship before i'm bi and i'm in my third year at college i've never had a girlfriend or boyfriend i've never dated anybody i need help i dont know how to approach to guys or girls i've been interested in girls and guy in the past few years in college no one knows i'm bi and i'm afraid to tell my family cause they are really close minded s i tried to talk to one of the girls and i was rejected i think i'm not lucky with girls or guys because of my appearance i dont have the courage to talk to the guy i like just cause i dont want to come out as the time passes i feel really lonely and sad and i sometimes cry at night what can i do thank you guys for all your responses but dont get me wrong i dont want to come out yet or anytime soon my situation is really hard to explain i think my parents will suffer a lot if they know about my sexuality and i wouldnt like to see them like that they would be really disappointed there is no way i can change that it is just the way they were raised and the thing they believe i know my happiness would be ruined but i would accept that rather than see them suffering because of me i wonder if dating another closet guy would be ok and for how long we'll be able keep that as a secret or should i just limit myself to date girls try some positive reinforcement to build yourself up also work on your issues with your sexuality too that can be a hindrance to happiness and don't worry so much about not dating yet i was myself before i met anyone and that only lasted a few months tops Avenue Q Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Friends The Emancipation of Mimi The Smoking Room EastEnders Dead Like Me One Tree Hill (TV series) Time Out of Mind Kodocha Social rule Sant Thakar Singh Human sexual behavior Milton H.
