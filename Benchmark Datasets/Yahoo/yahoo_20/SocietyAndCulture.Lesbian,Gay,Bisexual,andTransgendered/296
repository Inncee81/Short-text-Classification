has anyone else i just went through my second divorce and i am only years old on my th birthday i fullfilled a long time dream of going to bed with another man i really enjoyed it but as soon as he was done he got dressed and left i always thought that if i fulfilled my gay fantasies that i would have a better idea of whether i am gay or bi but i do not i love men for sex and women for a relationship anyway my question is is there anyway to bring these two together so that i love either one or the other for both activities i don't want to be one of those guys with a wife and a boyfriend if you know what i mean mostly you'll have to reconcile a lifetime of thinking that relationships are just between a man and a woman it'll probably be uncomfortable at first but it'll happen it's difficult when you first come out to figure out which men just want sex and which want more i think everyone at one time or another just wants a quick lay so i'm not going to be a prude about it but if you want a stronger personal connection to another man don't hop into the sack the first time you talk to each other acknowledge the interest but get to know him first that way the connection isn't completely based upon lust but there really aren't any thumbnail answers to this i recommend you go to your local lgbt center if one is available get to know other gay bi men in a different context than just a bar you'll meet real dimensional people there and network out good luck Sexual orientation Marriage Social rule Avenue Q Anal sex Friends Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Ex-gay Homosexuality Homophobia Bisexuality The Smoking Room Humphrey Bogart LGBT Gay slang Little Britain Same-sex marriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Sex and the City Theory of conduct Interpersonal relationship Transsexuality Anglican views of homosexuality Gay rights Fathers' rights Meaning of life Gender role One Tree Hill (TV series) E.
