am i getting over it sometimes i love her so much but other times i really don't like her at all i know that i'm never going to be good enough for her there are times when i just look at her and ask myself how do i like her am i getting over her it sounds like there's a battle going on between your rational mind and your irrational heart in your mind you may know that you shouldn't can't don't want to don't know the situation but your emotional side is still fixated on her and there's not all that much that you can do to stop that from personal experience i'd say that the only thing to do if you do want to get over her is to wait it's unlikely that you'l fall out of love very quickly because it takes time for such a powerful emotion to fade and be displaced i hope you can work it all out x Epistemology Infantilism Social rule Obsessive-compulsive disorder Time Out of Mind Sigmund Freud Emotions (album) Jon Secada Emotional intelligence Traumatic incident reduction Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Modernism Altruism Dog training Narcissism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Transactional analysis Psychoanalysis Moral objectivism Shaggy dog story Objectivist philosophy Homophobia Tina Turner Immanuel Kant Spice Girls Theodicy The McGuire Sisters Irrational number Human Real Love (song) Lord of Light The Isley Brothers Mind Love Another Side of Bob Dylan Freddy Fender Treehouse of Horror V Carl Jung Milton H.
