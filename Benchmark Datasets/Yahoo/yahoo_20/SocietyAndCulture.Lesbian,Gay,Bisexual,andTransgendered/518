has your lgbt status ever affected someone else in a negative way i don't mean have they suddenly not become your friend because of your sexuality take for example my year old niece me and her mother and father have always been open about my sexuality in the hope that she wouldn't develop a negative attitude towards lgbt people so she isn't afraid of who knows she has a cool gay uncle but as soon as the kids at her school got wind of it she was bullied about it this went on for months before she told anyone and to her credit she never once said she hated me which is what they wanted to make her do naturally i felt incredibly guilty but it's not like i could've done much about it have any of your friends family or work colleagues been affected like this and how did it make you feel when you found out i appreciate your input longview but my ten year old niece was bullied which is only ever a negative thing my sexuality is the thing that just is the fact she was bullied for something that she wasn't even involved in is negative in my eyes well longview i apologise if my edit seemed a little terse it certainly wan't intentional it's just something i feel very emotional about it actually happened to my mother some of her friends would distance themselves from her because of me i don't claim to have a close relationship with her but i was deeply hurt that her friends would distance themselves due to me i quickly turned that situation around and took her out to a nice brunch at the ritz carlton and she forgot all about her snotty friends as they have never been to the ritz for brunch and now she has some braggin' rights lol Homophobia EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) The Smoking Room About a Boy Ranma __ characters Theory of conduct Knots Landing Recurring South Park characters Social rule Bully Friends LGBT Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Gay Sexual orientation Kodocha Springfield Elementary School Shaggy dog story Ex-gay The Amber Spyglass Pet Sounds Stuttering Transactional analysis Humphrey Bogart Gay community Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Jon Secada The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Little Britain Domestic violence Kyle Broflovski Polyamory Cardcaptor Sakura Boston Public Infantilism Honey and Clover Hip hop rivalries Traumatic incident reduction Peter Pan Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Blood on the Tracks Laura Schlessinger Mystique (comics) The Marshall Mathers LP Pedophilia Sigmund Freud Section 28 Plame affair Germaine Greer AFI 100 Years series Fruits Basket Marilyn Monroe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gender role Child sexuality Kurt Cobain Maison Ikkoku Sex and the City Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Prisoner's dilemma Piccolo Junior Saga Charmed Zoophilia Ten Commandments The Adventures of Pete & Pete W.I.T.C.H.
