a question about gay marraige i'm just curious if the issue on gay marraige is more about having the legal rights of any other married couple or not being married in a christian church sorry if this question seems stupid i just don't follow this topic in the news because i already know where i stand in case you're wondering i think it's great if they want to commit to each other they can have all the same legal rights as everyone else they'll probably take their relationship more seriously than most heterosexual people do anyway have families be happy that's wonderful i'm just not so sure the christian church is the setting since god has already made it perfectly clear he's not okay with it it just seems like we're asking to be struck down by lightening i've always tried to be open minded it's not my place to judge others and i would never consider hating someone just because of who they choose to love so is it the church marraige that's the issue or getting government acknowledgement please note i'm just trying to understand the issue nothing more nothing less thanks in advance for helping me understand i just want government acknowledgment which i actually already have where i live woo hoo and the same benefits as any other married couple i do not believe the church should be forced to marry same sex couples if thier doctrine is against homosexuality i mean come on as gay people we are being told what we can and can't do and we hate it the church feels the same way Same-sex marriage Marriage Homosexuality and Christianity Religion and sexual orientation Civil union Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Federal Marriage Amendment Lawrence v.
