how can i tell my dad i'm bi my father is extremely homophobic i've been going out with a girl for months now my mother knows but i'm too afraid to tell my dad is there any way i can break the news to him just to let you know i'm not lesbian because i'm attracted to both sex someone said in one of the answers that i was a lesbian to be a lesbian you only like the female gender i like both glad i cleared that up believe it or not puzzlite we are in love that may not be the best thing to do it's your call my suggestion is to make sure you tell him before someone else does finding out through the grapevine will probably anger him more than if you confronted him about it explain your view of things tell him it's not your choice but it doesn't change who you are you may want to wait until your living on your own where he can't do anything about it if he did decide to kick you out good luck Gender role Lesbian Sexual orientation Friends Heteronormativity Little Britain Homophobia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule EastEnders Ex-gay Human sexual behavior Pitaten Homosexuality and transgender One Tree Hill (TV series) Calvin and Hobbes Dead Like Me Reparative therapy American Dad!
