okay so who watched the presidential forum on logo and what did u think i watched it but i'm disappointed that i fell asleep before hillary came on so i need to read what she actually said i have and still am an obama supporter however i was less than pleased on his answers or his lack of actually giving answers the two underdogs running are the ones that actually should be president but they are way to idealistic for mainstream america john edward is fake he just recently supports gays for the votes no less while i think the forum was good i don't feel like i learned anything new about the candidates i did find it interesting but not surprising that none of the republican candidates accepted the invitation for a similar forum this country with all its benefits is still really friggin screwed up juan i'm surprised i really didn't get that feeling from her she was professional and upfront with her questions just as a side note the debate can still be watched at http visiblevote logoonline com obama looked uncomfortable for someone that says he is our champion i liked his answers for the most part but was unsettled by how uncomfortable he appeared edwards came off fake and rehearsed he had sound bites and he aired them to us kucinich presented himself exactly like he is this man is open and honest if he could deliver the message better he would be a front runner gravel came off similar to kucinich i think he would make a great talk show host the guy had me laughing and admiring him at years old i do not think he could win but i was impressed with his candor richardson this man is a bought and paid for politician when he would not commit to signing a marriage bill if it were sitting on his desk that sealed his fate he is pandering for votes but not ours clinton she came off sweet and caring delivery is excellent but when you look at her words there is not a lot of substance there i see the same maneuvering with words that we saw from some other candidates i wasn't impressed overall of the front runners obama is the only one that impressed me of the other kucinich won my heart and mind he now has my vote i learned to listen when i went to a sales course many years ago if you listen to the words they always tell true story 2004 Democratic National Convention Democratic Party (United States) U.S. presidential election, 2008 U.S. Democratic Party presidential nomination, 2004 Barack Obama Alan Keyes Hillary Rodham Clinton Dennis Kucinich U.S. presidential election, 2004 The Daily Show Bill Clinton Social rule Jesse Jackson Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Plame affair 2004 Republican National Convention Late Night with Conan O'Brien Ralph Nader Ted Kennedy Shaggy dog story Ross Perot Current teachings of Prem Rawat Avenue Q Russ Feingold Theory of conduct Howard Dean Humphrey Bogart Federal Marriage Amendment Have I Got News For You John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004 U.S. Senate election, 2004 The Ashlee Simpson Show Blood on the Tracks Same-sex marriage in Canada Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Past teachings of Prem Rawat U.S. Senate election, 2006 Third party (United States) Karl Rove Pat Buchanan John Kerry Whose Line Is It Anyway? 2004 Iowa Democratic caucuses The Contender (television series) Bill O'Reilly (commentator) U.S. presidential election, 2000 ROC presidential election, 2004 U.S. Electoral College Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Empire Burlesque Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Condoleezza Rice Friends Melanie Wilkes Socrates Noam Chomsky United States House of Representatives Vice President of the United States Kurt Cobain Jerry Brown Sinfest Major League Baseball television contracts Pet Sounds Red state vs. blue state divide Sharon Tate The Apprentice 2 2000 Australian Grand Prix Paul Is Dead Bill Frist Zell Miller Same-sex marriage in the United States EastEnders Heinkel He 112 George W.
