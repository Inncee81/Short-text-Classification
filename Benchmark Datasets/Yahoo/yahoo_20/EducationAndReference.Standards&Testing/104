biology sat ii i am studying for the biology sat ii subject test i took honors biology as a freshman and i am planning to take the subject test in october as a sophomore i have the barron's book and will have about months of prepping time is it okay to take the test by studying the book alone haven taken biology last year and i probably forgot stuff what other prep books are recommended is two months enough prep time to get a high score if you've already taken the class two months is more than enough my only concern for you is that the material may no longer be fresh when you take the exam in october but if you use a test prep book you'll probably be fine it'll keep the important stuff fresh enough check out http www amazon com s ref nb ss gw initialsearch url search alias daps field keywords sat ii biology for user reviews on different bio books for the sat one of my favorite test prep companies is princeton review but there's a ton of other books out there that may be more suited towards your needs in my experience with sat subject tests a few weeks' worth of review suffices starting too far ahead of time doesn't help because by the time october comes around you'll have forgotten stuff you studied in august i've never studied for an sat subject test more than two weeks in advance Advanced Placement Program Education in the United States Web crawler Lynbrook High School Biology Stuyvesant High School Medical College Admission Test Test (student assessment) Gmail Education in Germany The Princeton Review Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Mozilla Firefox Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Romania Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Prostate cancer Education in the People's Republic of China On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Stevens Institute of Technology University of Central Florida Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Luther Head The Citadel (Military College) Princeton University World Wide Web Physics St. John's College, U.
