do you have to be a genius to get a perfect sat score not at all i imagine you just have to be really good at taking tests for example i got on the critical reading and on the writing not quite perfect because i've been reading avidly since th grade and took years of latin in high school latin does wonders for your grammar and vocabulary both doesn't mean i'm a genius when it comes to english just that i know a lot about english and grammar i clearly don't know as much about math though since i only got a on it but oh if i had studied more well and studying does help i'm convinced that i could have gotten a much higher math score if i'd actually taken the time to study for it but i imagine that studying can only make a so so score into a good score though it might make a great score into a perfect score a lot of it is about just being naturally good at tests but genius isn't a requirement you just have to be really good at what the sat is about SAT Advanced Placement Program Education in the United States Graduate Record Examination Esperanto as an international language English grammar Interlingua Education in Romania Junior Certificate Grade (education) Great Teacher Onizuka Ontological argument Intelligence quotient Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination GED Education in Finland Latin Test (student assessment) Finnish language Hiberno-English Education in Taiwan Sex and intelligence Mathematics National Certificate of Educational Achievement German language Theory of conduct Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy College admissions Jumpstart 3rd Grade Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dutch language Vietnamese language Sanskrit Greek language TOEFL Vocabulary Stuyvesant High School Bulgarian language History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Indian English Memorial High School (Hedwig Village, Texas) Theodicy A-level Hungarian language Ra (board game) Education in Singapore Baccalaur__at Bristol Grammar School Esperanto grammar Hopkins School DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Law school Affirmative action Hunter College High School United States of America Mathematical Olympiad High school Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) NUS High School of Mathematics and Science Romanian language Education Extreme Programming Law School Admissions Test Victorian Certificate of Education American Sign Language Juris Doctor Charter school Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX The Tale of Genji Theory of multiple intelligences American and British English differences Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Lynbrook High School Pump It Up Education in England Quizbowl Charles Darwin's education Homeschooling Spanish verbs Second language acquisition DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Spanish language No Child Left Behind Act Logan, Utah United States Academic Decathlon Constructed language Philosophical skepticism Adjective Troy High School Perl Auslan Grammar General Certificate of Secondary Education Pitaten Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test Computer numbering formats Theodore Kaczynski Secondary education in the United States DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Doomsday argument
