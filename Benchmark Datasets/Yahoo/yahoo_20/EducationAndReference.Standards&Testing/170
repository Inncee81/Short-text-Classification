can someone help me with my math placement test its for my college here is the link for the placement test http www cic totalcare com english admissn html you have to click 'sample placement test' then math placement test scroll to the bottom and press 'proceed to test' i know its easy but its been a little while since i did this stuff and i've forgotten it all i just need a walkthrough for the problems thanks in advance a calculate the following sqrt sqrt sqrt x b evaluate each of the following if x and y x y x xy c find n if of n is n n d solve x x x x x x x x x x e simplify the following x y x x f solve x x g factor the following completely a a a x y x h solve the system below x y x y i simplify and state restrictions x cannot equal x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x j solve for x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x k find the length and the slope of the line segment connecting a and b length sqrt sqrt slope l graph x y y x y x the graph will look like a line that intersects the y axis at and goes down two units for every five units that it moves to the right m graph y x a parabola with the vertex at the origin branches increasing on both sides as the equation describes n find x y z w x degrees y degrees z degrees x sqrt sqrt o solve the following equations for x or y x x x x x x x x x x y x y p find the tenth term of an arithmetic sequence when its first term is and the common difference is q find the area of the following figures x y r area pi r pi ad cm bc cm ae cm is the area of the rectangle be bc ad area of both triangles r graph each of the following y x upside down parabola with vertex at y x http www madeasy de y x gif y sin x http www quickmath com www images gif graphs plot example gif s simplify a log log log log use the identity sin x cos x t solve x x x x x x x x x take the log base of the entire equation u divide x x x by x x x x Cissoid of Diocles Trigonometric function Parabola Complex number Triangle Conic section Trigonometric identity Trajectory Wallpaper group Archimedes Projective transformation Random walk Multiple integral Glossary of graph theory Square root Quadratic equation Pi Quantum harmonic oscillator M__bius transformation Derivative Golden ratio Normal distribution Graph theory Phase-shift keying Ordinary differential equation Circle Mandelbrot set Bessel function Ellipse Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Quartic equation Collision detection Cubic equation Special relativity Roman surface Boy's surface Planetary orbit Quaternion Astrodynamics Coordinates (mathematics) Pentagram Manifold Catalan number RLC circuit Pendulum Pythagorean theorem Exponential function Gamma function Tetrahedron Fibonacci number Leonhard Euler Nondimensionalization Arthur Cayley Recurrence relation Kepler's laws of planetary motion Laplace transform Debye model Traveling salesman problem Absolute value Mathematics Compiler optimization Area (geometry) Semi-major axis IP (complexity) Loop-erased random walk Graph coloring Simplex Ruler-and-compass construction Dynamic programming Convergence of Fourier series Pascal's triangle Planar graph Logarithm Elementary algebra Equation of time Dirac equation Polygon Methods of contour integration Dijkstra's algorithm Haversine formula Orthogonal matrix Matroid Irrational number Heat equation Harmonic oscillator Black-Scholes
