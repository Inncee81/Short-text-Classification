i q tests how legitimate are they are they flawed are they subjective are the online ones legitimate is the entire concept of measuring intelligence flawed exactly how unbiased is the iq test does it depend on different stages of one's life after you've graduated college it might measure after the very same person joins a cult they might test lower so what exactly is being measured iq tests have one major flaw above all caclutated it is mental age chronological age this in inherently flawed your test is going to be somewhat standard mattering on the exact test you take where the flaw comes in is the chronological age technically speaking if you take an iq test twice once when you are and again while you are and you test the same on it lets say for a mental age score when you take the test your iq is which isn't possible but bear with me when you take the test your iq is so basically what that is saying is you are technically getting dumber as you age if you saw not too long ago there was an infant inducted into mensa a society for high iq people to that i said no shit if you think about it if the kid is and he gets an iq of and gets inducted if you reverse the fomula x x thus he scored enough points to score as a old old okay he must be smart but if you think about it these are standardized tests questions with multiple choice answers i could take random guesses and i would be able to get a score of a year old but my iq would be in that case thus the system is inherently flawed to benefit youth if you are tested at and you have an iq of lets say that means you have a mental age of does this mean when you hit your mental age will match your chronogical age so your iq will drop to then or is your iq constant thus you would have a mental age of is that a good thing i mean at dementia can start to set in there i would think the brain of a year old would not be as good as the brain of a year old all in all you can't take a test to figure out how smart you are which is what an iq test is i am a very intelligent person i have taken the mensa test and was denied membership personally i am the suckiest test taker you will ever see i have tutored people to as in classes that i got cs in it is just how i am having an actaul test in front of me isn't going to measure anything other than how well i take a test also my experience on the mensa tests you need some inherent knowledge of how things work and how things are if you do not have them then you are handicapped there was one picture question where it showed a marlin a goldfish a dolphin and a trout and the question was which doesn't belong right there you are at a disadvantage if you have never seen what a marlin goldfish dolphin or trout looks like also there are more than one answer to this question the correct one is a dolphin it is a mammal and breathes air while the others are fish i chose the goldfish because none of the others can be a realistic domesitacted pet was my answer wrong no in fact it was correct and if i could explain my logic i would have gotten full credit for it one a side note i was in meteorology class taking a test and a quesiton came up that was phrased do you know the difference between cloud x and cloud y i was the only one in the class to get full credit on it because i asnwered no logically i was right and the teacher saw that but what if i lived in some tibetten monistery and my life was all in there if i would look at those pictures i might never have seen any of them before nor would i know that a dolphin is a mammal it doesn't mean i am any less intelligent it just means i am lacking a piece of knowledge that should not effect the score of a test that is supposed to measure my intelligence and logic sticking oddly shaped pegs into equally oddly shaped holes is a better measurement of intelligence and logic than showing me pictures of fish overall it is a very flawed system that does not benefit anyone at all other than being able to stick their nose into a conversation and say i am a genius newsflash i am a genius too i just don't test well and because you want to look at the score of a standardized test you will never
