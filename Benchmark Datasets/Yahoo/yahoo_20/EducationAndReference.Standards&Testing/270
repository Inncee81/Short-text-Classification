what can i do if i get bad as first year or a levels exam results found the year hard tried to revise my best four a levels know i'm gonna' get bad results what can i do retake them can my college school kick me out for failing of my subjects does this effect my future i'm in the same position in fact i only done three as levels this year and know for sure i have failed and the other i can pass but with bad marks for my school i know i won't get kicked out but if i wish i can retake the year as many have done from the previous year as your allowed years in th form i think otherwise i'm allowed to decline my results i get for this and improve the coursework and re submit it in january therefore can improve my grade to continue to a level you usually need at least around a d but even if you get this or not the teacher can say whether he she thinks you're elegible as for future it is early but depending if you want to go to university and what courses the grades needed vary quite a lot i'm definitely not the smartest kid in year as most my gcse's were c's but i'm considering uni and course i like needs about ucas points which is something like a minimum of two e's at as level and d at a level so if you think it's affecting your future just think there are always plenty of people in the same boat as you A-level Grade (education) Graduate school General Certificate of Secondary Education High school UCAS National Certificate of Educational Achievement Higher (Scottish) Education in Romania Juris Doctor GED Education in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China SAT Leaving Certificate Education in Portugal Education in Australia Education in the United States College admissions Advanced Placement Program Tripartite System Chiropractic Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Pump It Up Education in Germany Master's degree Teacher Education in Singapore Education in Sweden Education in Austria No Child Left Behind Act Education in England Philosophy, Politics and Economics American and British English differences Education in Japan Appeal Bristol Grammar School Doctor of Philosophy Football (soccer) Trade union Beatmania IIDX Jaime Escalante Prostate cancer Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu International Mathematical Olympiad Secondary education in the United States Physician Numerus clausus Test (student assessment) Rugby union Mixed martial arts Theory of conduct Culture of the United States Affirmative action Harrow School Merchiston Castle School Poker jargon Comparison of Canadian and American football Baccalaur__at British undergraduate degree classification Bachelor of Arts American football Secondary education in France Grade inflation Volleyball Education in Malaysia University of Bristol Education in Taiwan Hogwarts Solar variation Education in Scotland Hopkins School College Martial art Physical therapy Architect Pitaten Norway national football team Uniting Church in Australia Matura Super Bowl XXXVIII Pittsburgh Steelers West Bromwich Albion F.C.
