sat act comparison i got a on the sat's in reading in math and in writing for the multiple choice for the essay and a on the act's according to the charts on wikipedia a on the act's is better than a on the sat's but i've heard many schools still do not consider or at least weigh less the writing section of the sat's and again according to wikipedia my combined math and reading score of is better than my on the act's i'm planning on taking the sat's again in the fall but if i do not raise my writing grade should i send my sat's or act's to colleges i d say send both colleges will like to see that you ve done well on both tests which you have true your writing score is significantly below your other scores but it is true that colleges aren t yet looking at the writing scores as seriously some schools more likely the state schools don t even ask for the writing scores at all and did you take the optional writing portion of the act any school that will seriously look at the writing section on the sat will require you to take that as well so you might look into it and see if the places you re applying look at the writing portion at all it should say somewhere in their applicant material but generally both of your scores are good so you can send them both a high score on either one will secure that portion of the admission requirements of anywhere you re applying but generally good scores on both tests might put you above someone else who only sent scores for one or the other and your lower writing score except perhaps at the most prestigious schools shouldn t negatively affect your chances what will look even better is if you manage to raise your writing score even by just a little when you take it again when you send scores they can see all of your sat scores and places generally like to see that you ve improved keep in mind that the multiple choice is of your writing score http www collegeboard com student testing sat scores understanding howscored html and that s way easier to study for than the essay but totally send both you ve got good scores on both tests good luck SAT GED College admissions Graduate Record Examination Test (student assessment) Education in the United States Advanced Placement Program Grade (education) Education in the People's Republic of China Affirmative action Law School Admissions Test Graduate school Education in Romania The Princeton Review Central processing unit Juris Doctor A-level High school Numerus clausus Education in Taiwan Single Transferable Vote Homeschooling Standardized testing Appeal IB Diploma Programme Uniform Resource Locator United States Academic Decathlon No Child Left Behind Act Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Prostate cancer Stuyvesant High School Intelligence quotient Quizbowl Trinity College, Dublin Junior Certificate Redundant array of independent disks Exponentiation Extreme Programming HTML Act of Parliament World Wide Web Hunter College High School Charter school HyperText Transfer Protocol Sex and intelligence Medical school Baccalaur__at American and British English differences Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Normal distribution Education in Australia College Board Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Education in England ELO rating system HTTP cookie Education in Germany Z-test Theory of conduct Education in Malaysia TOEFL Ra (board game) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Hong Kong UCAS Theodicy Mozilla Application Suite Lawyer Medical College Admission Test Model (economics) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Lynbrook High School Welding Debugging Reliability engineering Cross site scripting Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Doomsday argument Public education Gmail Gramophone record Education in Portugal Quicksort Plame affair Sheepshead Education in Finland Beatmania IIDX Magnet school CPU cache XML Item response theory Compiler optimization MP3 Fair use Martial art Explosive material Transmission Control Protocol Ice core
