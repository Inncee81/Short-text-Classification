why do you think michael jackson is guilty of child molestation a lot of people say that they think michael jackson is guilty or innocent but why maybe the kids are the ones lying michael is rich and has a lot of money the family who sued him in had a history of pulling scandals on other families and not just michael in to get the case dismissed or whatever all michael had to do was pay the family a couple million isnt that a sign that all the family wanted was money in the first place cause after they left michael alone then again michael does share his bed with kids but he says it's all out of innocence and that all they're about to do is go to sleep michael could be guilty but what does everyone else think and i know this subject is old but it's still on my mind michael is innocent fuck all haters at least you are looking for the truth all those others immediately judge him just because of what those kids and media said if they took the time to understand and do a little research they will see he's innocent all he ever wants to do is help children he is a very kind human being i think before people condemn him should look for the truth like your doing i love you mj 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Michael Jackson Knots Landing Miscarriage of justice James Hanratty Plame affair 1919 World Series Eminem Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal LaToya Jackson Allegations of child sexual abuse by Michael Jackson in the early 1990s Randy Jackson (musician) Katherine Jackson Days of our Lives North American Man/Boy Love Association Divorce Schabir Shaik Trial Michael Moore The Jeffersons (South Park) Overkill (band) Martha Stewart The Catcher in the Rye Mumia Abu-Jamal Anti-Defamation League O.
