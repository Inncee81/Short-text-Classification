as a non british citizen can i get employment as a school teacher in england without having a qts i am thinking of a change in career i have taught tesol re on a part time basis for more than ten years however i do not have a qts or equivalent i am not a british citizen but i would like to teach in england would the ministry of education in uk employ me as a school teacher how and where should i apply for a scholarship in england to do qts no you could not work as a teacher you would have to apply to do a pgce at a university for a year and pass to get qts you won't be able to work for a state school without it or an equivalent you won't get a scholarship i'm afraid there are other incentives but as a non british citizen it seems unlikely that you are eligible unfortunately you really missed the boat for a year pgce courses would have stopped recruiting in june so unless you are very persuasive and manage to squeeze onto a course now for september it's more likely to be able to get onto next year's courses it does depend though on what you want to teach it might be possible to work for a public as stated above actually private school but i would discourage you from trying it seems unlikely that they would employ you wthout qts if i were you decide what you really want to teach and ring up unis to try to get on a course with your experience and some persuasive skills you could have qts in no time hope this helps Postgraduate Certificate in Education Teacher Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Portugal Student loan Experiential education Education in Hong Kong Education in Australia Law school Professor Juris Doctor Master's degree College Teaching English as a Foreign Language UCAS Kingston University Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Scholarship Doctor of Philosophy University of Buckingham Separation of church and state City and Guilds of London Institute Top-up fees Education in Romania Doctorate Secondary education in Japan Open University National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in Singapore Trinity College, Dublin No Child Left Behind Act Education in Austria Voluntary Student Unionism Columbia University Grade (education) Intelligent design movement School choice Education in New Zealand Education in France French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Conscription Kwantlen University College Comprehensive school Immigration to the United States Reiki College admissions Education in India GED Independent school (UK) English as an additional language University of Central Florida Culture of the United States Marshall McLuhan A-level Secondary education in France Affirmative action Education in Taiwan British nationality law Tourism in Hong Kong Air Education and Training Command Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Poker jargon Aesthetic Realism University of Maryland Baltimore County Equal Protection Clause Education in Japan Higher education in Japan Caulfield Grammar School Education in Malaysia Architect Waldorf Education Language education Copyright law of the United Kingdom University of Chicago Alexander Technique Seneca College Danish Folkeskole Education Robert Hutchins Appeal Education in Scotland Israeli Arab Education in England Creation and evolution in public education Nurse JET Programme High school Middle Tennessee State University Health insurance University of Michigan Jaime Escalante Hong Kong English Elections in the United Kingdom Lawyer Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Distance education
