online college i got to university of pheonix i was just wondering would an employer be less likely to hire me because i went to school online i really think online college is more hard because you have to teach yourself alot unfortunately i have to attend school online because of work i am in college to become a school teacher i went for my bachelor's at a traditional school then landed my teaching position after i had been teaching for a while i went to get my masters and took those courses online through walden university online courses really aren't too bad you get to 'attend' class when you have the time and teaching yourself the material isn't too difficult it just requires a lot of reading on your part which would happen at a traditional college too talk to some area school districts and see what they say if they don't like to hire teachers that receive their degree online you may have to consider a traditional college in order to get a job or start your coursework online then transfer to a traditional school your senior year so that you have a degree from that 'traditional' school good luck Graduate school Education in the United States Teacher Education in Australia Master's degree Education in Germany Bachelor of Arts Juris Doctor Community college College Education in Portugal Professor High school No Child Left Behind Act Medical school Education in Hong Kong Associate's degree Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the Republic of Ireland Open University Education Trinity College, Dublin Education in Sweden Tai Chi Chuan Australian Qualifications Framework Chiropractic Academia Education in France Grade (education) Lawyer Distance education Athabasca University Columbia University Doctorate University of Maryland University College Education in Malaysia Cooper Union California Polytechnic State University Law school Doctor of Philosophy Education in Canada Bologna process Education in Taiwan Student University of Central Florida Master of Engineering City and Guilds of London Institute Teaching English as a Foreign Language Institute for Christian Studies Degrees of Oxford University Education in Japan Christian Brothers University Robert Hutchins College admissions The College of New Jersey Physician Theory of conduct Jaime Escalante Washington University in St. Louis Affirmative action GED Savannah College of Art and Design University of North Texas Eton College The Sims 2: University Japanese tea ceremony Architect Hogwarts subjects Western Kentucky University Education in Finland Education in Romania A-level Reiki Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Academic degree Social rule University of Toronto Experiential education Medieval university Georgetown University Air Education and Training Command University of Houston Pennsylvania State University Secondary education in France German language Textbook Franklin W.
