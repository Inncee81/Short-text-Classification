is there a faster way to mark a scantron card than a pencil at my office we process about scantron cards per day unfortunately we also have to copy about day over from faxed copies of cards that adds up to close to ten thousand little bubbles i have to fill in by hand with a pencil each week i'm thinking some company must make something akin to a downsized bingo marker i could use to fill in each bubbles instantly it would need to either use graphite or a ink specially formulated to work with scantron machines as anyone in the biz will tell you regular ink will not always work any ideas guys and girls thanks d use pencils at once you could rubber band them together and use them like chop sticks make it only little bubbles per week Pencil Casting Bingo Writing Fountain pen Printing press Traditional animation Typewriter Spice Girls Mimeograph machine Punch card Eraser Inkjet printer Textile manufacturing Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Poker jargon Rubber Unit record equipment Computer Screen-printing Surveillance Bubble Bobble Gettysburg Address Computer printer Mail Legion of Super-Heroes Paintball Akuma (Street Fighter) Royal Canadian Air Farce Eisner Award Photocopying Garfield Guilty Gear Extreme Programming Pencil lead Internet fraud Betting (poker) Overclocking Pebble bed reactor Fusion power CPU cache Playing card Tire Golf One-time pad NCUBE Keno Optical character recognition Medical prescription Pencil sharpener Duplicating machines ITunes Music Store Mario series enemies Wine making Chic Stone PlayStation 2 Jim Aparo Rubber stamp Fax W.
