how to handle the th grade students who are not disciplined and couldn't understand english well currently i'm teaching in a national plus school junior high school each class consists of students i have to say most of them are rich spoiled and lazy children since it's a national plus school i have to teach by using english but the fact is their english ability is way too low only few of them could follow the lesson well moreover they still do their 'elementary school'bad habits such as walking around during the lesson chatting interuppting when the t is explaining coming late not bringing the books not paying attention when someone's speaking can anyone give ideas how to cope this thing i need them to be able to follow the lesson well have some respect n discipline know the turn to speak and be silent and could sit still during the lesson i couldn't translate my explanation since english is the main language and my principal wants no billingual you may want to revert to elementary methods to try to curb elementary school behaviors use a marble jar and when it is filled have a pizza party put marbles in one each day everyone comes to class with books or on time or if everyone is quiet through the lesson be sure to tell them when lesson time so they know to be quiet alot of this could be language barrier but i would explain to them that listening to others including you is displaying common courtesy which you want to reward for more punative measures if people are goofing around make a dramatic walk to the chalkboard and slowly write tally marks until they are quiet for every tally marks they lose a minute of lunch recess and i'd explain the system that if they aren't quiet to teach the time has to be made up somewhere good luck to you you don't have an easy situation Education in the United States Education in Japan Social rule Second language acquisition Shaggy dog story Philosophy of language Theory of conduct Literacy Education in Romania Logic Dog training Dyslexia Alexander Technique Columbine High School massacre Extreme Programming Secondary education in Japan Primary education Chinese language Education in South Korea Martial art Education in Taiwan Professor Education in Singapore Aesthetic Realism Richard Feynman Graduate school Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Book of Isaiah Humphrey Bogart Economics Education Socrates Coming of Age (TNG episode) Social psychology I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue High school Turkish education system Education in England Singlish American Sign Language German language Great Teacher Onizuka Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus National Certificate of Educational Achievement Time Out of Mind Normal distribution Electrophysiology Spanish language The Book of Five Rings Ludwig Wittgenstein Intelligent design movement Education in Germany E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
