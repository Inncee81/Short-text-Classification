do i have to have a theme in my classroom i am a first year teacher and do not have money to go all out and set my room up with a theme is this okay should i spend my savings on classroom decoration i work in a very low income community so we barely have supplies as it is i've already spent hundreds on things like calendars books etc absolutely not i think some teachers get entirely too caught up in bulletin boards and themes it's fun to do but it's not necessary for learning to take place since you don't have a lot of money to put towards it and your students are low income you should all work together to create decorations let the kids set up committees and decide what they want to do and how they'll go about doing it it'll be cheaper less work for you outside of class and a creative learning experience for your students Beavis and Butt-head The Catcher in the Rye Columbine High School massacre Classroom Education in Germany Teacher Murdock-Portal Elementary School No Child Left Behind Act Glen Ridge, New Jersey Education in the United States Great Teacher Onizuka Daria King George V School Japanese tea ceremony Experiential education Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Raffles Institution Ohio Wesleyan University Bristol Grammar School Drama Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Giver JET Programme Kindergarten Bart chalkboard gags Boston Public Hogwarts Floor Directory Massachusetts Institute of Technology Teach the Controversy Graduate school Education in France Avenue Q Education in India House of Lords Education in Japan Caulfield Grammar School Erik Satie Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur The Adventures of Pete & Pete Harrow School Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix St. Joseph's College, Hong Kong Salt Lake Community College Homeschooling Progressive tax Teachers (film) Gwinnett University Center Education in Portugal Worcester Polytechnic Institute Robert Hutchins Steller Secondary School Lynbrook High School FairTax Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy The Apprentice 2 School violence Education in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China Paradox Emerson College Model United Nations Melbourne High School Lesson The Citadel (Military College) Tai Chi Chuan James Ruse Agricultural High School Carey Baptist Grammar School Learning disability The Emancipation of Mimi John Cage Franklin W.
