st grade teachers are you ready for school st grade teachers are you ready for school this is my first year teaching and it's weeks until school starts and i don't know what i'm doing i have the first day's activities planned but after that i don't know do i just jump into the lessons on the second day i'm suppose to meet up with a mentor teacher next week and go to new teacher orientation but i just want to know now any advice i didn't do my internship as scheduled because they really needed a teacher at this school so that's why i guess i'm so lost also all the first grade teacher meet each week and determine the lessons for that week so i really can't make my own lesson plans without them school policy i am a second year first grade teacher i would definitely take advantage of the planning time that you have with your first grade team i got hired two weeks before school started last year and my team helped me through the whole year they were very supportive and have a schedule planned out of the main activities and would show me all the steps for each thing that they did don't be afraid to ask a lot of questions with first graders the whole first month of school is a big adjustment period i found that we did not do many 'real' assignments mostly just assessments to place the students in reading groups and see what they know coming in and a lot and i mean a lot of behavior teaching it seemed very repetitive but i learned the hard way in not emphasizing all the routines and expected behavior enough we really started the curriculum in october also in our school they have half day kindergarten so most of september was having them adjust to being in school for a full day good luck let me know if you have any other questions Kindergarten Education in Germany Education in Japan Education in Romania Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Experiential education Teacher Extreme Programming Hogwarts Education Secondary education in Japan Standardized testing Grade (education) Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Homeschooling Waldorf Education Pitaten Intelligent design movement The Contender (television series) Caulfield Grammar School Tai Chi Chuan Scientology beliefs and practices Martial art No Child Left Behind Act A Course In Miracles Asperger syndrome The Apprentice 2 Education in Australia Literacy Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Music lesson Miami-Dade County Public Schools Hunter College High School Reading recovery Public education Boston Public Current teachings of Prem Rawat Jumpstart 3rd Grade National Certificate of Educational Achievement Carey Baptist Grammar School Professor Charter school Saturday Night Live Hogwarts subjects __cole Polytechnique Lesson Suzuki method Past teachings of Prem Rawat Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Negima Cooperative education ELO rating system SAT GED Gifted James Ruse Agricultural High School Education in South Korea George W.
