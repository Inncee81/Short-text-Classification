can i get a teaching job if i have a tattoo i am currently in college to get my degree for secondary education i am concerned because awhile ago i got a tattoo on my inner wrist i was not thinking ahead apparently is this going to affect me negatively when i try to get hired at a school sidenote the tattoo is small enough to be covered with a bandaid no they cant discriminate you just cover it with a small plaster or a watch and in such a descrete place it will go un noticed dont try to cover up to hard though as this will draw attention to the area and they may feel you have problems such as self harm wear the plaster for the interview and for a week or so and once you feel comfortable with them and that they arent going to judge you then take of the plaster allow them to ask questions and if hey ask why you covered it up just tell them that it was only recently done im sure your a wonderful person and i doubt they will hold a small tattoo against you after all the job you are doing is for children and i dont see how a small tattoo can affect their development lol dont worry xxx Tattoo Angelina Jolie Avril Lavigne Sento French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Avenue Q Infantilism American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Psychology The Apprentice 2 Androgen insensitivity syndrome Civil rights Henry Moore Milton H.
