what was your child's lead test result and how worried were you my month old had his test recently and it came back as a i'm kind of freaked out about it i read that and above is the level of concern but all of this research says that any amount could cause all of these horrible effects the only lead exposure i could think of would be the dust from some window sills that have some old lead paint under the newer paint which is peeling some it is not in a location where he can touch it and the peeling is not falling on the floor so i guess there could be some in the air when we first got the house i tested the paint on the window but not the paint below the surface paint i'm really beating myself up but the slightly elevated level could have been through contact with his toys living in a mining town near the interstate who knows let me know your experience thanks is ok my niece had a she's alright she moved out of the apartment they lived in because the landlord wouldn't do anything about it gave her a box of cascade dishwasher powder and told her to use that to scrub the walls daily my youngest came back i painted every unpainted wall in the house and had it retested months later and it went down to your baby is fine but i would definitely paint any and all walls and windows that haven't been painted in the last years or so just to be safe they can also come in contact with the lead dust in dirt outside so there isn't too much that you can do when it comes to that just make sure that you don't let him put his hands in his mouth when ya'll are outside and wash wash wash with warm soapy water everytime you come in and before eating or drinking anything if you have any of those toys that have been recalled because of lead paint get them back to the store for a refund you can google mattel toy recall and it gives you the whole list good luck isn't too much to worry about but being a mom it's hard not too just use precautions and he'll be just fine update everyone has some lead in their system it's natural the average normal is around so you see is quite normal it's when it gets closer to and above that it causes concern i would say in my professional opinion and in personal experience that if you know of things around your house that contain lead fix them now you probably won't be able to change out things like lead pipes and all of that but from what i hear as long as you don't use hot tap water for cooking then it should be ok Kitchen Paint Sento Tattoo Nuclear fallout Milton H.
