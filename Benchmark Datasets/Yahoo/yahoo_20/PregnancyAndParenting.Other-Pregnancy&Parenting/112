how safe is birth control i want to go on birth control however i am concerned about health threats such as blood clots also i am not crazy about the idea of gaining weight what are the health threats caused by birth control and will i gain a lot of weight also i heard that after i get off of birth control i will have a hard time getting pregnant another concern is also pregnancy while on birth control what are the chances of getting pregnant while using bc and a condom at the same time hormonal birth control does have risks such as blood clots as you mentioned however some forms have lower risks than others basically the lower the hormone dose the lower the risk but that is an over generalization the patch particularly in the us seems to have one of the highest rates of complications it also has the highest level of estrogen in canada and other places for some reason the patch has lower hormone levels depo provera is also extremely high risk and has the greatest risk of effecting future fertility the nuvaring has less hormones than the standard birth control pill and as such should have lower risks mirena is very effective and the side effects are low as well there is no evidence that hormonal birth control when taken as prescribed increases the risks of birth defects or problems during pregnancy the risk of getting pregnant while using the pill and condom assuming you use both correctly is near but crazier things have happened talk to your doctor a nurse a pharmacist and or planned parenthood to get a better idea of which method may be right for you then go online and get the patient information packet for each method you are considering and do more research yourself to look into the risks and benefits Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Folic acid Tocopherol Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Emergency contraception Urinary incontinence Abortion Hormone replacement therapy Menstrual cycle Depo Provera Condom Obstetrics Cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Growth hormone treatment Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Turner syndrome In vitro fertilisation Stroke Breastfeeding Diabetes mellitus Endometriosis Prolactinoma Herpes simplex virus Osteoporosis Traumatic brain injury Psoriasis Sex education Premature birth Organic food COX-2 inhibitor Ectopic pregnancy Nutrition Puberty Abortion debate Insulin Paracetamol Isotretinoin Medicine Cryptorchidism Maprotiline Aspirin Progesterone Tobacco smoking Miscarriage Clinical depression Atherosclerosis Blood pressure Coeliac disease Malaria Methamphetamine Obesity Safe sex Multiple sclerosis Acne Pregnancy Guinea pig Diethylstilbestrol Polycystic ovary syndrome Cardiovascular disease Gonorrhoea Teenage pregnancy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Medical analysis of circumcision Vitamin C Organic farming Transsexuality Breast cancer Caffeine Prenatal diagnosis Migraine Haloperidol DDT Depleted uranium Paroxetine Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Nicotine Growth hormone Spina bifida Cytomegalovirus Sexual abstinence Postpartum depression Pulmonary embolism Antiretroviral drug Ovarian cancer Myocardial infarction Alternative medicine
