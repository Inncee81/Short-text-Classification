question about gestational diabetes i have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes and have been monitoring my blood sugar levels for almost weeks now today my doctor put me on glydurade mg to take only before i go to bed for now i am only weeks and they said i am high risk and now have to see a physician rather than my midwife my question is how many of you have had this problem and how many were able to deliver vaginally and how many had a c section i had this same problem as long as you take your medicine excercise and control your diet the baby will not be too machrosomic for a vaginal delivery i was very careful so my son weighed lbs ounces when he was born i had him vaginally with no complications the most important thing to remember is this you are in control of your birth as long as the baby stays under lbs oz you can insist that they allow you to give birth naturally they will monitor the baby and if things get complicated then they may intervene with a c section my doctor kept insisting that a c section would be safer but i stuck to my guns the reason the baby gets so big is your high blood sugar is making him fatter so his shoulders may get stuck on the way down as long as you keep those sugars low s he will be a normal size Childbirth Obstetrics Breech birth Birth weight Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia Pregnancy Insulin Hypertension Premature birth Atkins Nutritional Approach Prostate cancer Medicine Caesarean section Stroke Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dieting Prenatal diagnosis Obesity Crohn's disease Abortion Hyperglycemia Midwifery Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tocopherol Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Growth hormone treatment Hamster Miscarriage Coeliac disease Medical prescription Stomach cancer Folic acid Oral contraceptive Glycogen storage disease type I Dialysis Insulin resistance Decompression sickness Sugar substitute Intact dilation and extraction Malaria Medical analysis of circumcision Diabetic retinopathy Intravenous therapy Blood pressure Fertility awareness Cytomegalovirus In vitro fertilisation Gastroparesis Low-carbohydrate diet Milk Turner syndrome Anorexia nervosa Pound Intersex surgery Diabetic ketoacidosis Psoriasis Abortion debate Nutrition Weight training Diabetic neuropathy Intensive insulinotherapy Partial-birth abortion Lupus erythematosus Sexual intercourse Angina Placental abruption Diabetic nephropathy Acromegaly Prolactinoma Puberty Pneumonia Infant respiratory distress syndrome Traumatic brain injury Sex assignment Garlic Asthma Acute respiratory distress syndrome Prenatal care Human cloning Tobacco smoking Female genital cutting Ovarian cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Terri Schiavo Cystic fibrosis Colorectal cancer Placenta praevia Strap-on dildo Aspartame Theory of conduct
