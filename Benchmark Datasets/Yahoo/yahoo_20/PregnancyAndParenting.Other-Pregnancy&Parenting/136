in abortions cant they first kill the fetus with injection and then suck it out isnt c section nicer i'm asking this and i still didnt got the answer i want why they have to suck out the baby while its still alive why cant they use some injection to kill the fetus and just take it out through c section isnt this much more nicer to do if they have to do they can shoot the baby full of saline solution that will kill the baby then you go through labor to push the baby out but i think the bigger question here is and you said it yourself why do they suck the baby out while it is still alive with you saying that does that not make it murder these people who have and give abortions do not see the baby as human so they justify their actions buy calling the baby a fetus there for they can say it is not a viable living person but they are wrong and they will find out in the end murder is murder no matter what kind of label you give it oh and they do not give a c section because then it will make the baby seem more real to the mother Abortion debate Intact dilation and extraction Abortion Pregnancy Theory of conduct Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Abortion in the United States Person Partial-birth abortion Childbirth Abortion in Canada Fetus Religion and abortion Roe v.
