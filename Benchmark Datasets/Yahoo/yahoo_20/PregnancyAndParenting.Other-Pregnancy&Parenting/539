commercials for my son and or daughter should i try it lots of my neighbors lately have been telling me my son would be good as the gerber baby he's about months now and has the prettiest eyes and round little face eith those cubby little cheeks and big dimples when he smiles as for my daughter yrs she was in a beauty pageant yr old she did well in the preliminary and the state she did ok in come to find out she was a little sick she threw up in the car later everyone is always telling me how cute my kids are and asking my daughter how she got so pretty do you think i should try to get them into it if so do you know any valid legit companies we can try we would like to keep it close we live in nw ohio i know for my daughter it would have to be up to her but she loves to sing and dance i will try to put a link to pictures but if it doesn't work and you would like to see my kids i can e mail some pics to you http thumbp mail re yahoo com tn sid mid adhhxeiaac rlxkbak g vyhe partid f fid inbox the pagant i put my daughter in was one of those fancy ones but i didn't realize it when i took her to preliminaries i figured it out when i saw all the little girls the state competition regardless of what the other little girls looked like i did not put makeup on my daughter yr the time i'm not one of those mother's that's all into pageants and would push my child to do them and win it was just something for fun to see how she would do like i said it would be up to her if she wanted to do anything like this of course i don't want her to be like lindsay nor do i want her to have self esteem issues but there are plenty of well rounded young hollywood starlets you just have to know how to handle those situations i bet your kids are super cute maybe they'd do well in pageants commercials etc but really think about it before you do it and consider who you'd be doing it for i'm sure you're justifiably proud of your kids but being in a commercial is work not play and and year olds don't need a job except cleaning up their blocks sitting still wearing makeup it's not something you'd get to opt out of for a commercial dealing with grumpy adults sitting in the car on the way to jobs and smiling and frowning on cue are not entertaining activities for little kids it would also take precious time away from what your kids would otherwise be doing playing and learning and for your daughter maybe doing a music or dance class your little kids could care less about the fame such as it is also they'd be getting a signal that what matters about them is how they look consider letting them play learn skills that are fun for them and then let them use those skills and their cute smiles in an acting or modeling career when they are much older and are truly making that decision for themselves good luck Humphrey Bogart EastEnders About a Boy Social rule Marilyn Monroe Sharon Tate Kylie Minogue Kodocha The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Daredevil Hall & Oates Boy band Patricia Ford Knots Landing Janet Jackson The Ashlee Simpson Show The Contender (television series) Care Bears Our Gang Survivor (novel) Shaggy dog story Negima Sin City George Burns The Adventures of Pete & Pete AFI 100 Years series Lindsay Lohan Full House Monster Rancher monsters Betting (poker) Avenue Q Characters in the Smurfs Garth Brooks Little Britain Hilary Duff Late Night with Conan O'Brien Miss Venezuela Charmed Jennifer Lopez Blood on the Tracks The Critic Great Teacher Onizuka The Fairly OddParents Ben Johnson (athlete) Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) Rod Stewart Maison Ikkoku Joke Garfield James T.
