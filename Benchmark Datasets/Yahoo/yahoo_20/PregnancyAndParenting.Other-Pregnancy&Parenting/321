autism and a second child what are the chances my second husband has many family memebers who you would say were on the spectrum at some point of there lives only boy age still has obvious issues all of the adults have had families and careers anyway we had boy together who is high autism how many people have a second i really want another baby and hubby is not into adoption so what are the odds of a second there are the statistics that the person above me gave which are accurate with your husband's family history though and the fact that you've had one child with autism there's a good chance you could have another i don't think anyone could give you an exact percentage though i guess you need to decide if you could handle another child with autism i have three kids two boys and a girl my second son has pdd nos which is a mild form of autism once he was diagnosed we decided not to have any further as there was a risk we could have another autistic child and my husband and i have no family history of it my son is very high functioning but its a lot of work and i can't imagine if i had a severely autistic child anyways i hope this wasn't too depressing just some things to think about then again i look at my daughter who i had after my son she was born before he was diagnosed and i think thank god i had her she's a miracle because if i hadn't had her before my son got diagnosed she probably would not be here Autism Controversies in autism Autistic community Asperger syndrome Autistic spectrum Autism rights movement Autism epidemic Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Ethical challenges to autism treatment Pervasive developmental disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Autistic culture Neurodiversity Androgen insensitivity syndrome Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Autistic savant Sensory Integration Dysfunction Mental retardation Intelligence quotient Gifted Disability MMR vaccine Temple Grandin Infantilism Vaccine Left-handed About a Boy Bernard Rimland Mark Geier Generation Rescue High-Functioning Autism Autistic enterocolitis Theory of mind DSM-IV Codes Thimerosal Bipolar disorder Refrigerator mother Safe Minds Cephalic disorder Romulus and Remus Jon Secada Rain Man Divorce Transsexuality Andrew Wakefield Growth hormone treatment Lorna Wing Risperidone Coeliac disease Bruno Bettelheim Hypoglycemia Dissociative identity disorder Theory of conduct Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Neurotypical Pedophilia EastEnders Political correctness Hacker Anti-psychiatry Bayesian inference History of intersex surgery National Alliance for Autism Research ELO rating system Bowl Championship Series Rich Mullins Feral child Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Beach Boys The Fairly OddParents Cancer Intersex surgery Cliff Richard Adult attention-deficit disorder A-CHAMP Schizophrenia Baby Blues Knots Landing Epidemiology Scrooge McDuck Childfree British Royal Family M.I.N.D.
