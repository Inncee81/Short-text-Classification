if i do not put my baby's fathers name on the birth certificate does he still have rights my unborn child's father chose to walk away even though this was a planned pregnancy he changed his cell phone number and does not even call to see if the pregnancy is going good i have made up my mind that i do not want him to have anything to do with my child so i am not going to put his name on the birth certificate if is obvious that he could really give a shit about this baby my question is if he wants any rights to see her will he have to pay for a paternity test and lawyer fees i dont want his support the welfare of my child is much more important and the father is a functional drunk and a loser with a job so unless he changes he is not fit to have my baby has anybody been through this before if the father is a loser with a job and a functional drunk why did you plan a pregnancy with him regardless of your opinion of him your child may be the one who wants to know his her father you cannot poison your child's mind about their father don't get me wrong he's a real jerk for leaving you but the fact is in years it's not your call courts can control the baby and parents for years but after that it's up to your child i'd put the father on the birth certificate if he wants involvement in the child's life you have no right to deny that your relationship is just that yours not his and the childs maybe he'll never come around but don't put your child through torture because of your experience with this guy Abortion debate Pregnancy Friends Abortion Fathers' rights Abortion in the United States Breastfeeding In vitro fertilisation Fathers' rights movement in the UK Birth control Divorce Prenatal diagnosis EastEnders Roe v.
