prenatal paternity testing there are possable fathers of my unborn child my boyfriend of years or his friend that i don't remember even sleeping with either way i was wondering where i could find more information about pre natal paternity testing i dont wanna hear don't do it it could harm the baby because at this point im doing what i can to save the baby concidering my boyfriend wants me to get an abortion right away or he'll leave me the thing is i love him more than anything and i can't picture my life without him this is true love for those that say there are pleanty of fish in the sea if i have the baby and its not his he'll leave me my family will disown me i'll be kicked out on the street while trying to finish school i'll be a single mother with no one to support me because the other possable father said he wants nothing to do with it if i did get an abortion i would be doing the baby a favor or atlease if i get a prenatal paternity test things might turn around also days after this incident with the other guy happend the th i had my period for one day it wasnt heavy tho it was just regular but it only lasted a day could this have been inplantation bleeding or whatever its called and my ultrasound estimated that i concieve on the th but this thing with the other guy happend on the th honestly please put yourself in my shoes before you tell me that what im doing is wrong seriously think about what you would do before telling me that im making a huge mistake there is a prenatal paternity test that poses virtually no risk to you or the baby it is relatively new but the results are just as accurate and they do a traditional cheek swab of the baby after birth to further validate the results you the mother go in and give a sample of your blood at any time after weeks of pregnancy the fathers must also give a dna sample either blood hair follicle or buccal cheek swab the only risk associated with this is the normal risks of having blood drawn the lab then takes the mother's blood sample and isolates fetal cells which have been discarded into her blood stream to create a dna profile for the unborn child and compares it to the dna profiles given by the father s the link to one lab that provides this service is http www dnaplus com fetal cell prenatal paternity test htm they are located in california however they can collect samples anywhere in the country i think there are relatively few labs that offer this service as of yet it is also quite expensive that said i have to give my opinion advice in the sense of your boyfriend saying he will leave you if the baby is not his it may be true love or it might just feel like it right now but how are you going to feel if you abort this baby and in the future you are no longer with him a child's love is true love and that child will be there always there is no guarantee at this point that the boyfriend will be also whether the other possible father wants anything to do with the baby or not he will have to support it financially another option is to place the baby for adoption that would really be doing the baby a favor i really wish you and your baby the best Pregnancy Obstetrics Abortion debate Miscarriage Abortion Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cytomegalovirus Childbirth Genealogical DNA test Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Abortion in the United States Roe v.
