we have a very horny cockatiel he has this one toy a ball of fuzz and string that he climbs on and pretends to mate with it my kids the older ones think it's the funniest thing on earth but when the younger kids ask what fargo the bird is doing all i can come up with is he's just playing but the stupid bird does it all the time i tried taking the toy out but then he just sits in the corner of his cage and does nothing he won't sing or eat or anything any ideas on how to fix this problem without getting another female bird well it will be kinda hard to break that habit of his he is probably ready for mating now and if you don't let him mate he will become very stressed out and or depress i've known bird owners that let their birds mate with their hands just so the bird will be at ease and this is true if they don't let the bird mate with their hands the bird will get upset with you and wouldn't want to do anythign with you i guess the bird sees them as their mate anyway best for you to get another female or just let him finish it off with teh toy just make sure the kids aren't around o Hamster The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Spider Kodocha Eric Cartman Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Rich Mullins Shaggy dog story Social rule Garfield One Piece minor characters Falconry Friends Procrastination Dog Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Species Salad Fingers Sexual reproduction Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trailer Park Boys Humphrey Bogart I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Doraemon The Emancipation of Mimi Ultimate Muscle The Angry Beavers Ron and Fez The Adventures of Pete & Pete Sin City Indianapolis 500 Chess strategy and tactics Shawn Michaels Tenshinhan Shit George Costanza Late Night with Conan O'Brien The Marshall Mathers LP Hun-Apu The Human Stain Jackass: The Movie Father's Day (Doctor Who) Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Sesame Street Jon Secada Chess problem Treehouse of Horror V Non-native pronunciations of English Bart Simpson Time Out of Mind El Chavo del Ocho About a Boy South Park The Critic Kakapo Beavis and Butt-head House Mouse Nashville Skyline Liger Charly Garc__a Domestic rabbit Professional wrestling aerial techniques Care Bears Invader Zim Whose Line Is It Anyway?
