mother hen left her nest with her first two new born another egg hatched while she was away what do i do the new chick in the nest is chirping for it s mama but she s to busy walking the other two in the yard plus theres more eggs in the nest ants are starting to come around the nest so worried is there anything i should do and what thank you first of all do not put the mother back with the newly hatched chick this chick is not ready to be put with the others this is so because it is not yet able to get out of the nest and keep up with the mother and her other chicks so if you give it to the mother she will either leave it behind or hurt and passably kill it take the chick and the eggs and keep them in a warm place degrees keep the humidity at this is common so when this happens i get a towel and put it in a bowl i then put a light above it and moderate the temp as the chicks hatch give them chick starter and water to give the newly hatched chicks a boost give them tablespoon of sugar per gallon of water for the first few days of life as soon as the chicks are walking around days old around without any troubles of keeping balance just like the other chicks that are with your hen you know that they are ready to go back to momma a hen will adopt her chicks up to day any older and the mother will know that they are not her chicks do not allow the other hens to get into the nest they most likely will kill the chick when giving the chicks to the mother makes sure that she is not going to harm the chicks to do this it may take up to an hour of just watching her and her chicks good luck also eggs can hatch anywhere from day with chickens if there was an early hatch humidity was to high if it was a later hatch then the humidity was to low so do not throw out the eggs until day also starting with day the eggs are not supposed to be turned so do not fondle with them much Chicken Egg (food) Capercaillie Emu Kakapo Kodocha Sea-Monkey Factory farming 1957 World Series Mercury Atlas 6 Osprey Egg (biology) USS Thresher (SS-200) Bird Friends African Fish Eagle Cannabis cultivation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pittsburgh Steelers Peregrine Falcon Leatherback Sea Turtle Seabird Snake Western Gull The dozens Houseplant Platypus Tilapia American lobster Grunion Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Zerg Breastfeeding Ostrich American Robin Rocko's Modern Life Pysanka Mound-builders Archery Ant Theory of conduct Rhea (bird) Aerial (dance move) March of the Penguins Albatross Flea USS Tunny (SS-282) Cuisine of the Philippines New York Giants Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nile crocodile Piccolo (Dragon Ball) USS Wahoo (SS-238) Soap bubble Shark Emperor Penguin Life in the Freezer Black-footed Albatross Spoonbill Queen bee Tawny Frogmouth Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Roman eating and drinking House Sparrow Gentoo Penguin Poker jargon Chick Hearn Dairy Malleefowl Coffee Jewish cuisine Chris Amon Musk Duck Eggerland series Mercury 4 Bobwhite Quail Mallard Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Omega-3 fatty acid Clownfish The Tomb of the Cybermen Betting (poker) Common Pheasant Haibane Renmei Super Bowl XIV 1919 World Series Sauna Chick Corea Social rule Lake Erie Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Storm-petrel Tenshinhan Bee Gypsy moth Cantonese cuisine San Francisco 49ers Menstrual cycle Sooty albatross Battle of the Bulge
