macaws does anybody know a good breeder in conneticut or new york who has macaws also can you tell me some facts about macaws do you know any good breeders from conneticut and how large does a cage for a macaw have to be i don't know any breeders but go to yahoo search and type in birds for sale that's what i did a two years ago to get my beautiful and year old male macaw othello also i'm from upstate ny macaws are of course very large birds one might cost you anywhere from with the average being around per bird depending on the breeder or wherever you get yours from i got mine in a private sale from the birds for sale site in new jersey southern now cages for these birds are about as well they must be big enough for the bird to walk around in without hitting his tale on the sides cages can be purchased directly online and there are some really good deals on ebay as well ok about macaws they are loud oh are they loud they let out a screetch that could pierce your eardrum especially when they are hungry bored or just want you to come play with them they love company but usually bond to only one family member they are not good with kids and i wouldn't have a cat either mine was raised with dogs and is fine with them when they eat and they eat almost anything but should mostly eat pellets with seeds and peanuts and dried fruits and fresh fruits and veggies also telly gets seeds and pellets in the morning cup then pieces of fruit throughout the day and shares some of my lunch and dinner he gets the veggies and a few tiny pieces of meat they are messy eaters oh heck they are messy period i have heavy plastic the kind of stuff you use in office under your desk chairs under the cage and i top that with newspaper his food he plays with and swishes around in his dish and it goes all over the place be prepared for a lot of vacuuming and mopping oh he will also need a bathroom perch for showers they love to shower with you and a regular perch if you plan on training him because you do not want to train him from his cage my macaw does talk and talk and talk mostly hello barb and what's up it gets annoying sometimes but thank goodness for other rooms in the house he loves to go outside so i take him to the vets to get his wings and claws clipped every about once every months call your local vet to see if they do aviary or they will be able to tell you what local vet will see your bird sexing the bird can be done with dna test blood test sometimes like in my case the bird has already been tested i know he's male he likes his cage left open and he sleeps at night in the dark on top of the cage he is good in the car but nasty to get in his travel cage he likes to bite still trying to teach him not to but old habits are hard to break these birds live to be about so make sure there is someone who will take him should you die telly will go to my son who has grown quite fond of him in recent months telly drinks water and orange juice loves orange juice and loves watermelon and banannas probably most of all and peanuts in the shell i'm constantly sweeping up shells but he is extremely funny and entertaining and most of the time a pure joy oh and he loves to dance to music put music on and he actually does move his feet and wings to the music and bobs his head it's quite comical to watch sometimes he will even whistle to the music although he is slightly off tone deaf i guess remember unless you have a trusted friend who gets used to your bird be prepared to not go anywhere for longer then a day they do not appreciate being alone for too long and mine is quite the watchdog when someone comes in a car he isn't used to he squawks like crazy and paces back and forth on top of his cage if i let the person in the house he is ok but if i just talk to the person from the other side of the screen door telly has a fit thank goodness i live in the country in my own home and away from any neighbors pretty much most of the macaws in the usa that are sold today are from hand raised birds they are not brought out of the wild they have been used to people all their lives yes it can be difficult owning a bird but if you get the right bird and are the right owner then it should be a happy match as long as you remember everything i have told you good and bad ps i've had my bird for almost years now and he has never plucked his feathers at all and last vet check he was in perfect physical condition the vet said i was taking extremely good care of him i have another little parrot that i have had for almost years Domestic rabbit Hamster
