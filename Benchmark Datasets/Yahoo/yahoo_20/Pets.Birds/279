cockatiel kitty i've had my baby boy for years now we had another cat but she passed away from old age she would never touch the bird let him do his own thing now we have another cat than i adopted from a shelter she's only months old she hasn't tried anything seriously with my bird yet but has tried to sneak up on him and watch him real close is there anything i can do other than spray her with water to keep her from actually trying to get him the cat seems more curious than actually trying to hurt him but i still get worried i'm very prtoective of my bird i think your best bet is to not have them around each other you never know if your new cat will attack your bird are your birds wings clipped if they are it is even more dangerous for the bird Pet skunk Glossary of nautical terms Cockatiel Feral cat Mutts Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tweety Bird EastEnders Garfield Ron and Fez Kakapo The Family from One End Street Pet Catwoman Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Shaggy dog story The Inside American Alligator Hamster Shannara creatures Seabird Kodocha Fire fighting Trailer Park Boys Jackass: The Movie Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Rugrats Ferret Breastfeeding Kitten Chinese calendar RuneScape quests Bird Jon Secada Cat Super Mario Bros. television series Boy Meets World Taikyoku shogi The Flintstones Hummingbird Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb B3ta Sin City Philosophy of language Jade Emperor Steamboy Childbirth Timon and Pumbaa Bat The Wotch The Beatles discography Nuclear warfare Hunting Lion Fatboy Slim Sylvester (Looney Tunes) Crazy in Love Phoebe Buffay's songs Piccolo Junior Saga Ranma Saotome Milton H.
