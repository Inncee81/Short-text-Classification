i think my pet birds are fighting a little worried when i was cleaning out their cage and say that they had both lost a feather from their tails which used to be much longer i think they are fighting is this bad and does anyone have any suggestions on what i could do or what this means the a mini parokee's i believe one is a male and the other is a female one of the main reasons why i feel like they were fighting is because when one goes to feed the other makes noises at it and tries to keep it from eating it will sit on top of the food or even try to eat out of the same one at the same time i placed feeding trays in the cage why are they figghting i also got the birds weeks apart so how long have they been together you can always rule the possibility that one of the birds is just a brat i went to the pet store the other day and one blue bird was fighting with all the others birds are just like humans some are simply jerks as far as the feather it depends where you live it could be shedding my birds went through it about a month or two ago but yours could be somewhat different which bird seems to be the most aggressive the one you had first or the other if it is the first one i would guess because it feels like it is rightfully its home and the other bird is intruding try letting them out of their cage as much as you can i have noticed it reduces the fighting of my two birds it helps them get their energy out Bird Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Hamster Dog Breastfeeding Dairy Kakapo Guinea pig Cat Mealy Parrot Tyrannosaurus rex American Alligator Seabird Canary Capercaillie Ferret Moult House Mouse Tarantula Ostrich Albatross Dog training Falconry Livestock Tooth enamel Nile crocodile American lobster John Cage Bird migration Color Red Squirrel RuneScape quests Airport Fasting Gray Wolf Thermoregulation Textile manufacturing Social rule Minor Harry Potter Beasts Garfield Animal communication Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mattress IPod The Birds (film) Emu Egg (food) Deluge (mythology) Spider One Piece minor characters The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Flea Species The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Ron Weasley Hedgehog Blue Jay Stomach cancer Tasmanian Devil Budgerigar Devil Fruit Acne Animal Orca Professional wrestling match types Sesshomaru Kodocha Poker jargon Bird flight Mosquito Trapping House Koala Nutrition Pet skunk Scarlet Macaw Rufous Hummingbird Archaeopteryx Internet troll House Sparrow Bat Eye African Grey Parrot Piccolo Junior Saga Creatures in Bionicle Shark Penguin Password Breath of Fire III Mountain Gorilla Dinosaur Sexual dimorphism Clownfish Leonard Cohen Kashrut American Eskimo Dog Squirrel Sesame Street
