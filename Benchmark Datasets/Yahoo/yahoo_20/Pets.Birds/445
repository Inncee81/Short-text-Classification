question about budgie wing clipping my birds are already tame but don't really play with me when i let them out they usually just fly straight to a curtain rod and stay there or fly around then go back there lol so i was wondering if i got their wings clipped would they be more dependant on me and if i do get their wings clipped will they need to be tamed again is clipping wings very stressful for the birds thank you for your answers in advance clipping their wings will make them more dependent upon you that usually means that they bond to you and become more friendly it also prevents them from getting lost in the event a door or window is found to be open i suggest you get the wings clipped they do not like it but they will hold no grudges against you as for the curtain rod flights you need to show them that they must come to you this can be taught in less than minutes all you need to do is get a long stick broomstick or similar size that will reach up to the curtain rods when the bird flies to the curtain rod chase him off it by placing the stick in front of him as if he is going to step up onto it when he flies to another rod chase him and repeat the stick maneuver keep this up until he gets too tired to fly at which time he will step up onto the stick then bring the stick down gently and have the bird step up onto your finger while you say step up he may fly off again in which case you chase him down and repeat the exercise eventually he will step up onto your finger when he gets tired enough at that time put your other hand up present your finger and say step up you should eventually be able to get him to step up from one hand to the other several times with repeated exercises he will eventually step up on command when you present your finger to him in his cage this is a very valuable command since you can use step up to show the bird that you are in charge if he misbehaves simply make him do several repetitions of step up this is usually all the punishment a bird needs when he misbehaves Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation The Price Is Right Marching band Glossary of American football Revolver Fast bowling Tag Parade (military) Puppet Heinkel He 112 Textile manufacturing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Falconry Glossary of climbing terms Professional wrestling holds Avenue Q B-47 Stratojet Tai shogi International League Apollo 8 STS-114 Archaeopteryx Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mattress Monty Hall problem Radio controlled airplane Professional wrestling throws Avro Arrow 2000 Australian Grand Prix Wa shogi Chopsticks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Timpani Napier's bones Chess terminology G-Man (Half-Life) Shen Gong Wu P-47 Thunderbolt Cessna T-37 M16 (rifle) The Time Machine Carpal tunnel syndrome Paragliding Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Boxing RuneScape Random Events Scientology beliefs and practices Dog agility The Empty Child Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Space Shuttle Columbia disaster NASCAR Softball Creatures in Bionicle Russian joke Bat The Ashlee Simpson Show Ko shogi Violin Poker jargon Inspector Gadget Rugby union positions Repetitive strain injury Chicken Non-native pronunciations of English Wright brothers Obedience training Volleyball Royal Assent 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Theodicy Professional wrestling match types The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Weight training The Shining (film) Double the Fist The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Menstrual cup Stuttering Blonde on Blonde Trapping Taikyoku shogi Tai Chi Chuan Welding The Subtle Knife Dai shogi Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Aikido GunZ The Duel John Cage Knight Rider Haibane Renmei One Ring
