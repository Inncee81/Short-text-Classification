four baby birds are outside on my porch and i believe that the mother has abandoned them what can i do to take care of them i feel sorry for them is there somebody i can call or is there a way for me to take care of them myself if the babies have most of their feathers they are fledglings baby birds fledge leave the nest several days before they can fly they need time to hop around on the ground climb low branches and exercise their wings until they have strengthened them enough for flight the parent birds continue to feed and care for the fledglings until they are self sufficient if they are fledglings leave them where you found them the parents are probably just gathering food for them leave the area because the parents think of you as a predator and will not come back to their babies if you are visible if they do not have many feathers yet and you think they are still nestlings try to find the nest and place the birds back in the nest do not worry that you have touched them birds do not have an acute sense of smell the parent birds will not detect your scent on the babies and will not reject them wildlife biologists and bird banders handle baby birds all the time with thier bare hands and the parents never reject the babies if you can not find the nest and place the birds back contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the baby birds yourself there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species Breastfeeding Kakapo Hamster Albatross Seabird Chicken Bird Falconry Capercaillie Pet skunk Bird migration Cat Hunting Peafowl Mealy Parrot Bird ringing Dinosaur Bat Condor Species Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Platypus Livestock 613 mitzvot H5N1 Acorn Extinction Terri Schiavo Ant Dog Ivory-billed Woodpecker Insulin Bird flight Hedgehog Airport Red Squirrel Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Fancy rat Mosquito Insect Dodo Comanche Gliding Foie gras Agriculture Gray Wolf Genetically modified food Ostrich Tetrapod Tasmanian Devil Vegetarianism Diabetes mellitus Fox hunting Orca Animal communication Trapping Peregrine Falcon Saruman RuneScape quests Animal testing Infantilism Hemp Rock Dove Weight training Archaeopteryx European Magpie Tyrannosaurus rex Trademark Nurse Shark Imprinting (psychology) Shrimp farm Peanut Domesticated turkey Insurance Honeybee Vermicompost Heinkel He 112 Canary Gas metal arc welding Egg (food) Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 Mid-levels Apple Prostate cancer Hummingbird Nile crocodile Pterosaur Animal rights Childbirth
