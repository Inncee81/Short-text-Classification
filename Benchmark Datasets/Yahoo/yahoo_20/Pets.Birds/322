budgies parakeets i want a budgie but i am trying to decide if they make good pets i think they do because they are the most popular type of bird and people wouldn't buy them if they weren't good pets right i know most of them don't learn to talk but can whistle and learn other tricks but i want to know if they are easy to train make great pets and where to buy them from thanks budgies are great pets believe me i have one you are correct they are the most popular companion bird and for a reason males can be great talkers if you teach them but their voices may be hard to hear yeah they can whistle and do some tricks they are easy to train if you work diligently and if you research their behavior well you can buy them at pet stores for about thats what i did but a better route you can take is to buy a hand fed one from a breeder it may cost more but they are usually more tame Dog training Conure Pet Sounds Dog Domestic rabbit Pet Hamster Parrot Bird The Pet Sounds Sessions Canary Dog agility Cockatiel Shaggy dog story Stuttering Falconry Obedience training Carolina Parakeet Surveillance Guinea pig Havanese Plum-headed Parakeet Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cognitive science The Beatles Contract bridge Aladdin (1992 film) Pet skunk Neopets Microchip implant (animal) German Shepherd Dog Non-native pronunciations of English Discus (fish) Companion dog Humphrey Bogart Hunter (World of Warcraft) Time Out of Mind Scientology beliefs and practices Alexander Technique Theory of conduct Clicker training Mel Blanc Pet store Whistle Kender Great Teacher Onizuka Eric Cartman Skateboarding trick Vocal range Hearing impairment Monk Parakeet Ferret Monster Rancher monsters Tai Chi Chuan Friends Snake charming Gerald Durrell Social rule Garfield Zoo Married... with Children Deflation (economics) Final Fantasy XI MapleStory Alexandrine Parakeet RuneScape quests Mojave people House Mouse Working dog Craps Chocobo Domestic goat Cat Senegal Parrot Complexity classes P and NP Toy train NetHack Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lisa the Vegetarian Animal Farm Mutual fund Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Weimaraner The Birds (film) Socialization Sheepshead Aikido Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Exotic pet YuYu Hakusho Animal cognition One Piece minor characters Border Collie Rat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kevin and Kell Guild Wars Pet rock Language
