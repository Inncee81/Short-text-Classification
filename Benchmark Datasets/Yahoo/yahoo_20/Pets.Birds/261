pregnant and have birds is it ok please read i just recently moved and i feel happy but i feel sad i was living with my parents and i couldnt take it anymore i am about months pregnant and i have birds parakeets and i feel so sad that i cant take them with me my bf keep telling me that you cant have a newborn with pets and it really hurt me because i had one of my birds for over years and the other for about years its hard to part with them i just wonder if it is true that i cant have my birds there with me i love them to death and this move is such bitter sweet you certainly can have pets even with a newborn in fact some studies show children who grow up with pets in the home have less chance of developing allergies the only pet concern is with cats and with those its a matter of who cleans the litterbox due to toxoplasmosis while it won't hurt the mother it could affect an unborn child so if you were to have cats someone else would need to clean the litterbox for you go get your birds Toxoplasmosis Cat Pregnancy Knots Landing Kodocha Pitaten Melanie Wilkes Ferret Guinea pig Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pet Breastfeeding The Fairly OddParents Ranma __ characters Peter Pan Abortion debate Ron Weasley Friends Miscarriage Neighbours College Roomies from Hell!!!
