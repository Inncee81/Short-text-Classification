is my mourning dove sick okay today i was out in my front yard giving away some troublesome toads i'd caught to the neighborhood kids when a couple little girls came rushing to me asking me for help they had found a baby bird and knowing me i went to investigate well the bird had been in water and from first glance i recognized it as a common mourning dove i took it home and dried it off making sure it had a nice warm place to sleep i filled a box with peices of cloth and very soft guinea pig bedding afterwards i did some research i found that this bird was old enough to fly it was just to ill to do so and so i began to watch over it the birds droppings are a very light yellow color and rather runny which indicated that the bird was either suffering from anorexia or liver problems i tried feeding it but the bird wouldn't stomach the slurry or any of the other foods i provided the bird also had a big open sore on his face so i gauzed it does anyone know what's wrong with it contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the bird yourself first off if it is suffering from liver problems it needs medical attention that you are not qualified to give furthermore there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species Hamster Chicken Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Falconry Fancy rat Bird H5N1 Kakapo Albatross Common cold Seabird Foie gras Anorexia nervosa Capercaillie Pet skunk Hedgehog Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Mealy Parrot Hemp Dog Insulin Animal testing Livestock RuneScape quests Hunting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Orca Terri Schiavo Tetrapod Poker jargon Obesity Kashrut Diabetes mellitus Spider Dinosaur Vegetarianism Stomach cancer Acorn Trapping Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Genetically modified food Nurse Taikyoku shogi Mattress Ferret Urinary incontinence Tofu Peanut Dog agility Salad Fingers Medicine Dairy Fugu Drowning Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Decompression sickness Tsetse fly Vermicompost Elephant Gray Wolf Species Fasting Archery Nuclear power Characters of Naruto Sleep Bat Health insurance Garfield Peafowl Airport Prostate cancer Dieting Dodo Shrimp farm First aid Swimming Pysanka Bird ringing Insurance Professional wrestling aerial techniques Apple Chocobo Tomato Peregrine Falcon
