button quail help i have a pair of button quail and have had them for or months at first they were really skiddish and whenever someone came in the room they'd run in their house now they have adapted well and dont get so scared when someone enters the room but they are not tame i gave up on trying to tame them a long time ago my problem now is that they dont have any eggs they hade one a long time ago after that not one egg has been seen what can i do to encourage them to lay eggs i am sure they are mail and female they get about hours of direct sunlight through glass this is probably not enough huh i read that they need hours of sun to lay eggs is this hours of direct sun rays or just hours of lighting thanks for your assistance whoever has the most in depth responce gets best answer the male is normal colored blackish blue with carcoal grey wings and dark dusty red underside the female is all white i am sure that the white one is a female because the blue one is a male for sue he has a white bib under his mouth thats proof isnt it and i saw an egg they live in a home made cage made from an up side down desk and some wire mesh they seem happy but dont lay eggs they always sleep and rest right next to eachother like together their cage is progagly sqaure feet or more layerd with cedar shavings i give them meal worms a giant sand box finch seeds and millet spray it's hours of lighting it doesn't need to be direct sunlight and actually you wouldn't want it to be because they'd probably overheat and die are they indoor birds or outdoor birds there isn't much incentive to reproduce if there's only feet of room to begin with are you entirely sure they're male and female do you have any pictures what color variety are they with normals and really most varieties besides the pale colors it's pretty easy to distinguish the two are they related if they are whatever you do don't breed them and if they are this could be part of the reason they're not readily humping make sure that whatever enclosure you have them in has lots and lots of cover when i had button quail i bought a whole assortment of fake real potted plants to put in the pen a friend's father constructed a coop of sorts for all of them for them to seek shelter under if the bottom of the enclosure is solid make sure you have it covered with mulch or something similar if it's wire bottomed you need to put something inside that has mulch bedding of some sort i found that with mine they would most often lay their eggs in a small depression scooped out by the female inside of a small cat crate i'd placed inside with shavings on the inside of it the only thing was my birds were very young and not really 'breeding ' they were just laying as a product of being hens so they would sometimes also just lay a random egg here and there it could be that your birds are just too young in combination with not being exposed to proper conditions suitable for breeding also make sure they have a constant supply of fresh food and water not just pellet food offer them vegetables mealworms etc etc the more variety in their diet the healthier they'll be the more willing they'll be to try to bring more birds into the environment Chicken Domestic rabbit Fancy rat RuneScape quests Egg (food) Poker jargon Cat Solar power Mattress Livestock Coffee Trapping Mealy Parrot Shark Platypus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Canary Kakapo Vermicompost Mouse (computing) Theory of conduct Minor Harry Potter Beasts Professional wrestling match types Tea Pet skunk Earthworm Ferret Seabird Cannabis cultivation Sea-Monkey Dog Pysanka Equine conformation Discus (fish) Aquarium Gypsy moth Christmas tree Roman eating and drinking Fish farming Spider Japanese cuisine Lighting FoxTrot The Time Machine Color Albatross Plastic Anopheles Hemp Vegetarianism Diseases of the honeybee Mulch Weed control Energy development Mid-levels Egg (biology) Ostrich Bread Brewery Pansy Domestication Cantonese cuisine Biological pest control Hamburger Veganism Sears Holdings Corporation Honeybee Opportunity rover Carnivorous plant Ron and Fez Chlorophyta Tofu Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Anchor Kitchen Salmon Shen Gong Wu Tetrapod The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Sento Sun Domestic AC power plugs and sockets EastEnders Futurama (TV series - season 5) Goldfish Domesticated turkey Sunlight Geology of the Grand Canyon area Houseplant
