should a female parakete chew wood and if so can she be pregnante hi i have a male and female parakeet my female parakeet chews on her perch that is made wood i dont know if she is or is not pregnant if not how can i direct her towards something else to do thanks so much birds will chew wood and there is pretty much nothing you can do about it that is simply part of their nature and in time they will most likely reduce the perch and anything else to dust it is good for them to have something wood to chew on as they need activity i would suggest you get them a few small toys say one or two with wood pieces in it she might focus her attention to the toys if she likes them you can replace the perch with a small concrete perch which are virtually indestructible her chewing doesn't mean she is about to lay an egg though Hamster Plastic Fancy rat Dog training Falconry Chewing gum Theory of conduct Tuatara Wood Duck Extreme Programming Chew Valley Lake Budgerigar Chinchilla Tobacco Pregnancy Wood Kodocha Upholstery USS Chew (DD-106) River Chew Parrot Team Fortress Classic Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Gypsy moth Ivory-billed Woodpecker Table saw Charles Manson Atomic Kitten Spider Sexual dimorphism Mealy Parrot Airport Rose-ringed Parakeet Kangaroo Incarnations of Immortality Topps Gender role Conure Parthenogenesis Cock (chicken) Golden Perch Kiwi The Spy Who Loved Me Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Kosher foods Sexual reproduction Kakapo Carolina Parakeet Lake Burley Griffin Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Aztec Narnia Hentai Passerine Paper wasp Ferret Damien Hirst Monk Parakeet Evidence of evolution Vitamin C Platypus Archery Angling Textile manufacturing Kasparov versus The World Wind turbine Lionel Corporation Soul Ostrich Alexandrine Parakeet My Life as a Teenage Robot Mojave people Salad Fingers Peafowl Torii Egg (food) EastEnders Sake Dragons (Pern) Plum-headed Parakeet Polyvinyl chloride Extinct birds African Fish Eagle Seismic retrofit Tooth enamel Tooth Casting Cocaine Banjo-Tooie Kaliyan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nicotine gum Strap-on dildo Teen Girl Squad Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Chicken Bird Wood fuel
