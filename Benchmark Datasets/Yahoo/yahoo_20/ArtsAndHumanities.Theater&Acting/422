play audition director problem question i have an audition for fiddler on the roof next week i'm and a female with blonde hair hazel eyes ' and medium built i want the role of fruma sarah the director doesn't like me and after being cast in one of her shows she refuses to cast me i any others i was told she hinks i make other actors uncomfortable i don't mean to but i have bipolar disorder so maybe that's it how can i let her see past her judgments and give me a part this time hmm that is a tough one if you have an opportunity to speak with her before the audition not on the day of the audition as she will be too busy simply say what you stated here sometimes a little direct communication and an apology can go a long way it is really important to prove that you can leave your personal issues at the door or you will develop an unfavorable reputation in the theatrical community hopefully you can show her you are sincere and just do your best at the audition Drama Empathy Giuseppe Verdi Theatre Clinical depression Clown Saudade Revolutionary Girl Utena Luck Darth Vader Team Rocket Suffering Emotion T'Pol Bhajan Peter Pan Scenes from a Memory Tragedy Doctor (Doctor Who) Our Friends in the North Undergrads Vladimir Peter Tytla Vanilla Ninja Force (Star Wars) Dragnet (drama) Pitaten The Practice Obsessive-compulsive disorder Theodicy Friedrich Schleiermacher Daria Grunge music Meaning of life Metallica (album) The Good Soldier Fasting Das Lied von der Erde Inherit the Wind Karma Play One Tree Hill (TV series) Queer as Folk (U.S.) Carmen Machinima Krelian Tlingit The Talented Mr. Ripley Canon (fiction) Philip Massinger Alignment (role-playing games) Teen Girl Squad Baise-moi Anxiety Tim Buckley Time Out of Mind Social psychology Galaxy Angel Grief Gollum Padm__ Amidala Happiness Emotions (album) Vsevolod Meyerhold BBC television drama About Schmidt Martian Successor Nadesico Binge eating disorder Glen Jacobs Bernard Williams Comedy Steve Urkel Religion Crossing Jordan One Life to Live Vittorio Alfieri Atmosphere (band) Biblical poetry Strong Sad Cordelia Chase Infantilism Pip (South Park episode) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
