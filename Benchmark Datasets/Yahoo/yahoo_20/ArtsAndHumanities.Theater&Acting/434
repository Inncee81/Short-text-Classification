how do you begin acting how do i begin my acting career with no experience in steps please i normally don't answer questions like this anymore because people post about of them each day but yours is very so simple so i will the first thing you need to do is get experience when it comes time for you to take the step to get an agent you will need to be able to show your resume a list of all your experience and you will need a lot of experience on it i always recommend theater as a place to start out because it gives you not only credits that look very good on a resume but also valuable experience as an actor if you can perform live with no problem then everything else is a piece of cake all the best actors get their start in theater and ones that didn't often wish they had so find your local community theater call them and audition for the next play they put on if you are in school join the drama club or the school play once you feel you have enough experience on your resume this can be anywhere from to or years it took me you call up an agent and set up an appointment to join agents are like middle men when a company wants to make a commercial movie etc they notify agencies which in turn tell the actors that they employ this is necessary because it would obviously be impossible for a company to notify each individual actor and just so you know agents do not seek out and discover talent like some people sometimes say you have to contact them and you never have to pay an agent agency anything they only make money when they get you work only then do they get to take of the money you make so if an agent ever asks you for money up front turn around and leave becoming a professional actor takes time but it pays off just make sure you get a good start Adolescence Teen Titans (animated series) Saved by the Bell Child sexuality Ageing Child Emo Rocko's Modern Life Our Gang Economic inequality Alias (TV series) Child pornography That '70s Show Modelling agency Teen Girl Squad Lindsay Lohan Kodocha Springfield (The Simpsons) Everwood Codename: Kids Next Door Baby Blues American Idol EastEnders Casino Royale (2006 film) Malcolm in the Middle The Empty Child TLC Determinism Fight Club Galaxy Quest Charmed Infantilism Knots Landing Soap opera Shawn Michaels Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Motion picture rating system Hilary Duff Fictional crossover Toronto Blue Jays Sydney Bristow Kimberly-Clark Corporation Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome Television in the United States Halliburton Driver's license Toonami The Inside Independence Party (Iceland) Full House Humphrey Bogart Mind Over Murder Back to the Future Ephebiphobia Principal-agent problem Recurring South Park characters Oakland Athletics New Kids on the Block Mulholland Drive (film) Dallas Cowboys History of SNL:1980-1985 Beavis and Butt-head Extras (sitcom) Outsourcing Age of consent Younger versions of cartoon characters Plame affair Tara Lipinski Lacey Chabert Oldsmobile Cutlass Entropy The Sims 2: University The Suite Life of Zack and Cody Free market Boy band Invincible (comic) Dallas Area Rapid Transit Eric Bischoff Secretar__a de Inteligencia WNNX (FM) Little Britain Parminder Nagra Deadpool Inflation Open cluster Pitaten Sant Thakar Singh Survivor (novel) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Kristin Kreuk Robert Clark (actor) It's Walky!
