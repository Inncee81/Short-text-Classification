what is a good way to get noticed in showbiz i've always been intrested but i dont know how to start im even okay with being even a movie extra win america's got talent but seriously extra work will not get you noticed but anyone can be an extra in film and television unlike actors extras do not have agents who take a percent commission you simply register with extras casting companies and call in each day on their casting lines to get work unless you hire a booking service for about a month to call in and get you the work of course these calling or booking services really do not call in to get you the work they simply know people at the extras casting companies and get lists of what they need and act as sub casting agents think about it why would the extras casting company individually call each and every person when they can just call a booking service and say we need people for a party scene then the booking service does all the work and calls each of their clients themselves sag is trying to regulate these companies at some point but the fact remains that these services can get you much more work than you can on your own just calling in on the casting lines all day trying to get through the busy signals the screen actors guild does have jurisdiction over backround actors however the contracts only require a small number of union extras to be hired for a given union production and the rest of the extras are non union this is part of the contract that production companies sign with the union there is a publication called extra work for brain surgeons it truly is the bible of extra work i am not one to try to sell books for anyone but i am in the know about this subject central casting in the biggest extras casting company followed by bill dance casting you simply register with these places and then you work there is a huge amount of work for non union extras and just a small amount of union extra work as a matter of fact one can work every day as a non union extra but if you are a sag member it is much harder to get union extra jobs this is because a given tv show for example only has to hire union extras and the rest can be non union if you sign up with a booking service or calling service as they like to call themselves you can literally work every day but the pay is not much more than minimum wage for non union although overtime is usually the norm as well as wardrobe allowance and sometimes mileage allowance you also can get paid extra for using your car pet or props in a scene there are many sag members secretly doing non union extra work simply because there just is not enough union extra jobs to go around you must live in la of course get a thomas guide map book and have a cell phone and a car but if you do your homework you literally can work every day no matter your experience or looks you can be young or old tall or short overweight or underweight some one armed dude or whatever there is plenty of work to go around and hollywood needs all types of people you don't even need headshots or a resume they take a digital photo when you register with all of those extras casting companies just stick with the legit companies there is a nominal or so fee to register even sag member have to pay a photo fee to register so there it is don't take bad advice just register with the big extras casting companies and follow the rules of working as a fim tv extra as i said i am not out to sell that book you can do some research and find out all you need but be careful as there are tons of bottom feeders scamming people who want to work in film tv as extras if you are lucky you can even become sag eligible from doing non union extra work but that is a whole other long story here is a link to hollywoodos the company that publishes that book extra work for brain surgeons http hollywoodos com index php option com content task blogcategory id itemid peace out alan ps aftra american federation of television and radio
