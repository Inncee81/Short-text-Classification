question about rent the musical why does roger call benny's wife muffy benny corrects him and says alison which is her real name i have seen rent many many times and still don't know why i also searched everywhere on google and can't find the reason roger calls her muffy and with an affected accent because he's making fun of the fact that benny married into a upper class wasp ish family mark and roger felt abandoned by benny because he used to be one of them before he married into money which is a point of contention throughout the show muffy along wth other names such as bunny or biff is a very old school wasp y name so he uses it to highlight the class difference Charmed Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Whose Line Is It Anyway?
