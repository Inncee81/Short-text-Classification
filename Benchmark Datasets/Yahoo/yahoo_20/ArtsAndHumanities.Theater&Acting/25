how do i get an agent if you have one plz tell me how you got one i really need an agent ive tooken classes and im really serious about acting talent agents for actors come in two main types theatrical television and film and commercial for commercials there are also dance print and voice over agents who specialize in these fields and signing with one of these agents can be a great way for actors with these other skills to cross over into one of the other areas being with the same agency for everything is called being signed across the board but many actors prefer to have separate agents for different types of work become some agencies might be strong commercially but not as strong theatrically or vice versa agents get information about auditions for roles either directly from casting directors and producers calling them asking for client submissions or from a fax email service called the breakdowns a daily list of roles being cast sent only to agents and managers although there is a black market for this information within the acting community and many actors without representation self submit for available roles which some casting people don't mind others hate and the owner of breakdown services abhors remember actors your agents work for you but they only get of what you make so that means you need to do of the work especially when you are getting started that means always be professional know your craft don't shy away from networking and letting cd producers and directors know about your accomplishments upcoming appearances by sending out postcards know your type and how you fit into the current market and above all make sure you and your agent are on the same page about what kinds of parts you will be submitted for and never pay an agent or manager up front to represent you they only make money when they make you money the plan of attack most agents refuse any off the street drop ins in other words they'll see new talent by appointment only don't bother phoning in for one just yet because without a face you're just another voice and unless that voice is absolutely incredible and the agent handles a lot of voice over work it simply won't get you in instead mail off your photo and resume along with a very special cover letter what makes that letter so special simple prove that you understand how valuable their time is so many people try cramming in their whole hopes and dreams autobiography into the cover letter it resembles a chapter from a novel the agent hasn't the time nor the interest to be a publisher any submission that takes more than seconds to scan through and read will likely be filed in the trash here's a sample of how to keep it short wannabe talent hopeful avenue dreamland bc attn ms a gent please accept my photos and resume for possible consideration of future representation i will contact your offices next week to verify your receipt of this package thank you very much for your time johnny smartguy that's it nothing else just plain and simple the agent even has seconds left to take a quick glance at your photo s and stats now the big trick comes the following week give it a full week before

very much for your time pause they'll either be impressed and relieved at the short conversation or they'll be caught so off guard that they'll try to explain further if they haven't said goodbye then just repeat a variation of your previous words always offering them the opportunity to end the conversation and reinforcing that you know their time is valuable they're so used to the can i come in pleading that you've really thrown them for a loop by not asking them for something call the better business bureau to see if any complaints have been made against the agency tips warnings agents
