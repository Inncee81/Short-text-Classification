what not to clean your camera lens with what are some things most people would think is good to clean thier camera lens with but isnt good first of all it's prudent to try to never have to clean your lens i accept though that this is impossible with a p s camera however with an slr you can buy a uv filter for the lens which will protect the lens for its entire life secondly when you do have to clean a lens the first most important thing to do is blow it clean with a blower brush simply setting about cleaning it with a cloth can cause all manner of problems if there happens to be a little speck of sand or other abrasive material on the lens surface you could scratch the lens only after you blow it clean is it a good idea to start to use a cloth that said i agree with ben h in his recommendations methyl alcohol available at most hardware stores usually gets rid of most problems when a simple wipe of the micro fibre cloth doesn't work now don't coat the lens with the alcohol if that stuff gets inside the lens it can also disolve some of the grease and cause the lens to jam instead place a drop or two in the middle of the lens and work outwards with your cloth in a circular motion his windex comment is a bit unorthodox i'll admit and should be a last resort solution but it does work i've not had a fungus problem so i can't comment if it works on fungus or not though i suspect it does however one problem i've had often comes from the seaside i don't have a clue what the chemistry of the air is along the ocean but i've often found a real goo coating my uv filter trying to clean it dry doesn't work it simply smears things worse often alcohol also doesn't work you're just smearing the goo around more in those situations i've found the windex to work really well too it seems to disolve that goo more thoroughly and leaves you with a lens in pristine condition once more however unlike my earlier advice in this case you need a different technique first of all in this case you're trying to dissolve a coating of guck that accumulated from the air a couple of drops isn't going to do that i'd place several drops on the lens again making sure they stay in the middle and then i'd gently work from the centre to the outside of the lens in a circular fashion the stress is on gently because you will have salt crystals mixed in with the goo that can scratch the lens so what you're trying to do on the first pass is disolve them and get rid of them keep in mind when you do this that you are also contaminating your cloth if you use the same spot on the cloth in the next cleaning you'll simply smear the goo back on the lens so the second time you do this use a different part of the cloth or better yet another cloth usually after three or four attempts the lens will come clean once you've done that it's a good idea to thoroughly clean your cloth under warm running water to get rid of all the residue then hang it out to dry and when dry it's ready for the next time another answer is to visit your local camera shop many still carry a lens cleaning fluid which usually works on lenses the only problem is that this stuff is usually more expensive than the other solutions on the positive side though if you bought a couple of those bottles once they're empty you can use one for the alcohol and the other for the windex this way you'll have these with you in your camera kit wherever you go i hope that helps a little Textile manufacturing Bong Dry cleaning Movie projector Opportunity rover Hard disk Sewage treatment Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) Diseases of the honeybee Water Floppy disk Digital photography Lens (optics) Brazing Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Hydrogen peroxide Drag racing Glass Water purification Leica Breastfeeding Nuclear weapon design Menstrual cup Plastic Fecal incontinence Motor oil View camera Photographic lens Upholstery Fire extinguisher Electrophysiology Glasses Photography Thermal power station Sunglasses E85 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Vinegar Stereoscopy Spirit rover Hamster Nuclear fallout Carburetor Ceramics Carbon dioxide Modem Dialysis Urinary incontinence Mattress Tag Polarization Apollo 8 The Apprentice 2 Syphon Filter Scientology beliefs and practices Swimming pool Microeconomics CPU design Sulfuric acid Wood Alcoholics Anonymous Traumatic incident reduction Decompression sickness Violin Automatic number plate recognition Ammonia Arcade cabinet Gramophone record Dairy Soul Computer virus Japanese tea ceremony Sun Mach kernel Digital camera Otitis externa Internal ballistics Hemp Cheating in poker The Inside LSD The Smoking Room Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Soldering Disinfection Fluorescent lamp Glacier Leather DVD Diving suit
