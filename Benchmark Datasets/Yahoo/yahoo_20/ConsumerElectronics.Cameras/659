how many pixels does a digital camera need to be equivalent to a good mm film camera i want to make big prints from the images with roll film in a mm camera i am happy going to x assuming lenses etc are the same on the digital camera and the roll film one how many pixels will give the same definition i think it is worth coming at this another way if you want to print a x poster at dpi you will need a resolution of mp this is calculated as x x x x if you are prepared to reduce the printing resolution to dpi you will need mp for a print this size it is probably reasonable to use this lower printing resolution as viewers will need to be some distance away scanned at dpi a mm film will give you mp the film is an analogue storage mechanism so whether this is realistic is an entirely different matter however there seems to be little point in making dpi scanners if there weren't real quality gains to be made in scanning film at this higher resolution that said i agree with the comment that this is quite a large enlargement from mm for most consumer grade film you will not be getting anything like the equivalent of mp and the suggestion that around mp is possible might even be a stretch at this resolution you would be effectively only printing at about dpi if you enlarged to x note that i haven't done this last calculation exactly Digital photography Dots per inch Pixel Digital camera Anamorphic widescreen High-definition television Digital cinema Aspect ratio (image) View camera Digital camera back Stereoscopy Television Digital video Camera Video Medium format Dot matrix printer Widescreen Konica Minolta Digital image editing Raster graphics Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital cinematography Autostereogram Circle of confusion Panoramic photography Mouse (computing) Photographic lens Depth of field Photographic film Movie projector Moir__ pattern Charge-coupled device Geographic information system Liquid crystal display Holography Anti-aliasing Optical coherence tomography Digital television Camcorder Image file formats Cinematography Magnetic resonance imaging Rendering (computer graphics) Fax Ebook Dither Laserdisc Gamma ray burst Binoculars Clementine mission Schneider Kreuznach Pinhole camera 8 mm video format Motion capture Inflation Microscope Windows Vista Computed tomography Killian documents Typeface Portable Document Format Halftone MP3 Color printing Computer animation Digital art Eyepiece Digital 2003 UB313 Gamut Tagged Image File Format Leica Single-lens reflex camera Traditional animation Astronomical seeing Nikon Corporation Analog-to-digital converter Motion picture terminology Pan and scan DVD Atari 8-bit family PNG Advanced Photo System Zoom lens Regular polytope Enterprise content management Microeconomics Film preservation Aberration in optical systems DV Digital circuit Big Bang Compact disc
