olympus camera warentee ok i have the olympus fe it kinda fell now something inside it is blocking the lense so you cant take pics but the camera itself still works when your not taking pictures does the warentee still apply i've had my camera less than a year if that helps thanks wow your camera works for everything but taking pictures then well that's the most important feature of a camera so you would need to get it fixed or replaced you will need to check your warranty papers to see how long the warranty is but they don't usually cover damage from dropping so you will need to pay for the repair how much did your camera cost new if it's a small pocket camera you will honestly be better off just replacing it with a new one and being more careful with the replacement i checked and it's a camera with a day warranty sorry you need a new one Canon T90 Photography Single-lens reflex camera Digital photography Warranty Road-rule enforcement camera View camera Camera Screenplay Solar eclipse Konica Minolta Endoscopy Olympus (company) Product liability Photographic lens Cinematography Rangefinder camera Film Implied warranty Oscilloscope Escape from New York Digital single-lens reflex cameras Stereoscopy Schneider Kreuznach Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure Canon EOS Macro photography Surveillance Pinhole camera Panoramic photography Shutter speed Apple Computer Goatse.cx Depth of field Grey market Secure Digital card Binoculars Mars Leasehold estate Movie camera The Amazing Race Universal Serial Bus Hubble Space Telescope High-definition television Computer virus Gramophone record GunZ The Duel Four Thirds System Movie projector Auto insurance Apollo 8 Mars Exploration Rover Digital camera Ranger program Technicolor Toyota Prius Assignment (law) Papal election Open access The Daleks' Master Plan Land Rover Health insurance Automatic number plate recognition IPod Poker jargon Tamper resistance Point and shoot camera XD-Picture Card Parallax Pentax Full frame digital SLR Nikon Corporation Digital camera back London Congestion Charge Karl Rove Sony CPU cache Tire Digital cinematography Master of Olympus - Zeus Leica Laserdisc Copyleft Zire Handheld Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Filmmaking Traditional animation Cinerama Closed-circuit television Texas hold 'em Betting (poker) Underwater photography Ocean's Twelve Knife Canon EOS-300D Haibane Renmei Panavision STS-61 Steadicam
