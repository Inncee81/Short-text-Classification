is this a good lens for a starter user http jessops com store s lenses sigma mm f and dg macro canon af details aspx issearch y pageindex catid comp n i want to be able to do some pretty close up macro shots on plants and stuff as well as normal photos i have a kit lens aswell but no macro is this a good lens for what i want to do it's going to be attached to a canon eos d rebel xt thanks im so amateur that i cant tell if this is actually compatible with my camera stated above before i order it is it compatible with my camera thanks again yes the lens is compatible with your camera so it should work ok as to the macro setting what this means is that the lens is capable of going closer to the subject than is normally expected of a telephoto however this lens only goes down to what that means in english is that the best you can do with it is get your subject onto your sensor in half life size if you're into doing flowers and things of that size you'll love the lens it will achieve those scales providing you with really nice macro shots on the other hand if you're into doing tiny things like small insects one of my specialities this lens will not do it for that you want a lens that goes down to life size basically you want to be able to render the subject the same size on the sensor as it is in real life for that capability you would need a true macro lens what's also nice about this lens is that you can stand well back from your subject many shorter macro lenses have you crawling up to your subject sometimes within millimetres this one give you a great working distance but you may have to also consider a tripod when you use it in macro work you want to close down your lens as much as possible to optomize depth of field but that then leads to slower shutter speeds the size and weight of the lens makes it unlikely you'll be able to hand hold all of your shots and an added bonus too the lens is also a nice range for general work and wildlife so it will probaly make you happy for quite a number of years in terms of quality you get what you pay for sigma makes good lenses so it' s not a bad lens at all it will five you sharp images and good contrasts and it's unlikely there will be any optical distortions but it is also rather slow at f f for example i have i have a fixed length macro that is mm and has a maximum aperture of f those extra stops sometimes make the difference between getting the picture or not when the lighting is poor however my lens in pounds cost around pounds which is of course a wee bit more than you're looking at i'd say go for the lens and enjoy it later as you get more sophisticated you may end up replacing it but by then you'll also know why you want to spend the money and you'll consider it good value at that time and until then you'll have a lot of outstanding pictrues that you can be proud of i hope that helps a little Canon T90 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Eyepiece Depth of field Stereoscopy Leica Cinematography Binoculars Canon EOS Aperture Contax F-number Konica Minolta Canon EF lens mount Zoom lens Reflecting telescope Canon FD Street photography Panoramic photography Nikon Corporation Rangefinder camera Camcorder Digital camera Movie projector Aberration in optical systems Photographic film Bokeh Amateur astronomy IMAX Floppy disk Pinhole camera Telescope Canon T70 Film speed Mouse (computing) Fast bowling Radar Eye Schneider Kreuznach Lens (optics) Widescreen Microscope Hubble Space Telescope Antenna (radio) Parallax Bicycle lighting Galileo spacecraft Normal distribution Internal ballistics Shutter (photography) Microeconomics Digital camera back Four Thirds System Clementine mission Explosive material Tank Atari 8-bit family 2000 Australian Grand Prix DVD Ammunition Autostereogram M16 (rifle) Automatic number plate recognition Gamma ray burst Enlarger Nintendo Revolution Advanced Photo System Autofocus Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Sensor GunZ The Duel Geographic information system Bluetooth Insurance Exposure (photography) Drag racing Equine conformation General relativity Technicolor Canon PowerShot G Terminal ballistics Star Trek Customizable Card Game Panavision PlayStation Portable Macro Oscilloscope Cinerama Traffic light
