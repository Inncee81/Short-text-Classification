which is better canon powershot a or sony dsc w i like how canon a has the vari angle lcd screen and i like how sony comes in blue it looks nicer and is more smaller which is cheaper which is better in battery has anyone had both canon a a vs sony dsc w advantages for the canon include the a is mp instead of mp which is really only a slight advantage but it gives more detail in enlargements the a is also mp but the canon sensor is twice as big as the sony which makes for sharper pictures with less digital noise the canon zooms to an equivalent of mm instead of mm which is a significant difference much greater range of shutter speeds on the slow end higher flash output and ability to add external flash aperture priority shutter speed priority and total manual control none of which are offered by the sony uses cheaper more commonly available sd memory cards quality levels instead of probably no big deal frames per second limited by your card size and speed while the sony only goes fps and is limited to shots flip out and twist monitor opens up some real possibilities for creative point of view in your pictures uses aa batteries which are available everywhere if your rechargeable batteries die the a is well known as one of the best cameras for battery longevity though advantages for the sony include higher iso if it is really useable uses li ion batteries which are supposed to last longer than aa batteries but see my note above small enough to fit in any pocket unless you really want a blue pocket sized camera and don't care so much about your image quality get the canon Leica Floppy disk Canon T90 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon PowerShot G PlayStation Portable Photography Movie projector View camera Stereoscopy Liquid crystal display Konica Minolta Camcorder USB flash drive Single-lens reflex camera Handheld game console Shutter speed IPod Mouse (computing) Photographic lens Aperture Walkman Motion capture Nintendo DS Universal Serial Bus Game Boy Digital cinematography Camera Oscilloscope 8 mm video format Bicycle lighting Laserdisc Digital camera Panoramic photography Internal ballistics Nikon FA Sound Blaster Computer Bluetooth Tungsten Handheld Nintendo 64 F-number Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Gramophone record Creative Zen Wind turbine Film speed Canon EOS Xbox 360 Nikon FE2 DVD Gamut Memory Stick Contax Sega Dreamcast High-definition television Sega Saturn Charge-coupled device Nintendo Revolution CompactFlash MP3 Apple Newton IBM PC compatible PlayStation 2 Apple Macintosh Action potential Secure Digital card Depth of field Nikon FM2 Frame rate Federal Standard 1037C Digital cinema Macro photography Canon EF lens mount Light-emitting diode Canon T70 Pinhole camera Film Nickel-cadmium battery Digital camera back Cinematography Game controller Central processing unit Atari 8-bit family Clementine mission Resident Evil (video game) Octopus card RFID Laptop Exposure (photography) Explosive material NTSC Gradius Starfleet ranks and insignia Nintendo Tank
