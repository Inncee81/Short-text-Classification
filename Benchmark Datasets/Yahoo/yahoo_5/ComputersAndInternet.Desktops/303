if i reinstall windows xp home service pack will it delete my current files currently i am running an xp professional service pack but i was wondering about switching to home it depends on what you're doing if you have an xp service pack update cd go ahead and use it the sp update doesn't care whether you have the home or professional version of xp if you have the full blown installation cd of xp home sp i would recommend that you have the disk reformat your hard drive first instead of trying to install home on top of pro in that case yes it will delete your files so you'll need to back up your data first however there really isn't any benefit from switching from the professional version to the home version since you already have xp pro sp i recommend you just upgrade your existing installation to sp you can visit microsoft's website and download the upgrade or you can order the cd from microsoft link below if you know someone who already has an sp upgrade cd go ahead and burn a copy of theirs and then do your own upgrade microsoft actually encourages sharing of the sp upgrade so there's no licensing or copyright violation if all you're copying is the sp upgrade Windows XP Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Linux Spyware System 7 (Macintosh) IPod Xbox ITunes NTFS Mac OS X History of Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh WordStar Microsoft MAME File system File Allocation Table Internet Explorer Macintosh Finder Modchip Apple Computer PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Btrieve Floppy disk Kazaa IBM PC compatible WordPerfect PlayStation Portable TiVo Mozilla Firefox MS-DOS Apple II family Novell NetWare Microsoft .NET Virtual memory Digital rights management Internet Relay Chat Blue screen of death BitTorrent Hard disk OpenDocument Trusted computing IA-32 Windows Me DOS Redundant array of independent disks Windows Update Common criticisms of Microsoft Windows 3.x Knoppix Steam (content delivery) Opera (web browser) QuickTime Emacs Copyright infringement of software Anti-virus software Macromedia Flash Library (computer science) Pretty Good Privacy Windows registry Palm OS ZX Spectrum Disk cloning The Sims 2 Sega Dreamcast OpenOffice.org MSN Messenger Laptop Wine (software) Online music store Patch (computing) Copyright Microsoft Jet Database Engine Enterprise content management Stardock Proxy server Rootkit Atari 8-bit family Gmail PlayStation 2 Backup Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis United States v.
