need to upgrade my pc how do i and whats cheapest way i have pc with mb pentium processsor and gb hdd i need to increase to i g hdd and g mb i am not computer literate so someone else will need to fic it for me my mind is reeling with all the replies from u wonderful people off to pc world i go thanks all if you are in the uk take it to your local branch of pc world or maplin and ask for an upgrade what you want is unclear your terms are conflicting with what you want upgrading your ram memory from mb to gb may help and you could simply add a second hdd rather than los your gb drive depending on your bios it may need upgrading through a process called 'flashing' you may be able to fit a large capacity drive ie greater than gb but stick with a gb drive for now this should be able to be put in with your existing drive the techie people will know how to do this for you if there is only room for one hdd some pcs are crippled this way then the tech guys should be able to do a transfer from your gb hdd to the new larger hdd and it will run the same way you could also do some work yourself and buy a gb external drive from maplin for about pc world do it for about that drive just plugs into a usb socket in the back of your computer so no literacy needed there then you copy all of the files from the my documents folder to the new drive and then defragment your main hard drive as for the ram memory that's a five minute job at maplins or pc world and would be minimum cost although if you know what ram you need you can order it on line at www pcworld co uk under accessories and then go into the store and pick it up maplins tend to sell the memory for around twice the price of pc world at the moment and pc world have special discounts for web ordering you don't need to buy it just have it reserved at your local store i've never used the 'value' branded ram it's very cheap but i use the pny or component shop memory and mb is around to for the type i'd bluff the tech guys at pc world and ask them what sort of memory you need to upgrade your pc let them tell you and then make an excuse that you don't have enough money at the present time then go home with the info pre order the memory and go in the next day with your computer case and go to the info desk where you pick up and purchase the memory chips then ask if a tech guy can fit the memory it's only five minutes work then pay for the work done hope this helps i expect you would pay around or so for the ram upgrade labour and around for the actual ram chips so there's plus for the external hard drive so that if you buy a gb internal hard drive and have the tech guys fit it i hope they don't charge you any more otherwise it'll be an extra or so and that would be expensive for you you'd be spending to upgrade your memory and get a disk that's only rd the capacity of the external one sometimes you can save money by doing it yourself and it's not tricky to connect the external drive full instructions are supplied you could buy spares and upgrades from other suppliers and save some more money but the tech guys or maplins techie people may not want to handle items not bought in their store as they cannot guarantee them Windows XP USB flash drive Personal computer Virtual memory Apple II family Laptop PlayStation Portable Atari ST IPod Commodore 64 Redundant array of independent disks Atari 8-bit family Apple Macintosh PlayStation 3 IMac Windows 2000 File Allocation Table Flash memory File system CPU design Computer RISC Digital photography Advanced Technology Attachment Modchip Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xbox Universal Serial Bus Embedded system Nintendo 64 AMD Dynamic random access memory Commodore International Apple IIGS Mac OS X PlayStation 2 Read-only memory Acorn Electron Amstrad CPC Moore's law System 7 (Macintosh) Xbox 360 System/36 TiVo IBM PC Timeline of computing 1990-forward Secure Digital card PC Engine BIOS ZX Spectrum Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo GameCube PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Computer virus Microprocessor Betting (poker) Overclocking Atari 2600 Computer bus Commodore PET Final Fantasy XI Desktop computer Computer forensics History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Mach kernel Inflation History of Microsoft Windows MAME Wal-Mart 64-bit System/34 Digital circuit Linux Sound Blaster Acorn Computers NeXT Random access memory TRS-80 Bicycle lighting Bulk vending Poker jargon Mac OS Enterprise content management Texas Instruments TI-99/4A INMOS Transputer Apollo Guidance Computer Booting PowerBook CompactFlash Sharp Zaurus MSX
