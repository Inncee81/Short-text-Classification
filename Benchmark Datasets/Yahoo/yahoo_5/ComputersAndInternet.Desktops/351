how do you reset the entire memory on a computer cuz my sisters completely messed up my computer and screwed around with the passwords and everything so i was wondering if there was a way to reset everything back to the way it was when i first got it and also can you fix a broken disk drive by yourself or is this something you would have to bring in or call someone for like if it doesnt open i assume by disc drive you mean cd dvd drive they are cheap to replace like at a computer store or newegg com if it's a brand name pc under warranty they're free just call the support center they're easy to install too the only precaution is put it in how you replaced the other one ie power cable ribbon cable and then if there are jumpers check the diagram on the top of the disk drive before you put it in to make sure that it's primary secondary or cable select like the one you replaced with that done you are able to reinstall the operating system you'll need the recovery discs it came with backup partion of the hard drive or ordering buying a new copy of the os if it's a brand name even out of warranty the original software should be inexpensive to order like the process has you put the discs in one at a time from when the computer first boots on you press any key to load from the disc and then it should guide you very easily from their if you want the original settings and have your data backed up if you wanted choose destructive recovery advanced recovery or restore to out of the box state Redundant array of independent disks Windows 2000 USB flash drive PlayStation 2 System/36 Booting Computer virus Hard disk Floppy disk Backup Atari 8-bit family Partition (computing) AmigaOS Xbox IBM PC compatible Virtual memory Oscilloscope Modchip Computer forensics DVD Copy protection Linux Cache Advanced Technology Attachment Password Nintendo GameCube Embedded system CPU cache File system Data remanence System/34 BIOS PlayStation Portable Personal computer Apple Macintosh Computer Sega Dreamcast Digital rights management Digital photography Disk cloning Computer storage Disk image Computer hardware Password cracking IBook Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis ZX Spectrum Nintendo 64 MAME PDP-11 PlayStation 3 Sega Saturn Apollo Guidance Computer Digital video recorder Malware Xbox 360 Amstrad CPC Btrieve DOS System 7 (Macintosh) Novell NetWare IBM PC NTFS Gramophone record Universal Serial Bus Cable television Database NeXT DragonFly BSD Animal Crossing High-definition television Anchor Federal Standard 1037C Compact disc Mouse (computing) Windows Vista PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Apple Computer Blue screen of death Elevator Drill bit Commodore International Mach kernel Acorn Computers Disk storage Library (computer science) Data recovery Nintendo Revolution Blu-ray Disc Multitrack recording
