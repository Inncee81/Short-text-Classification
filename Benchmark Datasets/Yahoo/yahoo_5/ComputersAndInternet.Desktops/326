what is better to build a computer with provided in details is it better to build a computer with the evga gts ko mb ddr w acs the specs are below try not basing the cards by the specs performance nvidia geforce gts mhz gpu pixel pipelines mhz ramdac memory mb bit ddr mhz effective gb s memory bandwidth or is it better to duel sli evga e geforce gts mb performance nvidia geforce gts mhz gpu pixel pipelines mhz ramdac memory mb bit ddr mhz effective gb s memory bandwidth as you will notice the gts has better memory banwidth even if i duel sli the which means i can do ton's more multi tasking with games and whatnot only reason im not sure is because the gts has has more mhz but not by much i need a good detailed answer not ohhh of them are better than go with of them gts pwns the x gts as its cheaper and is usually faster as sli doesn't truly double performance its video memmory all comes from the master card so it only has mb and has some compatibility problems gts is slower because don't believe the mhz myth even if sli x performance is slower because it only has shader pipes texture units and only rops while the has this means it out puts the shader power per clock times more texture and the raster operations per clock compared to a gts for the price of gts you could buy a gts mb the recommended amount of memory for next gen games or a hd xt some games better than it some games worse some games goes head to head with a gtx for a little bit more the gt is a more reasonably priced series gpu note most series gpus have a seperate shader clock the stock clocked mhz gts has a ghz shader clock the gts has a ghz shader clock a lot of benchmarks show its more cost effective Overclocking Xbox 360 Xbox DDR2 SDRAM Radeon X Series Graphics processing unit Shader PowerPC GeForce 3 Vertex and pixel shaders GeForce 256 Pentium 4 Nintendo GameCube Central processing unit CPU cache Doom 3 IMac Cell (microprocessor) CPU design Graphics card Scalable Link Interface PlayStation 2 Nintendo Revolution AMD Dynamic random access memory DDR SDRAM Voodoo 5 FLOPS Timeline of computing 1990-forward Atari 8-bit family Cg programming language Far Cry Celeron Apple Macintosh Athlon 64 Windows Vista Commodore 64 Clock rate EMac NForce2 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis RISC Universal Serial Bus Atari ST PowerBook Opteron Supercomputer PlayStation Portable High-definition television NForce Nintendo 64 Digital photography Computer Voodoo 2 Atari 2600 Xeon OpenGL PCI Express Neo-Geo PowerPC G4 PowerVR Rambus Super Nintendo Entertainment System Cyrix Computer architecture Commodore 128 IBM PC compatible Dawn (demo) Hard disk The Sims 2 MSX CDC 6600 Modem VIA C3 Game programming In The Groove (game) Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within Pentium M IBM PC Deus Ex: Invisible War DirectX Pentium III Bluetooth Athlon Acorn Electron USB flash drive
