can any one give me a suggestion on the following configuration that i am going to build intel core duo e intel ggcr desktop motherboard gbddr sdram gb mb buffer harddisk atx iball grabit cabinet sony dvd r w optical drive if you are going to run windows xp or vista then at the very least you are strongly advised to get at least gb of ram preferably ddr with a speed of at least mhz there are many excellent brands of memory but you need to ensure compatibility to your mother board chiefly a voltage tolerance issue usually the motherboard manufacturer or memory manufacturer will provide this info on their website or via email communication if you are going to do a lot of gaming then cooling overclocking and stability will be even more crucial issues for you excellent performance brands are ocz corsair geil crucial kingston patriot another primary area of concern is a quality power supply psu many people spend loads of cash on other components and neglect what is essentially the heart of the system your psu should have a decent output capacity of around watts and preferably dual or triple v rails among trusted well reviewed brands are antec smartpower ultra x or x thermaltake purepower the default cpu cooler heatsink that comes with the core duo is also not very highly regarded so seriously consider upgrading to a quality heatsink cooler combo such as the thermaltake big typhoon or the zalman cnps you may also want to consider getting dedicated fans mm or mm i like the antec ones for both your hd and dvd drives i am a bit fanatical about cooling which also impacts your selection of case design but not everyone share this perspective i noticed that you did not include a dedicated video card this is a must with at least mb dedicated video ram for a windows vista system and given your choice of a quad core x core duo processor i am not sure why you would skim here and share your system ram and cpu processor with an integrated graphics chip but you didn't state what your main usage would be or what os you would be running under so it's difficult to advise you on this issue if you are into gaming or hdtv hi def video then the newer cards from ati and nvidia maybe the way to go but based on the reviews for these poorly written drives and weak performances it may be more appropriate to get the older cheaper dx cards and wait for better implementation the xfx nvidia geforce gs or gs offer excellent value but if there are compatibility issues with the intel motherboard then consider sapphire asus readon xt from what i have read it may also be a good idea to look for a video card that support dual dvi output retail versions of these cards with mb on board ddr ddr are available from zipzoomfly com or newegg com for between us to us though i prefer seagate for its long year warranty most of the newer sata drives including hitachi toshiba and western digital seem to be quite stable however keep in mind that a hd can fail at any time without warning particularly after the warranty period is over so take periodic backups a good idea if you can afford it and your motherboard supports it is to activate raid and install an additional hd this mirrors your boot drive to the second drive and in the event there is a system disk failure you'll still have a fully functioning system from a system safety perspective it is always a good idea to have a quality ups that also functions as a voltage regulator this prevents data corruption and minimizes or eliminates the impact of brown outs power surges and power cuts a unit like the apc bx or ultra va us tigerdirect com would be suitable for your system configuration you also didn't mention a monitor if looking at lcd's the digital dell se wfp and the samsung w are good starting points which will cost around us besides the above the only additional suggestion is to be a bit leery of using a sony dvd optical drive they are known to be very finicky there are number of other very good alternatives such as lg plextor hp pioneer and samsung but this selection can be based on a very personal preference just do a bit of research on your model before making a final choice sony's cd r media however is quite outstanding imho providing excellent clarity and hf definition for dvd recording media verbatim is highly regarded as the most stable and compatible hopefully you will find some of this info useful enjoy your new system
