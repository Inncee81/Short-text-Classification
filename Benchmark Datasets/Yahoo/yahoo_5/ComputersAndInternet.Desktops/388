my pc is years old and has recently started slowing down opening a page i am sure i don't have any bugs etc as i have all the necessary programs to keep me reasonably clean i have just had the box open and done a thorough clean in the hope it was dust accumulation no such luck the extreme slowness remains it can take to seconds or longer to open a window at times in an email if i click a link the screen freezes and not responding appears sometimes i do this repeatdely before success opening the page as an older member of the computing world there are many things i do not yet understand about computers and any help anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated the reason i mention the age of my pc is because i fear age component failure may be my problem highlands hey sorry to tell you the bad news but years is definetly getting on for a pc and it's just the fact that the softwareis too much for the hardware and it can't handle all those processes at once there isn't really much you can do and i really would advise investing in a new computer the difference is amazing best of luck IBM PC compatible Computer virus Debugging Software bug Java programming language Computer AmigaOS CPU cache Opera (web browser) Mach kernel RuneScape cheats Virtual memory Apple Computer Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mouse (computing) Thread (computer science) Stopping e-mail abuse Unicode Expert system RISC MMORPG Windows XP PaX Theory of conduct Neopets Spyware Phishing Floppy disk Blue screen of death Apple Macintosh E-mail spam Social rule Gmail Denial-of-service attack Windows 2000 Computer and video games IPod Overclocking Kernel (computer science) Visual Basic Microsoft Windows Transmission Control Protocol Dog agility MP3 Portable Document Format 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Minesweeper (computer game) Software testing Nintendo Entertainment System X Window System L4 microkernel family Central processing unit Computer forensics Software engineering Carbon dioxide Game programming PlayStation 3 Space Shuttle program W.
