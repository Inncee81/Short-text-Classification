does yahoo still have any chance against google recently yahoo has been making a little come back the maps interface is greatly improved this website is brilliant i've always used yahoo for sports checking teams fantasy and chatting but they had recently lost my devotion with searching and thus its coveted homepage status i've also noticed that yahoo is starting to adapt some of google's ideas but google always seems ahead of the curve is yahoo's niche enough to sustain it or will google win out in the end what do you guys think n maybe you can fill them all but you can buy them no i think there will always be room for yahoo or another competitor for google google definitely has the search market down but yahoo has the whole web portal market locked down there will never be only one internet conglomeration too many niches to fill Google MSN Messenger Google search Search engine Web portal Opera (web browser) Website Ajax (programming) Yahoo!
