what are kickbacks in a true kickback arrangement a seller kicks back some of the sales proceeds to the buying company's agent the buyer's agent demands and or accepts the money as a condition for steering the deal to the seller and of course the buying company doesn't know that its own employee or agent is getting this money kickbacks are akin to but not exactly the same as bribes finder's fees and commissions in many most countries of the world kickbacks are routine expected and legal even if not quite ethical in such countries sellers know that they will make no sales unless a portion of the price is kicked back to the buyer's agent and buyer companies know that their employees and agents are soliciting and accepting kickbacks some kickback arrangements are illegal in some countries of the world in the u s three types of kickbacks are illegal in almost all circumstances it is illegal for a publicly traded company to pay kickbacks that are deducted for u s tax purposes in practical effect this means that publicly traded companies cannot legally pay kickbacks in foreign countries even if kickbacks are legal and necessary in those foreign countries it is illegal for an employer to accept kickbacks from employees although it is illegal it is an unfortunate fact that many employees are forced to pay kickbacks to their bosses just to get and keep a job in the u s it is illegal for any public official to solicit or accept kickbacks and or bribes most people are surprised to learn that even in the u s most kickback arrangements are not illegal even if they are immoral unethical civilly wrongful and tortious etc in other words if a buyer's employee or agent gets caught accepting kickbacks the person will be fired and probably sued for damages but the person won't face jail because it's usually not a crime except for the big named above hope this helps Contract Political corruption Oil-for-Food Programme Microeconomics Capitalism Insurance Stock Illegal drug trade Tax Wal-Mart Economics Internet fraud Plame affair Supply and demand Business ethics Enron Corporation Health insurance Real estate broker Arbitrage Usury Surplus value Arguments for and against drug prohibition Auction Coercion Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethical consumerism Black market Ethics Tort Islamic banking Mortgage Security (finance) Price discrimination Copyright infringement of software Financial markets Poker jargon Bulk vending FairTax Short selling Capital accumulation Gold standard United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Mutual fund Corporation Trust (Law) USA Monetary policy Schabir Shaik Trial Marriage ITunes Music Store GNU General Public License Monopoly Child pornography Reparations for slavery Fair Game (Scientology) Gross domestic product Economy of Russia 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Privatization Karl Rove Inventory Education in the People's Republic of China Advertising Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Monopsony Derivative (finance) Option Babylonian law Corruption scandals in the Paris region Bribery Warranty Gold as an investment Conflict of interest Trade union Copyright Publishing Jonathan Wild Consensual crime Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Apple Computer Public domain Taxation in the United States Bond Laws of Singapore SCO-Linux controversies Scientology beliefs and practices Dot-com History of the British constitution Labor theory of value Investment bank Dividend Food and Drug Administration Illegal immigration EastEnders
