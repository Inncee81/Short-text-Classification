what is a good camera it needs to be under to have video with sound to have good battery life and it would be better if it had a cool design first of all i'd buy a camera from a camera maker not an electronics company camera makers understand how photographers operate and they usually provide the tools you need not only to get outstanding pictures but also to set the camera quickly frankly casio sucks they're into electronics and gadgets not photography camera makers that are around include nikon canon pentax olympus and kodak these companies understand cameras and photographers however kodak builds only simple cameras that have limited functionality and reliability problems i've known many with a kodak digital and they all replaced them eventually if you look through all the questions here you'll also find more about inoperative kodaks than any other brand kodak is great if you want to spend as little money as possible and don't mind getting only a year of average pictures out of it their strengths are simplicity and low price nothing else olympus reliability isn't that good either and they use proprietary products so when you buy their memory cards you can't use those cards in any other camera except an olympus this is not usually a good situation to be in you may eventually want to replace it with another brand so you don't want to have to buy your memory cards all over again pentax builds a relatively good camera and offers the best bundled software available for handling your images pentax too though isn't as reliable as one would like however it's certainly better than olympus and kodak nikon and canon build the best point and shoot cameras and both use standard memory cards they're reliable and produce outstanding pictures i use a canon point shoot a powershot g which is an amazing camera that is highly reliable and incredibly well built in addition to being replete with features i also use a nikon d slr which is also an incredible camera you really can't go wrong with either of these brands now after deciding which brands you would consider think about what specific features you need video with sound clearly is a feature and a good battery life is too but you also need to decide whether you want to have anything to do with taking the picture or you just want to push the button and have the camera make all the decisions this is an important choice it will affect the final cost of the camera as well as how it is to use another feature to consider is the amount of zoom usually the more the better and it's handy to have a flash that covers a reasonable distance once you're clear on your requirements have a camera store salesperson help you by pointing out the models that apply to your requirements and your budget take that list home and look those up on camera reviews on the internet determine which are the most reliable and which produce good quality pictures once you've sorted that out return to the camera store and hold each of the few left on your list often the deciding factor after you've established your requirements and reliability and quality is how it feels in the hand if you've got huge pudgy hands a small camera is a disaster you'll never be able to push the buttons if you have small slim hands a small one is idea and a large one would seem like too much so make your final decisions based on how it feels in your hands remember you're going to be holding it a lot after you buy it finally in terms of your budget remember there's more to it than just the camera you may also need to buy a charger and rechargeable aa batteries nimh ones rated at mah at minimum which can run about and you'll need a memory card too even if the camera suppiles you with one you'd be looking at likely mb to about gb which would also run you about to depending on capacity and speed so keep that in mind for your budget too otherwise you'll be in for a real surprise when you get to the cash desk i hope that helps a little Leica View
