help i'm a slr newbie lenses ok ive ordered a canon eos d rebel xt and it's for a photography course at school so i need it ready soon was looking at a review and most have said the kit lens is trash pointless i pretty much want to do basic photographs to start off with but i have some knowledge in photography so i don't really want a bad lens to start with whats a decent lens for a starter like me one that isn't going to drop a bomb in my wallet ha thanks is this a good one just hit my eye becayse its and has macro http jessops com store s lenses sigma mm f and dg macro canon af details aspx issearch y pageindex catid comp n there isn't anything wrong with the kit lens for your purposes you will learn and develope your own techniques in class but a lot of people tend to go one way or another when it comes to lenses i prefer to stick with primes and let my feet do the 'zooming' for me where others prefer zooms i have a couple of each and use them depending on the situation if i am at a sporting event for example and i can't get in close to the action i will use a zoom but if i am doing something out in the open where i am free to move about i will use primes a great website for advice on all things photographic is www popphoto com sign up for the forums its free and ask all the questions you want i havent been there in a while just been to damn busy but i found most of the people there to be very kind helpful and very knowledgable good luck and have fun ow also if you are taking a beginning level class i believe that you will start with film and then move to digital and if that is the case the camera you ordered wont do you much good since it is a digital camera however if you need a digital camera then that will be just fine for you i have an origianl rebel and a d if you can find a new one anywhere i would reccomend getting one they have more features and are built a little better than the rebel forgot to say a good starter lens if you get a zoom would be a mm canon makes one as do a few third party manufacturers i like the sigma lenses they work just as well as teh canon come in a canon mount and cost quite a bit less check out these sites for great prices on cameras and equipment www bhphoto com www adorama com www keh com www digitalfotoclub com and this one for great prices on batteries for your rebel around vs www mydigitaldiscount com if you have any other questions feel free to message email me those mm are nice but not overly usefull if you are shooting any kind of ation they are a little on the slow side plus you aren't getting any wide angle so everything will be sort of close up the macro feature on long zooms like that is ok but its not great and i believe it is only or life size magnification if you like macro you are best getting a dedicated macro lens i have the sigma mm macro and its nice but i would really like the canon macro that goes from times life size that lens is around like i was saying before for a starter lens you are best off with a wide to telephoto lens like a or or higher rather than a telephoto to a super telephot like a that lens is just a little too restricted my first slr had a mm lens on it and it served me very well Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photography View camera Contax Canon EOS Photographic lens Leica Konica Minolta Canon T90 Single-lens reflex camera Zoom lens Digital camera Nikon Corporation Cinematography Schneider Kreuznach Stereoscopy Rangefinder camera Canon FD Digital camera back RuneScape cheats Binoculars Canon EF lens mount Drag racing Floppy disk Anamorphic widescreen Movie projector Camcorder Canon EOS-300D Computer virus Full frame digital SLR Nikon D70 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Theory of conduct C programming language Depth of field GunZ The Duel Lens (optics) Camera Shutter speed Street photography DVD Canon PowerShot G Advanced Photo System Social rule Amateur astronomy Eyepiece GunBound Widescreen Current teachings of Prem Rawat Aperture RuneScape Panoramic photography Medium format Canon EOS-20D Film Photographic film Secure Digital card Equine conformation Closed-circuit television Mouse (computing) B3ta Paintball CPU cache Quake III Arena Fast bowling Scientology beliefs and practices Oscilloscope Martial art Parachuting Dog agility Economics Internet fraud Strategic management Henri Cartier-Bresson Parallax Bicycle lighting Pure Pwnage Nikon FA Cinerama Pretty Good Privacy Gameplay of StarCraft Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Alignment (role-playing games) Poker jargon Pinhole camera Traditional animation Telescope Windows Vista Baseball RISC Panavision Macro Milton H.
