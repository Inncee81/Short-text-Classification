batteries in the us and uk for digital cameras i'm moving to the uk next month and i want to bring my digital camera from the us i usually use rechargeable aa batteries and can't find any info on whether aa batteries are used in the uk is there some voltage difference i should be aware of so just to clarify are aa batteries readily available in the uk no there isn't aa cells no matter where they are used are still aa cells but the charger on the other hand must be europe compliant in england the voltage is not and therefore you may need a travel adapter or a compliant charger to charge yoru batteries ni mh batteries are in my oppinion the best and cheapest batteries for use in cameras because they fit well with a digital cameras energy needs and they don't suffer from any memory effects many cameras also support cr lithiums which are great long lasting batteries but for the cost are only really a good idea if you need to use the camera all day and for one day Nickel metal hydride Nickel-cadmium battery Lithium ion polymer battery Lithium ion battery Volt Bicycle lighting PlayStation Portable Battery electric vehicle IPod Digital photography Memory effect Oscilloscope Action potential Lead-acid battery Universal Serial Bus Xbox 360 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Hybrid vehicle Ford Ranger EV Solar car Hydrogen economy Multimedia Card Toyota Prius FireWire Lithium Nintendo 64 Handspring Vacuum tube CMOS Apple Newton Flash memory Solar cell Electromotive force Digital camera Game Boy Secure Digital card View camera Circuit design Torpedo Uninterruptible power supply Game Boy Advance SP Radiation hardening Canon T90 Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Camcorder Handheld game console Electricity Mars Exploration Rover Electric boat Bluetooth Tungsten Handheld Incandescent light bulb Fuel cell Laptop Solar panel Television Diode Mobile phone Lightsaber Green Lantern Corps Transformer IBM PC compatible MOSFET Hubble Space Telescope Digital single-lens reflex cameras Electrochemical potential ATI Technologies Galileo spacecraft Electrophysiology Power supply Cosmic Era technology Creative Zen Internal ballistics Membrane potential Loudspeaker USB flash drive Second Battle of the Atlantic Central processing unit Automobile Renewable energy SmartMedia Tank Weapons of Star Trek Geographic information system Nintendo DS Leica Computer Nintendo Game Boy Advance Read-only memory CPU design Sharp Zaurus London Congestion Charge Road-rule enforcement camera STS-87 Non-volatile memory Windmill Voltage source Internal combustion engine
