canon rebel xti question i love taking photographs and would like to grow as a photographer i am looking at the rebel xti but i don't want to get a camera that is to difficult to use is this easy to use but at the same time will let me grow should i get the lens that most often comes with it i read some reviews and it seems like the is good but expensive what makes sense i take people pictures mostly my baby family ect but would like to be able to use it for other things thanks it is just as difficult to use as any professional type slr camera film or digital it is also much more flexible when it comes to the subjects you can shoot and the lighting situations you can approach with confidence that the camera will not limit your imagination take a class at your local community college and learn how to compose expose and print your own images Digital photography Digital camera Photography Single-lens reflex camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon EOS Macro photography Konica Minolta Photographic film Stereoscopy Leica View camera Panoramic photography Camera Canon T90 Digital camera back Medium format Technicolor Anamorphic widescreen Photographic lens Cinematography Advanced Photo System Photograph Shutter speed Street photography Traditional animation Digital cinema Depth of field Photojournalism Film Movie projector Contax Digital cinematography Surveillance Canon EOS-300D Nikon FA Point and shoot camera Widescreen Full frame digital SLR Film speed Twin-lens reflex camera Instant camera Rangefinder camera Enlarger Sharon Tate Cinerama Movie camera Charge-coupled device Nikon FM2 Gamut Panavision IMAX Canon EF lens mount Pentax Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure Time-lapse Nikon D70 Camcorder Image Nikon FE Lens (optics) Nikon FM Sergei Eisenstein Pinhole camera Canon FD Exposure (photography) Amateur astronomy Electronic journalism Road-rule enforcement camera Circle of confusion Henri Cartier-Bresson Scientific method Autofocus Zoom lens Bullet time Drama Large format Pixel Autostereogram Canon EOS-20D Color temperature 70 mm film Olympus (company) Binoculars Photography and photographers of the American Civil War Machinima Bernard Williams Professional video camera Multimedia literacy Nikon FE2 Film stock F-number Reflecting telescope Alignment (role-playing games) Shutter (photography) Perl Raw image format 16 mm film Felice Beato
