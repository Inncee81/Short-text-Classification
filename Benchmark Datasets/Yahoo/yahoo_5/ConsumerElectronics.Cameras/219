im having problems with my casio exilim it started yesterday i turned it on but it kept saying card error now i dont knw whats wrong wit it i take off the battery the memory card put them back in and nothing it still saids that i charge the battery but noo its not that does anyone knw what going on with my camera if you remove the memory card does it still display the message if not then it's because your memory card has gone bad it's rare but it does happen being that exilims take sd cards they are super inexpensive to replace search online or even at your local electronics store if you don't mind paying a little extra you can find a gb card online for like but if you remove the memory card only and it still displays that message then something is wrong with the camera itself and you'll have to send it in for service Nintendo DS Digital photography Oscilloscope Surveillance Calculator Nintendo GameCube IPod Objective-C Computer Automatic teller machine Computer and video games Computer virus Floppy disk E-mail Simple Mail Transfer Protocol E-mail spam Flash memory Cross site scripting Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Smart card Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act IPAQ On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Spam (electronic) RFID Poker jargon Atari ST Internet fraud PC Engine Spyware Digital Credit card Nintendo 64 GSM services Teletext Nintendo Entertainment System Casio Nickel-cadmium battery Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Musical Instrument Digital Interface Game Boy Advance Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Ebook Digital camera MSN Messenger Tungsten Handheld Steam (content delivery) PowerBook Pirate decryption Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting ZX Spectrum Buffalo Bills Ethernet Atari 8-bit family Social rule MDAC 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Windows Vista Bluetooth Handheld game console Wi-Fi Linked list Password (video games) Bank fraud Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Enigma machine Redundant array of independent disks Steven Wright Yu-Gi-Oh!
