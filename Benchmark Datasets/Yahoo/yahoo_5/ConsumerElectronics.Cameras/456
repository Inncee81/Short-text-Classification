how can i prevent others from seeing my photos on a digital camera how are they saved i'll soon have use of a digital camera but will be sharing the camera with my child who plans to use the camera often with friends how can i be sure my pictures are not stored on the camera itself or mixed in with other pictures i was told i'll need some type of memory card are all the photos only saved on those cards and no where on the camera itself similar to a computer which means i would simply use a seperate memory card from my child thanks p s i read that digital cameras have built in computers and i know on computes even when you erase or delete things they can still be retrieved by someone with enough knowledge is that not the same with digital cameras yeah i would say that the best way is to get memory cards one for you and one for your kid just remember to set it up on your camera to save everything to the memory card if they have that option because i know that some camera have like a small amount of built in memory like about mb so when there's no memory card inside it will automatically save them there and be sure to label your memory cards too so they don't mixed up and get a bigger capacity for you and a smaller on for you kid Digital photography Secure Digital card Floppy disk Computer XD-Picture Card Hard disk Digital camera File Allocation Table CompactFlash Memory card Surveillance Flash memory IPod Windows Vista Compact disc CPU design SmartMedia USB flash drive Trusted computing Atari 8-bit family CPU cache ITunes Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Analog-to-digital converter Cardcaptor Sakura Windows 2000 Octopus card MRAM Photography UNIVAC Apple Computer Memory Stick Nintendo Revolution The Sims 2 Bluetooth Digital circuit Virtual memory History of computing hardware Gramophone record Mouse (computing) Digital image editing Game controller Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind DV Digital Konica Minolta High-definition television View camera Laserdisc Closed-circuit television DVD Nintendo GameCube Computer numbering formats Expert system PlayStation 3 8 mm video format Multimedia Card Privacy Napier's bones Microdrive RISC Central processing unit Oscilloscope AmigaOS IPAQ Road-rule enforcement camera Modem Computer storage Computer forensics Telephone exchange IBM 1620 Our Gang Apple II family PlayStation 2 Image Biometrics Topps PDP-8 PlayStation Portable Autostereogram Code: Lyoko Credit card Compact audio cassette The Amazing Race Raw image format Pixel Anamorphic widescreen Gmail Read-only memory Image file formats TRS-80 Poker jargon Pornography Computer printer Computer virus Automatic teller machine Yearbook Xbox 360
