help my camera lens is stuck i have a month old casio i accidentally dropped it while it was still on and now the lens is stuck i try turning it on and off and it only says lens error on the screen please help how can i get it unstuck it depends upon whether it shows any marks from being dropped if it doesn't some companies will repair their cameras under warranty unless they show obvious signs of impact if it has any dents in the housing or on the lens or any marks from where it was dropped they probably won't cover it under warranty check with your local camera repair shop for a repair quote don't call a camera store where they send stuff out or you will end up paying for their markup on top of what the repair costs usually all but the cheapest digital cameras are worth getting fixed also in the future if you're not going to be using your camera for more than a minute or so turn it off so the lens will retract and be less susceptable to impact bob k http www camerarepairs com Digital photography Digital camera Single-lens reflex camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photography Leica Lens (optics) Poker jargon Rangefinder camera View camera Canon T90 Galileo spacecraft Movie projector Cleveland Browns Domain Name System IPod Surveillance Camcorder XML Mars Exploration Rover Road-rule enforcement camera Digital circuit Parallax Stereoscopy Photographic lens Apollo 8 Anamorphic widescreen Cinerama Binoculars USB flash drive 24 Hours of Le Mans Warranty Auto insurance Ebook Clementine mission IMAX The Inside Advanced Photo System Canon EOS Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March HyperText Transfer Protocol World Wide Web The Amazing Race Cinematography Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Bob and George Gmail Year 2000 problem Schneider Kreuznach 8 mm video format 3-D film Charge-coupled device Digital cinematography Nintendo DS Joel and Ethan Coen Best Buy Cross site scripting Oscilloscope Diamond enhancement On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Pretty Good Privacy Computer virus The Price Is Right Contemporary culture of South Korea 60 Minutes Nikon Corporation Wheel of Fortune London Congestion Charge Zoom lens Character encodings in HTML Point and shoot camera Hubble Space Telescope Radio controlled airplane Wal-Mart Eyeglass prescription Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Marshall McLuhan EXpanded MultiPlayer High-definition television Automatic number plate recognition Secure Digital card Danger Hiptop Bulk vending Len Hutton Apple Computer Marilyn Monroe Twin-lens reflex camera Blackjack Bubble Bobble Paintball The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Cable television Windows XP Modem Depth of field Advance fee fraud Widescreen
