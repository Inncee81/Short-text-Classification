lenses for pentax k d hello all my first time posting i'm all set to buy the pentax k d i'm just getting started with photography and wanted a camera that i could grow with my question is concerning lenses i will purchase it with the mm but i would like a lense to do portraits and one for everyday use i have a dog that moves a lot and would like to be able to catch him any links that can help me understand the difference between the lenses would be greatly appreciated also would appreciate any links to where i can get good deals on the lenses thanks ahead for your help don't buy any extra lenses yet the lens is the most commonly used kit lens because it is the most useful for most people you will have no problem catching your dog as he jumps around as this is a function of the shutter speed if you can't get a fast enough shutter speed probably will do fine just increase the iso until you can i'm sure you won't get up into the danger zone if you are outdoors there will always be enough light if you are indoors you will probably be using flash for portraits the classic range on a mm camera is to mm the mm end of your lens will perform as if it was an mm lens and this is right there in the portrait zone this doesn't mean that you must use the mm setting for all of your portraits as many people like to go outside the classic range one of our pros always mentions that he makes his living with his lens the pentax lens cupboard is surprisingly bare i must say you might consider a sigma zoom super wide angle mm f dc aspherical if lens for pentax digital slr which sells for at b h photo the nikon lens is constantly out of stock because this is such a versitile and useful range this is one of sigma's red line series which is supposed to be their pro level instead of the you might consider an upgrade to the pentax zoom wide angle telephoto da mm f ed al autofocus lens for digital camera which sounds like a nice lens based on the one review posted on b h or if you have just inherited some money the upcoming pentax zoom super wide telephoto smcp da mm f ed al if sdm autofocus lens for digital slr should be killer i use the nikon f lens and this one should be comparable the fixed maximum aperture of f should be fast enough to catch pretty much anything yeah i was going to mention that as a useful range as my wife has the vr for her camera i'm not versed in pentax lenses any more so i am not really the expert here if you get answers from pentaxian's like clavestone they will know more about the lens quality than i do i can only read reviews and pass along the information Nikon Corporation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon EOS Rangefinder camera Nikon FM2 Nikon FA Digital camera Zoom lens Cinematography Pentax Canon EF lens mount Camera Aperture Digital camera back Movie projector Floppy disk Point and shoot camera Panoramic photography Macro photography Nikon FE2 Shutter speed Stereoscopy DVD Nikon FE Film Nikon FM F-number Canon EOS-300D Schneider Kreuznach Street photography Film speed Anamorphic widescreen Automatic number plate recognition Volleyball IMAX Glasses Nikon D70 Stage lighting Lens (optics) Camcorder Red-eye effect Exposure (photography) Full frame digital SLR Dog agility Photographic film Television Autofocus Cosina Pinhole camera Diffraction Shutter (photography) Enlarger Widescreen Aberration in optical systems Closed-circuit television Depth of field Hard disk Drag racing Advanced Photo System CPU cache Polarization GunBound Eyepiece Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Railway signal Equine conformation Poker jargon Medium format Surveillance Eye Canon PowerShot G Cinerama Mouse (computing) Light-emitting diode Airsoft Olympus (company) Microeconomics Road-rule enforcement camera ATI Technologies Henri Cartier-Bresson Apollo 8 Bokeh Four Thirds System Bubble Bobble Canon EOS-20D
