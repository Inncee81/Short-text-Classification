can i ensure that the new xbox i buy is the improved model i know there are newer 's with a different chipset and improved heatsink so it doesn't crap out how can i tell the one i want to buy is of the newest stock and not an older one that's been on the shelves for a long time thank you i want to play halo and grand theft auto when they come out can't do that with a ps i don't know of a surefire way to do this without opening the which would violate your warranty i'm sure eventually someone will figure out how to tell by looking at the manufacturing stickers or the id that's visible on the package i'm sure places like joystiq or other gaming sites will post this once they know according to this article from joystiq the has been shipping with the newer nm cpu and improved heatsink part of the hw revision codenamed 'falcon' for about months now so this should mean that the s on the shelf now are using the new hardware this is also supported by the ever inrcreasing possibility of a xbox price cut in a few weeks since the new processor is much cheaper to produce in addition to being much cooler if you don't have a yet wait a few weeks according to an advance copy of circuit city's flyer the premium will be dropping the core will drop and the elite will drop there are also plans for an even smaller cooler cheaper processor but that won't start manufacturing until mid or so meaning we probably won't see it on shelves until late at the earliest microsoft is confident that the new hardware has fixed the rrod problem that plagued the earlier models and will still give you a year warranty so i think the nm model is safe to buy PlayStation 2 Xbox Radeon Overclocking History of Microsoft Windows Central processing unit Commodore 64 IBM PC compatible PlayStation 3 NVIDIA PowerPC Xbox 360 Atari ST CPU design Amiga Windows Vista AMD Windows XP Apple Macintosh RISC Pentium 4 Mac OS X 3dfx Timeline of computing 1990-forward History of computer and video games GeForce 6 Series Apple Computer NX bit Hot Coffee mod Celeron Sound Blaster Apple II family Wintel Jack Thompson Digital Equipment Corporation Console wars Electronic Arts Sega Dreamcast Laserdisc Microprocessor CPU cache Neo-Geo IPod Computer cooling Warranty Hard disk Pentium M Microsoft Windows Grand Theft Auto III TurboGrafx 16 Modchip Video game crash of 1983 X86 Counter-Strike DragonFly BSD Sega Saturn GeForce FX Cyrix Halo 2 Pentium D Apple IIGS Creative Zen Game programming VIA C3 Linux kernel Ashton-Tate Wal-Mart ZX Spectrum Floppy disk Nintendo DS PC motherboard DR-DOS Microsoft Computer PDP-11 Formula One Sega 32X History of video games (Sixth generation era) Athlon TRS-80 Color Computer Original Amiga chipset Super Nintendo Entertainment System Game Boy Advance Microprogram Mouse (computing) AmigaOS Windows 3.x 64-bit Game Boy E85 Mach kernel
