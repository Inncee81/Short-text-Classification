is there anyway to move your memory for an xbox to a xbox can i move all my saved games from my xbox to an xbox elite since it can do backwards compatibility ok this is ironic yesterday i was trying to do the same thing generally at ebgames and gamestop they sell transfer kits that have a usb output cord on one end and a place for your xbox memory card generally you'll be able to put your xbox data onto that then with the computer they give the software you can plug the usb part into your computer and transfer the data into a folder then you use another usb device with a place for your xbox memory unit and you simply drag and drop the folder into your memory unit all on the computer like i said earlier they sell them for like bucks at gamestop one word of warning generally the xbox memory card only has blocks many game saves are way more then that so you'll never be able to transfer them anyway i suggest checking the size of your saves before purchasing it PlayStation 3 Universal Serial Bus Xbox 360 IPod Xbox USB flash drive Modchip Computer bus Nintendo Revolution Secure Digital card N-Gage Floppy disk Bluetooth FireWire PlayStation Portable Nintendo GameCube Commodore 64 Personal computer Action Replay Timeline of computing 1990-forward Mouse (computing) Atari 8-bit family History of Microsoft Windows Musical Instrument Digital Interface Sega Dreamcast CompactFlash File Allocation Table Computer and video games Computer hardware Windows XP PowerPC USB mass storage device class Hard disk Windows 2000 Intellivision Apple II family Flash memory Game Boy Advance Desktop computer Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Saturn Sinclair ZX81 Dongle Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Game Boy PIC microcontroller Apple Macintosh Sound card Computer Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Atari ST SCSI Console wars Macintosh Finder X86 Sony Computer Entertainment Computer forensics CPU design Booting Memory Stick Sega CPU cache Nintendo ATI Technologies Sound Blaster IBM PC compatible Console game System/36 IMac Digital audio player X86 assembly language Digital circuit PC card PC Engine IBM PC Java programming language Digital photography Commodore International Digital camera RISC Windows Vista Atari 2600 ZX Spectrum ITunes Emulator Laptop C programming language Acorn Electron Knoppix Word (computer science)
