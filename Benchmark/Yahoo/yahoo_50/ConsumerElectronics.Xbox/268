is xbox worth it well i'm saving up for it should i get it or the wii or ps explain why it is or is not and is wii just for like mario zelda games or more im probably going to get a few thumbs down for this but the xbox is definitely the way to go the ps comes with nearly all the accesories which is why it is so expensive even with the price cut where as the xbox does not meaning that you dont need to buy a blue ray dvd player that you wont use if you dont want one secondly there is such a diverse amount of games out there for the xbox opposed to the ps where there are way fewer games although the xbox does have its flaws i e over heat on some of the consoles it comes with a year warranty now so you shouldnt have to worry as much xbox is the path to take i mean like come on gears of war vs resistance fall of man gears would own resistance hands down go with xbox Xbox Nintendo GameCube Computer and video games PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 Sega Nintendo Xbox 360 Rare (video game company) Final Fantasy XI Game Boy Nintendo Revolution Nintendo 64 Handheld game console Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Console wars Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever Karaoke Link (Legend of Zelda) Console game Video game console Xbox Live Game controller Counter-Strike Nintendo Power Guilty Gear History of video games (Sixth generation era) The Legend of Zelda series Game Critics Awards Player's Choice Dead or Alive (video game) Dance Dance Revolution Modchip Halo: Combat Evolved Grand Theft Auto III Computer role-playing game The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Super Mario 64 Nintendo Entertainment System Yoshi Stormfront Studios Madden NFL Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Sonic Mega Collection Plus Halo 2 Bubble Bobble Game Boy Advance Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Crash Bandicoot Psychonauts Boss (video games) Sega Saturn NVIDIA Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Unreal series Microsoft The Legend of Zelda Electronic Arts Monopoly (game) Intellivision Ninja Gaiden Half-Life 2 The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Shenmue II TurboGrafx 16 Metal Gear Solid Password (video games) Spider-Man Audiophile Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Zelda II: The Adventure of Link Paintball Pac-Man WWE RAW (video game) Sega Dreamcast Classic NES Series LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game Spy Hunter Nintendo DS Golden Axe Deus Ex: Invisible War Soul Calibur II Eurocom RISC The Legend of Zelda series characters History of video games (16-bit era) GameFAQs Spider-Man (games) Platform game FIFA Series Princess Zelda Mario Bros.
