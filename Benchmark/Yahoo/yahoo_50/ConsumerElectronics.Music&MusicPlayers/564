whats wrong with my ipod my ipod simply wont turn on i bought a new charger for it but it did not work it doesnt connect to any comp maybe the problem lies on the battery of your ipod no matter your charger is new so if the battery is completely dead then charging it or even connecting to your computer will not work so try to bring it to the store where you bought and don't forget to bring with you the warranty card tell them your ipod's problem so that they could fix it if your warranty card is still valid the labor fee might be free or you will be replaced with a new one but if the warranty card is no longer valid then you have to pay all for the charge if payment of the labor charge is higher then try to compare it if buying a new one will be better Apple Computer ITunes Music Store IPod nano ITunes IPod shuffle IPod mini Toyota Prius Octopus card Warranty Battery (electricity) Copyleft Poker jargon IBM PC compatible Credit card Mortgage Hybrid vehicle USB flash drive Trademark PlayStation Portable Digital photography Digital rights management IPod photo Digital audio player Gramophone record Loss leader Redundant array of independent disks United States Postal Service Steam (content delivery) FireWire Public transport Universal Serial Bus Microeconomics Nickel-cadmium battery Podcasting San Diego Chargers EFTPOS Laptop Betting (poker) Publicly funded medicine Steve Jobs Dodge Charger Windows XP Vorbis Atomic Kitten Automatic teller machine Mediation Ford Ranger EV N-Gage Auto insurance Napster (pay service) Best Buy Oyster card Internet fraud Toll road De Lorean DMC-12 Slot machine Keynesian economics Babylonian law Minimum wage Annuity Commodore International Inventory Ocean's Twelve Health insurance Walkman Battery electric vehicle Secure Digital card MiniDisc RFID New York Giants FairPlay Mac mini Online music store National Football League Color Debit card Implied warranty Xbox Pointer Surplus value Cable television Ethernet Buffalo Bills Bretton Woods system Tax Password Surveillance Mutual fund Monopoly (game) Blackjack Floppy disk Citigroup Computer Micropayment American individualist anarchism Creative Zen Flash memory Nickel metal hydride Miami Dolphins
