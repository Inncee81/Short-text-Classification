can i store music on a cd as data instead of holding minutes can i just burn that music as data to store a mb worth then i can just rip it back to my computer i'm low on hard drive space yes you can burn the mp 's straight to the cd as data the upside as you mentioned is that you can fit much more music on the disc the downside is that the cd will not play on most audio cd players just make sure when you burn the disc you choose to make a data and not an audio disc otherwise the program will likely convert the mp to the uncompressed cda format it will be easy to tell this as you won't be able to fit many songs on the disc MP3 ITunes Digital audio player MiniDisc Floppy disk Blu-ray Disc Laserdisc WAV Disk image CD-ROM DVD Compact audio cassette Backup DualDisc High-definition television Orders of magnitude (data) Video game music UK Singles Chart CD recorder Super Audio CD Walkman Audio file format CD-R USB flash drive Data compression Audio data compression Hard disk Computer storage Disk storage Acorn Electron Apple II family Sega Dreamcast Copy protection Karaoke Amstrad CPC Copy Control Musical Instrument Digital Interface IPod Digital photography CPU cache Digital rights management Gramophone record Sound recording Ripping DV QuickTime Audiophile CPU design Hidden track Disc jockey Online music store Knoppix Analog-to-digital converter Doctor Who audio releases Commodore 64 Windows XP DVD-RAM Tar (file format) Sony ZX Spectrum Redundant array of independent disks 64-bit Nintendo GameCube Phonograph cylinder The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series) Xbox 360 AmigaOS Video CD GIF Music radio RISC File Allocation Table Internet protocol suite Dance Dance Revolution Rhapsody (online music service) Computer forensics Mixtape Atari 8-bit family Optical disc Cache FairPlay Enterprise content management Unusual types of gramophone record Cue sheet Camcorder Digital audio Betacam PlayStation 3 File format DVD-Audio In The Groove (game) Player piano Library (computer science) Digital Oscilloscope Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Multitrack recording Metadata
