this is the best question you'll ever answer i have this crappy recording program on my computer that came with a guitar package thing i can use it to record my music songs i actually play with my microphone hooked up to my pc that being said when i record my songs it saves them as wav files i recently created a band profile on myspace and tried to upload my songs onto it it gave me a stern message telling me it only accepted mp files what are my options audacity is a good free program you can use to open your songs and do some simple editing or converting link in my sources audacity will let you re save your songs in mp format as well as some other useful stuff like fade ins and fade outs for the beginning and ends of your clips it also lets you change mono to stereo adjust volume levels in left and right speakers change the compression on your music etc etc etc you might find that useful as well if you're recording your own music oh and it has a decent microphone recording feature too if you wouldn't mind could you link us to your myspace music page i love indie stuff it'd be nice to hear some of your recordings Microphone Nine Inch Nails Multitrack recording Macromedia Flash MP3 ITunes WAV Grateful Dead Musical Instrument Digital Interface Live Aid Stereophonic sound SonicStage BitTorrent Pet Sounds Sampling (music) MySpace Karaoke Sonic Youth Binaural recording Blood on the Tracks Audio file format The Ashlee Simpson Show Warez PlayStation Portable Megadeth Red Hot Chili Peppers Sound recording Diablo II: Lord of Destruction PNG Sgt.
