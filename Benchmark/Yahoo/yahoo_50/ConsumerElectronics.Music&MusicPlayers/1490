why can't i watch my videos from itunes why do all the vidoes cartoons i buy from itunes kind of lag when i watch them on my laptop but are perfectly fine when i watch them on my ipod how can i fix this it sounds like your laptop can't keep up with the data rate of your movies this usually means there is either too little hard drive space left or that your hard drive needs to be defragmented also make sure other programs are not running in the background that require disk access as this would cause the stuttering you describe good luck ITunes Hard disk IPod Apple Macintosh ITunes Music Store Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible Defragmentation Apple Computer Virtual memory Laptop Windows XP File system Podcasting Floppy disk Redundant array of independent disks Computer USB flash drive Digital rights management ILife System/36 Surveillance System/34 Personal computer FairPlay QuickTime Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family Digital audio player IBM PC Walkman Computer bus Disc jockey IBook IPod shuffle MP3 Video game music Flash memory FreeDOS Defrag Compact disc Computer virus Computer storage DVD Enterprise content management Computer forensics MiniDisc Computer hardware Linux FireWire Copy protection Random access memory Desktop computer IPod photo IPod mini Original Amiga chipset Macintosh Finder NeXT TRS-80 Advanced Audio Coding Desknote Color Plaintext Gramophone record PC Engine Apple II family Motion picture rating system AmigaOS Vorbis Sound recording Partition (computing) Cache TiVo Digital photography Secure Digital card Commodore International System 7 (Macintosh) Acorn Archimedes Mouse (computing) Turing machine Master Control Program IMac Closed-circuit television Page table Computer and video games Computer animation Windows 95 MAME IPod nano Apple IIGS Commodore 64 Creative Zen Archos Bluetooth BBC Master Cable television Backup Oscilloscope Advanced Technology Attachment
