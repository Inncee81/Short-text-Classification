what cables do you need to hook up record player to computer i would like to make cd's of the records i have what how do i do this necessary software cables any help please thank you first you need to check if your current turntable is a preamped model if it's not then you won't be able to get good rips using it if it is then you need a cord that will connect it to your pc you will be able to find one usually at your local radio shack for not a lot of money you may need to take the turntable with you when you go so they know which plug will fit the turntable you then plug the cord into the turn table and the other end into the line in jack on your sound card once you have it connected to your pc you should then be able to rip the songs using most of the available music players ie window's media player itunes etc from there you just burn them to a cd in the same way you would any digital music file if you don't have a preamped turntable your best bet may be to pick up a usb turntable this will connect right to the pc through a usb jack and is preamped and designed just for the purpose of ripping lps circuit city sells a good one for around us depending on when it's on sale it comes with all the software you will need IPod Universal Serial Bus Digital audio player Musical Instrument Digital Interface Disc jockey Apple Computer USB flash drive Phonograph Gramophone record ITunes Music Store IMac Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Telephone exchange PlayStation Portable IPod shuffle Audiophile Apple Macintosh DVD Walkman Creative Zen Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sound card Computer bus Xbox Mouse (computing) Television Sony High fidelity Compact disc Atari ST Modem Atari 8-bit family Jack plug Amiga MP3 Draw poker Karaoke Xbox 360 FireWire Online music store Computer Nintendo GameCube Bluetooth Digital photography Game Boy Advance Dongle USB mass storage device class D-subminiature QuickTime Sound Blaster Creative Nomad Copy protection Secure Digital card Mixtape Commodore International BS 1363 Betting (poker) Digital Equipment Corporation Texas hold 'em Video game music FairPlay Computer forensics Btrieve Extension Cord Digital video recorder Lighting SonicStage Blackjack History of Microsoft Windows Ethernet Enigma machine RS-232 TRS-80 Vorbis Sampling (music) PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 Spark plug Modchip Podcasting N-Gage Cheating in Counter-Strike File Allocation Table Game Boy Phantom power Power line communication Laserdisc Computer hardware Beatmania IIDX Digital audio workstation Acorn Electron MiniDisc
