how is the quality of epiphone guitar amps i am getting some equipment to play some gigs and start a band and i need to know because the epiphone is much cheaper than fender but the epiphone still says they use real tubes and they do look cool i would say epiphone is a rather decent brand for beginners amateurs to start experimenting with if its a small gig epiphone is fine depending on where u place your amps the equalisations and effects you use and also the stage set up if its like in a big hall u can try to request for a mic out and control the output sound with some mixers tubes wise u have to consider their circuitry i find that even with low end amps sometimes their sounds are still quite noisy and dead gotta use alot of effect to bring out the tones fenders' amps are top notch no nonsense stuff usually people who know what they are doing get these amps but i think fender is more reserved for blues acoustic etc just my personal opinion for rock i would go for marshall amps for their extra gainy overdrived tones though expensive one respectabily sized amp can last you quite awhile as long as you dont frequently turn the volume knobs to or looking cool try getting your hands those full stack amps amp head and cabinet with speakers those are cool enough for me Bass guitar Instrument amplifier Guitar Jimi Hendrix Effects unit Epiphone Stevie Ray Vaughan Mike Watt Synthesizer Mixing console Van Halen Fender John Myung Fender Telecaster Electronic organ Electronic amplifier Double bass Buddy Guy Gothic rock Saxophone Grateful Dead Oscilloscope Mesa Boogie Kirk Hammett Microphone Violin Effects pedal Clarinet Harmonica Green Day Electrophysiology Timpani Trey Anastasio Loudspeaker Nirvana (band) Transformer Time Out of Mind James Hetfield Les Paul In the Flesh Live Diesel engine Carburetor Audiophile Kenwood Electronics Big band Bringing It All Back Home Trombone Blood on the Tracks Hearing aid Highway 61 Revisited Zakk Wylde Electric motor Thermal power station CPU design Phish Pop Will Eat Itself Acoustic guitar The Wall Tony Banks (musician) Vacuum tube Scuba set Valve sound Vox (musical equipment) Radiohead The Misfits MTV2 Solar power Wes Montgomery Miles Davis Beastie Boys Rhodes piano Joy Division (band) Drill bit Leslie speaker Fairport Convention Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Cellular network Fluorescent lamp David Bowie Eric Clapton Tank The Sonics Norway national football team Musical Instrument Digital Interface Heavy metal music Contredanse Diving regulator Chick Corea Fossil fuel power plant Manual transmission
