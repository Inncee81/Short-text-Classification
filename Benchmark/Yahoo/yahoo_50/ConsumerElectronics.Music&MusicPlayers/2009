creative zen or ipod which one would you buy the ipod the zune zen or any other mp player are all pretty much the same as far as what they were made for however all of them have there flaws and also there benefits except the zen the zen by far is the worst out of all of them it is basically a cheap imitation of the ipod showing no real benefits just flaws the only thing i can see that is good out of getting a zen is the money you save it is not much but you save the zune does have a larger screen and wi fi capability but the screen is the only good thing with wi fi sure you can exchange music but only for a limited time it would be the same as if you switched you ipod with a friend for a limited time the zune is very ugly just like the zen except the fact that the zune looks like a gigantic plastic box other mp players are just cheap imitations based around the ipod sure some of them work but if you really want to look good with your mp player the ipod is the way to go with those little mp players the benefits are just price and that is about it the ipod has an endless amount of benefits first off it looks great so nice and shiny with that mirror like chrome back plating on the video with the nano you get a range of color choices also with the nano the size amounts are perfect for whatever anyone is looking for the ipod is centered on one thing simplicity everything is within reach with a thumb and perfectly placed the ipod has many products already made and perfectded specifically for the ipod with an ipod you will look good sure the price is higher but look at all the benefits you are getting with it with the video capable mp players it is very hard actually quite near impossible to find for them however with the ipod no matter where you get the video there is a number of converters made specifically for the ipod i use videora myself and i love it i have well over movies and have never thought of switching to a different mp player simply put the ipod is the highest ranking as far as market sales and satisfaction if you go ipod you won t go wrong hope this helps you decide what way you wish to go IPod Apple Computer Creative Zen IPod nano Walkman Gross domestic product Microeconomics ITunes Apple Macintosh ITunes Music Store Poker jargon Laserdisc Digital rights management Redundant array of independent disks Law of value Deflation (economics) FairTax Digital audio player FairPlay PlayStation Portable Contract Gramophone record Monetary policy IPod shuffle IMac Capital accumulation Capitalism Economics Supply and demand Kylie Minogue Monopoly (game) Pump It Up Atari 2600 MMORPG Plastic Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Advance Wars: Dual Strike Public good Exchange value Keynesian economics Solar power Humphrey Bogart Solar cell Embedded system Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Computer role-playing game Jennifer Lopez Game Boy Advance Gold standard Externality Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Dance Dance Revolution PowerBook Intellectual property Super Nintendo Entertainment System Baroque chess Inflation Commodity MP3 Productive and unproductive labour Betting (poker) Stereoscopy Labor theory of value Computer and video games U2 (band) Compact audio cassette Labour economics Windows XP Slot machine ELO rating system Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Prisoner's dilemma Creative Technology Atari 8-bit family $ale of the Century Salary cap History of Microsoft Windows Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Audiophile Anarchism and capitalism Bulk vending ZX Spectrum Table tennis
