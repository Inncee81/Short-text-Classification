is it ok to screw on some rolling wheels into a marshall mg dfx i bought this marshall amp and it gets heavy carrying out to gigs is it a good idea to screw on some rollers you are right to be concerned with this things weight all decent floor amps are heavy esspecially this one because it is so large and has super heavy speakers in it yes you can install rollers on this amp if you want to but be careful as to only replace the outside corner feet with rollers the circuit board for this amp is mostly top located to accomadate the control knobs and jacks and only the speakers actually get anywhere near the bottom of the amp on a twin amp such as this you run the risk of damaging the cones if you install a heavy screws anywhere near the diapragms themselves but the outside edges should be clear space all the way up to the circuit board of the amp when you can afford it try and get yourself a good amp head and cabinet these are much easier to carry around Drill bit Iowa class battleship Instrument amplifier Tire Marshall Amplification Electrical wiring Elevator Bass guitar M4 Sherman Propeller Mattress Anchor Kirk Hammett Sailing Mountain bike Cruising (maritime) Escalator P-61 Black Widow BS 1363 Brewery Ship Vacuum cleaner Panzer II Effects unit Rail tracks Manual transmission Rail terminology Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Textile manufacturing IPod Skateboarding trick Rolling-element bearing Diving cylinder Ford Mustang Saturn V Battlebots Carburetor Ampeg Gramophone record Guitar Glossary of firefighting equipment STS-114 Tank Jimi Hendrix Van Halen Loudspeaker Panzer I Stage lighting Drifting (motorsport) Knoebels Railway signalling Boston and Lowell Railroad Club (weapon) Arcade cabinet Dodge Neon Timpani Glossary of climbing terms Subwoofer Car handling Scuba set Electric guitar Fuse (electrical) USS West Virginia (BB-48) Glossary of nautical terms Solar power Oscilloscope Electronic amplifier Harp USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Stairway Table saw Barbed wire Professional wrestling attacks In the Flesh Live Hard disk Super Mario Kart B-47 Stratojet Ford FE engine Wood carving GunZ The Duel Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Diving Tank classification Toyota MR2 Casualty lifting Knife Kingda Ka General Dynamics F-111 Mesa Boogie Movie projector Airport Diving regulator Taps and dies Boat building Randomness Sonic the Hedgehog 2
