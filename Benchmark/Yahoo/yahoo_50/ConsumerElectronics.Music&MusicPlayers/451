pls can anyone tell me the difference between an ipod and an mp player as my daughter wants one i am out of touch with all those gadgets that are around pls enlighten me as my daughter is hassling me for it and i don t know the difference and how to use them an ipod is an mp player there are other mp players on the market but obviously the ipod is the most popular one there are several different models of ipods and mp players in general but the main difference is the storage capacity which can range from about to gb gb will hold around songs depending on the song's length and file format regardless of whether you get an ipod or a different brand of mp player they all operate about the same way first you need some music you can convert your cds into mp the file format generally recognized by these devices another popular format is wmv which is supported by windows and many mp devices you can also purchase music in mp or wmv from online sites like apple's online music store songs are generally each next you need to transfer your music files to your mp player most mp players connect to your computer using a usb cable one is usually included some mp players also come with a music manager program like the itunes client for the ipod which makes it easy to transfer music back and forth other mp players will simply show up like a small usb storage device allowing you to drag drop files once you're done transferring your files over you can disconnect the mp player from your computer and listen to the music on it anywhere as for which one to buy that's a different question the ipod is certainly among the more friendly devices on the market if you or your daughter aren't very computer savvy i'd go with the ipod it's included software package itunes helps you to convert your cds to mp s catalogs them for you and makes it easy for you to transfer music back forth between your computer and your ipod you can also use itunes to listen to your music on the computer or buy additional music from apple's online music store as for which model to buy that will depend on your daughter the smaller ipods use memory chips to store your music so they're a lot more durable if your daughter intends to take it with her a lot the trade off of course is they don't store as much the newer larger capacity ipods use a small hard drive to store files some can also play video files as well as music the downside is the hard drive can be damaged if you drop it i think something in the gb range would make a good first mp player Walkman Apple Macintosh IPod shuffle IMac Digital photography Online music store Windows XP USB mass storage device class FairPlay Xbox 360 Digital rights management Gramophone record FireWire IPod mini Universal Serial Bus Hard disk QuickTime AmigaOS Vorbis IPod photo Video game music PlayStation Portable Redundant array of independent disks Mac OS X Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis MiniDisc Streaming media Computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface PlayStation 2 ILife Laserdisc Flash memory ZX Spectrum Windows Vista Mouse (computing) Commodore International Commodore 64 Advanced Audio Coding Linux Atari 8-bit family SonicStage Disc jockey Creative Nomad File system Enterprise content management Atari ST PlayStation 3 Computer and video games Secure Digital card Apple typography Compact disc Virtual memory System/36 Sony History of Microsoft Windows Rhapsody (online music service) IBM PC compatible Apple Newton TiVo Amiga Digital camera Xbox CPU cache America Online Napster (pay service) Windows 2000 Compact audio cassette Computer virus Archos Microsoft PowerPC Copy protection Video codec Amstrad CPC Central processing unit Personal computer Steve Jobs Portable Document Format Memory Stick File sharing
