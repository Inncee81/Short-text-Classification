can i get replacement ipod parts well see this is my little situation pretty funny actually i was just sitting on the couch browsing though when i saw this news report on stolen ipods and in the middle it flashed several serials on the screen well thanks to tivo i paused it slowed it down and wrote them all down checked on apple com there all real and under warranty so i was wondering if it is possible to get free replacements on broken ipod earphones and other things by filling out fake service requests and getting replacements under an ipod i don't own i know i'm evil hahaha i wouldn't recommend it a lot of times customers or police call apple and report products stolen so if a service request comes in for those ipods they'll deny service and possibly contact the affiliated law enforcement if it ran on the news there's probably a good chance they've been reported to apple plus that's technically fraud not that i think apple would bother for a set of earphones but they could come after you for it legally Apple Computer IPod nano IPod shuffle Digital rights management Spyware ITunes IMac Trademark Digital audio player USB flash drive Podcasting Walkman Poker jargon Redundant array of independent disks Ocean's Twelve RealNetworks April 1, 2005 Apple Macintosh Warranty Emacs Theory of conduct Windows XP Internet fraud Embedded system Contract Linux kernel Apple Newton PowerPC IBM PC compatible Sinclair ZX81 Advance fee fraud Microeconomics Apple typography Vivian Solon 2000s Objective-C Universal Serial Bus Wireless Application Protocol Mozilla Firefox IPod mini 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Modem RuneScape cheats Identity theft Killian documents IPod photo Mouse (computing) Plame affair Vorbis Apple IIGS Bluetooth TiVo Weebl and Bob U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Napster (pay service) Phishing CPU cache The Daleks' Master Plan Modchip Apple II family History of the graphical user interface Karl Rove Headphones 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Original Amiga chipset Milton H.
