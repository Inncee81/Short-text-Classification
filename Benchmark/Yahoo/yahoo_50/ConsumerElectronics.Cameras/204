affordable telephoto lens for canon xti i have the canon rebel xti with a mm lens i want something with a little more range but i don't want to spend more than any suggestions well you're not giving yourself a lot of leeway with a cap the next step up in the telephoto lens world from mm is mm and you won't find one from canon or a rd party at a low price a few options find a really cheap mm or more mirror lens these usually have a fixed aperture of f and they're not going to give you great results but it's mm and it's cheap get a tele extender x or x you can't use the canon or sigma brands as they are not made for the but there are cheap rd party brands like kenko that as far as i know will work on that lens stretching your mm to mm mm but note that a tele extender will also decrease your maximum aperture by x x as well and degrade your image quality especially a kenko get a compact superzoom for or less more check out some of the x x superzoom cameras which give you a minimum mm focal length equivalent of mm mm and more for a few bucks more those cameras accept tele extenders as well pushing the maximum zoom to mm and more mind you these compacts don't give you quite the same image results as a dslr with a good telephoto lens but it might still be better than the kenko option since those cheap tele extenders really degrade the optical quality of the lens they're attached to good luck edit george just noticed we're on the same wavelength except for specifically recommending canon brand extenders as far as i know they do not work on the which is too bad since it would probably be the best solution Photographic lens Digital photography Leica Eyepiece Digital single-lens reflex cameras Zoom lens Aperture Macro photography Cinematography Konica Minolta Single-lens reflex camera Binoculars Photography Telescope Zeiss Reflecting telescope Rangefinder camera Canon EF lens mount Aberration in optical systems Stage lighting Schneider Kreuznach Pinhole camera Camera Lens (optics) Optical telescope Canon T90 Depth of field Nikon Corporation Anamorphic widescreen DVD F-number Diffraction Canon FD Amateur astronomy Bicycle lighting Confocal laser scanning microscopy Panoramic photography Digital camera Bokeh Microscope Mirror Four Thirds System Fisheye lens Redundant array of independent disks Olympus (company) Clementine mission Microscopy Gamma ray burst Headlight History of telescopes Shutter speed Optical coating Normal distribution Camcorder Synthetic aperture radar Hash table Nikon FM2 Speed limit Holography Optical fiber Hubble Space Telescope Explosive material Myopia Astronomical seeing Canon T70 Digital cinematography Monochromator Widescreen Canon EOS-300D Poker jargon Pentax Ethernet Street photography 35 mm film Nikon FE2 Automatic number plate recognition Cosina Laserdisc UK Singles Chart Movie projector Betting (poker) Cassini-Huygens Oscilloscope Point and shoot camera DualDisc Eye Gramophone record Ultraviolet Schmidt camera M16 (rifle)
