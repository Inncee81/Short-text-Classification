mp digital cameras which has the fastest shutter speed i just bought a kodak v mp and i am disappointed with the time it takes to capture the photo after i press the button and i really thought it would reset inbetween photos quicker just wondering if this is as good as it gets for this price range or should i return this camera and get something different my budget is or less thanks the issue is not shutter speed itself but the time it takes to focus and measure the exposure this is a problem for any highly automated camera but seems to worst with smaller digitals the time is a result of a series of design compromises between things like the power of the little motor that adjusts lens focus battery life and camera size a faster motor will place greater demands on the battery both the motor and battery will be bigger as a result increasing the size of the camera you can overcome some of the time delay by setting your camera to 'monitor' or a similar setting this continues to adjust the focus as you are framing the shot downside is shorter battery life the other technique is to start the autofocus sequence by pressing the shutter button half way down on most cameras this will set focus and exposure once you are satisfied with the composition of the shot you can then press the shutter button the rest of the way to take the shot downside is this still takes some time and you might miss that candid moment you were aiming to capture Digital photography Photography Canon T90 View camera Konica Minolta Leica Movie projector Digital single-lens reflex cameras Camera Canon EOS Exposure (photography) Stereoscopy Camcorder Single-lens reflex camera Mouse (computing) Shutter speed Floppy disk Contax Digital cinema CPU design F-number Cinematography Pinhole camera Time-lapse Personal rapid transit Street photography Automatic number plate recognition Photographic lens Bicycle lighting PlayStation Portable CPU cache Toyota Prius Nikon FM2 Nikon FA Enlarger Traditional animation Shutter angle Hubble Space Telescope Shutter (photography) Motorcycle Electric motor IMAX Stage lighting IPod Anamorphic widescreen Autofocus Charge-coupled device Film Modem Medium format Macro photography Internal ballistics Television Nikon FE2 NTSC 2000 Australian Grand Prix Canon PowerShot G RISC Digital camera Panavision Quicksort Binoculars Apple Macintosh Welding Widescreen Canon T70 Nikon Corporation TGV IBM PC compatible Bullet time Photographic film GunZ The Duel Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Nikon FE PowerBook Photojournalism Action potential Digital circuit Fire-control system MIM-23 Hawk Galileo spacecraft Dog agility Drag racing Radio controlled airplane Embedded system
