is it ok to leave the camera on the dock today i bought a kodak series charging dock and i would like to know if my batterys will be ok to stay on the dock over night the kodak charging docks have circuitry built into them that stops charging the batteries when they get a full charge so go ahead and leave it on the dock when you are not using it and it will always be ready when you need it ni mh batteries have very little memory so they don't go bad like the older ni cad batteries bob k http www camerarepairs com Eastman Kodak Digital photography IPod Toyota Prius USS Terry (DD-513) USS Thompson (DD-627) USS Triton (SS-201) IPod shuffle USS Whale (SS-239) Nickel metal hydride Laptop Organic light-emitting diode USS Waters (DD-115) USS Silversides (SS-236) Penske Racing CMOS Cruising (maritime) Gemini 10 USS Wahoo (SS-238) STS-106 Dixon of Dock Green Charge-coupled device USS Waller (DD-466) USS Wallace L.
