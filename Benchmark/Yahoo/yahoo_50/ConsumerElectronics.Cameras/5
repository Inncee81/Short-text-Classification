looking for digital camera that takes quick consecutive pics without a few seconds delay you don't say what your budget is i use a nikon d slr which fires off images at the rate of five per second my older d s now replaced by the d takes pictures at the rate of three per second this isn't exclusive to nikon either canon slrs have similar speeds so if high speed is a priority go for an slr if that's too expensive or bulky and you really want a point and shoot you're going to have to live with shutter lag though it doesn't have to be seconds i use a canon powershot as my p s camera the model g this one has about a one second shutter lag which isn't too bad it also has a continuous shooting mode in one setting is does pics at the rate of about three per second but it does that by not readjusting focus or exposure between shots in the second mode it does about one per second because it will adjust focus and exposure between shots either way for a point and shoot that's impressive i'm not recommending the nikon d or the canon g both are quite expensive and are designed more for purists i love them both but that doesn't mean someone else won't disagree with me however there are other models from canon and nikon that might meet your needs and minimize some of your frustrations i hope this helps a little Digital photography Leica Canon T90 View camera Canon EOS Nikon Corporation Single-lens reflex camera Rangefinder camera Konica Minolta Nikon FA Nikon FE Nikon D70 Nikon FE2 Canon PowerShot G Camera GunBound Photographic lens Floppy disk Movie projector Canon EF lens mount Point and shoot camera Secure Digital card Mouse (computing) Nikon FM Digital cinema Contax Digital camera back Shutter speed Advanced Photo System Street photography Stereoscopy Film speed Pentax Closed-circuit television Quake III Arena Canon EOS-300D Twin-lens reflex camera Mercedes-Benz Macro photography Embedded system Oscilloscope Atari 8-bit family Major League Baseball television contracts Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Time-lapse Camcorder Medium format Digital camera Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Canon FD GunZ The Duel Cinematography Bluetooth Motorcycle General Dynamics F-111 Olympus (company) Raw image format 135 film Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster F-number Bullet time Wind turbine NTSC Turbocharger Universal Century Technology Frame rate Canon EOS-20D Volleyball Aperture Image scanner Digital cinematography Traditional animation Eastman Kodak Escape from New York BZFlag Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Persistence of vision PlayStation Portable Autofocus Automatic number plate recognition Counter-Strike Tennis Canon T70 Pinhole camera Sniper Team Fortress Classic Full frame digital SLR Color temperature Cheating in Counter-Strike Hubble Space Telescope B-47 Stratojet Airsoft Movie camera
