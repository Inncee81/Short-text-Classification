which brand of slr camera is the best nikon canon olympus sony etc please tell me why it is a good one what model also how is it better than the other brands what is more advisable for a begginer like me note if you will mention brands of cameras that i did not include in my question please make sure that it is available worldwide not only in some places you know i live in asia teehee o o thanks guys n n there are really only two choices nikon and canon both of these companies have been building cameras before sony and olympus were even in existance olympus came along in the seventies and didn't build bad cameras they competed well with pentax and minolta but that also meant that they didn't have the extensive experience that canon and nikon had so their cameras were only average today they're still average and they have reliability problems too sony is new to the game they bought out minolta to get a bit of camera experience but they certainly don't have enough experience at the moment to really understand how photographers use cameras their cameras are not nice to use you end up having to go to the menu far too often when you should have a button to do the job besides that if you out grow your sony slr what's next there is no higher model and no professional model either pentax also makes slrs and again longer than olympus and sony but they're targeted at the consumer market not the professional market you can save some money here both on the camera and the lenses the camera has built in image stabilization but alas while that means the lenses are cheaper the stabilizor doesn't work as well as one built into a lens pentax reliability is only average too and if you out grow that camera there's also no place to go canon and nikon have a solid growth path from their entry slrs all the way to the top professional models they have extensive accessories and lenses to solve just about every photographic problem you'll ever encounter and they both innovate and develop new tools for photography canon innovates first usually but being first means you don't always have the best solution nikon takes longer to develop a similar feature and ends up doing it better if you have to have the latest features now canon is your only choice if you prefer to have the latest features when they've been refined and optomized nikon is the choice there are two major philosophical differences between the two companies canon wants to be the leader and have the largest market share so they have been building camera bodies that look sexy for the consumer market they are also cheaply built to cut costs and thereby move the price down further as a result although the entry level cameras from canon perform well they're not comfortable to hold their controls are limited and awkward and if you happen to drop the camera there's a good chance it will break nikon believes in building solid workhorses their cameras don't look sexy and they're not cheap either but if you drop one it takes the abuse it's also designed for photographers so the controls are many and they're strategically placed on the bodies where they are needed the other difference has to do with protecting your investment as canon evolved its cameras it was not concerned about the investments that their customers made when they went digital everything that was purchased for the film cameras was obsoleted it is not possible to use your film based lenses on a canon digital that raises the question of what will happen when the next major advance in photography happens will everything you bought suddenly have to be replaced at considerable cost because they chose again to not maintain compatibility most likely they have that kind of history pentax was the same incidentally and so was olympus nikon on the other hand tries its best to maintain compatibility they ensure that their new cameras at least accept the investments of the past if you happen to find a nikon lens at a garage sale the odds are really good that it will fit on your nikon digital slr and actually work albeit with some restrictions what will happen as nikon develops new cameras most likely whatever you bought today will continue to be useable so when you consider all of those factors your only realy choice is nikon however there are many people who swear by canon so if the above factors are not important to you canon remains a good option too certainly if you skip the consumer models and go directly to the professional ones both makers build incredible products just be aware that eventually the lenses you buy may not work on the next incredible professional camera if you want to go canon i'd look at the xti it's a nice little camera and its only real shortcoming is the absense of a spot meter if you go nikon the d x is a wonderful entry level product and has more than you need to start off it actually has many features that are usually only in higher end models i'd also be careful about what lens you buy usually the lenses that are sold with the bodies aren't that good with the nikon i'd go for the mm mm zoom that gives you an awesome range and negates the need to own two lenses for general photography canon doesn't make one of these unfortunately however you can get a similar lens from tamron and from sigma which will work with the canon so my suggestion to you is to consider a nikon d x as a starter camera with an mm mm lens later as you get more sophisticated and demand ever more functionality you can move up to the d which is also an incredible design and in time there's the d which is only one step below the professional model that provides you even more power and flexiblity of course by the time you're ready to move up those models will have been replaced but you'll find they will only get ever better i hope this helps a little Photographic lens Microeconomics Free trade Digital camera back IPod Camcorder Computer Inflation Macro photography
