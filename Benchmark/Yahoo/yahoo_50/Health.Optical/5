did i accidentally damage my eye when i removed a contact okay so i only got contacts this afternoon august as my doctor advised i removed them after hours around pm it was my first time removing my left contact as the doctor only had me remove the right one at the office anyway it took me a few minutes so my eye was a little pink with irritation but i did succeed in removing my contact however after closely looking in the mirror i noticed there seemed to be a small clear glob near my lower eyelid of my left eye this was not the case for my right eye whose contact i assume came out easier this small glob seemed to be membrane or eye discharge it didn't have a serious effect on my vision only sometimes when i blinked my vision seemed a little blurred but it'd clear on its own my left eye remained pink for less than minutes after removal and now after an hour and a half my left eye is normal did i damage my left eye should i not wear contacts tomorrow will it repair itself thanks in advance first you are a new contact lens wearer and it will take you a little while to become more comfortable many people have trouble taking the out and putting them in girls with longer nails have an especially difficult time remember to always wash your hands before handling your contacts your eyes never experienced contacts or a finger probing them before this caused the redness and even the slight drainage your doctor probably gave you some rewetting drops try putting these in now i bet when you wake up tomorrow everything will be fine tomorrow remember patience putting them in and use the rewetting drops throughout the day Conjunctivitis Eye Diabetic retinopathy Contact lens Stereoscopy Eyeglass prescription Social rule Milton H.
