can showering in your contact lens hurt your eyes i've been doing this occasionally for years with no ill effects but someone at work told me yesterday that it's incredibly dangerous and can really damage your eyes i'm a bit sceptical is this true i wouldn't say it is incredibly dangerous wearing your contact lenses in the shower increases your risk of eye infection or irritation if you exposure your contact lenses to water bacteria and contaminates can attach themselves to the contact lens this can cause you to experience irritation or even an eye infection infections in some cases can become very serious and even result in loss of vision so technically yes showering in your lenses could hurt your eyes but i wouldn't say it is incredibly dangerous lol Conjunctivitis Contact lens Multiple sclerosis Methamphetamine Diabetes mellitus Legionellosis Eye Diving Ultraviolet Herpes simplex virus Group A streptococcal infection Eczema Coeliac disease Intravenous therapy Swimming Toxoplasmosis Common cold Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Radiation poisoning Gonorrhoea Hip fracture Penis enlargement Rocky Mountain spotted fever Escherichia coli O157:H7 Keratoconus Glasses Psoriasis Foodborne illness Eyeglass prescription Breastfeeding Sexually-transmitted infection LASIK Bathing Stereoscopy Refractive surgery Diarrhea Botulism Aspartame Otitis externa Tuberculosis Cytomegalovirus Myopia Diabetic retinopathy Narcotic Hard disk Sewage treatment Computer virus Intraocular lens Lyme disease Cephalic disorder Ulcer Bleeding View camera Leptospirosis Spider Anthrax Chronic fatigue syndrome Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Quarantine Depth of field Sunglasses Aspergillosis Nuclear explosion Smoke-screen Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma AIDS Airbag Hydrogen sulfide Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Eye contact Safe sex Iris (anatomy) Poliomyelitis Reiter's syndrome Cancer Smallpox Escherichia coli Transmission (medicine) 2001 anthrax attacks Diplopia HIV Parkinson's disease Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Acne Ulcerative colitis Hepatitis C Use of poison gas in World War I Diseases of the honeybee Rabies Eyepiece Snake Chernobyl accident Items in the Metroid series Tularemia Nuclear fallout Photorefractive keratectomy Formic acid
