i am having problems putting in my contacts lenses i have the contacts on the tip of my finger and its moist not dry why wont the contact leave the tip of my finger when i put in on my eye ball plz tell me if im doin something wrong or any tips you have first of all your contact does need to be pretty moist but your finger needs to be dry wet finger and wet lens means it will stick to your finger also if you are not allowing the contact to suction on to your eye and you are pushing on to your eyeball the contact may stick to your hand you should not have to apply any pressure to your eye when inserting the contact make sure you are looking up when the contact is almost in contact with your eye you should feel it suction on sometimes even hear it then look up down and all around to ensure that the contact has no bubbles under it then close lid not tight and lightly massage your eye lid hope this helps Condom Electrophysiology Snooker Eye Pottery Campfire Textile manufacturing Bong Contact lens Knife Breastfeeding Casting Billiards Car handling Cornea Internal ballistics Diving Tobacco Gesture Chopsticks Archery Double bass Fire fighting Volleyball Stereoscopy Glasses Peter Shilton Violin Japanese toilet Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
