are contacts hard to get out of your eye hi i was just wondering if i got contacts would the doctor stare at me while i put them in i would rather be alone and do i have to take them out or can i just leave them in and go home or do i have to show the doc that i can take them out too are contacts easy for you im not too worried about putting them in but getting them out seems a little tricky is it i want some advise on whether people think they are difficult to have i personally hate glasses they are so dumb there really annoying i think i would look way preatier without them what do you think are they hard to get out of your eye help school is almost starting and i want something different but i need opinions the key to contacts is practice i first started wearing them years ago after wearing glasses my whole life the nurses at the office tell you how to put them in and may watch you some but really just want you to practice to put them in my doctor's office was going to send me home the first time without taking them out and i didn't let them because i was having trouble taking them out it now takes me like seconds to get them in and out it really will boil down to you finding your own personal way that makes you comfortable Social rule Rei Ayanami Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Eye contact Milton H.
