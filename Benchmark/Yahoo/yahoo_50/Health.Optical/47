contact lenses i'm i have tried contact lenses but have had to stop because in the middle of the day they get blurry and i can't see through them at all if i move them around back where they're supposed to be then i can see again i have heard that there's a special lens made for astigmatism i have astigmatism has anybody tried these and do they work sounds like the lenses don't fit your eye properly they are probably slipping to cause the blurring as you say that when you shift them back you can see again you may have to try a few before you find a good fit just tell your optician about the problems you are having and he should test you out on a few i had to try about different types of lenses and only ended up with a really rare type at the end of it but yes astigmatism means you have to have 'toric' lenses specially designed for the shape of your eye or as has happened here they will move in your eye Contact lens Eyeglass prescription Astigmatism Glasses Aberration in optical systems Eye Lens (optics) Eyepiece Myopia Intraocular lens LASIK Keratoconus View camera Nuclear weapon design Diabetic retinopathy Cornea Telescope Presbyopia Optometry Anamorphic widescreen Stereoscopy History of telescopes Sunglasses Movie projector Leica Strap-on dildo Macro photography Screw Autostereogram Bates Method Microscope Canon EF lens mount Social rule Blur Stage lighting Equine conformation Cinematography Binoculars Contax Ophthalmology Amblyopia Snake Big Bang Canon T90 Eye contact Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Color blindness Len Hutton Volleyball Automatic number plate recognition Solar eclipse Violin Compound eye Condom Albinism Carl Zeiss Digital camera Parallax Diabetes mellitus Digital photography Shaped charge Railway signal Nystagmus Eye surgery Conjunctivitis Panavision Depth of field Saccade Hearing aid Trilobite Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Zoom lens Operation Market Garden Schmidt camera Computer virus Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Milton H.
