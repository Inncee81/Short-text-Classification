i have recently got contacts for the first time eyes have adjusted but they are very dry any suggestions i have toric contacts for astigmatism i did give my eyes the proper time to adjust to the contacts in air conditioning they seem to get very dry very easy tried visine drops for contacts that only seems to help for like minutes help i love the contacts and want to wear them but it is kind of uncomfortable try getting a different solution if it is the generic store brand then that could hurt your eyes or are you wearing them too long you may need to cut the hours that you wear them also talk to your eye doctor about it he she will know better than any of us so make an appointment you may need a different brand of contacts im sure you don't have to say goodbye to your contacts just yet Contact lens Social rule Glasses Mattress Eyeglass prescription Menstrual cup Intraocular lens Aberration in optical systems Tire Fecal incontinence Theory of conduct Jon Secada Motorcycle Japanese toilet Keratoconus Myopia Diving suit Sunglasses The Shining (film) Astigmatism Electrophysiology Gas metal arc welding Condom Carpal tunnel syndrome Carburetor Carbon dioxide Hard disk Hydrogen chloride Urinary incontinence Naval mine The Curse of Fenric Smoke-screen Time Out of Mind Kitesurfing Archery Conjunctivitis Keynesian economics Diabetic retinopathy Paragliding Eczema Traumatic incident reduction Breastfeeding Sanitary towel IPod Instant coffee Domain Name System The Amazing Race The Ashlee Simpson Show Friction PlayStation 3 Prostate cancer Table saw Gramophone record Fire fighting Have I Got News For You Welding Equine conformation Sailing Dishwasher Circuit breaker Cyclops (comics) Papa's Got a Brand New Badge LASIK Punt (boat) Sleep apnea Eyepiece Bon Jovi Cornea Air traffic controller Pitaten Volleyball Inflation Cliff Richard Strap-on dildo Eye W.I.T.C.H.
