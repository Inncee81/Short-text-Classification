how do these kittens see me yesterday i adopted a pair of three and a half month old kittens from an adoption service and they are very skittish around me their mother was definitely feral so it's reasonable to assume their father may be too these kittens act unlike any cats i've had before when i enter the room they're currently staying in they run for cover but will come out after i sit down for awhile as long as i hold still while sitting they'll eat drink and even use the litter box they know i'm there because they climb over me and sometimes react positively to a little petting but if i move they will head back to their hiding spot i've done my best not to move suddenly but no matter the nature of my movement they still react with fear i find this confusing since they seem comfortable around me in regards to eating playing and whatnot my question is how to these kittens see me a caretaker a threat a neutral party or something else also tips to help tame them would be great these kittens were adopted from a foster home where they seemed very happy and we were told that they socialized just fine with people as well as other animals they're still trying to figure you out for themselves you may be able to tame them all since they're pretty young all it takes is time i have noticed that being sure of yourself reassures animals move normally they'll get used to you you don't need to go around being so aware of them they'll get the pattern of your routine animals love consistant behavior and will get used to your movements just do your thing sort of ignore them provide their food water and clean thier box eventually they'l follow you around as kittens are fascinated by seeing thier litterbox cleaned they'll get that you're the mom Cat Socialization Feral cat Kitten Domestication Hamster Dog Garfield Domestic rabbit The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Glossary of partner dance terms Pet skunk Feral Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Animal communication Guinea pig Kodocha Pitaten Ferret The Shining (film) Atomic Kitten Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Dog training The Time Machine Ron and Fez Kashrut Adoption The Amber Spyglass The Dalek Invasion of Earth Fancy rat Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Shaggy dog story Gray Wolf Conker's Bad Fur Day Spidey Super Stories Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Japanese tea ceremony Feral child Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Pok__mon Live!
