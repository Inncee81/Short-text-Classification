cat has foot ankle injury i came home today and found my yr old bengal leopard cat limping his front paw is noticeably swollen and he holds it up when he walks as not to put any weight on it i can bend his leg at the joint the swelling is in the foot ankle area there are no cuts he is an indoor cat my guess is that he fell off a high area or got it caught somewhere is it worth going into the vet what could they do what can i do for him at home he is a large cat over lbs and pretty tough last time he hurt himself deep cut on leg it completely healed within a day i know felines are one of the fastest healing animals i'm just concerned and looking for some vet professional advice i'm not a professional but i think you've got two options leave him till the morning and see if he's any better or take him straight to a vet my cat hurt his leg and was limping and swollen but as soon as i dragged his favourite toy across the floor he managed to jump quite well cats in pain don't do that they normally hide Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Diving Equine conformation Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Guinea pig Volleyball Trapping Cincinnati Bengals Cat Glossary of ballet terms Fancy rat Carpal tunnel syndrome Suplex Glossary of climbing terms Boxing Fast bowling Hip fracture Foot Horse High-heeled shoe Spanking Garfield Professional wrestling aerial techniques Ferret Biped Figure skating Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Weight training Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling slang Horse gait Cat o' nine tails Mixed martial arts The Shining (film) Badminton Kurt Angle Anatomical terms of location Paragliding Bengal cat Domestic rabbit Swimming Clouded Leopard Spider Tattoo Housebreaking American football Massage Sport rowing Manx (cat) Taikyoku shogi Cheerleading Casualty lifting Black panther Decompression sickness Clean and jerk Dog Liger Boston Public Kodocha Bryan Robson Orthopedic surgery Dog training Anterior cruciate ligament Breaststroke Shaggy dog story Kitesurfing Osteoarthritis Puma 1957 World Series Dog agility Suspension bondage Babe Ruth Tai Chi Chuan Drag racing Mississippi John Hurt Pittsburgh Steelers Pet skunk Leopard Cat Jaguar Evel Knievel High jump Felix the Cat Columbine High School massacre Front crawl Hobie cat Greg Valentine Taboo food and drink Batting (cricket) Leopard James Augustus Grant Piledriver (professional wrestling) Archery Cricket Backstroke
