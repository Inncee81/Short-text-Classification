year old cat licks month old kitten's bum should i take this as a good sign the older cat is a girl and kitty is a boy we introduced kitty into the house about weeks ago do they like each other usually they play fight very rough or ignore each other i want them to groom each other and sleep close older kitty is spayed and kitten will be soon we just want to put more weight on him it is a good sign your older cat is mothering your kitten when kittens are newborn they don't poop on their own as gross as it sounds the mama kitty licks their bottom to stimulate their bowels and swallows the poo it's just a processed version of her own milk after all i doubt your older cat is ingesting any poo she's just mothering him my other take on the situation is if your older cat is not spayed she may be reacting to the smell of a male get her spayed as soon as possible if she's not already or you'll have kittens before you know it also get the kitten neutered in the next couple months or he'll start marking around the house as in peeing on the walls and once male cats start that it's very hard to get them to quit even after they've been neutered good luck Cat Kitten Ferret Guinea pig Ron and Fez Feral cat Socialization Garfield Toilet humour Breastfeeding Domestic rabbit Manx (cat) The Price Is Right Badly Drawn Kitties Pitaten Pet skunk Shit Oral sex Salad Fingers Flatulence Felix the Cat Puberty Housebreaking Urinary incontinence Phoebe Buffay's songs Castration The Sound of Music South Park Bulgarian language Conker's Bad Fur Day Girly Friends Vomiting The Jazz Singer Doug Chocolate The Beatles bootlegs Shrek 2 Marc Antony and Pussyfoot AFI 100 Years series Ranma __ characters The Contender (television series) The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Goatse.cx Cats (musical) Felis sapiens Social rule Kangaroo Eric Cartman Garfield and Friends Kurt Cobain The Marshall Mathers LP Little Britain Purr Sterilization (surgical procedure) Poker jargon Kakapo StarCraft: Hybrid USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Methcathinone Red Hot Chili Peppers Catgirl Hobo Kenny McCormick Something Positive Puma Donovan RuneScape quests European Rabbit Aquemini Atomic Kitten Grammatical gender Luck 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blink-182 Tina Turner Big Brother UK series 5 Elektra (comics) Joke Dean Koontz Milk Nile crocodile Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Okashina Okashi El Goonish Shive Polish language Coeliac disease Ren and Stimpy Silly Symphonies Black Bob Barker Trailer Park Boys Bat Ginger Rogers Mnemonic
