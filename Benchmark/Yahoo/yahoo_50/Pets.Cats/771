my cat has a lump on her back i have a year old cat who seemingly overnight has developed a medium sized blob type lump under her skin behind her right shoulder it felt warm to the touch and moved pretty freely under the skin she went to the vet a week ago for her annual checkup and got some vaccines however she has never had an allergic reaction before so i doubt it is that the blob moving under her skin doesn't seem to cause her any pain she doesn't flinch or make any kind of protest to touch and she is walking normally she has lost a pound and a half in the past year and is in general good health i'm worried has anyone else experienced this i'm taking her to the vet tomorrow regardless i think last friday when she was at the vet she got her year rabies shot i heard that they can cause bad abcesses at the injection site sometimes has anyone had experience with this hmm given her age i would say its possibly a fatty tumor but that's not necessarily much to worry about they don't usually show up that fast but its possible its been there a while and you overlooked it i'd call your vet and ask their opinion it could also possibly be a cyst but those tend to be a bit firmer to the touch it could also be the site where the cat recieved its vaccines if it was injected in a way that left it suspended rather than fully absorbed call the vet and they'll eliminate a few possiblities for you Pet skunk Guinea pig Rabies Fancy rat Vaccine Ferret Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Allergy Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Equine conformation Ben Johnson (athlete) Milton H.
