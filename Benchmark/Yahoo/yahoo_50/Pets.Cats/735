how do i get my cat to eat other food when he will only eat his current food and refuses everything else my cat is allergic to his current food we recently found out but he refuses to eat anything else he has licked his belly bare but would starve before eating anything else other than tuna he is epileptic and has to take phenobarbital to stop seizures i have tried just putting other food down and making him eat that when he final is hungry enough but he will seriously starve himself before eating anything else i can't believe you people saying cats won't starve themselves that is so wrong cats will starve themselves dogs won't more importantly you vet people should be ashamed for leaving this out if a cat stops eating it can start to develop fatty liver within two days or less this can be very dangerous my cat is having a similar problem with food allergies fortunately she likes everything but when i've tried to switch her quickly her system goes haywire you have to switch gradually put about of the new food in with the old and wait a few days then increase the new food to about of the total you feed etc until you've made a full switch i'm not sure what you are feeding now but one very high quality food that cats have trouble refusing is wellness salmon dry food it is very stinky cats love stinky and it is a very high quality food without fillers or grains which is the main cause of allergies in cats wellness also has a regular food not salmon that would be just as good if you cat can't have the fish keep your cat eating that is the most important thing research the effects on a cat's body if it doesn't eat damage can start happening within as little as a day good luck to you if you have any questions feel free to email me directly i don't work for a vet but i've been researching cat food and diets for two years because of various health problems my cats have Omega-3 fatty acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cat Salmon Nutrition Fancy rat Fecal incontinence Oily fish Guinea pig Stomach cancer Garfield Coeliac disease Peanut Anorexia nervosa Allergy Chocolate Taboo food and drink Insulin Folic acid Ferret Tlingit Hypoglycemia Veganism Diabetes mellitus Vegetarianism Dog Binge eating disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Breastfeeding Raw food diet Eating disorder Livestock Fasting Tooth enamel Healthy eating Sushi Tofu Agriculture Atkins Nutritional Approach Welding Hay fever Aspartame Domestication Gas metal arc welding Clomipramine Organic farming Famine Medicine Obesity Whaling Tocopherol Seabird Arguments for and against drug prohibition Chicken Brown Bear Hamster Milk Dieting Hedgehog Protein Eczema Environmental vegetarianism Rabies Super Size Me Haloperidol Trailer Park Boys Cheese Orca Soybean Genetically modified food Food guide pyramid Foie gras Domestic rabbit Vitamin D Carnivore Shaggy dog story Ramen Ecology Kitten 613 mitzvot Vegetarian nutrition 2000 Australian Grand Prix Gray Wolf RuneScape quests Krill Stone Age Coronary heart disease
