is it acupunture a good alternative to treat a cat with hyperthyroidism please if any of you know about it tell me i'm afraid of having my cat treated with conventional medications for hyperthyroidism she's and never been sick before i wonder if acupunture works or homeopathy in cases like this please share your experiences if any my cat has an appointment tomorrow with a regular vet and i feel aprehensive he'll give her traditional medications thanks for help i have used both acupuncture and homeopathy i am a student of veterinary homeopathy with the bih and i can tell you for sure that neither is the way to go with hyperthyroidism your cat needs the medication and it will not harm her so work with your regular vet on that my cat was on the medication for a few months for his hyperthyroidism and then had the radio iodine treatment this spring the radiation is the gold standard for solving this problem it cost me abut your cat is young and the long term cost of medication and the frequent blood work etc may add up to that amount or more over the years so it is something you should discuss with your vet after the medication gets the thyroid secretion under control you have plenty of time to find out about treatment centers in your area to arrange something like carecredit to break the cost down to manageable monthly payments etc i treated a year old cat with the radiation and she lived to be and my current cat just treated is Hyperthyroidism Homeopathy Thyroid Traditional Chinese medicine Asthma Alternative medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Cancer Radiation therapy Veterinarian Thyroid cancer Health insurance Graves-Basedow disease Publicly funded medicine Church of Christ, Scientist Radiation poisoning Faith healing Aortic dissection Iridology Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Migraine Ionizing radiation Colorectal cancer Health science Drug addiction Growth hormone deficiency Endocrinology Computed tomography Complementary and alternative medicine Bipolar disorder Malaria Guinea pig Thyroid hormone Endometriosis Reiki Cardiac arrhythmia Clinical depression Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Scientology beliefs and practices Amiodarone Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coeliac disease Multiple sclerosis Veganism Hypoglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Controlled Substances Act Sewage treatment Prolactinoma Decompression sickness Growth hormone treatment Reflexology Urinary incontinence Randomized controlled trial Fecal incontinence Life insurance Childbirth Diazepam Diabetes mellitus Traumatic brain injury Quackery Extreme Programming Hepatitis C Radiosurgery Hypothyroidism Fancy rat Pet skunk Acupuncture Microeconomics Anorexia nervosa Semiconductor device Software engineering National Kidney Foundation Singapore Intellectual property Unemployment AIDS in Africa Anxiety Health maintenance organization Chocolate Menstrual cycle New Age Medical malpractice Water purification Ekadasi Sleeping sickness Magical thinking Drug abuse Mental Health Act 1983 Insulin Neurofeedback Pharmaceutical company Psychiatry Hypertension
