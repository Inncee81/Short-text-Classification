how do you think 'my' cat's doing it's about a stray cat that comes to my house every day about weeks ago i found out that she got pregnant and bought some cat food and fed her quite enough to be nurtured yesterday she was gone for whole day and when she showed up i noticed that she was no longer obese in other words i guess she gave birth as soon as she finished her meal she left but showed up few hours later to stay only about ten minutes do you think her babies are doing okay i looked at the nipples to get some clue and noticed they were pink and exposed than they used to be also do cats usually leave their babies for a while after giving them birth i think her babies are doing fine and that she is doing okay too she needs to come eat and they are in a safe place sometimes she just needs to take a break and sleep for a bit before going back to them write down the date you noticed she had given birth it may be hard to remember what day it was later when it is time to estimate their ages the best thing you can do is to gain her trust feed her good quality kitten chow so that she has all the protein and nutrition she needs to feed them well purina is good and pet the kittens when she starts bringing them to you the kittens will be much easier to find homes for if they are used to people my two beautiful cats were kittens from stray moms who had them they are both very wonderful because they were socialized very well to love and trust humans http cats about com od kittencare ss track weeks htm here is very good advice for you as well as good pictures and what to expect of the babies at each week by the way talk to a vet about possible fleas if you see the mom or babies scratching some over the counter medications are too strong and are dangerous to a normal cat let alone to a nursing mom Guinea pig Garfield Ferret Kitten Phoebe Buffay's songs Dog Pet skunk Feral cat RuneScape quests Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Childbirth Pregnancy Ralston Purina Company Neighbours Coeliac disease Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kodocha Fancy rat Elephant EastEnders Flea Stomach cancer Piccolo Junior Saga Hey Jude Nutrition The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Friends Cliff Richard Obstetrics Girly Nestl__ Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Domestic rabbit Infant Laura Schlessinger Jon Secada Obesity Chicken Knots Landing Socialization Bat Egg (food) Fasting The Adventures of Pete & Pete Manx (cat) Blue Whale Raw food diet Big Brother UK series 5 Rent (musical) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Folic acid Shaggy dog story The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Terri Schiavo Premature birth Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Code: Lyoko B3ta Atomic Kitten The Inside W.I.T.C.H.
