my cat has turned on my other cat i had my nd cat spayed today and now my first cat is hissing and jumping at the recovering cat this is totally not normal as they usually love each other to bits having been born to the same litter and lived with each other since this is upsetting me to see it and i'm wondering if this is normal i've kept them apart all night and the bully cat was going bezerk let her in this morning and she sniffed and went ape one of her claws ended up embedded in my finger so they're now seperated again as others have said it's because the cat who was spayed has come home from the vet smelling different cats rely very heavily on their sense of smell and your first cat is unsettled of the strange scent that the second cat now has and doesn't know what to make of it when cats feel threatened they have two reactions flight or fight your first cat has chosen the latter option you may need to slowly re introduce them something similar happened to me about six weeks ago when our male cat merlin sneaked outdoors and hid in the engine space of a parked car when i eventually managed to resuce him and brought him back inside i wasn't prepared for the hostile reaction from our female cat sophie she was hissing growling and trying to attack him she was really aggressive i decided to separate them and reintroduce them to each other as if they had never met before sophie had the run of the home allowing her to feel in charge of her territory and i kept merlin in our bedroom overnight with his food water and a litter tray i thought that sophie might have calmed down overnight but no such luck she hissed as soon as she saw him so i let merlin have the run of the house and put sophie in our bedroom for a couple of hours so that she could investigate his smell i also let sophie smell my hands after handling merlin as another way of getting her used to his scent i repeated the room scent swapping process every day until on the fourth day sophie could finally tolerate his presence in the same room as her for about a week or so merlin was still a little wary of being around sophie but things improved on a daily basis and after a couple of weeks their friendship was back to normal now they groom each other and playfight just like they always did i don't know if it helped or not but i also used a feliway spray as they are said to emit pheromones that are soothing to cats be patient it will may take a little while but once their scents become intermingled things will start to improve good luck Cat Pet skunk Dog Domestic rabbit Kakapo Social rule Shaggy dog story Animal communication The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe God Emperor of Dune Ferret Sin City Galaxy Angel Pitaten Poker jargon Fancy rat RuneScape quests The Death Gate Cycle Menstrual cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) House Mouse Ranma __ characters Milton H.
