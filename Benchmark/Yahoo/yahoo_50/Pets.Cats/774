is getting a cat's mouth cleaned expensive i recently wondered about my cat's breath he's older apparently it's could be a health problem could anyone tell me a ball park idea of the vet cost at the clinic i'm at it starts at about pre operative blood work is an option for younger animals but usually required for older ones the cost for that blood work can vary depending on what type of panel the vet recommends at my clinic it starts at about and can get up as high as about for an expanded profile if your cat needs extractions those may also be additional it's also possible that he may even need to go home with antibiotics or start them before the procedure depending on how bad his oral health has become and pain medication is another possible expense especially if extractions are necessary at the clinic i'm at the cost is about for most cats your vet may be completely different of course but hopefully this gives you some idea i know it sounds kind of expensive but it's well worth it Pneumonia Diabetes mellitus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Veterinarian Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Folic acid Guinea pig Hypoglycemia Pet skunk Cancer Halitosis Domestic rabbit Insulin Multiple sclerosis Nutrition Ferret Tooth enamel Growth hormone treatment Chronic fatigue syndrome Medicine HIV test Drug test Medicare (Canada) Food and Drug Administration Migraine Breast cancer Blood transfusion Colorectal cancer Traditional Chinese medicine Aspartame Acne Asthma Cat Drug addiction Sickle-cell disease Fancy rat Stomach cancer Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Lung cancer Gastroesophageal reflux disease First aid Dentistry Dialysis Clinical depression Cannabis (drug) Myocardial infarction Insurance Breastfeeding Abortion Tuberculosis Physical therapy Physician Paracetamol National Health Service Radiation therapy Oral contraceptive Lethal injection Cardiovascular disease Raw food diet Medical cannabis Education in Australia Medical analysis of circumcision Randomness Pharmaceutical company Shrimp farm International Phonetic Alphabet Aspergillosis Medical school Childbirth Chlorpromazine Ebola Needle aspiration biopsy Tobacco smoking Animal testing Divorce Hypnosis Health insurance Asbestos Tocopherol Atherosclerosis Rabies Microeconomics Stroke Nuclear power Shock Low density lipoprotein Sleep apnea Clomipramine Dental caries Stem cell Computed tomography Positron emission tomography Balance disorder Compiler optimization Mesothelioma Chiropractic Group A streptococcal infection
