how do i stop my cat from urinating around the house here's my dilemma we have two cats male and female two year old siblings the female urinates around the house quite often i'm aware that this is a typical problem given the situation and we have tried seperating their litter boxes spraying anti peeing spray in her favorite watering holes and so on the big problem now is that i am buying a brand new house and will be buying new furniture i need to find a sure fire remedy to this problem before she starts destroying our new stuff p s they are indoor cats p p s both fixed it sounds ongoing so i'm assuming that you've had her checked for a uti if she sometimes uses the litterbox make sure that you're cleaning it often she might be extra picky about such things if she avoids it altogether you might try a different litter or just more litter i had a cat that peed all over my apartment because i wasn't putting enough litter in the box and another that hated the crystals litter so she peed everywhere but the box you might experiment with different boxes too some cats hate the enclosed kind and some don't care some like the kind with high walls and some like the shallow boxes if she's a small cat she might be having trouble getting into the box Hamster Cat Fancy rat Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Toilet Poker jargon Tobacco smoking Shaggy dog story Star Trek Customizable Card Game Kitchen Thermal power station Toilet humour Phoebe Buffay's songs Guinea pig Urinary incontinence Urine Diseases of the honeybee Genericized trademark Kurt Cobain Dog Friends Particle in a box W.I.T.C.H.
