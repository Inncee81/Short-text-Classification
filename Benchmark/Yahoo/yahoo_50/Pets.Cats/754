how soon will a female cat mate after she has delivered a litter of kittens i am looking after a stray female cat with month old kittens i have noticed that she has started to leave them occasionally i want to get her spayed but i do not want to rush into it because i was told after she is absent at the vet she or her kittens might reject each other so i want to wait for a little while longer when the kittens are big enough to be on their own in case she rejects them i am now concerned that she may be mating again do you know whether that is possible its possible my cat had a litter of kittens about months ago and months later she was pregnant again and we have another litter now her kittens are old enough now that they will probably be fine without the mother i gave the kittens away when they were months old after being away from them for a while she might not like having them there but she will do that no matter how old the kittens are alot of animals do that but i dont think she will be gone long enough for her to reject them Kitten Cat Manx (cat) Feral cat Guinea pig Socialization Ferret Atomic Kitten Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Tigon Garfield Cheetah Feral Lion Red Squirrel Panthera hybrid The Aristocats Big Brother UK series 5 Liger Pregnancy RuneScape quests Kakapo Species Japanese Bobtail (cat) Black panther Clouded Leopard Leopard Cat Tick Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Cats (musical) European Rabbit Cornish Rex Hamster Puma Nerpa Abu Dhabi Treecat Silly Symphonies Louis Wain Housebreaking Serval Estrus cycle Toxoplasmosis House Mouse Asiatic Golden Cat Phoebe Buffay B3ta Kodocha Cuteness Azumanga Daioh Heartworm Rabbit Lynx Ralston Purina Company Purr Kangaroo Badly Drawn Kitties Bengal cat Red Fox Lie Bast (goddess) Ocean's Twelve Selective breeding Animal communication Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Ostrich Pet store The Cat in the Hat Platypus Internet phenomenon Feline leukemia virus Girly Marc Antony and Pussyfoot StarCraft: Hybrid Neighbours Sex assignment Schapelle Corby Richard Chase Garfield: His 9 Lives Chocolate Lazarus Long Garfield and Friends Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Catgirl Giant Panda Animal shelter Tasmanian Devil Feral cat colony Fancy rat Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Abortion debate Chinchilla Ren and Stimpy Spider Stoat Pok__mon Live!
