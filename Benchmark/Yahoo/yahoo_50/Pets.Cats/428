we are adopting a kitten and are concerned about the furniture should we declaw we are concerned about the aftereffects on the kitten when a cat is declawed the vet does not removed his fingernails the vet amputates his fingers at the first joint some people consider this a mutilation and i think the aspca agreed with that assessment several years ago claws as you know are a cat's first line of defense and also the way they catch their food they snag it when the claws are removed in declawing the cat moves to his second line of defense he bites and declawed cats often become biters so people then have them defanged that may be okay for indoor cats but indoor cats regularly shoot out an open door or meander out into a summer night through an open window and either don't or can't find their way home a defanged and declawed cat without a home is a helpless creature who can neither defend himself nor hunt when cats sharpen their claws which is the thing they do to furniture that leaves it in tatters they are not sharpening their claws at all the claws grow from a cuticle at its base just as do your fingernails only they grow faster and the cuticle pulls at the claw as it grows this is apparently an uncomfortable sensation so the cat digs its claws into a treetrunk or an overstuffed chair and pulls to loosen the cuticle and free the claw there is also an emotional clawing you pull out a fun toy or the cat hears your footsteps coming down the hall and the cat excitedly digs in to the scratching post or carpet just inside the door you do not have to have your cat declawed to keep him from scratching the furniture all you have to do is trim his claws his front claws once every week to ten days there are cat claw clippers available at pet supply stores and all the cat care books tell you not to use human toenail clippers because they can split the claw but i always used human toenail clippers if you buy the professional ones you can trim down closer to the quick but i was always a coward about getting too close to the quick i just took off the points here's what you do you sit the cat on your lap and i do mean sit him with his backbone perpendicular to your pelvis and parallel to your backbone and his back against your tummy then push in on the palm of his paw to express his claws and just clip the points off his claws if you train your kitten to expect this he will never cause you a minute's problem my cat used to sit like a gentleman in a spa for his weekly manicure we did it every sunday when you remove the points from your cat's claws his claws cannot pierce your furniture and if he should be playing with you and play smack you on the face his claws cannot pierce your skin either still your cat does need to sharpen his claws so you should get him a scratching post and because his claws are no longer rapier sharp you need to get him a scratching post made of a material that his claws will be able to dig in to so he can loosen the cuticle so you get him a good sisal scratching post you can buy him the traditional sort of phallic scratching post with a nice wide base so he can get a good tug when he digs in to the vertical piece but they also have these sisal i don't know what to call them humps like an upside down kind of flattened u with a little effort you can mount one of these on the wall just above the baseboard in the room he will haunt the most in addition to the mainstay scratching post i also bought a bunch of those cardboard three inch wide cheapie scratching posts and mounted them on doors just beneath the doorknob using double stick mounting tape in rroms where he would do emotional scratching like on the entry door rub all the scratching posts with catnip so he smears his scent on them and that is how you avoid a vet bill for surgery and train your cat to scratch his furniture and not yours it really really works too Nail (anatomy) Volleyball Ferret Pet skunk Manicure Hamster Knife Upholstery Strap-on dildo
