elderly cat not eating or drinking just constantly licking lips i have a male cat of about sixteen years of age for that past few days as far as i can tell he hasn't eaten very much at all and i cant remember him drinking either he is constantly licking his lips and occasionaly heaves and meows with what i assume to be discomfort but nothing comes up he has really been a house cat for the last few years mainly due to his age so shouldn't of eaten anything nasty the only thing is he was treated with frontline flea treatment about a week ago if petted he will purr and makes an effort to be sociable so in some ways he is himself he has always been a thin cat and over the last twelve months become frailer on his feet i am very worried about him and dont want him to suffer can anyone offer any sort of sensible advice i know that taking him to the vets is the best option and i would pay whatever it cost to make him comfortable but fear the stress of that would be too much for him as he is a timid creature in the past he has lost a few teeth naturaly so toothache has crossed my mind however i can feel around his jaw and it doesnt appear to present any sort of discomfort to him at this point he really needs a vet there is nothing else you can do in this situation it could be kidney failure dental disease or any number of other problems go today Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tooth Garfield Psoriasis Fancy rat Socialization Fecal incontinence Guinea pig Anorexia nervosa Tooth enamel Urinary incontinence Unemployment Mouth ulcer Spanking Domestic rabbit Ferret Dental brace Elephant Dog Pet skunk Bat Taboo food and drink Gray Wolf Minor Harry Potter Beasts Acupuncture Red Dwarf characters Singlish Chronic fatigue syndrome Theory of conduct Infantilism Stuttering Dehydration Halitosis Dental caries Book of Isaiah Prostate cancer Hamster The Fairly OddParents Maine Coon Anxiety Insomnia Hypoglycemia Flea Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Oral sex Breastfeeding Animal communication Coeliac disease Medicine Milton H.
