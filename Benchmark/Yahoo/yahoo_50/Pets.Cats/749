should i put my cat down or not my cat oscar of years was recently diagnosed with feline aids im gutted and devastated the vet thinks i should put him down as his quality of life will be poor suffering from one infection after another he is quite i'll and has a tumur on his leg loss of appitite etc the thing is i don't think i can bring myself to put him down a couple months ago i started working at an animal hospital as a vet tech and i have seen a few cats come n with feline aids as much as i hate to say this putting the cat down would probly be the better choice for your cat if he is already very sick he will only get worse as time goes on overall i honestly think he would appreciate doing so before working at the vet i would have told you not to put him down but now that i understand how the cats are affected by this disease and seeing the cats that come in with it i realized that its either put him down now or let him suffer and continue to wear down i am soooo very sorry to hear about your cat and i know this has to be hard for you but just keep in mind that what ever desicion you make u made it because u felt thats what would be best for your cat Feral cat Chronic fatigue syndrome Garfield Rabies Ferret Simone Weil Hearing impairment 2000 Australian Grand Prix Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Neighbours Feline Panleukopenia Time Out of Mind Heartworm Pitaten Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Philadelphia Eagles Tuberculosis Babe Ruth Parkinson's disease M__ni__re___s disease Multiple sclerosis Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Fox hunting Guinea pig Doraemon 2005 Kashmir earthquake Myxobolus cerebralis Ranma __ characters Felix the Cat Tooth enamel Toxoplasmosis Sin City Veterinarian Felidae Phoebe Buffay's songs Anorexia nervosa Sharon Tate Obsessive-compulsive disorder John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Kodocha Cat Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Cat in the Hat Jiddu Krishnamurti Bipolar disorder Clinical depression One Piece minor characters Traumatic incident reduction AIDS Hearing aid Richard Feynman Procrastination The nature of God in Western theology Dog Fancy rat Cheetah Tobacco smoking About a Boy Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog EastEnders Traumatic brain injury Infantilism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Church of Christ, Scientist Dr. Seuss Dyslexia Rammstein Equine conformation Luck Cat Stevens Medicine Tom and Jerry (MGM) RuneScape quests Pneumonia Alcoholics Anonymous Rent (musical) Felis sapiens Milton H.
