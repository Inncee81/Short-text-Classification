just a fun question for cat lovers why do cats bring home mice and other little creatures uneaten do you think its 'cause the treats at home taste better than wild kills wait a minute sararoy i have two cats that are kept indoors i am asking a question for fun and not to get some totally random pointers because cats don't always hunt to eat they hunt because it's their nature to hunt also they like to leave gifts for their humans my kitty used to be an office cat we needed a mouser and she was great at it she always left them for the people she liked which i became one of once she got to know me eventually i became the one who took care of her all the time and most of the mice were left for me she left them mostly dead then all dead then headless i asked a friend of mine who'd always had cats and was involved in the humane society what that meant why the progression she said she wasn't sure about the headless but there was a reason for the mostly dead then all dead my kitty was telling me she loved me but i was a moron the first one was mostly dead so i could finish it off and have a lovely meal the second one was all dead so i could have a lovely meal but since i was too stupid to figure out how to finish it off myself i turned girly and called a guy in she would just kill it for me now that she's a house cat and has no more mice to kill she leaves me her favorite toys where i can find them Cat Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Poker jargon Pitaten Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) RuneScape quests The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Taboo food and drink Animal rights Invader Zim Ghost The Three Musketeers Recurring South Park characters Trailer Park Boys Random Harvest Tiger Treehouse of Horror V The Invisibles Anna Karenina The Lovely Bones Dog Kevin and Kell The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) EastEnders Jumpstart 3rd Grade South Park Death Note YuYu Hakusho Black Sabbath The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Minstrel show Meaning of life Kindaichi Case Files Girly Elektra (comics) Shannara creatures About a Boy Futurama (TV series - season 2) 613 mitzvot Survivor (novel) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Knots Landing Rose (Doctor Who) Mickey Mouse Sherlock Holmes Social rule Dilbert Chicken Ferret Bob and George Narnia Friends Witch-hunt Death (personification) Baxter Stockman Ren and Stimpy The Cat in the Hat Houston Astros Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Mouse (computing) Dr. Seuss Angel Sanctuary Care Bears Characters of The Sandman One Tree Hill (TV series) Badly Drawn Kitties Shadowcat Time Out of Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Catscratch Livestock History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Neo (The Matrix) Eric Cartman Joke Micronauts Trigun characters Shot of Love The Death Gate Cycle Sea-Monkey Phoebe Buffay's songs Incarnations of Immortality Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Baldrick Sin City John the Baptist Mabinogion Theory of conduct Peter Griffin Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist ReBoot
