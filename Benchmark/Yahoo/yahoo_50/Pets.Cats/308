help my cat got out well about weeks ago one of my friends let my cat out she came back but starting acting really wierd she started to eat her own poo and now she has worms what made her do this i always keep the cat box clean i love this cat and i cant afford to bring her to a vet they want to charge me over is there an alternative other then giving her away if i knew that i was going to be broke years ago i would not have saved this cats life and i would have just let it die out in the cold if u want to be an a about it this is quite unusual i've heard of dogs eating their own poo and dogs eating cats' poo but not a cat eating it's own there are many reasons why a pet might choose to eat its own faeces such as dietary deficiencies anxiety an inherited trait or maybe because they just enjoy the taste the truth is that no one really knows why this occurs try ringing your vet and explaining the problem and asking if they have a product that you could add to the cat's food this may stop her from eating her poo otherwise when she does her poo i presume she's normally an inside cat you could sprinkle her poo with something nasty like cayenne pepper to get her out of the habit also you need to treat her worms asap that is the real problem here make sure you buy a good worming treatment really soon as it's dangerous for her and she could easily die if not treated good luck Conker's Bad Fur Day Ron and Fez Taboo food and drink Fancy rat Hamster Dog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Garfield Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Guinea pig Chocolate Ferret Cat Anorexia nervosa Feces One Piece minor characters Stomach cancer Pitaten Insulin Ron Weasley Salad Fingers Shit Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Folic acid Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Fairly OddParents Fecal incontinence Diabetes mellitus Kakapo Hot dog Coeliac disease Lisa the Vegetarian Toilet humour Red Hot Chili Peppers Food Tooth enamel Traumatic brain injury Diarrhea EastEnders Ecco the Dolphin Animal rights Vegetarianism Veganism Rabies Borderline personality disorder RuneScape quests Obesity Piccolo Junior Saga Red Dwarf characters Kashrut Jewish cuisine Crohn's disease Omega-3 fatty acid The Cat in the Hat Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Unclean animals Sin City Cuisine of Denmark Nutrition Girly Futurama (TV series - season 5) Toxoplasmosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Kodocha Kenny McCormick Friends Timeline of alternative rock Hypoglycemia Neighbours Rocko's Modern Life Tofu Socialization Dave Lister Coprophagia Stuttering The Perishers Ascariasis Hedgehog Care Bears Korean cuisine Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Dog training Bread Manx (cat) Chile pepper Domestication Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Jonathan Archer Hearing impairment Phoebe Buffay's songs Vampire Diseases of the honeybee The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Docking
