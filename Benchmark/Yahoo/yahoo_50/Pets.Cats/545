my cat wails at night when carrying his toy why my cat is about yrs old and has been doing this for several years now he only does it in the middle of the night and only when he is carrying an old toy this toy is like a sock with the end of it tied i throw it in a corner in the living room and every night he finds it and carries it in his mouth across the room and does this weird wailing while he is carrying it if i wake up and hear him i call out to him and he brings it to me then stops the wailing if i don't hear him he just drops it in the middle of the living room he does this every night without fail he is healthy so i think it is just a behavioral issue i have spoken to my vet about this and she said one of her cats wails too but she has no idea why can anyone tell me why he does this i read some of the answers to a simular posting but it doesn't seem to fit him i need to add that he starts out sleeping with me but then searches for his toy in the middle of the night finds it and wails my cat oreo loves poof balls he does what i call talking to his toy just like when a baby will bring his her favorite toy and babble to you cats are nocturnal so they're up at night roaming and playing your cat is merely talking to his toy or loudly calling out for you to come play or come see what he's doing my other two cats don't do this but oreo does i had a cat a long time ago that went outdoors and max was his name would bring my mom a bug or a bird that he just caught and he would sit out in the driveway looking into the kitchen window where my mom would be holding onto what ever he had caught and he would cry out to her very loudly he was looking for her praise approval so adorable so your cat doesn't have behavioral issues he's just talking this isn't something to be concerned about too bad cats can't do this during the day lol Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Phoebe Buffay's songs RuneScape quests Avenue Q Garfield Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Columbine High School massacre The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Late Night with Conan O'Brien Miss Saigon Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jam (TV series) Pok__mon Live!
