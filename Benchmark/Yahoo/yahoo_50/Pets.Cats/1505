i have a month old kitten who pees on my bed some times she was born at the foot of my bed that's where her momma felt comfortable i guess she used to go there every day no it's only once in a while after i got a new bed any ideas on how i can stop this honey it sounds like you need to get her fixed she smells your scent it's the strongest on your bed so that's where she pees i only know this because i had a little female kitten years ago that did the same thing she would literally hop up on the bed and pee twice she did this on me as i was under the covers it was really annoying the vet said i needed to get her fixed i did and she stopped doing it it has something to do with marking their territory and smelling your scent or the scent or feeling in her case of her momma getting her fixed will increase her lifespan so i'd recommend just going ahead and doing that before you run out of fabric detergent good luck kitties are the best Cat Ferret American Black Bear Mattress Kakapo Sin City EastEnders Guinea pig American lobster Fancy rat Poker jargon Angel One (TNG episode) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Stop and Smell the Roses Dog Shit Trademark Kitten Pet skunk Shark Felis sapiens Strap-on dildo Garfield Sampling (music) Ron and Fez Proprioception The Critic Atomic Kitten Social rule Phoebe Buffay's songs Perfume Milton H.
