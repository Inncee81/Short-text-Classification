i have a new kitten help i've just had a new week old kitten who has settled in fine my god but he never stops playing but i have some problems my other cat who is about a year old is doing the usual hissing spitting but seemed to be calming down until kitten found his feet and decided he wasn't scared of the older cat and is now terrorising her she now spends most of her time outside and is reluctant to come in to eat or sleep she has been hiding in my spare room and i've been feeding her in there so she can eat in peace am i doing the right thing i'm also concerened about how much new kitten is eating i'm feeding him on a mixture of felix pouches and dry food but how many pouches per day should he be eating and is he ok to go through the night without eating what's the best thing to do for kitten and also mog my older cat you are doing great cats are territorial animals and your new kitten is the intruder as far as your adult cat is concerned the hissing etc is perfectly normal it's great that you are giving your adult cat some kitten free space but don't forget to give lots of love too equal amounts to both if possible typically kittens of that age should be eating about ounces of wet food a day when dry food is given in addition to wet the cut the wet food amounts in half it's perfectly ok for your kitten to go all night with out food but just make sure there is always plenty of water available your kitten and adult cat will work out their territories on their own sounds like they are off to a good start it will just take time Kitten Hamster Domestic rabbit Garfield Phoebe Buffay's songs Atomic Kitten Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape quests Ferret Cats (musical) Shark Brown Bear Feral cat Kitchen Pitaten Dog Fecal incontinence 613 mitzvot Fancy rat Characters of The Sandman Kakapo Chocolate Capercaillie Treecat Little Britain Gramophone record The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kangaroo Shaggy dog story Fire fighting Vampire Big Brother UK series 5 One Tree Hill (TV series) Weather lore Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Social rule Thermal power station John the Baptist Comanche RuneScape skills The Amber Spyglass Ron and Fez Urinary incontinence About a Boy Hypoglycemia Campfire Koala Microeconomics Puma RuneScape locations Okashina Okashi Chinese New Year Coconut crab Feral Piccolo Junior Saga Taboo food and drink Binge eating disorder Veganism Rod Stewart The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Tooth Ranma __ characters Taikyoku shogi Red Squirrel Seabird Sushi Climate of the United Kingdom John Forsythe Ham Rayman Animal communication Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Characters in the Smurfs Double entendre 2000 Australian Grand Prix InuYasha Chicken Trailer Park Boys Girly Passover Frog Azumanga Daioh Metaphysics Badly Drawn Kitties Kodocha Time Out of Mind FoxTrot The Time Machine Rabbit The Emancipation of Mimi Tasmanian Devil Xiaolin Showdown
