lost my cat for weeks my outdoors cat has been missing for weeks and i'm freaking out he has been spayed and he was is an outdoors cat sometimes he'd stay out overnight or for long stretches of time but never more than a few hours i've already tried putting up lost posters in a few neighbors' mailboxes and at animal clinics but no luck so far i've also searched what seems to be like everywhere on my property and i call him everyday too hope is getting thin what else can i do for him and how long should it be before i really really worry about his life or what are the chances of him coming back alive and well at this point edit he's also declawed on his front two paws plus some relatives of mine visited stayed in my house for a month of so and he disappeared weeks after that so that may have been related to his absence they're gone now though he was originally an indoors cat for about a year after we got him i've had him for years but he meowed so loudly to get out everyday that i just had to let him out i trusted him to stay around our property which he did though he does enjoy wandering over to our neighbors' he's only been out for a few hours before he can catch birds and even sometimes drinks our pool water i know that means i need to provide him with higher quality water but i haven't seen any hint of that happening thanks to everyone that answered so far the chances of your cat still being alive are higher than you'd think but the chances of you finding him are slim sounds like your doing all you can and hopefully you'll find him there are plenty of miracle stories to give you hope you'll find him edit if he's been gone that long before that gives him a much higher chance i was assumming he'd never been away that long its not good that he's declawed Shaggy dog story Social rule Poker jargon 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pet skunk New York Giants The Inside Housebreaking Dog RuneScape quests Hiking Ferret Ra (board game) Big Brother (USA TV series) The Joker's Wild Stomach cancer Animal Crossing Garfield Marching band Animism Swimming pool Tag Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wheel of Fortune The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dog training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Luck Friends Richard Chase Kakapo Kitten Houseplant Knife Physical paradox Feral cat The Smoking Room Rose (Doctor Who) Goodness and value theory The Contender (television series) Extinction Rais massacre Sant Thakar Singh Snooker Gerald Durrell Roanoke Island Fancy rat Jon Secada A Day in the Life Catwoman Maneki Neko Doomsday argument The Pilgrim's Progress Socialization Avalanche USS Yorktown (CV-10) EastEnders Guinea pig Ocean's Twelve Domestic rabbit AFI 100 Years series Muslim ibn Aqeel The Amber Spyglass Species Prostate cancer Incarnations of Immortality Alex Ferguson Miss Saigon 2005 Belgian Grand Prix The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ron and Fez Big Brother UK series 6 Avenue Q Singlish Terri Schiavo Mid-levels Drowning 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships Cleveland Browns Jeopardy!
