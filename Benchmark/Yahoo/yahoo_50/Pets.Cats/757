i ahave a young cat a tortie and my seven year mentally retareded sister comes over to pet her the cat will appear to be enjoying herself then suddely jump up and scratch the poor girl in the face one time she scratched her eyelid the girl is still allowed to pet her but only once or twice then she has to stop why does kitty flip out like that uh staight down the line inever said she was rough with her i think your the ding bat the two are always closely supervised actually the cat is healthy as a horse except for having half solid half soft stools occasionally and she's going to the vet this am for a shot to clear that up good anawer susan w you too matt c the cat never freaks out on me but she does have a limit for petting i have had my sister to pet my arm like she's petting the cat and the petting doesn't seems like it's too much pressure but it could be for the cat normally the cat appears to be glad to see her and approaches her for a pet and even flops on her side for more pets to avoid future attacks she has to stop petting after about thirty seconds so far that has worked well also she's not allowed to lean in close anymore getting some really good answers thanks my brother's young lab that is scared of everybody and his own shadow will follow her around for hours torties can be difficult cats i have two now and have owned others in the past none of them have been ones to like being petted the older one i have now used to lie on her back and invite to have you rub her tummy she would then nip your hand the younger one does not like being stroked at all but likes to be around and to sleep on the bed with me or my daughter one i had when my eldest now was little and she would strike out for no reason as for your sister being rough i doubt that very much specially as she would be supervised intellectually disabled people and animals have a special bond and the animals are usually very gentle i honestly believe it is the cat and not your sister hopefully as your cat gets older and matures she will mellow next time the cat misbehaves put her in time out then let her out after a while usually this will help to modify the behavior Ranma __ characters Dog Azumanga Daioh Guinea pig Volleyball Hamster Sin City Fancy rat 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Tenchi Muyo!
