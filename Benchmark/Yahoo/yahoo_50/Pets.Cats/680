how can i train my cat to come home when called i was going to keep my month old kitten indoors and train him into a housecat but i do think its slightly cruel especially as i have a small place so how can i let him out in the morning when i go to work and train him to come home when i get back at he has a fav toy which i can rattle when i get home to call him but how can i begin to teach him that this noise is his home time and what if he doesnt come i'd be gutted if i lost him i agree with what alot have posted i dont want to let him out of my sight i used to have him in the garden with a leash and he never went far so we go out without it now and he doesn't stray far from me but if i'm not in sight he may go too far and get lost i'll wait a while yet don't worry i do live on a busy road in the town so theres a chance of being run over or attacked by cruel drunks i'll wait alot longer before i risk it if i do at all thank you i wonder that too we only take my cat out on a harness and leash we stay out there and read or garden when she is out she was a little hesitant about the harness at first but now she likes it because she associates it with going outside Dog training Cat Atomic Kitten Ferret Feral cat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sears Holdings Corporation Archery Housebreaking RuneScape quests Night (book) Tag Kitesurfing U.S. Highway 1 Dog agility Boom Town (Doctor Who) Tenshinhan Swimming pool Strap-on dildo Poker jargon Socialization Saki Ben Johnson (athlete) USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Falconry Operation Market Garden Obedience training Shaggy dog story USS Whale (SS-239) Knots Landing Kitten Fencing Leash Singlish Lechaina Johnny 5 Volleyball RuneScape locations Apollo 8 Manx (cat) Prostate cancer Futurama (TV series - season 5) Paragliding Avenue Q Toy Story 2 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Social rule Kodocha Equine conformation Nepeta Futurama (TV series - season 2) WCBS-FM Airport Satchel Paige Rain Man Fancy rat American football Feral USS Waters (DD-115) Surveillance Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Natural Selection (computer game) USS Tunny (SS-282) Billboard Hot 100 Battles of Lexington and Concord Beetle in an Anthill Aladdin (1992 film) Dog EastEnders Second Sight (video game) Hamster SMTV Live Full Metal Panic?
