how do i introduce my new pup to my cat we just bought a month old cockapoo and she will be picked up two weeks from now has to get fixed and has one shot to go this gives us time to prepare my cat is a yr old orange tabby who is super spoiled he spends more time in my room than in my brother's and my parent's so we have decided to not let the dog come into my room since it is kinda the cat's room the only thing is i don't know how to introduce them my cat is very friendly he is just really picky when it comes to picking friends and is an indoor outdoor cat who mostly hangs w cats so i don't know how he will first react someone told me to have them greet outside and the dog should be in his crate so that the cat will get first sniff someone else said that i should not be carrying or be petting the pup when my cat is around the first two days so he doesn't get too jelous and seek revenge and to not force their meeting what worries me is the size of the pup compared to the size of my kitty kitty has claws p i've done this with a german shepherd pup and my cat the cat was very freaked out to begin with but they are curious by nature and will want to see what the new addition to the family is doing my cat followed the puppy around but she was sneaky about it the puppy was afraid of the cat to begin with but soon they were used to each other i wouldn't worry about the cat having claws if the pup gets out of line the cat will put her in her place quickly i think i would have preferred that my cat had claws when doing this i think the idea of letting the cat see and sniff the pup while she's still in a carrier is a good idea it will make the cat feel more secure good luck Cat Garfield Dog training Dog Housebreaking Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Care Bears Shaggy dog story Ron Weasley Guinea pig Hamster Friends Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye The Smoking Room Our Gang Mixed-breed dog Ben Johnson (athlete) Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Humphrey Bogart 101 Dalmatians: The Series Social rule Ed, Edd n Eddy One Tree Hill (TV series) Johnny 5 Felix the Cat The Contender (television series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Socialization Jam (TV series) Galaxy Angel The Fairly OddParents StarCraft: Uprising Pet skunk Ren and Stimpy Badly Drawn Kitties Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reservoir Dogs Vegeta Sin City Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Piccolo Junior Saga Great Teacher Onizuka Knots Landing Elvis Presley Steven Wright Lady and the Tramp The Adventures of Pete & Pete Trailer Park Boys Kim Possible Okashina Okashi Serenity (Firefly episode) EastEnders The Critic The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ultimate Spider-Man Eddie Guerrero The Death Gate Cycle Spidey Super Stories Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) One Piece minor characters The Inside Taikyoku shogi Smallville (Season 4) Little Britain Characters in the Smurfs Nintendo Nintendogs Tom Goes to the Mayor Beethoven (film) Mark Calaway Taxi Driver The Family from One End Street Maison Ikkoku Oh My Goddess!
