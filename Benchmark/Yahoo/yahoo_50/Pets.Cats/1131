cat hissing please help very concerned i took my year old cat to the vets today to get his shots updated when we got home our other cat he is months old started hissing and growling at the cat who went to the vets and at myself this was about hours ago and it has not stopped at all any help regarding what i can do about this would be great thanks my guess is the cat that went to the vet and you smell funny to the other cat it would be just like introducing the all over again the younger cat can smell the vet on you and the older cat and it is strange and scarry the younger one may avoid the of you for a couple days you could try luring the younger one with canned food or a treat or something if the younger one is hissing when either one of you approach and generally avoiding you it is because he is scared sometimes they take a while to get over it watch the younger cat and see if he is sneaking up on the older one like he wants to see it but does not want to get too close if so that is a pretty good indication that given time things should get back to normal of my cats one hissed at our new dog for a month now he hugs and plays with him i usually have a cat fight if i take one cat to the vet and not the other as long as there is just hissing and growling and no inguries i usually do not worry about it too much it usually resolves it's self with mine the best way to get them over the thinking the other cat is strange is by giving them all wet food it changes their mind set and by the time they are done eating they realize it is still the same cat Cat Garfield Dog training Sin City Shaggy dog story Phoebe Buffay's songs Kakapo Social rule Fancy rat Cockroach Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Milton H.
