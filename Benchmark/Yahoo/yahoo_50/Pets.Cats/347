very naughty cat constant meowing clawing it's miserable i have a year old male neutered cat i can't stand the thing he meows constantly all night long at my door if i let him in the room he meows and wakes up the baby month old i put him outside he literally ripped up the screens on the windows trying to get back inside the house he is a complete nightmare of an animal he clawed the rug under my door and shredded it up i can't put him in the bathroom he tore up the bathroom and ended up cutting his arm shoving it under the door hole and got a nasty infection that cost me to fix i can't stand this animal i've tried sprays to foils to water nothing works i even had him neutered to try to remedy i got a second cat for a companion too she's a good cat but he still acts up i am about ready to just drive it far away and dump it i don't know what to do the pounds here won't take in anymore cats i can't get rid of it please help i think he might have some type of personality disorder or ocd to make him do this i've never had a cat act like this before the worse of it's from am am he keeps everyone awake it's terrible he's done it before the other cat came n the picture and before the baby was born we shrugged it off as kitten behavior it's only gotten worse my husbands going to drive him out to the country if this doesn't stop http www petmeds com pdetail asp sk sp cat mg would i cut the pill in half if i was to try some anti aniexty meds it says mg per every lb of the cat he's about lbs so mg the pills come in mg half would be mg don't want to overdose he gets attention plenty of it it's not humane we have to have our screens shredded bathroom terrorized awake all night long etc we have tried everything for it craigslist doesn't do animal ads if i gave this animal away in this condition the next owner might not be so kind and just put it down if this cat turned it's aggressive ocd behavior onto our son omg so we want to find a cure for how this cat behaves or it has to get the boot my husbands friend lives out in the country on a large piece of land and he was going to drop him off there it's a lot better than a death sentance or the animal possibly hurting our son the baby is months old the cats been acting up like this since we got it as a kitten in april something is wrong with this cat i'm even willing to try medication but my husband he's had enough my son got scratched today during one of this cats fits we can't segregate the animal because he only hurts himself and our rooms put an ad on petfinder i doubt i'll get any bites on it but worth the try believe it or not you can use obedience training to help you with that keep him awake all day if he acts up spray him with some water and redirect him to something positive like a scratching post if he paws under the door slap his paws gently correction and redirection are key tell him no loudly to spook him and make him do something you want him to do use cat treats or tuna as a reward when he does what you want this method will take some time and patents but it works also try spending some more time petting and playing with him when he does what you want i also suggest cat care books Cat Ferret Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Garfield RuneScape quests Dog Dog training The Amber Spyglass Sin City Social rule Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Rabies Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obsessive-compulsive disorder The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jon Secada Poker jargon Characters in the Smurfs Codename: Kids Next Door Windows XP Housebreaking Feral cat Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist 2000 Australian Grand Prix EastEnders Friends Knots Landing Oh My Goddess!
