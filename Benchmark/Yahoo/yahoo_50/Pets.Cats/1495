i can't take my cat with me i'm going to my mom very soon for about a month my cat is almost years old i never been away from her for even a day and i've had her since she was a kitten i'm i'm really attached to her so much that when i migrated i took her with me even though it was a very hard task since certain countries has certain regulations about taking pets along very difficult i can't take her with me when i go to see my mom my mom is in my home country do you think my cat will run away or go looking for me when i'm not there my dad plays with her as much as i do my dad goes to work in the morning feed her come back at lunch time feed her in the evening he feeds her too and plays with her often so i hope she will be satisfied with just my dad company but i'm scared that my cat runs away go looking for me i'm also scared that when i get back she might forget me what do u think i'd prefer cat owners to answer my post pls basically make sure your dad keeps your place secured and locked up when he is not there so she doesn't escape it's hard to tell how a cat may react they're very individualist animals so no one cat will act the same as another however cats are also attached to places as well as people unlike dogs who mostly just attach to people so i doubt she'll want to leave a familiar place especially when she's being fed and taken care of she'll likely kind of forget about you in a matter of days but she'll recall you quickly enough when you come back i left my cat behind for months and she needed a couple days and familiar responses interactions from me but she remembered me again Feral cat Cat Pet skunk Garfield Socialization The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Shaggy dog story Pitaten Social rule Ferret Strap-on dildo The Fairly OddParents Breastfeeding Dog training Grandview, U.S.A.
