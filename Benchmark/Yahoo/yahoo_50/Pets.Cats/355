a question a bout kittens and litter training i just adopted a week old from the pound and he has been very good about going in the box for the week i have ahd him but today when i cam home from work he pooped in a plastic grocery bag i had on the couch now i am worried he goes other places when i am not home how can i teach him that he should just go in the litter box not that plus other places it's hard to answer your question without knowing a bit more but if he's been going in the box already then he understands the concept and maybe he just needs it reinforced mama cats teach their kittens to go in the box by putting them in the box and then not letting them out until they go you might try that but it just might be that he pooped somewhere else because he was upset because he missed you he's still just a baby after all don't panic just keep at it consistency is the best teacher of all good luck Pet skunk Cat Hamster Toilet humour Dog training Kitten The Contender (television series) Discordianism Socrates Ron and Fez Martial art Boxing training Shit Social rule Mixed martial arts The Jazz Singer Guinea pig The Catcher in the Rye Garfield Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Joke African American Vernacular English Milton H.
