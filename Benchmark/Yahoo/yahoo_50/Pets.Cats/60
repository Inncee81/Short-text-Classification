how do cat's purr just wondering my cat also talks to his little lobster toy mostly in the middle of the night he grabs it in his mouth walks around the house and then sets it down in front of him and starts making these noises it's kind of like yodelling because the pitch goes up anyone else's cat do something like that lol to be honest even the scientists don't really know how a cat purrs there has been a lot of discussion about purring some vets or scientists don't think purring means anything others think that it does mean the cat is happy it also comes out in cats when they are totally freaked out and dying it seems that purring seems to calm down the cat it seems to be something that vibrates but nobody is really sure where it comes from we jokingly call it the purr box but it does seem to come from somewhere in the throat area but not really sure as far as the cat talking well that's really common more common if you have a siamese cat i have himalayan cats and the persian comes out in their lovely knotted fur but the siamese is their in their voices boy do they talk they talk to us they talk to each other they talk to them selves and they talk to their toys it's a strange sort of speach as you say i'm not sure if i would call it yodelling but the pitch does go up one of my cats is a runt and is totally built wrong and she is the funniest little thing but makes the weirdest sounds she snores at night while she talks she didn't start purring until we had her shaved about weeks ago she loves her new do and loves that we can get to her skin better and just purrs and purrs now but the noises at night can keep us up all night i think all cats make strange sounds i've had loads of cats and they always made weird noises some worse then others but the ones that play with toys do tend to talk to them i think only cats do it more than cats who have other cats to play with somewhere along the line i decided to get to cats and most of the time it has worked out quite well Shaggy dog story Cat Purr Garfield The Inside "Weird Al" Yankovic Guinea pig Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Cheetah Late Night with Conan O'Brien Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
