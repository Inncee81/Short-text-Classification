only for cat owners my mom is having a problem with her cat her cat is a female shes years old about year ago my mom had to incorporate my brother's cat into the household my brother could no longer keep his cat in his house so he gave it to my mom its been a year now and the year old cat has been peeing all over the house i know it has to do with territorial issues the other cat is not at all hostile or peeing my mom doesn't know what to do i volunteered to keep her cat at my house to see how she does my mom can't give the other cat away because my brother would probably get pretty upset even though i think she should get rid of the younger cat do you think she'll pee all over my house i have no pets i would appreciate serious answers there is no way i can take my brother's cat lets just say we are not on speaking terms i meant to tell you that the other cat is years old and shes a female my mom's cat had her own litter box but she has stopped using it cause the younger cat uses both litter boxes there are no guarantees but it seems clearly to be a territorial issue i assume there are two litter boxes as that is almost a necessity i would guess if you took her she would not pee but take one of the litter boxes that she uses and don't clean it take the litter that is in it that way in her new surroundings she will immediately know where the litter box is and recognize that she has used that litter box there may be some accidents at first as sometimes a move can be very stressful cats hate changes and sometimes react strongly but since the situation you have described has been going on for some time it is likely not to change as long as both of them are together by the way my response is predicated on there being no medical issue with the older cat you want that looked into before making any specific plans at the cat could also be showing signs of senility and yes that happens Cat Dog Pet skunk Calvin and Hobbes Domestic rabbit Philosophy of language Kurt Cobain Garfield Manx (cat) Recurring South Park characters The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Shaggy dog story Friends Phoebe Buffay's songs Ren and Stimpy Hamster The Fairly OddParents Fancy rat Guinea pig Tobacco smoking Pitaten Prolog Life insurance The Adventures of Pete & Pete Bill Clinton Democracy The Subtle Knife Cindy Sheehan House Mouse Kim Possible Theory of conduct Litter Arab-Israeli conflict Cat litter Kyle Broflovski Continuation War Public-key cryptography Recurring characters of Futurama Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Schr__dinger's cat Red Dwarf characters Social rule Feral cat Whose Line Is It Anyway?
