what is wrong with him i've had this cat for months and it's been nothing but problems he howls constantly even when he gets attention food water he claws us half to death when we try to eat i've had to put him in the spare room for the night just to get sleep and when he's in there he runs at the door slamming into it and howling for hours straight i have to take sleeping pills just to sleep now he bites and claws when we try to pet him the vet said he's fine health wise but i don't know what to do i need some quiet and sleep i tried spraying water lemon juice yelling etc nothing works what can i do if this keeps up the landlords gonna make me give him away he is fixed we had him fixed as soon as he was old enough so that he wouldn't start spraying i got him from this person who's cat had kittens after the cat was given to her and she couldn't keep them the other one our friend took from her is calm and happy the complete opposite of ours i can't put the cat in the yard because the yard belongs to the apartment building not me where did you get him shelters cats and strays can be feral meaning they haven't been handled by people from a very young age and don't see people as friends they are essentially wild and don't appreciate life as a pet cats are also nocternal meaning they are the most active at night they don't understand that you want to sleep they have things to do so what to do consider cat proofing your fence and making him an outdoor cat give him a dog house for cover and let him be wild especially at night he'll be safe in the yard and not pooping all over the neighborhood Cat Pet skunk Socialization Ferret Garfield Shaggy dog story Guinea pig Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Domestic rabbit Dog Fire fighting Feral Sin City Toilet humour Phoebe Buffay's songs Fancy rat Humphrey Bogart The Fairly OddParents Satchel Paige Skunk The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rabbit Housebreaking Kitten The Smoking Room Friends Thermal power station Pitaten Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Feral child Lady and the Tramp Grandview, U.S.A.
