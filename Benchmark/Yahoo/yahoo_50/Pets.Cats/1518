my cute sweet kitty my kitty looks like a little tiger or some wild cat like not domestic look to her she is super loving and great but she will not take a collor i put it on her twice and she almost broke her jaw on it it got stuck on he lower jaw and any tighter it would have hurt her so we were going to get her chiped any how what do you think i think that being chiped is about right any one know for sure did you get your kitty spayed usually your vet can do it while she's under anesthesia for that and then you don't have to worry about it but if she already is spayed i'd call your vet and then your local animal shelters and see who offers the best prices for chipping just make sure if you do the animal shelter that someone knows exactly what they're doing chipping is definitely a good idea in fact i can't think of one reason why it could be considered a bad thing but as someone else mentioned if your kitty wanders off and someone else picks her up without a collar that person might keep her still that is a long shot and if your cat won't wear a collar don't force it esp if her jaw almost broke yikes you could try every so often to slip it on her maybe when she's sleeping and calm but if not then at least you have the chipping and hopefully if she does wander off she won't go far and everyone will know she's yours good luck and thanks for being a responsible owner Cat Dog Ferret Pet skunk Garfield The Fairly OddParents Kitten Microchip implant (animal) Craps Guinea pig Poker jargon Domestic rabbit Fruits Basket Luck Feral cat Dog training Shark Hello Kitty Pitaten Equine conformation Girly Social rule AFI 100 Years series Inspector Gadget Trailer Park Boys Sin City Knots Landing Ranma __ characters New York Giants Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Something Positive Socialization Humphrey Bogart Happy Tree Friends Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Cleveland Browns Power Rangers Manx (cat) Housebreaking Nintendo Animal rights Galaxy Angel Maneki Neko Darkwing Duck Atari 8-bit family Animal euthanasia Eric Cartman Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Mutts Feral Okashina Okashi Cowboy Bebop Paul Is Dead Twelve Swords of Power New England Patriots Dental brace Great Teacher Onizuka Hearts (game) 1957 World Series Detroit Tigers Animal Badly Drawn Kitties Random Harvest 2000 Australian Grand Prix Little Britain Cheating in poker EastEnders Banana Trigun characters Monster Rancher monsters Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Manual transmission Game show Animism Animal shelter Phoebe Buffay's songs Kodocha Domination & submission (BDSM) Philip J.
