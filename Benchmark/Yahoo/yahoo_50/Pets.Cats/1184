pulling a tooth on a kitten a few days ago my cat looked like it broke its bottom canine tooth i was hanging out of his mouth hurting his lip in the process it was only hanging on by a piece of the roots so what i did was grabbed a needle nose pliers and removed it from the mouth after removing the tooth we found that his adult tooth was starting to come out i'm just wondering since it broke off and the roots didn't come out will this hurt the cat in anyway the cat doesn't seem like its in anymore pain and can eat normally again anyone gone through this and did it turn out okay let me clarify for you gramma's baby the tooth was already out was only hanging on by a thread of root haven't you had a parent pull out a tooth that was already loose so its not like i had to hold him down and work for mins to get it out it took me seconds to remove it because it was already broken and my cat couldn't eat because he was in pain from the tooth jabbing him in the cheek i'm looking for people to answer that have gone through this if the root didn't come out with the tooth will that harm the gums your cat will be fine my question is are you talking about a cat or a kitten it sounds like a kitten i had to take my kitten to the vet to get a tooth pulled because it had been really bothering her for two days and she wouldn't let me anywhere near her mouth the vet reached in and gave a quick yank and it came right out a week later i managed to reach in and pull two more teeth that were hanging on and causing her similar discomfort after a little while the bleeding stopped and my kitten was fine she didn't even remember it had happened all of these teeth that we pulled were just like you said hanging on by a thread the kitten just need a little help getting them out this is normal there is nothing wrong or cruel about what you did i think most people would have just used their fingers instead of pliers but those little teeth can be difficult to grab because at least with my cat they tend to salivate more and there can be some blood when they are about to lose a tooth the pliers probably just gave you leverage so you could get in and get out as quickly as possible to minimize the discomfort on the kitten Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Drill bit Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Diving Characters of Naruto Domestic rabbit Cocaine StarCraft: Uprising Textile manufacturing Tobacco Professional wrestling holds Breastfeeding Dental caries Tooth enamel Milton H.
