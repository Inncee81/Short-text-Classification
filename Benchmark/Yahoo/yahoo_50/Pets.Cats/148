why does my cat have oily fur near her tail it's quite bizarre and i've seen this in another cat i've known as well both are very clean animals but had this patch of oily fur near the base of their spines just above the tail what's truly strange is that when you scratch or pet the area both cats get this weird expression on their faces coupled with a compulsive need to lick something preferably your hand if anyone can shed light on this please do it sounds like stud tail there are glands back there that are overactive and creating a bit of a mess http fabcats org acneandstudtail html Cat Hamster Ferret Felix the Cat House Mouse Dog Chinchilla Pet skunk Tom and Jerry (MGM) Fancy rat Dandruff Skunk Cheetah Guinea pig Manx (cat) Domestic rabbit Oral sex Cat coat genetics Turkish Van American Beaver Mink Azumanga Daioh Discordianism Tasmanian Devil The Cat in the Hat Internet phenomenon Sugar Glider Printmaking Skin Bat Animal communication Hedgehog Spanking Minor Harry Potter Beasts Maine Coon HyperText Transfer Protocol Fur Monster Rancher monsters Leopard Dr. Seuss Equine conformation Meerkat Tiger Serval Where No One Has Gone Before (TNG episode) Linked list Horse Puma Xenomorph Jam (TV series) An American Tail Friends Kim Possible Trapping Beaver Conker's Bad Fur Day Siberian Husky Labrador Retriever Taboo food and drink Team Rocket Cat o' nine tails Tortoiseshell cat Fur Fighters Sonic Adventure Uniform Resource Locator Aurora (astronomy) El Goonish Shive Wget Stoat Characters of Naruto HTML element Characters in the Smurfs Red Fox Gray Wolf JavaServer Pages Sesshomaru Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Phoebe Buffay Anatomical terms of location Leopard Cat International Phonetic Alphabet Tincture (heraldry) Tuatara Fisher (animal) Mozilla Application Suite Black panther Docking Clothing Social rule Shaggy dog story Garfield Platypus Fox Siegfried & Roy Rabies Cetacea Acne Leaf The Secret of NIMH
