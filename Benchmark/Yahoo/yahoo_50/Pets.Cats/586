introducing a new cat hubby and i have adopted a new cat freijha she is from the shelter today we already have a cat oni oni is yr mos and bigger so that is good but they are both girls oni is furious with me and hisses at me when she sees me i think because i was holding the cat when we let them sniff each other there was a lot of hissing and growling but no violence she did swipe at me though later when i came to try and calm her down given that freijha is younger and smaller i hoped that this would work better freijha is a well socialized cat oni has not been with other cats in a year presently oni will not leave her window ledge and we have put freijha in a safe room but she is crying i have such a hard time ignoring it anyone have an idea as to how long this might take for them to acclimate or might they never hi holly how long have you had freijha for how long did you leave it before introducing them if you left it less than one day and night you'll need to go back to square one i'm afraid it sounds to me like you've already read up on how to introduce a new cat seeing as you used the term 'safe room' if you did introduce them on the very first day keep freijha in her room for one whole day and night obviously you can go in and see her lots and if necessary let oni outside or put her in the room and let freijha stretch her legs around the house for half an hour or so the most important thing to keep things running smoothly is to make sure that oni doesn't feel inconvenienced or pushed out you must reassure her that your home is still all hers give her double the fuss you would normally give keep them separate when you are out of the house or asleep if you left it a good few days before introducing them you can probably safely allow them to be together whilst observing if a lot of hissing growling posturing or any violence occurs separate them again for one whole night before re introducing if you introduced them on the very first day keep them apart for a day or two as mentioned above as long as oni is not hissing at you or the door to the room where freijha is being kept you will be ok to proceed if possible i'd advise to close off lots of rooms and just leave freijha's room door open and the living room this way you can keep an eye on them and know where they are i did this for about a week when i introduced my kitten to my cat how long it will take is difficult to say in some cases it could be days in most cases it's about a month in some cases it's a few months they may be best friends or they may just peacefully co exist but usually cats do settle down and learn to live in the same house one way or another the best advice i can give you is to be patient and not to worry if things are moving slowly oni will need lots of love and reassurance over the next few months if after weeks there is still hissing every time they meet and you are still separating them a lot i'd advise you to take the plunge and allow them both to be together we kept our kitten separate from our year old cat for about weeks with supervised meetings but we found that every single time we let the kitten out our cat would jump on her so we decided to bite the bullet and just let the kitten out all day whilst we were in the house after a couple of hours they both got tired and went to sleep in the same room it's been about weeks since we got her and they don't groom each other or sleep together yet they playfight which sometimes gets a bit rough but there is no hissing anymore just take things slowly give lots of love to oni and keep them separate when you cannot observe give it about a month and things should settle down congratulations on your new kitty xx emmie p s have freijha and oni both been spayed if not you'll need to get that sorted soon or everything i've said will be meaningless as they will fight lol Cat Social rule Sin City Garfield The Amber Spyglass Pitaten Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jam (TV series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shaggy dog story Sleeping Murder The Shining (film) Piccolo Junior Saga EastEnders Dog training RuneScape quests The Star Wars Holiday Special Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ferret Cliff Richard Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Swingout Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Fire fighting Avenue Q Sleep She Loves You Rent (musical) Atomic Kitten Characters in the Smurfs DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX K' The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha The Inside Badly Drawn Kitties Little Britain Weight training The Contender (television series) Poker jargon Time Out of Mind Milton H.
