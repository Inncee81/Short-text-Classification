just taken in a feral week old kitten help we have just collected a week old kitten from a shelter we were told that the mother was feral it was had limited human interaction since weeks once home he is eating but is only comfortable being stroked when in his 'bed' once outside there he runs away and hides as soon as we try and approach can any one offer advice do people think he will be able to be socialised how best to gain his trust pick him up any advice would be gratefully received thanks do you think weeks will make a difference do you think weeks will make a difference cats keep growing the entire first year cats are usually referred to as teenagers until they are about years old what you personally have is the age old nature vs nurture question however the fact that the cat claims territory as his own the bed tells me volumes get the cat comfortable being around you and your family and if it appears he is going to behave as with all cats this is within reason usually theirs then you should get claw caps assuming he is neutered which you would need to do if he isn't to control his scratching the fact he is weeks means he can become used to you over time and will use less and less of his instinctive desires to run and chase and hunt find a way to get him to run chase and hunt in your home this is how you will teach the cat that where he lives now is his new home and that it is a good place make this happen and he will not want to leave and will be a very good pet investing a few months now will reap rewards you never thought of later one final thought here if the cat is prone to biting and does so in a very aggresive manner you will want to figure out a way to discourage this behavior sooner rather than later he needs to understand that biting is ok as long as it is not biting a person as with a small child re enforce positive behavior but not with food a neutered cat will easily become overweight after the second year develop good habits not the bad ones and you will do fine Cat Socialization Dog Dog training Kitten Feral cat Ferret Altruism Domestication Lie Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Culture Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Soul Guinea pig Brown Bear Puma God and gender Garfield Nicomachean Ethics Milton H.
