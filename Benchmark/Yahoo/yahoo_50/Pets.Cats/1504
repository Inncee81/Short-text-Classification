some advice on my new kitten please the week wait is over and i finally got my gorgeous little ball of fluff on sunday she is just adorable and very clever using her kitty litter straight away thanks to everyone for advice on kitty litter a few weeks ago i also asked for some names for her and for those of you who answered i have named her isis pronounced ice ess my little boy calls her icy which i think is very cute to anyway i m so excited i m rambling so i ll get to the question i was concerned about how my little dog would act with a new kitten but my dog is being wonderful with her it s the kitten that is terrified of the dog she is aching her back hissing and scratching my dog when she comes to close and they keep having these staring standoffs the kitten is fine until the dog moves what should i do i know its only day so should i just be supervising and letting them sort it out themselves do you think kitty will get used to the dog and stop her hissing and scratching i m just worried that our dog will lose an eye the way they are going but the dog is so good with her she just wants to say hello but is scared of the kitten and backs off lol anything i should be doing or some advice would be great thanks so much hi all just wanted to say i m about to pick a best answer but it s so hard because you all gave wonderful answers so thank you all so much for your stories and advice a quick update its been a week with isis now and we had some problems and already have an expensive vet bill as isis got sick last week but she is doing much better now thank god as for her and my dog chelsea well they aren t the best of friends yet but isis is way more curious of chelsea now she likes to play with her and she seeks the dog out for some play time this of cause involves isis chasing the dog s tail then rolling over in a ball of fluff as if to say i m so innocent it wasn t me lol chelsea is still being good with the kitten she has learnt to lick and play with the back of the kitten as there are no claws at the back lol and although isis gives the occasional hiss and scratch to warn the dog off its mostly all fun and games oh and the cutest thing is that they fall asleep in my lap together i took the advice some of you gave me and got kitty s claws trimmed when we were at the vet last week and i am glad to say that the food bowls are now side by side just be patient the kitten is very young and probably isn't sure what exactly a dog is the hissing arching of the back and scratching are perfectly normal and a way of trying to demonstrate that although she's small she isn't a pushover the dog being older recognizes isis as another animal since he isn't being aggressive in retaliation he obviously understands that she doesn't really mean any harm and i'm guessing that he backs off more in disappointment than anything else like i said just be patient continue to supervise them you could try setting their food bowls out at the same time on different sides of the room and each day bring them closer together by the time the bowls are side by side i think you will find that the two animals will have figured everything out good luck Garfield Shaggy dog story Ferret Dog Piccolo Junior Saga Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an B3ta Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pet skunk Sin City Fast bowling Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 RuneScape quests Guinea pig New York Giants Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Avenue Q Kodocha Dog training Poker jargon Winning Streak Haven (TNG episode) Characters of Naruto Hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kitten Pitaten Little Britain The Catcher in the Rye Coming of Age (TNG episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Milton H.
