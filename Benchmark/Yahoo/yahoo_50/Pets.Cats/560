how do i get my obese cat to lose weight i have cats my oldest is obese the other are all right in weight if i put my oldest on a diet how can i prevent my other from losing weight i don't know how you feed your cats but cats are obligate carnavoirs and after they are adult they must be fed meals a day with fasting inbetween for their health they intestinal tracts are short and it is better for them if they go without food for to hours inbetween their meals if your cat was in the wild it would be doing that also your cat would be getting a lot more exercise if it was in the wild so be sure that you are giving it at least good quality play periods a day this can be done with a toy on a string or a ball you roll and they chase or you can invent games we play indoor pingpong and badminton so that ours can chase the balls and the birdies we also have several home made toys on strings that we purposely make them chase up and down their condo's the key in these exercises is to play until the cat gets tired and stops first and they will another good game is to get one of those laser lights but be sure you do not shine it in their eyes or they will go blind anyway if you are feeding your cat properly you will find that it tells you one the can of food how much they need for their weight per day per meal if you get your kittys good exercise and keep their food intake correct the ones that are skinny will gain and eat what they need because the exercise will perk their appetite and the ones that are fat can't eat more than you put out for them at a feeding and the exercise will help them lose you can feed them all in different corners of the room and stay there until they are finished or in different rooms if you train them that they will get food for only hour down they will learn that if they want to eat they had best do so all day munching for a cat is not healthy for them if that is what they are currently doing you will have to break them of that habit to do so if they are adults put the food down times a day and leave it down for hours and pick it up for hours for the st week then each week after that pick it up hour earlier until it is only down for hour you can actually get them to eat it all in minutes if you work at it and that is what they should be doing the problem now is that they are allowed to have it all the time most likely and so they have learned to nibble you will have to retrain them and it is very easy if you keep patient and consistent i guarantee they will get the message very quickly cats are actually easier to train than dogs i know since i train all of mind to do everything good luck Obesity Cat Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Hamster Diabetes mellitus Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Breastfeeding Insulin Super Size Me Nutrition Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog training Anorexia nervosa Garfield Folic acid Guinea pig Ferret Badminton Low-carbohydrate diet Dietary fiber Coeliac disease Raw food diet Adjustable gastric band Gastroparesis Fasting Bread Fecal incontinence Social rule Tag Little Britain Hamburger Vegetarianism Livestock Urinary incontinence Swimming Milk Tocopherol Poker jargon Veganism Volleyball Piccolo Junior Saga Comanche Terri Schiavo Chocolate Tenshinhan Weight loss Hyperglycemia Tooth Prostate cancer Fugu Paintball Shaggy dog story Fast bowling McDonald's Bodybuilding 613 mitzvot Giant Panda Cleveland Browns 1957 World Series Foodborne illness Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pet skunk Cirrhosis Gastric bypass surgery The Amazing Race Coronary heart disease Dialysis Sea-Monkey Fast food Vitamin Obedience training MapleStory Game show Babe Ruth New York Giants Exercise Clinical depression Brown Bear Marathon (sport) Softball Egg (food) Healthy eating Albatross Sleep Flatulence Glycogen storage disease type I Conker's Bad Fur Day
