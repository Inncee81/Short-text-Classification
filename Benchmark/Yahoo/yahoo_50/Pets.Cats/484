does anyone know anything about cats with extra toes i have been offered a cat with toes on each foot he's a gorgeous almost orange and black cat with tabby like markings but in a circular pattern the toe thing concerns me though is this mutation linked to any health risks or is it just one of those things the condition is called polydactylism just means many toes in latin of all the various mutations in cats this is one of the most harmless the main health concern would be that you need to pay just a bit more attention to the claws not only can the extra toes be in a location where they aren't worn by regular use but i had one cat with claws that grew out from between two of his toes and one mutant claw that was double headed and hard to trim otherwise trimming cat nails is pretty easy if you aren't familiar with the technique your veterinarian can show you and there are tons of helpful websites with instructions the most important thing to bear in mind is that your goal is to just snip off the very tip of the claw not trim it down to the quick fortunately if you get your cat accustomed to having you examine and handle his paws while he is young trimming nails will be a lot easier as he grows older since all cat owners should check their cats' paws regularly this concern really hardly qualifies as a special health risk those marking you describe are called classic tabby even though they are less common than the fine lined stripes of the mackerel tabby they are gorgeous aren't they i would have no hesitation in adopting this lovely little fellow and would expect many years of quality companionship from him good luck and enjoy your new cat Cat Tabby cat Cat coat genetics Pet skunk Dog Hamster 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ferret Leopard Turkish Van Domestic rabbit Nail (anatomy) Fast bowling Equine conformation Manx (cat) Professional wrestling holds Floppy disk Volleyball Garfield RuneScape Marching band Guinea pig Wolverine (comics) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma CPU cache Cheetah Skateboarding trick Dog training Unreal Pottery Red Dwarf characters Wood carving English English Claw Anchor Paintball Milton H.
