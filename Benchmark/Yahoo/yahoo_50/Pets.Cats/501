my cat cannot stand up hi guys ive a year old cat called bubbles i came home days ago to find him outside lieing in the garden with flies all over him he coulden't stand up and was meowing at me i managed to pick him up and take him downstairs to clean him it appears he had soiled himself and coulden't move i placed him on a towel cuddled up in the lounge but he cannot stand up or put any weight at all on his legs he seems happy enough and is still eating his dinner when i bring it to him albeit with help from me to lift him up i haven't called the vets yet as i imagine this is down to old age possibly arthritis in his legs i had noticed he had been weak on his legs a few days before this happend but he had been before where he had slept funny on them so didn't really pay much attention to it does anyone have any more insight into what this could be ive searched the web for answers but not come up with anything and im scared that if i call the vet hes going to give me one answer o hi guys and thanks for your replies i'll be taking him down the vet this evening and take it from there he means alot to me as he was just a kitten when my father was still around as for my screename it was made like a year ago didn't realise it was linked to my email address anyway besides the point thanks again for your replies take him to the vet it could just be old age or a stroke but if he needs medical attention its better to know than to leave the cat suffering Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charles Ives Garfield Equine conformation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass Aerial (dance move) Haven (TNG episode) Phoebe Buffay's songs Salad Fingers Happy Tree Friends The Inside The Subtle Knife Professional wrestling throws The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Guinea pig Friends The Shining (film) Ron Weasley Pet skunk Social rule Kasparov versus The World Swingout Professional wrestling holds Cat The Pilgrim's Progress Ocean's Twelve Past teachings of Prem Rawat Siamese (cat) Fancy rat The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Pitaten RuneScape quests Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Strangerhood Jam (TV series) Russian joke Humphrey Bogart Sinfest Rent (musical) Mornington Crescent (game) Miss Saigon Jumpstart 3rd Grade Divorce Milton H.
