reason for early morning defecation in living room we have two siamese brothers with two clean litter boxes recently one of the cats has started defecating in the living room only in the early morning uses the litter box the rest of the day our vet suggested a pheromone spray which has not helped has anyone had this experience can you think of any reason for this behavior and how to prevent it pheromone spray is only supposed to help with urine marking not defecation if your cat is not old and has no underlying medical condition the reason could be stress stressors such as moving changes in routine or changes in the makeup of the family can result in inappropriate elimination reducing these stressors or decreasing their impact on the household will benefit your cat and probably you too cats of all ages may develop an aversion to the litter box or substrate material inside of the litter box some of the litters with a 'perfume' or 'antiseptic' smell may dissuade some cats from using them trying different types of litter including clumping litter sand newspaper and no litter are things that could be helpful some cats may not like where a box is located it may be located too close to their food or water it may be in a high traffic area where they cannot have privacy it may be in an area where they can be easily ambushed by another cat it may be on a different level of the house than where they spend most of their time in addition to trying various substrates also place extra boxes around the house to see if box location makes a difference there should always be at least one more litter box than the number of cats in the household some cats are very particular some will not defecate in the same box in which they urinate others will not go in a box which has been used by another cat just as we do not like to use dirty bathrooms neither do many cats if the litter box is not cleaned regularly they may decide to find a different bathroom Hamster Japanese toilet Cat Urinary incontinence Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Toilet Toilet humour Pet skunk Post-traumatic stress disorder Housebreaking Cat litter Toilet paper Enzyme Diabetes mellitus Insulin Breastfeeding Tobacco smoking Kitten Diseases of the honeybee House Mouse Urinal Menstrual cup Urination Psychosis Fire fighting Natural Selection (computer game) Hypoglycemia Folic acid Menstrual cycle Guinea pig Tooth enamel Territory (animal) Friends Fecal incontinence Urine Daylight saving time Biology and sexual orientation Traumatic brain injury Sleep Glucokinase Carnivorous plant Schizophrenia RISC Japanese tea ceremony Alzheimer's disease Gas metal arc welding Perfume Alkane Waste management Clinical depression Surveillance Semiconductor device Microeconomics Classified information Jackass: The Movie Public good Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Glucocorticoid M16 (rifle) Albatross Thermoregulation Honeybee Acne Ionizing radiation Loudspeaker Hydrogen peroxide Psoriasis Biblical scientific foresight Vitamin C Marathon (sport) Human height Garfield Social psychology Welding Kitchen CPU cache Halitosis Tai Chi Chuan Body piercing Mouth ulcer Collision detection Stroke Colorectal cancer Entropy Richard Chase Manx (cat) Corrosion Migraine Basement Insurance Computer virus
