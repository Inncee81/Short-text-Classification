whats a good litter what's the best litter to get i have two kittens the first time i bought scoopable litter which was nice but it didn't control the odor well at all the second time i accidentally got an odor control kind but it wasn't scoopable which is the best kind to get that combines scoopable with odor control there is no litter that is going to be effective in controlling odor contrary to claims made by several brands it just doesn't happen a better way to control the odor is to change what you're feeding your cats i've found that cats fed iams have less stinky litterboxes than cats fed other premium foods if you doubt it conduct your own test feed your kittens any advertised brand note the level of stink then feed your kittens iams and within hours the litterbox will be less stinky for litter i like tidy cats for multiple cats scoopable and i scoop daily the small grains of litter are easier on the kittens' delicate little paws so they like it better i presently have cats in my house and if you walked in my door you wouldn't know i had cats until you saw them the cats are healthy active and have beautiful shiny fur if you would like to use a deodorizer i recommend x o which can also be used for cleaning Cat Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Kitten Hamster Ferret Fancy rat Pet skunk Toxoplasmosis Atomic Kitten RuneScape quests Cat food Ralston Purina Company Red Squirrel Procter & Gamble House Mouse Theory of conduct Feral cat Dog Jumpstart 3rd Grade Tick Vermicompost Manx (cat) Flatulence Garfield Breastfeeding Organic farming Diseases of the honeybee Japanese toilet Humphrey Bogart Natt__ Raw food diet Gray Wolf Cats (musical) Doug Through the Looking-Glass Tobacco smoking Fecal incontinence Paracetamol Vitamin C Life insurance Japanese tea ceremony Biological pest control Odor Toilet humour Brown Bear Shaggy dog story Ren and Stimpy Factory farming Rabbit Sadism and masochism Veganism StarCraft: Hybrid Milk Smegma Terri Schiavo The Cure Poker jargon Litter M16 (rifle) Fisher (animal) Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Rocky Mountain spotted fever Chocolate Phoebe Buffay's songs Bong Dairy Trapping Socialization Menstrual cup Livestock Social rule Cyanide Omega-3 fatty acid Gypsy moth Domestic goat Serval Patent medicine Puberty Neopets Computed tomography Time Out of Mind Trademark Animal communication Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Maneki Neko Pitaten Skunk Cocaine Debugging Azumanga Daioh Thermal depolymerization Asiatic Golden Cat Mid-levels Sea-Monkey Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Cable television Sanitary towel Deodorant
