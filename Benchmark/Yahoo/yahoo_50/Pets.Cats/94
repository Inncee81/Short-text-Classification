how can we get our kitten to stop peeing and pooping in places he shouldnt our gorgeous little kitten weeks has taken to weeing on the bed and pooping behind the tv the tv thing is a nightmare to clean up with all the wires and also dangerous the bed we thought he was just coming for a cuddle and then warm wet patch we dont let him on the bed now and stop him going behind the tv but we cant be watching him he is locked out of those two rooms during the day but will still wee other places than his tray even though we keep in fresh with litter making sure not to rid the tray of his smell completely what can we do we would love to have him sleep on the bed but cant risk it quilts are a nightmare to wash to reply to the person who says about a kitten being weeks old id like to assure you we got him from a registered and well known breeder he is totally healthy and was deemed by the vet fine to leave his mother if it reasures you about the week rule for kittens remember some kittens get seperated at birth and most do ok i have a rescue cat who was astute enough at weeks when it got seperated from its mum to follow an old tom cat through its catflap because it knew there would be food an warm and it has no emotional issues at all regarding the wee thing some cats need more attention than others you look at the tv while it wants your attention so it recognises competition and is trying to make a point put a small litter tray there until this phase in its development passes the bed is where it smells you the most and just wants to join in it's scenting to make it presence known dont let it sleep there shut the door and keep it out again its just a phase in its development give it an old sweater that has your scent on it to snuggle up on in its own bed to get rid of the smell put bicarbonate of soda down and rub it in leave it for hours then vac or wash out another trick is to put tin foil in places where they wee poo a lot cats hear different to us and they dont like the noise of tin foil moving i would say the best thing is to interact with it as much as possible play games and leave boxes with holes in them for it to investigate to keep its attention i've got a very naughty cat and a most loving placid cat at the mo the naughty one is an attention seeker but she just needs stimulation or she'll boing of our shoulders even onto the remote to distract us and turn the tv over not all cats are the same in nature if it is a real real problem and the phase does not pass there is a thing you can get from the vets called feliway that diffuses cat hormones similar to the ones given off from their mothers to stimulate them and make them feel safe i used one when i lost one of my two cats a few years ago i had two from the same litter her sister was destitute and it helped steady her nerves Hamster Toilet humour Guinea pig Ferret Kitten Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Shaggy dog story EastEnders Ron and Fez RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pet skunk Sin City Urinary incontinence Dog Silent Night, Deadly Night Traumatic brain injury The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breastfeeding Phoebe Buffay's songs Salad Fingers Menstrual cycle Mattress Animal communication Manx (cat) Social rule Basic English Poker jargon Happy Tree Friends The Amber Spyglass Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Domestic goat Dream Atomic Kitten Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Doctor Dances Pitaten Garfield Friends Angel One (TNG episode) Autism The Marriage of Figaro The Star Wars Holiday Special About a Boy Sleep Treecat Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Carbon dioxide Little Britain Milton H.
