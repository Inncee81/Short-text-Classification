bonding with my cat hey guys so i was wondering what are some ways to bonde with my cat i'vehad him for about two three years now and i've never had a big bond with him he's more of a shy cat he'll come to you if he wants attention i have a big bond with my other cat so he gets jealous if i am with my other cat what to do it sounds like he's naturally independent if its shyness then maybe spend time with him when the cat who likes attention isn't around to bond with my cat i play and cuddle with him and even when he's being independent i annoy him lol or just sit next to him and talk to him sounds crazy but it works Kim Possible Ranma __ characters Red Dwarf Shaggy dog story Late Night with Conan O'Brien Mickey Mouse Recurring South Park characters Undergrads Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Married... with Children KaBlam!
