i'm having cat issues meet charlie our year old tabby i rescued him from the local shelter he has adapted to us quite well but for some reason he does not want to poo in his litter box i clean it daily and vacuum the area around it regularly too we moved the box when we opened the house to him i showed him several times where it was he urinates fine in the box but seems to defect right in front of the box not inside i do not know what else to do i will try some of the things that i've seen offered with other questions but i'm really concerned that we will have to give him away also yesterday he had some diahrrea sp and it looked as though there may have been some blood discharge is this normal i set up an appointment with the vet but she didn't seem concerned is this a sign of worms any advice would be much appreciated should i confine him in the basement with the box so he can get used to it did i give him free reign too soon thanks i just want to say that giving up charlie is not an option i just stated that i didn't want it to come to that so please keep your judgement to yourself i would never give my daughter up but this is where the problem lies i do not want any harm to come from this issue i e my daughter thinking this is some kind of food so back off you do not know the entire situation and you do not know what kind of animal lover i am so your judgement is not necessary thank you i think the changing food and changing litter are two good recommendations plus here are my two cents i had a cat that had all sorts of bathroom issues until i took him off canned food he happily ate dry food the rest of his life and never another problem another cat i had seemed to think that if his front legs were in the box then his back legs were too we got a bigger litter box and he was fine a friend of mine with the same problem ended up using one of those under the bed rubbermaid things like 'x ' as a litter box and that was when her problems finally ended she slowly weaned him down to a smaller box finally until your issues end get some heavy plastic sheeting from home depot or somewhere and cut a piece to lay under the box that extends out a couple feet anywhere the kitty might poo i'd try everyone's suggestions before you rush to the vet when an issue is vague the vets seem to charge more they do test after test they'll do anything that you authorize them too i've had to say no to a kitty cat scan twice and he got better on his own anyway good luck Hamster Cat Fancy rat Pet skunk Garfield Domestic rabbit Kitten Guinea pig Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Dog Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Basement Contract Urinary incontinence Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mattress Pitaten The Shining (film) Ferret Sin City Theory of conduct Cat litter Waste management Peanuts Animal rights Pretty Good Privacy The Amazing Race Folic acid Equine conformation Dairy 613 mitzvot Plame affair Prostate cancer Terri Schiavo EastEnders Kitchen Knife Soap opera Jumpstart 3rd Grade Breastfeeding Fecal incontinence Friends Salad Fingers Textile manufacturing Long Path Genericized trademark Blood on the Tracks Heinkel He 100 Ecco the Dolphin Ron and Fez Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mercury Cougar Chicken Vitamin C Combine (Half-Life 2) Cascading Style Sheets The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Kashrut George W.
