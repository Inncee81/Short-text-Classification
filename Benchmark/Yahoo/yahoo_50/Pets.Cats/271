something wrong with my cats eye my sister got this kitten a week ago and the lady who gave us the cat said he was healthy and that she had taken him to the vet yesterday i noticed that his left eye was shut as the day progressed i noticed that he would gradually open his eye today im noticing that he is twitching his left eye however his left eye is fully opened i'm sure the kitten has not come in contact with any bacteria since he had not gone outside or come in contact with other pets i was thinking it was eye irritation should i be alarmed by this and take him to the pet sounds like it might be conjunctivitis use a warm washcloth and wipe the eye a few times a day when you can take it to the vet although my kitten's cleared up on it's own Kitten Cat Guinea pig Ferret Socialization Conjunctivitis Pet skunk Manx (cat) Dog Eye Puma Badly Drawn Kitties Bast (goddess) Cats (musical) Phoebe Buffay's songs Feral cat Sleep Atomic Kitten Louis Wain Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Common cold Through the Looking-Glass Hamster Big Brother UK series 5 Treecat The Beatles Dead Like Me Ocean's Twelve Tooth enamel Domestic rabbit Discworld gods Social rule Salad Fingers Tuberculosis Maine Coon AFI (band) StarCraft: Hybrid Saki Internet phenomenon Pet The Shining (film) Stuttering Azumanga Daioh Astronomy on Mars The Pet Sounds Sessions Microchip implant (animal) Sarah Kerrigan Goatse.cx Chronic fatigue syndrome Rabies Rent (musical) Ron Weasley Purr Twitch City Diseases of the honeybee Indonesian language Datalore (TNG episode) (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Pet store One Piece minor characters Turkish Van Cheetah Veterinarian Thermoregulation The Death Gate Cycle Contact lens RuneScape quests Goofy Aliens vs. Predator 2 Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography The Parting of the Ways Evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet Boom Town (Doctor Who) ReBoot Psoriasis Rose (Doctor Who) House Mouse USS Waters (DD-115) Kakapo Little Britain Fire alarm control panel Dr. Seuss Sneeze Ecology Aliens versus Predator (computer game) Menstrual cycle Chromosome Siamese (cat) Toxoplasmosis Operation Market Garden The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Kodocha Minor Harry Potter Beasts Quotation mark Pet Shop Boys Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten
