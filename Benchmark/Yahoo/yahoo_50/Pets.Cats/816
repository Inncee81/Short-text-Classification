whats wrong with my cat i know i know i should ask the vet and of course i want to but my mother is not one to favor this cat and she only allowed her in the first place because she has a job she is a mouser and bug eater she does her job well but is a dear cat to me heres the deal she grew up the first six months as a semi ferrel cat at a fire academy she had a traumatic experience at the age of two months where she was lost and starved for two weeks she made a great recovery and was a normal but somewhat violent cat for seven years i noticed that she started licking the fur off her stomach this year and the licking spread to her front arms inside of hind quarters and now the outside of them she sometimes purrs constantly which is very out of character for her this purring is accompanied by labored breathing at times recently her abdomen has been firm feeling as well i'm thinking a long term worm or parasite infection im going to try to get her to a vet asap thanks you guys also personality change she has gotten a lot more affectionate and will sit for hours while before she couldn't stand to be touched for too long she is fix and up to date with immunizations strictly indoor cat i really don't think its fleas guys going to the vet is best she definitley has a problem although i have no idea what it is i do know that one time my cat got very affectionate out of the blue not like her at all she also was vomitting so i took her to the vet she had had a stroke the vet speculated that the change in her personality was because she was scared she couldn't get close enough to me also i know that cats don't always purr because they are happy sometimes they do it when they are in pain i'm glad you're taking your kitty to the vet my mom is the same way Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Guinea pig Garfield Equine conformation Fancy rat Ferret Purr Stomach cancer Blood on the Tracks Traumatic brain injury Charles Darwin's illness Cancer Pet skunk Breastfeeding Time Out of Mind Spanking Milton H.
