we just adopted a kitten yesterday but he's a biter how can we get him to stop biting it's not just little love bites he wants to eat our fingers he has plenty of food so he's not hungry he is weeks old is this just a phase or something we should worry about also we have an older cat in the home too but they haven't really met yet we're still working on that any suggestions he doesn't know better and has lots of energy you don't punish him but you teach him he needs to learn that fingers hands and feet are not objects to bite when it happens you react gently and you need to get his attention sometimes a very gentle tap on the nose followed by the word no works other times grab his feet and gently tap his nose and say no sometimes a play session afterwards amplifies the training but not too quickly or he will associate biting with being rewarded now to the second part your older cat cats usually abhor changes and you have brought a massive change expect a lot of hissing and growling but that is usually for show in addition get a second litter box if there are not already two your older cat is alpha and will want to remain alpha your kitten will be turbocharged and your older cat may not be happy with that it can take anywhere from days to a couple of months before any definite conclusions can be had if there is a wide age difference actually consider getting a second kitten the kittens would then take out all the energy out on each other allowing your older cat to adjust but if it is only several years or so things should settle down all right and by the way child proof your house as your kitten will want to get into and onto everything Cat Dog training Ferret Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Milton H.
