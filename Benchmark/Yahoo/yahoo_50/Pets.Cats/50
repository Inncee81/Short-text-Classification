kitten still has stitches my month old kitten still has stitches in her stomach it's not a lot just a small piece that is still left she got fixed on and the vet said that they were dissolvable would go away but now she has had them in for more than months what can i do i don't want to take her to the vet unless i have to i just called my local vet and they said it would be better to just bring her in rather than try to remove it myself because she probably wouldn't stay still it would cost to have a tech do it if you go back to the same vet they really shouldn't charge you to take out the left over stitches even if you see the tech there really is no harm in leaving it as it will eventually fall out on it's own i wouldn't recommend trying to take it out yourself you could accidentally cut your kitten or pull something too hard Mattress Knitting Ferret Guinea pig Aerial (dance move) Bookbinding Knife Kitten Veterans Stadium Textile manufacturing Garfield RuneScape quests Chocolate Stomach cancer Theory of conduct Socialization Through the Looking-Glass The Marshall Mathers LP Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Shaggy dog story The Midnight Sun James Herriot Knots Landing Pet skunk Textile manufacturing terminology Kodocha Time Out of Mind Floppy disk Sewing machine Soham murders Drowning Equine conformation Sarah Kerrigan Plame affair Happy Tree Friends Euro StarCraft: Hybrid Drill bit Killian documents Trapping The Shining (film) Piccolo Junior Saga Stitch (Lilo & Stitch) Satchel Paige Chess (musical) The Amber Spyglass Poker jargon Randomness Cat Professional wrestling holds Atomic Kitten Sailing Warren Buffett Scientology beliefs and practices Cricket ball Winter Soldier Investigation Tooth enamel Extreme Programming Eric Bischoff Highway 61 Revisited Isaac Singer Napoleonic Wars Blood on the Tracks Veterinarian WNNX (FM) Punisher Professional wrestling throws Suicide methods Cocaine Rigging Dog training Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Samuel Goldwyn David Beckham Tobacco Sly & the Family Stone Pretty Good Privacy Sin City Sewing Friends Muslim ibn Aqeel No Child Left Behind Act Paragliding All Creatures Great and Small John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Wyatt Earp Pet Sounds Modoc War Lathe 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian) Kimono 9/11 conspiracy theories Education in Australia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Handloading Fancy rat Sheepshead Jaynestown
