i had a dream about this guy i like at work in my dream i was at work and so was this guy i like well he was shot in my dream he was coughing up blood and dying to say the least but the dream ended before i ever really knew if he died i like this guy but i don't know if he likes me at least one other girl at work likes him and he seems to be close with another girl but i don't know if they are 'close close' but they've never gone out my best friend says she thinks he likes me by how he acts but i don't know can anyone give me an idea as to what this dream might mean him getting shot and all it doesn't really mean anything he was just on your mind a lot and so you had a dream about him unfortunately it was in a bad setting but if i had to guess it sounds like you're secretly 'killing' him inside because he wants you to ask him out because he's too shy to ask you out metaphorically Scenes from a Memory Pitaten Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Friends Theory of conduct Phoebe Buffay's songs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Little Britain Reservoir Dogs The Ashlee Simpson Show Ranma __ characters The Shining (film) It's Walky!
