what's with my creative dreams i always have vivid dreams and i love being in my dreamworld but sometimes i'm troubled when i awake because i don't know what to do with creative information last night in a dream i designed a piece of furniture it was a really cool stacking side table that could unstack into three tables i haven't seen this piece of furnture before once before i dreamed about a chandelier design i still remember it clearly sometimes i dream songs i haven't heard i'm aware that they are original in the dream and wake up with the tune in my head the strange thing is i don't know how to work wood or metal and i certainly don't know how to write or read music can't play an instrument so the music dreams get lost i can't write them down and the design dreams well i can sketch things but then what am i supposed to have them built dear todd t i think your dream world is trying to tell you something it's screaming to you that you have a lot of creativity inside you it's wanting you to act on it there are many how to books magazines and pamphlets out there write down your dreams and find out how to create the inspiration in the dream this will take time i know because that's exactly what i did what started out as gift giving and a hobby is now a small business i couldn't be happier please listen to your dreams your sub conscience knows you better than your mind sometimes allows hope this helped my dreams helped me if you have any questions email Philosophical skepticism Dream Lucid dreaming Jon Secada John Cage Charles Ives Time Out of Mind Scenes from a Memory Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Little Britain Social rule Bringing It All Back Home The Emancipation of Mimi Milton H.
