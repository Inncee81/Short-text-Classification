why do i keep dreaming of the walking dead for the last about years i have had on and off dreams of trying to escape the living dead i guess it all started when i saw the movie return of the living dead but the dreams themselves are not about the movie just the idea of escaping these creatures i've since been fasinated by the idea and have even prepared myself for such a fantastic event but psycologically i have no idea what these dreams symbolize according to dreamcrowd to dream that you are walking with ease represents the way you are moving through life and progress toward your goals consider your destination to dream that you have difficulties walking indicates that you are reluctant and hesitant in proceeding forward in some situation you may also be trying to distance yourself from certain life experiences the difficulty in walking is a reflection of your current situation and the obstacles that you are experiencing to see the dead in your dream forewarns that you are being influenced by negative people and are hanging around the wrong crowd you may suffer material loss this dream may also be a way for you to resolve your feelings with those who have passed on if you dream of a person who has died a long time ago then it suggests that a current situation or relationship in you life resembles the quality of that deceased person the dream may depict how you need to let this situation or relationship die and end it to see and talk with your dead parents in your dreams represents your fears of losing them or your way of coping with the loss you may want that last opportunity to say your final good byes to them to see your dead sibling relative or friend alive in your dream indicates that you miss them and are trying to relive your old experiences you had with them in trying to keep up with the pace of your daily waking life you dreams may serve as your only outlet in coping and coming to terms with the loss of a loved one try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Out-of-body experience Sigmund Freud Sant Thakar Singh Jean Grey The Amber Spyglass Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Supernatural Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory About a Boy The Lovely Bones Phaedo John Berryman Funeral Traumatic incident reduction Grief Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Narcissism Theodicy Enlargement of the European Union Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Pilgrim's Progress Immortality Carl Jung Clinical depression Paranoia Agent Dead Like Me Tonality James Hillman Karen Horney W.I.T.C.H.
