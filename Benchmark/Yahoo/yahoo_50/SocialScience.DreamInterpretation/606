can someone tell me if they know whats going on with me ok i know this is going to sound incredible werid to most of you but it the truth most of the time when i dream i see little clips of thing that are completly relistic ex a pic of a tea kettle or somethimes i even see like movie type thing ex me and my friend in a park walking seeing dogs and certain trees well from a day to a month period i see all of the things i see in the clips does any one else do this cause its been happening for a couple of years now and iam a little freaked out about it help please don't be afraid you may have a gift for seeing and remembering images that are ahead of time the explanation i have heard for this is that all human thought and perception as a form of energy is connected over time and space as one continuum comparable to a movie script at any point in time it is possible to perceive images thoughts or perceptions even if outside the present or current lifetime that is why people have past life impressions or can remember more if they are hypnotized or regressed they are assumed to be tapping into the memories of people who lived before who are connected like soulmates and can feel each other's thoughts over time in your case you may be seeing images in advance memories of the past or future that are coming to you in dreams again please don't be afraid but try to find books or exercises that can help you to develop your skills or apply them in a way that is beneficial i have a friend who helps counsel people to heal because she can see into their pasts what has not been forgiven and needs to be released before they can move on it seems you have a spiritual gift of vision so keep a positive mindset and try to use it for good Out-of-body experience Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory Reincarnation The nature of God in Western theology David Hume Neuro-linguistic programming Jon Secada A Course In Miracles Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of perception Hypnosis Science fiction film Milton H.
