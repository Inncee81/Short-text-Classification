how do i bring on a lucid dream i have had a couple of them very cool ones but would like more how do i bring them on sorry but i don't agree with a few things myopic said i'll answer your question but had to say this reality testing is easier with something simple like looking at a clock twice to see if it changes or try to easily read small text there's also holding your nose like you're going to sneeze and trying to breath through it trying to create people or flying can take more concentration she is right about that you'll want to expect it that does help but nothing's absolute anything can happen in dreams and yes do try them even if you know you're awake same as with the age i too was trained to wake when i had children but i've had more lucid dreams since having children than i ever did when i started ld ing as a child i don't believe my children had anything to do with it because i started having more since i started reading more about it and trying different methods as for her lucid dreams getting boring i guess they might for some people but i can't imagine how even when i just look around in my dreams i think it's awesome i'll wish when i wake i'd thought to control it but still love being lucid what frank is telling you to try is known as the wake back to bed wbtb method it's very common basically what's going on is you're waking up when your rem cycle is strongest dreams are more vivid and easier to remember during this time getting up out of bed helps your conscious wake up when you go back to sleep your body falls asleep but your conscious now has more awareness making it easier to know when your dreaming another common method is mneomonic induction of lucid dream mild people have names for everything don't they as you're laying down repeat to yourself i am dreaming or this is a dream or whatever you can do this when you're going back to bed if you use the former method or by itsself there's also recognizing a dream sign or something that appears in many of your dreams to help you become lucid i believe this is called lucid induction of lucid dream yep lild there's those names again what you should do is definitely read more about lucid dreams but never believe that they only come this way or won't come that way like i said eariler nothing is absolute i've had lucid dreams before i had good dream recall and before i started a dream journal try different methods even if they sound funny or stupid hey if it works Out-of-body experience Philosophical skepticism Consciousness Sleep Hypnosis Hypnagogia Milton H.
