confusing dream s last night i had this dream about me and one of my friends who is several years older than me in my dream this friend of mine and me were sitting in his car and as i turned my head and looked at him he just gazed into my eyes and then he raised his hand and placed it palm to palm on top of mine then i entwined my fingers in his and we held hands after a bit he took his arm and put it around me sure it sounds romantic but this guy i consider him a brotherly type and whats even weirder lately he's been acting much more soft spoken and calmer with me any ideas as to what this means remember this is your dream dreaming of acting the way you described show how much a guy is treated you like that however in reality it may not be the case he may just be a symbol of what you are looking for even he is a brotherly type guy but deep down you are seeking for close relationship Out-of-body experience Gesture Professional wrestling holds Salute Phaedo Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Milton H.
