why would kurt cobain's spirit talk to me i know this is strange and anyone can say whatever they want but i have been talking to the spirit of kurt cobain for quite a while now i know i have asked the question how can i speak to kurt cobain but i meant how can i see him face to face i have listened to nirvana and played their songs for a very long time now okay like i said i've been going through a pretty harsh lifestyle i also kurt went through a lot as well i know what i go through now and have been going through he has been there as well i contacted him through evp and told him all of this and i talk to him like that i never bother him about his music or his death only talking to him and asking him about myself and coping with my life i have asked him many times if i will ever see him he never responds to that i just want to know why would he choose to talk to me over anyone else i mean i care about him not as a fan but as a person who went through it the same as he did no one ever beleives me if this spiritual voice is coming to you to seek closure for cobain since he left unfinished business i would ask him how can you help this spirit to have closure it could be to forgive and give him to god so he can move on or contact courtney love or someone else who might still need to forgive so he can move on or work with teen suicide prevention or recovery groups if that would help him feel he is resolving the ill problems he escaped by suicide and left unresolved i would guess that you and he share some karma and you are not meant to take his path but to resolve issues instead so he can have closure by bringing resolution and healing through you if this is a muse that is inspiring you to study certain music or explore yourself then just use it that way it could be an angel or a demon if it is not at peace and still disconnected or in conflict with some unresolved or unforgiven issue on a personal note please don't feel bad i have had experiences channeling past life poets writers politicians spiritual prophets etc who seem to use me as an editor or typsetter for their messages they want to share i think these are divine but some friends are concerned that these not be abused to be demonic so i have to be careful what the message is my whole website is filled with these writings so i plan to publish these and share with other people and show it does not have to be a negative weird or scary thing i want to use these ideas for good not to cause problems it makes sense to me that people share a collective conscience and we have soulmates in this life as well as beyond so of course our thoughts and feelings are connected it's just a matter of who we are close to if you share karma or spiritual connection with this angel or soul or whatever spirit is communicating with you then just use the interaction and message to bring healing for good purpose and there is nothing wrong with that if nothing else i see nothing wrong with contacting either a spiritual research group who might document your case as a study or even try writing an article about it for a magazine or journal try contacting the association for research and enlightenment edgar cayce or any carl jung center or buddhist group if you are troubled by this i would consult with either a monk or even the dalai lama is open to receiving requests for counseling or questions he helped to identify richard gere's past life connections so maybe you have a purpose like that if so he may want to help if you look up dr weiss there is a whole following of people doing psychological research on past life regressions and counseling so maybe you can find a local counselor who works on that level so you are lucky today there are more people studying and researching this seriously than before if you want to see some of the writings i have channeled political http www houstonprogressive org letters html http www houstonprogressive org isocracy html my constitutional rants and ravings come by dictation which i attribute to the same muses who inspired either jefferson or george mason or the founding fathers who prayed extensively before writing down the founding documents i normally cannot stand politics or religion so these long essays on church and state used to stress me out but i have learned to forgive and accept and try to make sure the idea is constructive and not negative or anti government shakespeare moliere http www houstonprogressive org jr index html whatever karma i have with nine inch nails http www houstonprogressive org
