what does stroking mean in a dream i keep having this dream that someone i hate is stroking my hair and that i'm calm with it all depends on the level of hate and cause of it hate is like cancer it is most likely interfering w your spirit so spirit conscience is sending you a message to calm the hate that you say 'keep having' is a good stage for a surreal dream you know this is not real when this person messes with you and you don't react with hate watch for such an unreal event when it happens let that trigger your mind to know it's just a dream and zzz fill in the blank suggestions grab persons hand and ax them what would make things right with us or what would get under their skin the most remember you are in control because you recognized a trigger that it was just a dream and pulled that trigger this will cause you to start to wake so do not wake stay asleep or go right back to sleep thinking of where you left off Lucid dreaming Dream Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hypnosis The Amber Spyglass Social rule Out-of-body experience Kodocha EastEnders Hulk (comics) Consciousness Miss Saigon Avenue Q Cigarette Smoking Man Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Oh My Goddess!
