interpret my dreams i was at a park and it seemed that i had a little daughter she was wearing a lil pink dress and her hand had some kinda deformity appearing like ulnar nerve palsy wrist drop it was kinda random but it was a strange connection between the child and me like id carry her around the park telling her stories watched her play around but there was a concern about her not getting hurt like i guess any parent would but its strange im not in any kinda relationship currently or have been since the past years i'm no pedophile either the second dream i had was i was walking with a person who seemed to be the son of god but not like jesus or anyone perticular i noticed the surrounding but i couldnt see his face there was a point in the walk where we entered an area of water that had steps decending within it i was a lil afraid to enter but he had told me that i could breath so we went inside and i woke up very strange dreams could any one interpret them for me dreams are symbols that the sun conscious makes up to help you through a difficult problem that you cannot handle in the waking state dreams do not foretell the future only the past and the present a smalll child of either sex indicates that you feel safer when you were younger the deformed hand represents the world as a harnful place a place to be wary of so that you don't get hurt in you would feel safer if there was someone there to hold you and keep you safe and watch over you you chose the female sex because they are more likely to be kept safe in an unsafe world the second dream ties into the first dream you were walking with some that had earned your trust that someone was indeed jesus christ you could not see his face because you have not accepted him as your lord and saviour yet when you entered the water he jesus was getting ready to baptize you but by waking before you had the chance indicates that you have not yet decided to make the choice yet the reason that i said that the two dreams were together was that in the first dream you felt more secure safe when you were being held and in the second you were walking with jesus in reality in times of trouble and trials jesus the second part of the trinity holds us up wjen we are in the most trouble and danger in our lives Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baptism Free will Diving Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Scenes from a Memory Horus Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The Pilgrim's Progress Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses G-Man (Half-Life) Holy Spirit Eastern Orthodox Church American Idiot The Amber Spyglass John the Baptist Christian views of Jesus Gospel of Thomas Abortion debate The Death Gate Cycle Soul Neo (The Matrix) Lucid dreaming Roman Catholic Church Baptist Dream Jon Secada Rich Mullins Boston Public Justification (theology) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Church of Christ Book of Revelation Infantilism Cliff Richard Bondage (BDSM) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Escape from New York End times Noah Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) The Matrix Reloaded Community of Christ A Course In Miracles Polyamory Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Messianic Judaism Sin City Rais massacre Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paranoia Agent Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Dissociative identity disorder W.I.T.C.H.
