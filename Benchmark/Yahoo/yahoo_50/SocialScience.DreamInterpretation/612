if you dream about certain things over and over what does it mean to dream about snakes since i was a little girl and alligators since years ago over and over again the alligators are in my dream and are trying to bite me and sometimes i know i had a dream about them but i can't remember what about yes i am afraid of these animals hi lissy you have hit on one of my interests which is dream interpretation i have a book that i use whenever i want to know what one of my dreams mean and i just looked up your question about dreaming about snakes and alligators and this is what i found it is under the heading attack by wild animals although the reason may be unclear you are threatened chased or attacked by a wild animal the culprit may be an alligator bear lion tiger shark wild dog any creature really the common thread in this dream is the ferociousness and single mindedness with which the animal approaches you the encounter spikes your adrenaline you wake up awash in anxiety and fear this dream like the one of monsters hiding in the closet is extremely common in childhood although it can recur in adulthood as well wild animals are clear metaphors for the unconscious urges inside all of us often as you contemplate the plot of the dream you realize that the focus of your fear seems not to be the physical danger but that you're in such close proximity to something unpredictable that can't be controlled in this way the dream is often about the fear of harboring and keeping in check anything that would be considered uncultivated social or sexual behavior for children wild animal dreams serve as a type of placeholder symbol for any new worries or stresses that need processing although the habitual appearance of specific animals in your dreams might hint at deeper symbolism the type of animal that attacks you is perhaps less significant than the behavior it exhibits in the dream dream expert gayle delaney recommends taking a moment to consider the personality and behavior of the animal did it appear with deadly stealth out of nowhere or stomp and growl announcing itself from miles away was it possible to communicate with this animal or was it not responsive asking these questions might help you equate the dream behavior with a similar experience you're having with a person or situation in waking life this is from me most of the time dream interpretation is just that interpretation since it is from your subconscious only you can really figure out and understand what is going on in your life that would cause you to have this dream a lot of times once you can figure out whatever it might be in your life that needs attention once you do whatever you need to do the dream will stop if you in fact have something that needs attending to the dream itself is like a spotlight on it to get your attention over the years i have found that sometimes i actually know in my dream that i am dreaming and can actually participate in my dream as an observer i don't really know how i do it but the next time you are having this dream try to tell yourself that you are just dreaming and then see if you can try to talk to the animal to see what it wants if you can do this you just might be able to find out what it is your subconscious is trying to tell you i hope that this helps Infantilism Autism Milton H.
