death of mother polar bear dream what does it mean last night i dreamt of being somewhere that there are polar bears the mother polar bears were dying and i was was trying to save her babies the babies were polar bears but they were only the size of kittens i intitially tried to feed them skim milk and the weakest baby began to drink and either appeared to fall asleep in the milk or drowned in the milk i was searching for whole milk for the babies so they would get fat i knew the skim milk wasn't going to do them much good i remember there was hard packed snow all around but i don't remember being cold it sounds like in real life you are taking on more things than you can handle were you just given more responsibility at work or something do you feel stressed out that is what this dream sounds like to me Milk Jon Secada Dairy The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Buffay's songs Atomic Kitten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infant Charmed Pitaten Childbirth Ron and Fez Out-of-body experience The McGuire Sisters Friends Knots Landing The Shining (film) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Marshall Mathers LP Characters in the Smurfs Whale Dream Year of the Spider Shaggy dog story EastEnders Chocolate Time Out of Mind Hansel und Gretel Empire Burlesque Abortion debate Lucid dreaming Soy milk Kitten Characters of The Sandman Angel Sanctuary Timeline of alternative rock The Beatles bootlegs Night (book) Journey (band) Humphrey Bogart Mudvayne Scenes from a Memory Breast milk Cheese Tea Cliff Richard Doug Dream Theater Car handling What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
