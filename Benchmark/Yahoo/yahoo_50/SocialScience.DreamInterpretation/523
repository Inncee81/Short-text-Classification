need some laughs obnoxious dream it's just a stress dream i'm sure but can you provide helpful insights it's rather chaotic but here it is i was at a building school getting ready for some event i dont remember what there was a ton of things going on i dont remember all then there was this guy who was trying to kill me that was like hunting me down and i was trying to hide from him he followed me to the building because this girl in the dream told him where i was every time i'd hide from him she'd tell him where i was then the phone starts ringing off the hook and theres all these people calling for no reason just to see if i was there i dont understand this part so i decide to finish what i was doing in prep for this event and leave i was putting up streamers or something then i remember that i had to call a woman i used to work with to warn her about this guy so i call her but she doesnt answer the phone this part was in another dream too wait for details then i call another person who i used to work with who irl i call frequently i say to her that the girl dimed me out and now my life's in jeporday and i need her to come get me she says she knows all about it but cant come because shes not supposed to be helping me so i say sorry i didnt want to get her in trouble but then she doesnt answer the phone again when i call her she was mad over something and was refusing to talk to me i dont understand this part but the guy was going to kill her too then i'm cleaning windows and theres blood on them but then i notice its ketchup then i'm in an air traffic controller tower and am talking to some guy about the planes coming in theres one thats covered in ice and is going to crash in the dream it looked like an iced cube with just the nose and the tips of the wings sticking out wait for details and all the people on the plane were scared then i'm talking to this lady and i say to her why doesnt the pilot simply slowly come in for a landing and just coast on the runway that way hes not ft in the air and wont crash she said his landing gear was frozen then they radio the pilot and tell him to try and land the way i said instead of continuously circling as he may be able to land that way the passengers would live and thered be minimum causalties so he starts trying to land i can hear them screaming then i'm back at the building sweeping the ground and cleaning the blood ketchup off the windows to get ready to leave the woman i used to work with calls me and says shes sending her friend to get me out before this guy finds me and kills me but due to the risk she cant come herself but not to tell anyone then the guy comes into the building and i'm running from him and i see this lady the one i was talking to about the planes pulling up in her car wait details she was on the phone saying to someone my friend and another person that she'd been looking for me for years and years and years i see her pulling up so i try to clean the ketchup spatter off of the windows on the door so she doesnt think i'm nuts and killed someone i dont get this part at all lol then the guy is standing by the door with a knife and i dont want her to come in so i'm trying to think of ways to scare her away so she doesnt come back and get killed she comes into the building and i walk out of the door and put a chain lock on it so the guy cant come out then i run round the corner to try and catch her before she comes in so she doesnt run into him and i was upset because he came to kill me while i was trying to finish preping the building for a party thats all i remember its totally nuts and such a stress dream please laugh over it i did but perhpas provide some insight so i dont have such a crazy one again periodically i have this sort thanks oh yeah forgot they were seperate exits the one i locked with the chain lock and the one she was walking in i locked him in one side of the building by a ramp it resembled a school in design and in a good portion of when i was running from the guy i was in a hallway corridor trying to figure out which exit was the right one to leave out of there were two and one was a dead end and wouldve been a fatal choice as there was no way out from there if that helps at all idk something smart thanks but i dont watch many movies actually didnt watch any t v for quite some time when i had this one and any dreams i have after a night of tv viewing i automtically dismiss but this was creepy its such an obnoxious stress dream i suppose btw thank you for reading the whole thing i rarely post dreams and certainly not this long thumbs up for you thanks for the responses it was just weird is all they guy in the dream idk him irl was trying to kill me but also the other people in the dream as well and its always either this guy says i'm married to him or something along those lines when even in the dream i'm not but he thinks i am and he's always trying to kill me and these others i dont understand this at all i've had maybe or with this same theme over the last few weeks so while the dream may be a stress dream the significance of the on going theme is what i'd like to figure out so perhpas i stop having them thanks for the suggestions and the responses as i know this was long i usually stick right to the details ok so i read the whole thing you answered my dream about my son so now i am going to take a shot at yours i don't know you at all but i will give this a shot you sound like you are a very responsible person and protective in your dream you are protecting the woman with the dangerous boyfriend trying to protect everyone on the plane then protecting the woman from the guy with the knife if i missed something and it's the same guy sorry exit doors is giving a choice one good and one bad you never said which one you took so maybe that means you are fixing to have to make some kind of major decision in your life it was probably one of the longer dreams and i am not one to analyze every detail but that is what i picked up from it The Inside Social rule United Airlines Flight 93 Avenue Q Aerial (dance move) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape
