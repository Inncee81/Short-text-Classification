saw a spider before sleep last night in bed i was at the point where you are calm and relaxed and about to go to sleep when for some reason i opened my eyes really fast and i saw a spider the more my eyes focus on it the spider got smaller and smaller then it disappeared then i gasped i knew it wasn't a real spider because it was floating in the air it just looked fake then when it disappered i knew for sure so was this basically a dream even though i wasn't asleep what does it mean according to dreamcrowd some believe that the spider is symbolic of an unkind and sneaky individual are you the spider building a web or are you being dragged into one a spider's web might represent entanglement and the general complexities of life depending on the details of the dream it could also symbolize a smothering individual ironically very old dream interpretations say that the spider is an omen of good luck alternatively carl jung felt that the spider's web was a symbol of wholeness due to its formation circular shape construction and complexity he called circular symbols mandalas and said that they hold valuable meaning for the dreamer the spider and his web may be calling for an integration of the dream's personality leading to greater self awareness and resulting in feelings of completeness therefore the spider and his web may be considered profound and spiritual dream symbols that call for greater self understanding and encourage us to derive meaning and satisfaction from the intricate framework and interplay of life try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Out-of-body experience Carl Jung Dream Lucid dreaming Sleep Mandala Aikido Art Neuro-linguistic programming Hangul Year of the Spider Edgar Cayce A Course In Miracles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hypnosis Garfield Human Carlos Castaneda Culture Psychology of religion Cyberspace Goodness and value theory Modernism Summa Theologiae Quantum mechanics Subud Karen Horney Complex number Autism Hinduism Friedrich Schleiermacher Consciousness Phaedo Web crawler Traumatic incident reduction Inflation Copyleft Chinese language Ouroboros Python programming language Logic Supply and demand Perl Eye Central processing unit Strategic management Open Directory Project Lisp programming language Shaggy dog story Reincarnation XML Supernatural Tai Chi Chuan Polarization Sant Thakar Singh Alcoholics Anonymous Labor theory of value Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Contender (television series) Theory of conduct Mathematics Scientology beliefs and practices Computer Postmodernism Unicode Many-worlds interpretation Martial art W.I.T.C.H.
