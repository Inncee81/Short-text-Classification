top of a hill i had a dream i was kidnapped by guys and was drivin' in a red sports car to their mansion along the way to the house we had to drive up a huge hill an impossible hill to drive up in real life the car struggled to get up the hill but eventually got up it was winter and all the kids were at a mountain tubing down it was snowing but instead of of a blanket of snow on the ground it was actually a blanket a cream coloured blanket i was walking up the mountain but slipped i was sliding down i tried to get a grip on the blanket that was the mountain but it slipped out of my hands i was falling when i woke up it was pretty much a flash of an image rather than a dream but i was standing in the middle of the street and was looking down a huge hill it was like looking from the sky onto earth it was like a normal hill ant like cars were passing below i could see the top of my feet as i looked but it scared me so much i woke up before anything else happened i didn't explain cause i didn't have room so i was wondering why i keep having dreams of weird hills it's made me a bit scared to drive up them in real life what do you think this means i've been having more dreams about hills mountains but i can't seem to remember more no i don't drive up a lt of hills i don't drive but where i live there is basically no hills unless we go into the city i do have fear of heights which probably has something to do with it but i never have dreams about being on top of a building just hills and mountains according to dreamcrowd to dream that you are climbing a hill signifies your struggles in achieving a goal to dream that you are standing on top of a hill signifies that you have succeeded in your endeavors or that you have now have the resources to complete a task at hand try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Milton H.
