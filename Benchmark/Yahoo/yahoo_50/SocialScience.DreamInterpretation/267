scary dreams i have been having some really strange dreams in which somebody is trying to kill me but each time i either escape or wake up each time it's in a different setting but similiarities in setting include it being a large building like a castle large house apartment building etc and there is always a large crowd there some of the people whom i know and some of whom i don't most often the dreams happen on sunday nights but not always and i have a thought it's anxiety for having to return to work the next day monday morning blues but i can't be sure anybody have some thoughts or similiar experiences dreams of being chased attacked or terrorized are always manifestations of anxiety you may be ignoring personal problems or simple fears in life your subconscious mind is simply trying to get you to accept these fears and anxieties knowing nothing about you personally it is impossible to diagnose anything specific however you do have the conscious ability to end the fearful dreams your emotional reaction to these dreams is to be afraid although many real world rules don't apply in dreams your emotions are different emotions are far more powerful than rational thoughts try this the next time you find yourself in a dream as described in your question ask the chaser or monster a question what do you want from me seems to be good enough you will find that a couple of things may happen first the monster will change into something less scary a hideous troll could become a pink bunny second the monster could disappear you would feel better and perhaps would have gained some insight which could travel back into your wakeful state personally i've had long conversations with my fear inducing dream characters i once had a dream that a giant was trying to crush me as i ran through a maze of stone corridors i stopped in the middle of a large room and turned to him why are you trying to kill me i asked it it immediately turned into my father and started to cry i can barely recall the conversation we had after that but it was incredibly emotional and led to me accepting things about my life the trick is that you have to be open to facing your fears Anxiety Panic attack Lucid dreaming Dream The Amber Spyglass Out-of-body experience God Emperor of Dune Shaggy dog story Unconscious mind The Death Gate Cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Homophobia The Shining (film) Sigmund Freud Avenue Q Kain (Legacy of Kain) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Miss Saigon Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Social rule StarCraft: Uprising Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Psychoanalysis Stuttering Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Existentialism Jean Grey Traumatic incident reduction American Psycho Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory The Hobbit Obsessive-compulsive disorder Piccolo Junior Saga Fable (video game) Transactional analysis Hypnosis RuneScape quests Paranoia Agent Alaga__sia Children of Dune Hulk (comics) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Stoicism The Fairly OddParents Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Borderline personality disorder Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Invisibles W.I.T.C.H.
