reoccuring dream every night before i have a shift at work i'm a student work at an ice cream store i have a dream that i'm really far away from work and really late for it i can't think of anything this could mean because i like my job and i'm not stressed over it i've never been late i'm actually usually around minutes early nor am i scared that i will be late anyone have any idea what this could mean thanks like i said i'm not scared of being late i know that nothing terrible is going to happen even my boss has told me so i don't really think of work before i sleep at least i don't think i do so i don't really think that's it thanks for the answers so far you're dream doesn't sound prolific in the sense that it means something why it's probably happening is because you stated that this dream happens every night before your shift at work indicating that you go to bed thinking about going to work not stressing but you probably set your alarm to wake yourself up or know that you will have to wake at a certain hour since this is probably the last thought you have before drifting into sleep your subconcious mind takes over and turns those thoughts into a pattern of meaning you brain is an amazing organ and can turn random events and other daily stressors into something completely different next time before you go to bed try really hard to think of something else a cute guy a favorite dish etc and see what happens Insomnia Avenue Q The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Time Out of Mind The Lovely Bones Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Dream Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Out-of-body experience Urinary incontinence EastEnders Psychosis Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Miss Saigon W.
