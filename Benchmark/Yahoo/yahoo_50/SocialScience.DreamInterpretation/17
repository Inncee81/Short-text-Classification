dream help ok i had a dream about my cousin telling my others cousins future wife that he is cheating on her and all this bad stuff wat does this mean dreams are just symbols that the sub conscious makes up to help solve our problems that we can't handle when awake do you know something about your cousins future wife that nobody else knows if you do keep it to yourself telling eill do no good are you jealous about your cousin getting married are you wanting someone special in your life i say ignore the dream and let things be as they are when you go to bed at night tell yourself while in a relaxed mode that you are not going to have this dream ever again if you do this in an extremely relaxed mode it is a form of self hypnosis and your mind will obey the command this works and i know it does because i use it on myself Out-of-body experience Scenes from a Memory Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Hypnosis Lucid dreaming Milton H.
