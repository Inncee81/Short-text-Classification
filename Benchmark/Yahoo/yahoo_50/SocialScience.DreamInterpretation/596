lucid dreams can anyone tell me how i might be able to stop having lucid dreams is that possible they're alright sometimes but when i have lucid dreams usually i sleepwalk which gets dangerous at times like when i walk down the stairs or open my window and stuff one time i made my bed heheh well first off i'm jealous that you're able to have lucid dreams all the time at any rate the best way to not have the lucid dreams is to stop realizing you're in a dream or make yourself wake up from within the dream or hey stop doing dangerous things in your dream and continue to lucid dream Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Dream Sleepwalking Shaggy dog story The McGuire Sisters The Shining (film) Therion (band) Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie American Dreams Grandview, U.S.A.
