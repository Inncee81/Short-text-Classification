what does my dream mean there was this bridge and before i crossed it some lady was crossing it before i was and the bridge broke through and she fell we were in a secluded area and i called somehow i don't know how maybe through a cell phone but anyways it took them minutes to get there and by the time emt's got there she already died of some disease that kills quickly then i watch my sister and her kids go over the same bridge and i tell her no but too late they fell through and i jumped down to tell them we need to find a way out and not touch the wet stuff because it had that disease and we got out and we were on the front street and trying to get home on a train but that train blew up and we jumped out and everyone was dead except us and we ran and ran and just wanted to go home not sure if you are affected by the bridge collapsed in the news nevertheless bridge support things lead to problems relationship wet stuff disease difficulties fell gave up disappointment failure mistake emt help train blew up sudden changes everyone was dead except you hope it seems like in life you have come across sort of difficulties in life this could be about relationship projecting yourself see a bridge and some lady fell and died some emotionally you are encountering some problems in life this may be due to some support or someone you used to trust and perhaps that disappointed in some way and you felt bad having warned your sister and her kids not to go to the bridge shows that you have some anxiety about others this could due to personal experience however at the end even though there are changes in life you managed to come out live that symbolizes that you still have hope even though this sort of problems are not resolved the way you wanted to basically you are venting out your helpless conscience The Ashlee Simpson Show Stroke Diving Escape from New York Death The Amber Spyglass The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Traumatic brain injury Urinary incontinence Ambulance Emergency Medical Services Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Narcissism War of the Worlds (2005 film) Epistemology Third English Civil War Days of our Lives About a Boy Syphon Filter Shaggy dog story Drowning Customer relationship management Panic attack Multiple sclerosis StarCraft: Uprising Charmed The McGuire Sisters Clinical depression USS Tunny (SS-282) Asperger syndrome Paranoia Agent Gwen Stacy Social rule Son Gohan Nocturnal emission One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Vegeta Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Borderline personality disorder Psychoanalysis Scenes from a Memory AFI 100 Years series Force (Star Wars) Mystique (comics) Sigmund Freud Hey Jude Ghost Equine conformation Phoebe Halliwell Nancy Witcher Astor God Emperor of Dune Operation Market Garden Prostate cancer Live Aid Conker's Bad Fur Day Dead Like Me Karen Horney Aerial (dance move) The Critic DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Mach kernel Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Dog Infantilism One Piece minor characters Jon Secada Blood (computer game) Battery (electricity) Justification (theology) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind Love Hina main characters Skateboarding trick 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Daredevil Diseases of the honeybee Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy K' First aid Sin City 7 July 2005 London bombings Carl Jung Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cleveland Browns Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Initial D Ty Cobb Autism Antisocial personality disorder Alcoholism Street-Legal Anxiety Leo Wyatt
