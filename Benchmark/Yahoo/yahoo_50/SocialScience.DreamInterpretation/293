can someone please interpret my dream i was walking through a dark hallway of my dorms at school i hear someone say veni ad me latin for come to me i turn around and there is no one but the scenery changes to a creek that swam in when i was younger two people i never even met were skinny dipping and talking in german or what sounds like it i hear a yell above me and the sky is suddenly blackened out i cry out and fall to the ground i see a hand holding a knife with a hilt made of gold it starts moving towards me and then i woke up what does it mean thanks it's impossible for anyone to give a correct interpretation of this dream unless they know you well symbols in dreams don't come standard and generalized they are highly influenced by your association to the images and events in a dream you may be able to understand the dream yourself but it would depend on how deep an understanding of yourself you already have it would also rely heavily on the events thoughts and emotions you experienced the day before the dream wish i could help more but any interpretation of your dream by anyone on here would be a lot of hot air be well Jon Secada Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Columbine High School massacre The Shining (film) Scenes from a Memory Piccolo Junior Saga Out-of-body experience Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Milton H.
