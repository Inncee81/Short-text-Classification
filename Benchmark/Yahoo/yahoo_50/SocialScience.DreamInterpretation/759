there's this recurring dream i have had for years i am older w long grey hair beard i am on a rock beach w huge gnarled trees with a group of people all with brown skin white hair while the adults are working around us i am storytelling to the children it's a pleasant dream but is a rather strange scene seems like it could be another planet or something anyone have a clue what it might mean zowie you stole my dream from me really that's my retirement dream in a few years after a long career in government service i plan to retire on a nice island somewhere hope that works our for you too that dream symbolizes a slower paced lifestyle to me where you can enjoy the people around you and that you can tell kids your experiences in an entertaining fashion so that they will enjoy life to the fullest while achieving their potential it sounds like the good life even if you never get to that place maybe where you are at now you can start doing that with the people you are with in a sense paradise is where you choose to make it and then start living it good luck to you Storytelling The Jam Gothic rock Freeters Green Day Scenes from a Memory Kender Care Bears Puberty Lucid dreaming Progressive rock 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Beach Boys The Giver Hair color The McGuire Sisters Physical attractiveness About a Boy Infantilism Garth Brooks Pornography Our Gang Hiking Radiohead Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mulholland Drive (film) W.I.T.C.H.
