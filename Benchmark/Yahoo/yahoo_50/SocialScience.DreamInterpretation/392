choosing dreams is there a way to chose what u dream about how oh yes i do it all the time when you're falling asleep just make up a story whatever you want to dream about make it as if you're watching a movie or tv show be one of the characters in your story and just have at it picture everything out as you go along if you're having trouble getting ideas or don't really know what exactly you want to dream about then think of something you already know about think of a tv show and then just make up and play an episode in your head that you've adjusted to have you in it it may not be exactly what you started thinking about when you do fall asleep and start dreaming but it'll be a sort of guide for your brain as to what you dream the idea i guess is that the last thing you think about when you fall asleep is usually what you dream about so if you concentrate on it actually being your dream it'll happen or if you're asking b c there's smthing you want to not dream about try doing the same or go to bed right after reading a book or watching some tv that is unrelated to the theme of the bad dreams you're having or are afraid you might have Philosophical skepticism Wheel of Fortune The Shining (film) Dream Out-of-body experience The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Lucid dreaming Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Avenue Q Whose Line Is It Anyway?
