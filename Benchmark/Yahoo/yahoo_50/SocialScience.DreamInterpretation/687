dream help okay so for the last week or so i've been having dreams about my friend dying the first time i accidentaly got in a car crash with him and had to go to his funeral where his parents yelled at me the second i wanted to go on a little boat in the ocean and he got eaten by a sea lion the third burgalars got in the house and killed him cuz he got in the way the fourth i found a little animal and was keeping it in his house but it bit him and it had rabies the last one doesn't really fit with the east but he was my doctor and i didn't want him to be so i made him put me under but he used to much anestetic and almost killed me any ideas as to why these dreams won't stop i've told him about them all and we are stumped there is no one answer for what the dream means generally speaking however dreams about death signify much needed change in our lives such dreams typically herald symbolic rather than literal death in this way death dreams let us know that some part of the self needs to be radically reworked whether it be one's attitudes emotions or relationships though these dreams may be frightening and may linger in our minds for days they do come to us in service challenging us to grow and evolve like all dreams the best approach to those of death is to work with them creatively looking within to ascertain what is no longer needed in our lives and to determine the direction in which we should proceed W.I.T.C.H.
