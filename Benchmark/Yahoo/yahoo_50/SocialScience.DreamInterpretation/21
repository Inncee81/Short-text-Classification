i had a weird dream last night can somone spread some light on what it might mean i was outside in a crowded area and suddenly it was armageddon huge comets were falling from the sky and things were exploding all around and in the sky as well it is really getting to me because normally i can't remember any dreams i have but this one i do remember so there must be reason why right when we dream we do so in symbols because it is easier to deal with than when we are awake dreams are problems that we are having in our lives they do not portend the future there is something very explosive going on in your life right now something that you are either not aware of or you are refusing to do anything about the only way this dream is going away is to figure out what the problem is and deal with it to do this you may need to go somewhere where it is quiet and peaceful and you won''t be bothered so that you can be comfortable and relaxed then you need to take a very critical look at your life take a look at your past your present and see what is going on that you are not handling well it might be something that although might be a future event is something that is coming up soon and you don't want to face it if you can do this then your problem will go away and so will the dream this could be only about you it could be about about another person or about several other people good luck Lucid dreaming Dream Scenes from a Memory Impact event The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Insomnia Social rule Jiddu Krishnamurti Out-of-body experience Cliff Richard Sleep Avenue Q Journey (band) Philosophical skepticism Dream Theater Piccolo Junior Saga Miss Saigon Carlos Castaneda Asteroid Aerosmith Sin City Tribulation Escape from New York End times Pok__mon Live!
