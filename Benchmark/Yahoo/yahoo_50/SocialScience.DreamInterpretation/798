what does it mean when you have a lot of religious dreams i've had dreams dealing with religion for as long as i can remember but recently they've really started amping up i've had a couple of dreams where i've seen muhammad pbuh one where he is standing on a hill in wind and one where something really bad i don't know what has happened to me and my head is in his lap with him saying everything is ok it will be ok i've had dreams where i'm praying dreams where other religious stuff has happened and now last night i had that dream about praying over and over again and at the end of the dream having my third child a boy why do i keep having these dreams a farmer friend i know dreams constantly about places on his farm his equipment his neighbours and generally his dreams are about his farming life because he lives it breathes it and works it my great love is travelling so i have many dreams where i am in exotic and far away places one night i'm in singapore th next venice the next the alps of switzerland we dream about what our attention is focused on because that is where we can best obtain the metaphors for the messages that the dreams have for us having read your profile it seems that you have a lot of your attention directed at the muslim religion perhaps because you re a recent convert it consumes your thoughts and your time take away the setting of the dreams to find the message the setting and characters are what gets our attention your dreams seem to be about comfort what you say in your profile indicates that you find comfort in your new religion most religious followers whatever faith seek comfort and assurance my interpretation of your dreams are that you have a lot of fear and anxiety in your life in order to get the comfort you need you are seeking the support through religion focus on your thoughts and how much negativity is in them watch how this negativity leads to anxiety and fear in the dream of the third child the birth of a child represents the emergence of a new you your subconsious mind is saying that when you find your comfort and the anxiety of fear is gone you will be like a child joyous innocent and happy unfortunately the way to be comforted and to release sadness fear anxiety and worry is not from anything outside of us but from the inside i don't know th teachings of islam but assume like christianity the core issues are things like love your neighbour forgive relinquish hate in your heart don't find fault with others etc comfort can only come from a pure heart when one has turned away from judgement and criticism of others to look to find the things inside oneself that need to be bettered or changed the process begins Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Muhammad Ten Commandments Islam Prayer Religion Religious conversion A Course In Miracles Qiyamah Christianity Jiddu Krishnamurti Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Nation of Islam Theory of conduct Sufism Evolutionary creationism Scenes from a Memory God Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Meaning of life Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Time Out of Mind Milton H.
