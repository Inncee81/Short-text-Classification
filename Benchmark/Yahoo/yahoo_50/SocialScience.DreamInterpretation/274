i keep having a bad dream my sister and i were both raped as children by our father i was six and she was ten i am now and she is our father is dead now he died when i was twelve but i keep having these dreams that he has us tied up and he is making us watch him rape our children i have a little boy thats seven and she has one thats two this is so tormenting it interupts my daily life i wake up in the middle of the night and i swear i can hear him walking in the next room i cant stop crying after i wake up so i cant go back to sleep first of all sorry to hear that you and your sister had that bad and unforgettable childhood that bad things left a bad trace of memory in your subconscious mind and the shadow of the rapping incident will be very hard to go away projecting your dad has you tied up in the dream show emotionally you cannot get over this shadow of shame in other words your dad was part of your life that is a fact and you can't deny it even though he died he used to be part of your life that stays in your memory forever there is something we can never get rid of family relationship is one of them now that your problem is not to understand the bad dream but is how to deal with it more or less you know why you dreamed about it whenever you look at children you will have that feeling back in your subconscious mind there are ways to get rid of it but it is very hard you have to learn to be tough and accept this is the fact first i would seek for spiritual help rather than psychological help in this case as christian myself i say faith to god is more important than anything else however if this is once in a while bad dream i don't think you should magnify the problem because you only get worse if this continues yes seek for spiritual help the temporary psychological help i would suggest that you talk this out with someone and let your feeling go in daily life and perhaps that will not come in your subconscious mind or dream Infantilism Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Amber Spyglass Dream Unconscious mind About a Boy Miss Saigon Transactional analysis Carl Jung One Tree Hill (TV series) Night (book) The Shining (film) Immortality Sigmund Freud Lucid dreaming Alcoholics Anonymous Simone Weil Phoebe Halliwell Soul A Course In Miracles Traumatic incident reduction Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q Theory of conduct Out-of-body experience Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ten Commandments K' Milton H.
