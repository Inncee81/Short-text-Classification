dream interpretation question now bear in mind that i've never been in a car accident of any sort but nonetheless i had this dream last night very brief where i didn't see anything i just heard screeching and then this big crash also i've never witnessed a major car crash just a ew fender benders so what could this mean a dream analyst on a local radio station in santa barbara once said that dreams are usually not about what you are experiencing in the dream for example if you have a dream about crashing in an airplane this dream is not about your underlying fear of flying i'm no expert in this field but i'm guessing that your dream is really about some fear you have of not having control over a situation Roswell UFO incident American Pie (song) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wheel of Fortune Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Road traffic accident A Day in the Life Fixed-wing aircraft Unidentified flying object Dream One Tree Hill (TV series) Accidents and incidents in aviation Melanie Thornton Pop punk Green Day Waylon Jennings 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Philosophical skepticism 24 Hours of Le Mans United Airlines Flight 93 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Plame affair Minority Report (film) Air safety Roxette Sigmund Freud Futurama (TV series - season 5) Psychoanalysis Tenerife disaster Mumia Abu-Jamal Speed limit American Dreams Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hearsay The X-Files (season 1) Knots Landing Major League Baseball television contracts United Airlines Flight 232 Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
