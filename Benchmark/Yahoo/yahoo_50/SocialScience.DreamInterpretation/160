i had a dream my boyfriend cheated on me what can it mean i had a dream he came home with the obvious signs of cheating he tried to make it seem like it was no big deal and that it didnt even happen in the dream i started crying getting mad and was trying to leave him in the dream then i woke up my boyfriends never cheated before he's just not one of those scummy guys and he's away at work right now should i tell him about it and what do you think it means a dream is just a dream the most it can mean is that some part of you is worried that he might cheat one day doesn't have to have any basis in reality i also think it means that a part of you realizes how important he is to you and that scares you a bit because you are afraid of losing him don't mention it to him he might feel you are accusing him of something he hasn't even done chalk it up to a strange dream and forget it most dreams never come true i dreamt once that i was riding a pegasus winged horse however i've rarely been on a horse in my life even though i love horses doesn't mean i'll ever have a horse and definitely never will ride a winged one but it did indicate my own personal wishes it was still just a dream good luck Avenue Q Milton H.
