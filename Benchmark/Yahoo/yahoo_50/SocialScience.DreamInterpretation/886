why do i keep having dreams about dinosaurs i have a book which explains dream meanings but dinosaurs is not in it its not a recurring dream its different dreams with dinosaurs in them always carniverous spelling dino's t rexes raptor type things etc i never get bitten or eaten but am always being chased by them or hiding from them and its usually in houses or in a residential street seriously its bugging me now i've had these dreams about times over the last year or so c'mon someone tell me what the hell is going on in my brain kim you're not going to find the answer in those dream interpretation books they're fun to read i had one when i was younger too but a book that says for example water means this trees mean that is taking objects out of the context of the dream it doesn't know your entire dream who you are what's going on in your life etc therapists are trained to interpret the dreams of their patients but even they make sure the patient does most of the interpretation just guides them once in a while they will tell the patient what they see in the dream by the way i am certainly not saying you need therapy most people have recurring dreams or as in your case dreams that have recurring themes some are very common to many people such as dreaming you are falling or flying i myself have been having types of dreams with recurring themes for the past couple years and i have yet to figure them out kim i don't know how old you are but i would hazard a guess that you are young excuse me if i'm wrong the subject of dinosaurs is very popular in addition to learning about them in school we see movies about them etc so it's not surprising that they would be the main subject in your dreams now the fact that they are carnivorous is important that means they are a danger to you also you said they are always chasing you or you are hiding from them you know that the dinosaurs are symbolic of something else in your life that is frightening you even if you are not aware of it it's in your sub conscious or even deeper in your un conscious the good thing about those dreams is that you never actually get hurt or destroyed this shows that you are a strong resourceful girl and the dream is showing you that whatever is scary to you in real life can't really hurt you that you can handle it no matter how big a problem it seems no matter how overwhelming the fact that they take place in houses or in residential streets tells me i would need to know more information about that part of the dreams about you i could easily say it suggests something is going on in your family some change that took place a year or so ago or an on going situation that started then but that could be wrong it could simply mean that houses mean something to you so i won't try to jump to any conclusions there one good thing is that you have had these dreams only about times over the past year or so that's not even one a month so that tells me that you are really not that terrified as the dreams would imply we also tend to work out real problems we have by symbolically making up a situation in our dreams at night and as we work out the situation in our dreams we are working out our real problems sometimes without even realizing it i hope this helped you somewhat what i can say is that the dreams tell me you are stronger than whatever issue is going on in your life whether small or big good luck Dream Avenue Q Scenes from a Memory Meaning of life Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Amber Spyglass American Pie (song) Autism Alcoholics Anonymous Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Carl Jung Calvin and Hobbes Sigmund Freud Pitaten Paranoia Agent Philosophy of language Sin City Milton H.
