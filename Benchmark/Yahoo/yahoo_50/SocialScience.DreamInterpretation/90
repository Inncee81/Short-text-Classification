is this a reincarnation dream or just a strange coincidence well i don't know if i can remember it that well it was about two years ago but i'll give it a shot in my dream it seemed as if i were a man which uh isn't right haha but i was watching myself like an outer body experience it starts with some very high powered man giving me a medal of honor then i head out to a submarine i was in uniform like i was a marine or something well right before the submarine went under i was looking out the window at the ocean and a very cold grey sky looked like iceland or something and i was walking to the bathroom just as we started our descent into the sea just as we were climbing down i looked into the mirror and my ears started hurting like a lot p here is where i woke up i woke up yelling crying feeling every emotion in the world i asked my mom later and her uncle died in the marines in a submarine sinking off the coast of iceland on my birthday exactly years ago reincarnation coincidence or communication ooh and my grand uncle got a purple heart award would this explain the medal i got in the beginning of the dream and nobody knew exactly how my grand uncle died could this be a form of communication and i never heard this story my mom doesn't talk about her family often and we don't talk to that side of the family i don't even know my grandma's names hahaha this very well could be a past life regression dream you should keep a dream journal and write down everything you dream about and the date we can learn a lot from our dreams just the energies you woke with suggest that this dream had strong significance for you i would say either a past life memory or a visit from you grand uncle you could have been him or one of his fellow sub mates on that fateful day very cool thanks for sharing that one Scenes from a Memory Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Miss Saigon Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jiddu Krishnamurti Plate tectonics Reincarnation W.I.T.C.H.
