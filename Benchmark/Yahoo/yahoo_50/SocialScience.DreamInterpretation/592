what causes a reoccuring person in your dreams over the last almost yrs now i have had dreams of the same person its someone i have never met in person these dreams are very emotional and when i wake i can still feel the impact from them for weeks and weeks and it cause me to withdraw into myself feelings of hurt seperation also come from this they are not everyday dreams but happen often threw out every year it started when i was in my middle teens and now i am in my middle 's just curious as to the cause of them according to dreamcrowd it is very common to dream about all kinds of faces strange faces and familiar faces alike are frequent images in our dreams interpret your dream by considering the face and the general content of the dream a stranger's face could represent different parts of your personality or psyche you think that you are seeing a stranger but in actuality you are seeing a different part of yourself jung said that the stranger is a part of you that comes from the unconscious a comic face may indicate that you have a conscious or unconscious need to mock or snub the conventional featureless faces suggest that you may feel unnoticed and unappreciated on the other hand some believe that the blank or unclear face represents a teacher that is someone who is there to show and teach you a lesson but you are unprepared for it and the face is blank smiling faces are representative of happy thoughts and feelings and possibly anticipation of a joyful event in the near future always remember the compensatory nature of dreams and their ability to point to the opposite of what you experience in daily life try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Dream Carl Jung Consciousness Unconscious mind Sigmund Freud The Giver Shaggy dog story Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Lucid dreaming Milton H.
