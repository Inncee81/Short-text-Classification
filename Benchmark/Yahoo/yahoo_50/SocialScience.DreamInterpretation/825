i'm married and pregnant and dreaming of a fantasy man last night i had a dream where i was not pregnant and wasn't even aware i had a husband i was with friends from high school hanging out when an absolutely gorgeous guy approached me and we all of a sudden started to kiss the chemistry was undeniable he took my hand and we started walking to this courtyard when this happened it all of a sudden fell nightime and the stars shone brightly like never before another thing that was strange was that there was fish swimming in the air as blue and vibrant as his eyes he took me in his arms and we seemed to float in midair with the same magic electricity as when we first locked eyes the dream ends there is this normal why was my husband completely out of the picture do i secretly want to have an affair or did i just get lucky with one last fling before i start a family with my husband i would love to hear your input ah don't worry it doesn't mean you're having an affair this first thing might sound a little new agey and cheesy i read in a book once that when you dream of a lover of the opposite sex who isn't your real life lover it's like a shadow or projection of a part of your soul or of an opposite energy connected to your soul he showed up in your dream to show you that he will love and protect you and that you will be happy in your new family night time and water symbolized by the fish imply femininity and your subconscious to further that theory maybe he symbolized something new coming to you your baby or the fact that you will be raising a family something that you will be in love with and treasure wholeheartedly i can't think of anything else but it sounds like a happy and wonderful dream and since you seem to have no intention of leaving your husband in real life i would take it as a good sign d EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory W.I.T.C.H.
