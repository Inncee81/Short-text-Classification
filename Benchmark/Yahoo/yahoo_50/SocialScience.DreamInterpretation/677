i have dreams that come true but not on a daily basis how can i get these dreams to happen more often i get dreams maybe every two weeks that actually happen they're not really important but i start to remember what i dreamed when i see it happening for example recently i was at a baseball game and the game went into extra innings then i saw a kid waving a sign and i remembered briefly what happened but i knew which team would win in what way and it happened again there was a dream that i had that occurred when i was having a conversation with my friends now every time i have these dreams i forget about them until it happens then i recall what will go down how can i have these dreams more often and have them become more detailed you cannot control your dreams you may have psychic dreams if i were you i'd keep a notebook beside your bed or under your pillow and when you wake write the parts of your dream that are still remaining it will get easier with time just words you don't have to make sentences you know point form then you will be able to have an accurate record of how many of your dreams are prophetic and you may be able to spot a pattern make sure you date your log good luck psychic sylvia brown advises you ask god for guidance as to why you are receiving this and if there is a work he needs you to do usually these gifts are not for personal gain Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Dream Derren Brown Philosophical skepticism Jon Secada Social rule The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Playoff Wheel of Fortune Theory of conduct Psychokinesis Boston Red Sox Cliff Richard Edgar Cayce She Loves You Satchel Paige Socrates Telepathy The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan D__j__ vu Emanuel Swedenborg 1919 World Series World Series Time Out of Mind New York Knicks Cleveland Browns No-hitter John Berryman Jean Grey Baseball Stars Ty Cobb A Course In Miracles Thank God It's Doomsday Emotions (album) Phaedo Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Chicago Cubs Troy Glaus War of the Worlds (television) Sandy Koufax Dream Theater Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Unconscious mind Japanese poetry San Francisco Giants Parapsychology Tris Speaker 1957 World Series 1986 World Series Eberron Los Angeles Clippers False prophet New York Giants Miracle Pittsburgh Steelers Maimonides The Catcher in the Rye Humphrey Bogart Apocalypse Christmas San Diego Padres Norway national football team Bowl Championship Series Miami Dolphins Blood on the Tracks Link (Legend of Zelda) Numerology Cricket AFI 100 Years series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blog Innings Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
