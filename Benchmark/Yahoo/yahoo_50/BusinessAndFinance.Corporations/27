how much do you think private security contractors like blackwater charge private companies greetings i am doing a report on private security companies like blackwater dyncorp etc i am wondering if anyone knew an estimate of how much these companies charge for corporate business security in places like the middle east for example if a medium sized trading company wanted to open a center in a risky country what do you think the industry charge would be this is a difficult question to answer unless you define the requirements better the cost of security personnel in iraq would probably range from to per hour per person there would also be costs for logistics housing equipment supervision and management etc and the customer would typically pay for all of these costs in addition to the hourly rate for personnel so if you had ten security people on staff it could cost you about million just for security personnel alone a company that was serious about doing this would typically hire a security consultant to do a threat assessment based on the size and location of the proposed trading company the consultant would then recommend the number of security personnel needed types of security systems etc and the client could budget accordingly Private military contractor Wal-Mart Call centre Insurance Citigroup United Kingdom corporation tax Donald Rumsfeld Blackwater USA Defense Logistics Agency United States Postal Service Reliability engineering Management Credit card Trade union Raytheon Halliburton British national identity card National Health Service Education in the People's Republic of China Karl Rove Privatization Bank Sarbanes-Oxley Act Outsourcing Investment bank Hanscom Air Force Base Telephone numbering plan Classified information Japan Self-Defense Forces Mutual fund Microsoft America Online Corporate governance MMORPG Manitoba Hydro Voice over IP Non-governmental organization Peacekeeping Plame affair Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Publicly funded medicine Corporate finance Health insurance Multinational force in Iraq Coalition Provisional Authority Capital accumulation Xerox Incident Command System Microeconomics Tax Risk management Gartner United Airlines United States Marine Corps Unemployment United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme Security (finance) Social Security debate (United States) Natural monopoly Enterprise resource planning Secretar__a de Inteligencia Security guard Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina New Deal Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Hedge fund Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 Crew Exploration Vehicle Government of France Information Services Procurement Library Financial analyst George W.
