acura tl or acura tsx im and im getting my car in a couple days which one do you think is better for me i am an acura dealer and i see many times where parents get their kids a tl then they are back not long after for another car because their child did not know how to drive and the tl had too much power and they wrecked the car like one of the other people said the tsx is an awesome car it handles i feel much better than the tl and it is a more solid car this car also holds it's value a lot better than the tl i know its hard to believe but this car has a better resale value than any other car out there the tsx comes with almost the exact same things that the tl comes with if you purchase a or newer the tl and above do not have a lot of transmission problems that was the previous tl the tsx i have not seen a lot in the shop unlike the tl which is probably in almost as much as the previous mdx one thing you have to remember is that the tl is the top seller so of course you will see more in the shop if you have some time on your hands you should really wait if you are buying new for the new tsx which wil be out in april or may of because from what i hear it will blow the series out of the water i have had two tsx's an and now an and i have enjoyed them everytime i get in them you feel very secure and in control once you learn the triptronic shift in the car you will find out that the car is actually very fast not off the line but on the highway i will put it up against a lot of cars even the v 's one thing i found out the other day is i don't think it has a govenor because i hit mph in th gear the other night racing on the highway so trust me this car has all you need for starting out Acura TL Acura Acura MDX Honda Acura TSX Drag racing Time Out of Mind 24 Hours of Le Mans About a Boy Toyota Prius Acura Integra (North America) Acura RL Indianapolis 500 Sport utility vehicle Honda B engine Car handling Porsche 911 The Amazing Race Mercedes-Benz Nissan Skyline Ben Johnson (athlete) Honda Prelude Mazda RX-7 Honda NSX The Beatles discography Wangan Midnight 2000 Australian Grand Prix Bombardier EastEnders Operation Market Garden 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Beltway sniper attacks Manual transmission NASCAR Jackass: The Movie Mitsubishi 3000GT Yugo Automatic transmission Bluetooth TGV Back to the Future Initial D Transmission (mechanics) Automobile Gran Turismo (game) Motorcycle Grand Theft Auto III Social rule Fuel efficiency Shaggy dog story Rear wheel drive Ford Thunderbird Year of the Spider Toyota MR2 Top Gear Diesel engine Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Acura RSX Dodge Neon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Honda Ascot The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Supercar Heinkel He 112 Honda Pilot Ford Mustang Honda Civic Craps Bulk vending BMW M5 Extreme Championship Wrestling Car and Driver Ten Best Mazda Miata Supply and demand Lincoln LS Honda S2000 Toyota Land Cruiser Billboard Hot 100 Dodge Charger Hybrid Synergy Drive Honda CX series Hybrid vehicle PRS Guitars Microeconomics Cosworth Edsel Radio controlled car Blonde on Blonde Rules of the road Traffic light Volkswagen Golf UK Singles Chart Chris Amon Speed limit Diving Gear ratio Empire Burlesque Donald Neilson
