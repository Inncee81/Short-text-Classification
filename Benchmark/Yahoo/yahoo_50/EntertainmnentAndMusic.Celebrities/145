is it possible to get a celebrity to sign something through mail or such specifically clive owen i have no chance of meeting clive owen in person but getting him to sign a poster for the new movie shoot 'em up would be one of my most prized possessions is there any way to do something like that thank you look honestly the chances are slim only a very few celebrities will do this the best way to enhance your chances is to mail the poster making sure to enclose a return container with ample postage and a very polite letter asking the celebrity to sign the poster personally to you they are more likely to sign something to a specific person because that lessens the chances of a profit being made by the recipient on their signature alone good luck United States Postal Service Pretty Good Privacy E-mail Postage stamp Autograph Mail Winning Streak Game show E-mail spam Michael Owen Post office Terrell Owens Surveillance Public-key cryptography Horror film Mail fraud Viral marketing Free Republic Stamp collecting Neopets Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive Aristotle Envelope McFly Gosford Park Sinclair Research Ltd Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Objective-C Rodney Anoai Make money fast Live 8 Celebrity William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Postage stamps and postal history of the United States The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Clive Owen Postage due Order of Canada ZIP Code Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Wilfred Owen Chinese New Year $ale of the Century Patent About a Boy Princeton University Spam (electronic) Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Dr. No Autopen Babe Ruth Trust (Law) USA Consensus decision-making Yukio Mishima Whose Line Is It Anyway?
