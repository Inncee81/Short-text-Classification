why do i sometimes feel like i was a mistake to be here on this earth don't get me wrong i sort of like my life but yet i sort of don't life isn't a walk around the park but let me go into details first off i'm bad at everything there is nothing i'm really good at i suck at anything you could imagine i suck at all sports i suck at doing hand on work i suck at school work i suck at playing an instrument i just simply suck i mean things for me are going in the right direction but i always end up to screw it up some how i'll get over it but wow do i suck at life lol also the longest relationship i ever had with someone was a month and a half and she broke it off online so i suck at that too what is my problem why am i here lol i'm still trying to figure that out i just sometimes feel like i don't belong here on earth does anyone else feel the same i'm not suicidal but i think i don't deserve to be here although there is one thing i'm good at and that's being nice and respecting other people you think to much my friend let talk about sport first what good is sport either you are very talented and become professional then you can become famous and rich although they also have their own problem with injuries among other things very few of those talented people the rest of us are either above average or below average sound like you are below average so what if some guy beat you what is he going to do with that victory brag to his girlfriend meaningless so unless you are very talented and turn pro sport for the rest of us is just to keep in shape nothing more don't take defeat to hard the same thing goes with playing an instrument i can't play an instrument either so what i go out to the music store i buy my favorite cd then go home listen to it and enjoy my music now working you suck at hand on work and you suck at school so you probably end up with a minimum wage job so what does money make a person happy no it is the state of mind that make you happy or not i use to work for less money with less responsibility those were the happiest days of my life most people assume that bill gates is happy may be he has more headache than you can even imaginable finally your short relationship so what you are in good company the divorce rate are high among movie stars there are billions of people out there someone is right for you your job is to find that person my advice is do not assume what is right and what is not right for you since you are probably suck at that too so try everything until you find what is right for you enjoy the journey laugh when you don't get what you want next is the right answer don't act like a loser walk with your head up don't be nice to everyone be nice and respect people who deserve to be respect good luck Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Friends Pitaten Humphrey Bogart Professional wrestling slang Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Theodicy 2000 Australian Grand Prix W.I.T.C.H.
