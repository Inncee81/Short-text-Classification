how do i make it stop i guess i caused it myself by always whining about living in a small town i am young and very confused and have no idea what i want to do with my life or where i want to live or visit when people imply that my life is mundane or mediocre it makes me sad like i'm not living up to their expectations that i should be doing what they want then they keep pushing their ideals onto me after i've just thrown out an idea but i'm not even sure of it why does it seem like older people try to relive their life over through you is this what's happening it does seem like that sometimes and i always used to think the same as you but now i have children i can understand how some people like to give you ideas and push to do more things because they are older and as you reflect on your own life and as they reflect on their lives they can see with insight at the things they may wish they had have done when they were your age if your not interested then kindly tell them that your happy with the direction that your life is going at the moment Theory of conduct Meaning of life Pitaten Milton H.
