is it wrong to con people out of their money i was wondering if it is morally wrong or if it is classified as stealing because i don't think so i think that tricking people into giving their money to you is not forcing them to give you anything therefore it is just lying lying is not a sin plus you teach the person a valuable lesson in the end your opinions will be much appreciated well depends on your morals everyone's morals are different most people base their way of life off of that in which there religion tells them to so christians follow the bible as a moral guide for instance i see nothing wrong in coning someone out of their money i think that it shows that you are smart and influential and very charismatic but some might think differently about you i think it is a skill to con someone out of money Ten Commandments Ethics Morality Sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theory of conduct Evil Value system Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion Moral objectivism Confidence trick Pacifism Baptist Ethics in religion Calvinism Philosophy Friedrich Schleiermacher Charles Grandison Finney John Howard Yoder Divine grace Reincarnation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Holy Spirit Evangelicalism Gospel of Thomas God New Testament Theodicy Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Resurrection of Jesus Human sexual behavior Church of Christ, Scientist Religion and sexuality Goodness and value theory Philipp Melanchthon Ocean's Twelve Religious views of suicide Church of Christ Human nature S__ren Kierkegaard Categorical imperative Abortion debate Simone Weil Prophet Theology Abington School District v.
