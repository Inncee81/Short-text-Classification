multiple personalities i put this in mental health then thought it might go better here i doubt anyone can help me but i thought i would try i have multiple personalities and we dont get along very well anymore i've tried shrinks and they arent any good for me and its not dangerous or interfearing with my life and unless i tell them most people dont even know but its simply depressing we each want different things the 'primary' personality has more or less the life she wants husband and kids and such but the rest of us are miserable especially given that i am in love with the husbands old college roomate and that another one of us is a lesbian i dont know how we can all be happy at once unless we all had bodies of our own which i dont see bieng even remotly possible any advice or experiences of your own would be great but please dont be hateful we all have our problems mine are just a little more outspoken then others to the person who said this is normal is it normal to be able to distinguish different selves even small personality quirks how we like our coffee or tea what music we like our speech patters we may even converse amongst ourselves and do not always get along on any matter i can think of it is as if several souls got jammed into one body as for the roomate its possible its the timeframe i miss i do wish to go back but i cant help but feel how i do for him even back during that time i knew him well he knew a bit about the multiple personalities but not in detail i guess you could say i never introduced myself he actually has a splintered personality aswell only one from what i know i we went to different shrinks and a mental hospital while still in highschool they never listen and would try to tell me things 'couldnt' have happened and that i was lying they also put me on meds that nearly killed me although i have no idea what they were anymore i went to about five different shrinks pretty much all the ones in my and area and no one could help i'm also not sure i like the idea of us all bieng shoved together into one person to the person who thinks i am lying i have alot of issues ones that did not let me function properly for many years my doctors did not help i worked through it mostly with friends journaling excersize my spirituality and other self therapies i'm not saying i'm perfect now but i get along well enough i have alot of friends and family keeping an eye on me aswell so if i do anything wrong they would be sure to tell me i'm guessing the primary personality knows how all of you feel but is too happy with the life she is leading to let any of you take over even temporarily has personality integration failed when the primary dealt with psychiatrists psychologists if so it may be that you haven't dealt with the root of when the personalities diverged does she know what event caused the fracturization of the personalities you say you're in love with hubby's old college roommate this sounds weird to say but maybe you're in love with the time frame of when the hubby was in college and the old roommate just represents that time frame a time of innocence and youthful expression i'm not judging you by any means i know that it takes a horrific event to splinter a personality good luck with personality integration the best outcome Autism Goodness and value theory Psychoanalysis Friedrich Schleiermacher Bipolar disorder Avenue Q Milton H.
