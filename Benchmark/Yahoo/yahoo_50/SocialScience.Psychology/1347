how do i stop procrastinating i always procrastinate and i end up not doing anything for example i had a lot of things to do this summer and i didn't do any of them i say that i'm going to do thingas and i just do something else or i start and nerver finish them i don't want this to become a serious problem in my life that keeps me from doing what i want to do first thing to do is make a list if you can make a list of what you want done then its half the solution the second thing is when do you want it done by again this list can be long getting longer by the day though if by naming them and seeing them written on paper or on a pc screen then it would motivate you into dealing with them if not in a particular order or sequence at least by nature of them after a short while you will see that the large list has actually shrunk Theory of conduct On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Lisp programming language 1957 World Series 2000 Australian Grand Prix Time Out of Mind Arabic alphabet Eight queens puzzle Current teachings of Prem Rawat Bookbinding Topology Textile manufacturing AmigaOS Traumatic incident reduction Philosophy of space and time Alex Ferguson Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Requirements analysis Black hole Paul W.
