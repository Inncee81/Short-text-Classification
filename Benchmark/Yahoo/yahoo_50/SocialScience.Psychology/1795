is there anything i can do a group of us are visiting our friend nxt week i used to fancy her about months ago we didn't speak for months i ended contact because she didn't want to become more i cudn't take anymore though she clearly liked me mates agreed we eventually met up as a group and she was extremely rude snappy at me throughout the whole day she also showed clear signs of jealousy as i hit it off wth another girl that came along all my mates could see it contact increased among us after the trip via email txt and i believed the friendship was getting back to normal i've recently been meeting many women going on dates and it's a great feeling this has been reflected on my facebook page by the women i met and mate's comments photo's i don't understand why she hasn't spoken to me for over a month she's spoken to our other mates about the trip saying how great it'll be planning the wkn etc but nothing to me why won't she speak to me does she want me visit what could i have done the last time we spoke was when i txt her at am and others saying what a great night out i had no mention of other women she might not b speaking u a few reasons like she really likes u but isn't ready for the intensity of a serious love thing or she has a lot going on in her life or she has someone you don't know about or you mad her angry and she's waiting for an apology my suggestion to you is first apologize like if i've upset you i m sorry then text her not about your night but wishing her a good night or tell her you are thinking of her just a short word sentence or times a week next after weeks of txting her sweet msgs send her a card in the mail short sweet and simple something like i've been thinking about you let's grab lunch at on friday see you there don't mention the other women bc it's going to make her jealous and wonder what you are expecting from her make sure you compliment her when you see her nothing vulgar or sexual simply a wow you look amazing kind of compliment make sure that you make the conversation about her and what's going on in her life make sure you are listening to what she says and comment back on the topic include some of her ideas or thoughts this should help good luck Plame affair Social rule Kodocha The Emancipation of Mimi Haven (TNG episode) God Emperor of Dune Friends Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Ron and Fez Dead Like Me The Chemical Brothers Pitaten Shaggy dog story About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart The Smoking Room Ranma __ characters Zoophilia Religious Society of Friends Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Sharon Tate Milton H.
