if somebody is ashamed of something they did wrong could it make them feel angry or embarrased or something like that and also do some people withdraw from others when they feel ashamed yes yes and yes those are all natural and common ways people react to feeling ashamed especially men people may feel bad about doing something wrong so their reaction is to bite back so to speak and act angry or try to turn it around on someone else re direct the blame feeling embarassed is also a very normal reaction no one likes to be wrong or ashamed so embarassment is the result of feeling ashamed and withdrwling from others is another way one might react especially if what they did was ather serious like an unfaithful spouse or someone who commited a crime when you see someone is reacting to their ashame i dont think thats a word but o well dont try to make them feel worse they are already obviously guilty and making them feel worse is only going to put you in the wrong and worsen the situation just be patient wait for an appology and except it or not then move on sometimes people need time to feel angry or embarassed before they can say they are sorry or explaine themselves Stuttering Theory of conduct Futurama (TV series - season 5) Avenue Q Social rule Prostate cancer Mental illness Utilitarianism Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Pitaten Ben Johnson (athlete) Binge eating disorder Allergy John Howard Yoder Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Infantilism Emperor Guangwu of Han Divorce Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chimei Domestic violence Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Jam (TV series) Procrastination Foreign reaction to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Evil Characters in the Smurfs Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Karen Horney A.J.P.
