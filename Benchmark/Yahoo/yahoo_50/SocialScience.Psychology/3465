how does this happen any ideas would be a great help how can a person that in most ways is a very kind and considerate by nature person when put into a situation where they are dependent on someone that is trustworthy do things that they are completely unaware of that are either mean argumentative antagonistic or otherwise unhealthy behavior and be so unaware of this behavior that it seems to them that they are being falsely accused to the point that they become very defensive and end up denying almost if not everything no matter how many times they are told they can't seem to understand what went wrong or how this is even possible has anyone ever seen heard of this behavior or have an idea how to help them feel less defensive and get over the unhealthy behavior they also feel so misunderstood that they start to lose the ability to trust and just end up repeating things and asking to be listened to even though what they are saying is reinforcing the unhealthy behavior any thoughts or ideas will be a great help thank you new gardener are you saying that the trustworthy one is the jerk dovey is there any way i can contact you i have heard of you and have been told you have some good information but this is the first i have ever seen you how is the book coming was drinking involved it sounds like someone i know it's nice of you to stand by them after obviously enduring their behavior quite a lot i've only known someone to act like this after drinking so my advice is to do things that don't involve drinking with this friend you've told him her how they act so they know you don't like it i don't really see what else you can do to influence this person good luck Theory of conduct Social psychology Social rule Philosophy of language Nicomachean Ethics Ethics Traumatic incident reduction Stuttering Ontological argument Behaviorism Time Out of Mind Milton H.
