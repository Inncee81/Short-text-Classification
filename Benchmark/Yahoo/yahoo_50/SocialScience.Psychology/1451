pls interpret this dream non magical interpretations most welcome i was sitting on a sofa with my sister the sofa is outside some building on the sidewalk we got a news that our aunt and uncle couple got into an accident and we rushed to the hospital the relatives were there and most havent seen each other and us for a very long time we exchanged hugs and i noticed my aunt about years old now has her mother alive looking really old of course my aunt looks different but her mom looks like how she looks now anyway after the hospital incident it was christmas that time my mom told me that she will introduce me to this special child mentally and physically staying in the hospita who i dont really know and i was a bit distant to him because i really dont know him and i dont know what to talk about etc after that we got a news that out parents both died same day i didnt know what my mother died of and my father died because of lung complications smoker we inherited his collection of boots wher he hides continued in our mountain cabin we selected which ones we liked and we got home back home i was crying in the living room and i saw my parents in the flesh my father looks thinner and different and i cant see my mom only her shape on her orange office uniform i held their hands and i felt their warm hands and i held it firmly i really felt it i was sobbing terribly until the dragged me to the gate they said they must leave now i asked my sister if she can see them too since i was holding them she said yes crying hard i knew there that she was just lying to me to comfort me perhaps parents and my sister hugged together and my mother went outside the gate walked left my father walked to the right direction then i woke up at am gasping for air end knowing how old you are and if you are male or female would help with this i'm guessing you're female and probably a young adult i'm wondering if you are beginning to realize that soon you and your sister will be the adults or elders of your family as your parents and other family members age and are not sure how you feel about moving into that role you also fear losing those people that you love the mention of christmas can indicate something to do with your faith or tradition or possibly a season of life in one of my past dreams there was a special child in a hospital that was claiming to be my child and i kept saying no i do not have a child here but later i understood that special child was me the parts of me that had been left behind as i tried to grow up and be what everyone expected me to be in that same dream there was a dead woman in my office cabinet i realized that the woman could not live until the child was recognized and embraced during this time the lord was helping me get back important parts of myself that i had lost i don't know if this will help you but it is food for thought and prayer it could also represent things in your family line that you need to recognize or deal with the collection of inherited boots can represent things your parents values lifestyle gifts etc or your parents faith or both you are working to decide which of the boots of your parents that you want to walk in and which you you prefer to discard if your parents are still alive in reality this dream might reflect your recognition that they are not always going to be there or that you have to find your own way in life and in faith in some ways this letting go is like a death because it hurts especially if they do not always understand your choices sometimes they feel not needed and resent your new independence even if you basically embrace the same faith and values as your parents they are not always going to understand the choices you make and you will have to be true to god and to yourself and make the choice that is right for you the fact that your mother walked to the left and your father to the right into the afterlife might suggest you have questions about whether or not they are both on the same path or if one of them is on the wrong path spiritually i'm guessing perhaps your mother is the one you feel most concern for you can visit me at my website if you like www mytincottage com Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The Shining (film) Kodocha Milton H.
