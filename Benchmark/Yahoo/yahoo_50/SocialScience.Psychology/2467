why is it hard to cry i usually don't like to cry and it is over months since i cried lately there were times i wanted to cry and i couldn't there is some thing inside that forces me to cry but i can't shed a tear i hear people say it helps to cry sometimes it's hard to cry because it requires that you get real with your inner self and until you do you won't cry you'll remain in a state of denial because there's a shell there to protect you from this hurtful terrible pain that comes from the soul apparently you have some major amounts of water damned up and you know inside that you won't be able to cry just a little there's some major bawling being bottled up and you're just not ready to face that sadness yet when you finally do you'll see it's easier to stay in touch with your emotions you will feel better and you'll be happier actually once you've gone through the process of forgiving yourself or whomever it was that has hurt you Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breastfeeding Mojave people Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Amber Spyglass Pitaten Year of the Spider The Inside Piccolo Junior Saga Tears The Death Gate Cycle Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Diving Knots Landing Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Muslim ibn Aqeel Simone Weil Kodocha Angel (vampire) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ben Johnson (athlete) Theory of conduct Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Anger management Sting (musician) Alcoholics Anonymous Blood on the Tracks Gia Carangi A Course In Miracles Ayyavazhi mythology Trish Stratus The Parting of the Ways Humphrey Bogart Buddy Guy Dualism (philosophy of mind) The Beatles discography The Contender (television series) Gosei Sentai Dairanger Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) YuYu Hakusho Famous last words Wallflower (comics) Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Billy Ocean Milton H.
