how do you prepare yourself for the worst my exams didnt go well at all and i think i am going to fail my class fellows will graduate before me and i will have to give the exams again my project will also be delayed due to it it was all because of a relationship someone i loved left me and i couldnt concentrate on my studies i was on the verge of killing myself but then i thought about my family now my result is going to come and i know its going to be bad please tell me how to stand up in life again and face it also tell me how to remained clinged to god as you often feel faithless in these situations thanks i think about the scale of things one year ago i was tending my husband cancer and my mother in law heart problems going to college and working full time since then i've left school left not graduated lost that job and my husband and mother in law within days of each other guess what the world keeps turning it will continue to turn i'm still here and have a new job i don't care if i ever go back to college it doesn't matter anymore but for you there is always time to try again one day when you are old and dying will it really matter it is only a setback not the end of things as a matter of fact it could be turned around and used to help others who struggle we can have hard times and still move forward i thought my world would end when my beloved husband died but it didn't it just changed people have tragities lose loved ones miss oppurtunities lose jobs etc and still move forward life is not about what happens to you it is about how you re act to what happens don't let you circumstances determine who you are use them as tools to help you grow expand and then reach out to others Pitaten Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Procrastination Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Grade (education) Hikikomori Honey and Clover 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dead Like Me Current teachings of Prem Rawat Shaggy dog story Ten Commandments Love Hina main characters Transactional analysis Uzumaki Naruto Maison Ikkoku Polyamory Graduate school Great Teacher Onizuka Mother Teresa Jean Grey Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist High school Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Boston Public Past teachings of Prem Rawat Fathers' rights Infantilism Time Out of Mind Education in Romania The Ashlee Simpson Show Phoebe Halliwell Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Abortion debate Ranma __ characters American and British English differences The Lovely Bones Kodocha She Loves You Billboard Hot 100 Anderson Cooper U.S. Electoral College Jon Secada Social rule Miss Saigon Lawyer Battle of Warsaw (1920) The Subtle Knife Hollyoaks D.N.
