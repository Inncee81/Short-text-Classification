question for lucid dreamers i just took an afternoon nap today for about hours in that time i started to have a series of lucid dreams the problem is i couldnt stay in them very long i have to keep using the spinning technique like every seconds and it only works about half the time im also aware that becoming exited can wake you but i am usually calm so here are some questions can someone give me some tips for staying in my lucid dreams for a long time like atleast a few minutes not seconds is that normal to only stay in that short idk if its just me but it seems the spinning method will only work if you start doing it the second the visual starts to fade is this true here we go here's some ways you can try to ld longer rubbing your hands together or holding onto something can help you can also try to focus on something most say something of a bright color like red but i was afraid i wouldn't be lucid when i looked away when i tried that but that was me there's also telling yourself out loud increase lucidity now again it might be just me but i'm afraid that if speaking doesn't wake me then my laughing will however when you do any of these or others constantly remind yourself that you're dreaming otherwise you might go into a normal dream yes some people have to work at somethings more than others that's true with anything keep at it nothing always stays the same i'm sure it'll work if you try it before the dream starts to fade sort of like a preventive spin as for well after it starts to fade i believe that's just something you'll have to work on good luck and congrats on having several lucid dreams in one go i'm thrilled everytime i have one i'd be jumping up and down swinging my arms wildly if i'd done that Lucid dreaming Dream Out-of-body experience Aerial (dance move) The Amber Spyglass Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sleep Volleyball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Sonic the Hedgehog Billiards Futurama (TV series - season 5) Textile manufacturing Natural Selection (computer game) Traumatic incident reduction Consciousness Care Bears Swingout Piccolo Junior Saga Diving Fast bowling Good Morning, Vietnam Daylight saving time 2000 Australian Grand Prix Jon Secada Internal ballistics Episodes of Lost (Season 2) USS Tunny (SS-282) Narcolepsy Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Poker jargon Gamma ray burst Professional wrestling holds Craps GunBound Combine (Half-Life 2) Wheel of Fortune Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Lightsaber combat Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Urinary incontinence Indianapolis 500 Speed of light Oh My Goddess!
