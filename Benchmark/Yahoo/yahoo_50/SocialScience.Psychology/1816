don't you get so frustrated when a beautiful song is ruined because it constantly relates to someone in your head especially when it someone that you would prefer not think about it's ruined though your mind will just not let go of the connection people try too hard they always know the right thing to say oh i take all experiences in whether good or bad i sit to that song that reminds me of the annoying person and i am thankful for knowing them and smile at the discomfort this person brought to their life don't get me wrong i am very optimistic but don't give me that life is not so perfect grow up if a person is in deep sorrow then he will be in frustration Shaggy dog story Social rule Pitaten Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
