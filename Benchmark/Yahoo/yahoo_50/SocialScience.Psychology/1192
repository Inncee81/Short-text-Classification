i can't get over small mistakes i don't no what's wrong with me when i make a very small mistake it keeps bothering me and i feel so stupid for making such a mistake and i hate myself so much i want to get over it but i keep thinking of those things in the past i just wanna run away to some place where nobody will find me sometimes i wish i never existed i feel so bad about myself in many ways especially when i'm shy and don't wanna speak a language that's not my primary language and when some stranger talks to me and i answer them in or words and sometimes i don't speak loud enough me mom just tells them i've been here not so long and i cant speak the language so well bla bla like she has to tell everyone this and sometimes she laughs when i talk and i feel so stupid embarrassed yeah language becomes a burden for me it's discouraging i don't have confidence anymore how to get over it i am like that before i used to think that my mistakes are so small only dumb people would commit them but as i move on i kept on repeating those mistakes and felt badly of myself then i realized why i keep on committing them i did not learn so whenever i commit a mistake no matter how grave i make it a point to learn from it now how to avoid doing it again and to find alternative ways of how to avoid committing it as for language concerns try thinking using the language you'll find it easier to speak when you don't think in english then translate it to the language think using the language and practice also before doing anything begin with the end in mind envision yourself being able to respond fluently and then you'll find yourself doing so also don't be afraid to commit mistakes cause when you do it'll teach you how to be better mistakes are not bad they actually make us better Social rule Avenue Q Singlish Jon Secada The Ashlee Simpson Show Stuttering Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ten Commandments The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cornish language Kodocha Theory of conduct Bill O'Reilly (commentator) One Tree Hill (TV series) She Loves You Ranma __ characters Alexander Technique Profanity Franz Boas A Course In Miracles Scientology beliefs and practices Joke Taiwanese (linguistics) Plame affair Theodicy Hiberno-English Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Ontological argument The Death Gate Cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Pitaten Quebec French Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chess strategy and tactics Garfield Book of Isaiah Past teachings of Prem Rawat Russian joke Asperger syndrome The Amber Spyglass English language Ludwig Wittgenstein Philosophical Investigations Esperanto as an international language Karen Horney Spanish verbs Alignment (role-playing games) Debugging Piccolo Junior Saga Transactional analysis American Sign Language Simone Weil Novel I Want to Hold Your Hand History of the English Bible Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Apology (Plato) English grammar Edgar Cayce Object-oriented programming Sant Thakar Singh Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist About a Boy Consensus decision-making Mojave people Yin Shun Phoebe Buffay's songs Evil Whose Line Is It Anyway?
