should i quit my school band ok i have been in band for about yrs and i used to really like it but now it seems more like a job and anyone whos in band knows that its a huge commitment and i dont think i want to waste my time like that anymore since i have all honors and a p classes and my career has nothing to do with music although people say that by being in band looks better to colleges and i could get scholarships by being in it but then again i cant really get them if im just an average player right overall i really invested thousands of dollars into it and lost almost all my friend outside of band just to be in it and i'd hate to think it was all for nothing ya know surprizingly though i still like being in it but i dont at the same time most people say that i should probly coast for a year and make my choice then what do you think i should do i think you should stick it out for the last year of high school once high school is over you have the rest of your life to not do band and re invent who you are in college you have put the time in and if you quit now it will all be for nothing just try and stick it out and the time yoou do spend doing band try to enjoy yourself and when you get stressed out over it just remind yourself that you are doing it for fun you said so yourself you are just an average player so killing yourself over it is not gonna help just stick it out and have fun while your in it Avenue Q Oasis (band) Atomic Kitten Quarashi Married... with Children MMORPG Alexander Kuoppala Minor league baseball Jennifer Lopez The Ashlee Simpson Show Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Kurt Cobain One Tree Hill (TV series) Alignment (role-playing games) Marching band Freeters Matt Hardy Green Day Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Clarinet Beyond Shadows W.I.T.C.H.
