i always wake up feeling sad why ive recently started to get over someone and i just push out old feelings i used to feel for them and try to ignore it and i would feel numb for a while then i would get these sudden highs where i feel so happy and excited and i tell myself im happier without this person i go to sleep feeling that way but then when i wake up i feel so empty and sad even when i felt so happy the night before its like it all went away and i just want to sit and cry its happened all week and i hate it why does that happen and sorry i dont know what category this goes in i know it must be hard i've been there before to the point where it got pretty bad all i have to say is to just move on i've tried everything as well to get over it nothing worked but when i finally did it was because time helped me in the meantime you can only wait i know it sounds pointless but think optimistically whatever made you happy before just keep thinking about it when the times comes you will even forget their names and if you see this person on a regular basis don't avoid them at all costs it helps trust me love can be such a stupid thing much better to be free and unattached emotionally not worth the trouble why don't you go out and buy yourself some new clothes change hair style feel good about yourself Shaggy dog story Happiness Pitaten The Amber Spyglass Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Time Out of Mind Jon Secada Avenue Q Current teachings of Prem Rawat Grunge music Goodness and value theory Knots Landing Transactional analysis The Ashlee Simpson Show Year of the Spider About Schmidt Kodocha The Shining (film) Megan Griffin Out-of-body experience Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mojave people The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cliff Richard Theory of conduct Emotions (album) Vernon Schillinger The Beatles discography Humphrey Bogart Nine Inch Nails The Wall Kimi Finster English grammar Atomic Kitten The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Negima The Emancipation of Mimi Philosophical skepticism Boston Public Borderline personality disorder One Tree Hill (TV series) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
