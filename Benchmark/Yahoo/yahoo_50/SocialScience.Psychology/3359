have you ever have a deja vu something happen and you know it have happened before or met someone and you have a feeling that you have knowen him i've had at least one that was verifiable by another party before my hubby and i were dating we were just friends one day he needed a ride so on my way to work i took him to the place he needed to go he was early for his appointment but i needed to get to work so i pulled into a nearby mcdonald's where he could get some coffee and breakfast until it was time for his appointment he could walk from the mcdonalds as soon as i put the car in 'park' i had a sudden wave wash over me i turned to him and said have we done this before he said no i said i think we've done this before you are going to go to your appointment and they are going to tell you that the man you are meeting had a death in the family and won't be able to make the appointment does any of that sound familiar i was still convinced that this had happened before because it was like a memory he just looked at me strangely and confirmed that we had never been in this situation before and this was the first time he was going to this place so i gave him a dollar and told him that if it did happen he could catch the bus and ride it to my work he just sort of shrugged and took the dollar and went into mcdonalds he probably thought i was crazy at that point i drove on to work when i got to work i was so emotional over the weirdness of the experience that i immediately told the receptionist about the whole situation i kind of laughed and said so don't be surprised if there's knock at the door later we both kind of laughed and i went to my office my hubby's appointment was supposed to be at a m at about a m the doorbell to our offices rang we had large solid doors that stayed locked and had to be answered by the receptionist i heard some commotion and went to see what it was it was my future hubby the noise had been the receptionist's reaction to him showing up just like i had said he came in and told both of us that it was just like i said he sat at the mcdonalds until right before his appointment he walked over to the place and they told him that the man he was supposed to meet had a death in the family and couldn't make the meeting they would have to reschedule so he used the dollar i gave him the only money he had left after buying breakfast and coffee at mcdonalds to ride the bus to my workplace we didn't have cell phones back then if he hadn't had the money to ride the bus he would have been stranded in that part of town all day ther receptionist at my work was an older lady who had been through a lot in her life after my future hubby left i spent some time talking to her about this incident to see if we could make sense of it we never really could she just said that sometimes it happens my hubby and i started dating about years later and were married years ago i don't know if he was in danger that day or what i absolutely have no explanation i do have one more premonition i can tell you about the receptionist i mentioned above had a daughter that was about she was single she had a bad marriage at an early age and she never re married one morning i came to work after having a vision and i asked the receptionist has your daughter ever thought about having children she looked at me very surprised because to my knowledge the daughter was not even dating anyone she said no she is approaching and she'll probably never have children but i just found out last night that she is getting very serious with a man she's been dating but he's older than her and they don't plan to have any children she wanted to know why i asked that i told her that i had a vision that morning of her daughter with a little girl in a ballerina costume i described the little girl to her i told her that it was a shame that her daughter wasn't going to have any children because she was such an accomplished woman and could pass on so much to a child we let it go at that a few weeks later the receptionist was very excited when i came into the office and told me that she had just found out her daughter was pregnant she and the boyfriend weren't even married yet and the daughter never thought she could get pregnant but she was they did not plan to or try to get pregnant nor did they use anything to help her get pregnant it was just out of the blue this woman had never had a pregnancy before they ended up having a little girl that looked just like the one i described to the receptionist from my vision the receptionist retired a few years ago and moved to be closer to her daughter son in law and granddaughter Friends Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Social rule Similarities between the Bible and
