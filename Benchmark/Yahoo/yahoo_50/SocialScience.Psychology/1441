how can i overcome my bad procrastination habit don't just tell me to get off my butt i'm asking for serious answers i've got an anxiety problem that flares up when i go out in public so finding a job is a bit difficult for me any tips or ideas i don't have a problem with anxiety in most situations unless i'm in an enclosed building or around individuals i don't know i work out each day that doesn't affect me i'm going to a psychologist to see if she can help but i am nervous about opening up to someone who doesn't care i'm not afraid of being laughed at i'm afraid of something bad happening to me i feel very vulnerable there are really two approaches and both can be done shaping don't try for your end result right away list as many situations that provoke anxiety that you may encounter rank them from most difficult to easiest when you've determined the easiest task see if it can be broken down into smaller pieces start small and master the smallest parts of the easiest task reward yourself for your successes when you are no longer anxious with a task proceed to the next one on your hierarchical list explore possible reasons or experiences that may have led to your anxiety explore underlying causes thoughts or feelings with understanding of the depths of your feelings you gain power over them you de mystify those dynamic traumas that ricochet and bounce around the depths of your self and through understanding you can integrate these traumas back into your aware mind and thinking and instead of being paralyzed by these traumatic influences you can access and gain strength from them these are the approaches commonly pursued in therapy when followed through both help it's often better to focus on one approach at a time these approaches can be done yourself but working with a trained therapist is usually far far more effective a trusting relationship with a friend or loved one is also a valuable piece of the picture sometimes you can borrow strength from a relationship to help you jump hurdles it's like taking out a bank loan to start your small business about your experience with your therapist if after giving him her it a chance you don't feel she he it cares about you you might be better off with a different therapist the caring is really important a primary issue is what are you successfully avoiding through maintaining the status quo imagine what if you didn't have an anxiety procrastination problem what would you have to do what role would you have to assume often this question helps uncover the strongest source of our anxiety this may be worth thinking about with self understanding we gain the mountain climbing tools we need to climb out of our personal pits good luck on your journey to personal success Procrastination Psychoanalysis Psychotherapy Traumatic incident reduction Anxiety Clinical depression Extreme Programming Autism Neuro-linguistic programming Stuttering Alexander Technique Strategic management Psychology Second language acquisition Reparative therapy Traumatic brain injury Post-traumatic stress disorder Hypnosis Social psychology Social rule Transsexuality Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Prostate cancer Milton H.
