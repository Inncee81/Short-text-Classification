how do i deal it hurts my pride to ask this i've had a wonderful childhood and after i turned i went haywire i made a lot of bad decisions and lost a lot of friends i've hung out with the wrong people and i've been hurt a whole whole lot and i have trust issues so i've resorted to hiding in my house and i am so selective about who i let into my life i really don't have that many people in it at all how can i quit being scared i've been so depressed lately i have no desire to get out of bed i've read a lot about depression and i've tried to pull myself out of this hole it's just tough knowing how much i loved myself and how confident i used to be and now i'm the complete opposite words of wisdom life is not all about sunshines and butterflies so cheer up people go through things so that they can learn from it you just have to take time assessing your life and trying to find out what you want out of this world what do you truly want where do you truly want to go those kind of things so you can work from there dont be hard on yourself just live your dreams and try to appreciate the pros and cons of life and this world it might open you up to the most harshest of things but atleast this time you know everything's for real good luck on life and god bless EastEnders Pitaten Theory of conduct Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) John Howard Yoder Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Friends Humphrey Bogart Piccolo Junior Saga Alcoholics Anonymous Time Out of Mind Nicomachean Ethics W.I.T.C.H.
