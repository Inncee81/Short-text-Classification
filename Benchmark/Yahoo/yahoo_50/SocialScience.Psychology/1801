can we change influence someones mind thinking assume you are in close relation with her him you can talk discuss shout etc assume you are her his father mother or spouse or sibling you know that her his thinking is not right assume you are wiser and you want to influence her his thinking and bring it in the right direction what will you do ya u can certainly influence someone frm doin wrong or against wat they are doin one way is to keep telling them everytime about right n wrong indirectly or directly first they may get wild on u for sometime or even hate u for tellin so but u should not be rude in any case and u should give them freedom to think but dont leave the track of pricking them about the same thing u may even ask others who are close to him or her to tell the same but in the most different way frm urs u can even talk to them peacefully or even tell incidences wich make them realise they are wrong and to ur suprise they will change to be right and i am sure this will work bcoz it worked for me thats how i was brought into control and got influeced a lot wen my parents repeated the same thing againn again this as happened even to my friendz i am sure it will work but it will take some time the other way is to be open to them talk to them clearly wats right n wats wrong but dont stop them frm doin wat they wanna do for few days but slowly try to reduce or decrease wat they are doing or thinking by restricting them frm doin few things widout making them realise that n makin them feel the difference wid that lil good change in them this will also surely help u change wat they are thinking or doing hopethis helps take care Social rule Theory of conduct Pitaten Milton H.
