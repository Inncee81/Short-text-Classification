squemish passing out at the sight of blood injury if so have you sought treatment with a psychologist or other health professional and has it made a difference i am a huge wuss if i accidentally cut myself i pass out just flat out faint i don't want to consciously consciously i'm not even upset but my subconscious just reacts and puts me out i am looking into seeing a psychologist for this but this trait medically called something about the vesa vega nerve and syncope i cant remember exactly but this condition of passing out at the sight of blood injury is hereditary and my mom and brother also suffer from the same thing and both have seen a psychologist about it both my brother and mom had little to no improvement after they had seen a psychologist but everyone is different responds to different things and i'm hoping i respond well to psychotherapy i'm just wondering if anyone has dealt with this issue and had success seeing a psychologist it just sucks its embarrasing i don't want to do it cant help it and most people can't sympathize everyone thinks i'm a p ssy not realizing that i cant help it and that i hate it if you don't suffer from this you can't understand it people think i just need to man up but thats not how it works for whatever reason its deep in the part of my brain that i dont control and it happens it embarrasses me when i pass out it pisses me off and i feel bad for the people around me when it happens because they don't understand they understandably freak out and call its horrible anyway am i the only one has anyone on here had to deal with this have you found a way to deal with it what you are describing is called a vaso vagal response or vaso vagal syncope it is a reflex response some people get from different kinds of stimuli some people get it when they stand too quickly or they are dehydrated their blood pressure is too low for the heart to pump enough blood volume to the brain and they get dizzy and pass out it sounds more like a physical problem than a psycholocial one to me your doctor may be able to help your symptoms by prescribing a medication called a beta blocker also one other treatment i read about was increasing your water and salt intake just increasing your water intake alone won't work you may want to get a physical and talk to your doctor about it Traumatic brain injury Hypnosis Stroke Medicine Milton H.
