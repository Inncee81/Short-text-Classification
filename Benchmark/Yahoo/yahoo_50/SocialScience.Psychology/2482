should i explain myself or would that make things worse for some reason whenever i feel ignored by my boyfriend instead of wanting to talk to him about it i get closed off and turn into a virtual hermit i know this is not healthy that communication's really important but i have avoidance personality disorder and some other emotional issues so he beat it out of me today that i felt lonely and whatnot but i felt really needy saying that because i am needy and he was all like why'd you keep it inside you know you can talk to me and i really didn't know what to say i realized i don't really trust anyone but i really want to trust him three or four years ago i got sexually assaulted by someone we both know and talk about a lot and that's when i first noticed my depression but it was my first year of highschool so that might not have had anything to do with it i'm wondering if i should tell him this or am i making an excuse for myself i don't want him to be weirded out do i need help this is really a sensitive issue and i think you should handle it carefully for yourself and your boyfriend it is a difficult thing for you to discuss with your boyfriend i am sure for things to be the way you want them to be with him you will need to tell him both for yourself and for him however he should not be ignoring you for any reason this is a sign that he may have issues of his own going on unrelated to your problems this may be another opportunity for you to strengthen your bond with him if you were able to get him to discuss with you what has been on his mind it could make it easier for you to trust him enough to let him help you with your issues remember not to push him too hard he must open up on his own i really hope for the both of you that you are able to work through this for what it is worth you are already on the right track by discussing this here you are able to analyze the situation and look at it from a third persons point of view and take yourself out of it giving you a totally different point of view and allowing you to move on and work through your situation Theory of conduct Social rule Goodness and value theory Autism rights movement Procrastination God Emperor of Dune Sigmund Freud Homophobia Ty Cobb Polyamory Chess strategy and tactics Domestic violence Surveillance Karen Horney Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Love Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Opportunity rover Utilitarianism Free will EastEnders Time Out of Mind Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Infantilism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Anger management One Tree Hill (TV series) The nature of God in Western theology Narcissism Force (Star Wars) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Milton H.
