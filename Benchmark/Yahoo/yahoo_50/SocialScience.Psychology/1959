have you noticed people dont think things through for them selves they are told the answers i have noticed that people have opinions on here but it is not really thought about ideas people dont need to think these days it seems to me to be a bit of a dying art form i hope you can understand what i mean we are given ideas in our head and answers and that is what we use we dont get a question and actually need to think about the solution anymore i dont know if this is really a question i will have to go away and think about it i think i would just like your thoughts on this thanks for your ideas xxx vici i have not heard of nlp but i think i might find out about it it requires more effort to think things through and come to your own answers about things having ready answers fed to you so that you don't have to actually think about things is a whole lot easier and there are tons of people around who are ready to provide pre digested answers to any question you might have that way you can move on to more important things like what paris hilton or whoever the current version is is up to it saves so much time and energy to let others do the thinking Theory of conduct Current teachings of Prem Rawat Gottfried Leibniz Social rule Past teachings of Prem Rawat Extreme Programming GED Milton H.
