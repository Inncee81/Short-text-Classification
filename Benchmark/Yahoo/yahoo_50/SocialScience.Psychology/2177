i'm obsessively ambitious is there anyway that i can enjoy my life i'm years old and am suppose to be in the prime of my life in terms of enjoyment fun according to what people but idk i've had an extremely hard upbringing been poor for a long time and as a byproduct of that i've become obsessively ambitious last semester i got a i'm entering only my junior year in college and plan to start studying soon for the gmat and cfa part exams so i can hopefully get a on the gmat and pass the part one of the cfa before i graduate all because of the potential money that doing those things could make me as ridiculous as this may sound my obsession to be rich successful has become so bad that i cannot even enjoy myself on a friday night with some friends because i begin to think that i could have used that time reading the the vault guide to finance interviews i just wish i could be normal enjoy my youth any advice suggestions would be greatly appreciated ambition is quite the respectable trait wanting to better the self to be bigger and brighter to become a person of status and wealth i suspect it would do you well to consider these two facts status cannot take you far if you have only excelled in a specific area and wealth is relative always becoming a successful individual and worthwhile human being is not a process defined by your position on the corporate ladder or the numbers in your bank account it is in fact a process ongoing until death humans are an amazing sort of creature constantly thinking learning growing and changing experience is the essence of life and your reactions to each and every one serve to better define you to not only the world but yourself who are you what do you believe and why what can you conquer and what leaves you in ruin what have you done to get close to another what has taken your breath away think of it this way having a high paying occupation in a field which you are well versed is a wonderful tool for enhancing the quality of your life money does make it easier to accomplish certain things however if you have been so busy focusing on one area that you do not have time to become a well rounded person with hobbies interests and friends to sometimes share them with then what point does that money serve as you know it doesn't take an incredible lot of money to merely exist money makes it easier to access experiences if you have no outward experiences then that money basically goes to survival see the irony just remember you can't take it with you go out and experience life live a little as they way take time to enjoy the personalities and thoughts of your friends find things that excite you find passion without it you will never be satisfied with your occupation and your life will seem empty Education in the United States Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Strategic management Capitalism Graduate school Capital accumulation Microeconomics Socrates Diablo II: Lord of Destruction One Tree Hill (TV series) Meaning of life Goodness and value theory Motivation Science Education in the People's Republic of China Economics Inflation Asperger syndrome Nicomachean Ethics Social rule Franz Boas Public policy Force (Star Wars) Dilbert Human General relativity Avenue Q Chartered Financial Analyst Meme Mutual fund Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Species Sant Thakar Singh Gross domestic product Cheating in Counter-Strike MMORPG The Amber Spyglass Affirmative action Procrastination The nature of God in Western theology Supply and demand Scenes from a Memory Friends Action potential Gestalt therapy Law of value Happiness Professional wrestling slang Rudolf Steiner Kim Possible Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kender Characters in the Smurfs Lewis Carroll Money Neuro-linguistic programming Charles Darwin's education Blog Education in Portugal Education in Germany Life insurance Monetary policy Cultural relativism Martial Coercion Uzumaki Naruto Piccolo Junior Saga 2000 Australian Grand Prix Infantilism Cognitive science Parkour Pitaten Charles Dickens Scientific method Primitive accumulation of capital God Emperor of Dune Great Teacher Onizuka Rudolf Hermann Lotze Psychology John the Baptist Final Fantasy XI Friedrich Schleiermacher Computer Mathematics Anti-intellectualism God Dyslexia
