how do i become a therapist i am a very good listener and people always come to me for advice i think helping people is useful please tell me everything you know about this career and what skills you need thanks as i am finding being a good listener is just not enough you have be organized you have to be empathetic and being a therapist is not about giving advice but helping direct a person to either resources or coming up with there own answers the first thing they teach you in counseling theories is that your job is not to give advice to be a therapist you can either go into a social work or a psycology bachelor degree if you choose addiction conseling you can be done in four years however usually you have to go onto a masters degree in either of the two previously stated fields though social work usually gets you farther i find the psychology much more intresting also it is a very political field there is much more to it then most people think who go into it it isn't just simply pulling up two chairs one person listening and the other providing answers there is that whole confidentiality thing the beuricratic nature of the whole thing there is lots of assessing and basically hoop jumping to be done also i hope this helps Psychology Psychotherapy Nurse Psychoanalysis Ethics Medicine Occupational Therapy Reparative therapy Social work Massage Altruism Neuro-linguistic programming Physical therapy Economics Goodness and value theory Master's degree Scientology beliefs and practices Empathy Transsexuality Software engineering Humanistic psychology Laura Schlessinger Alcoholics Anonymous Public policy Autism Music therapy Transactional analysis School counselor Graduate school Social rule Education in Portugal Asperger syndrome Clinical depression Lawyer Dissociative identity disorder Head of state Ex-gay Sexual orientation Extreme Programming Education in Romania Psychiatry Albert Ellis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Personality psychology Past teachings of Prem Rawat Doctorate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Adult attention-deficit disorder Librarian Procrastination Education in Germany Occupational Medicine Theory of conduct Education Economic inequality Alexander Technique Second language acquisition Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Social psychology Electrical engineering Chinese University of Hong Kong Parachuting Education in the United States Education in Australia Teach the Controversy Traumatic incident reduction Plame affair Transpersonal psychology Current teachings of Prem Rawat Avenue Q Carl Rogers A Course In Miracles Intelligent design Book of Isaiah Meaning of life Carl Jung Reincarnation Addiction Medical school Property (ownership right) English grammar Psychometrics Health psychology Gestalt therapy Philosophy of language Probation officer Social justice Microeconomics Religious Society of Friends Motivation Juris Doctor Dyspraxia Justification (theology) Logic Green Party candidates, 2004 Canadian federal election Coercion Milton H.
