dangerous foreplay my year old lover terri and i have been a couple for a year we met while playing football with a group of lads he was on one team i was on the other his team won he told me in confidence that his uncle sexually abused him as a child and make him do things that no human should make another human do terri wants me to beat and bite him during sex foreplay as far as i know i am the only person he has told this to what can i do to help him from this nightmare and can i take the law into my own hands by hunting down his uncle i have never met terri's family yet terri is one very messed up person he used to drink all the time and take drugs from the early age of and used to 'work on the streets' until he was i really do want to help him but this is way over my head and to be honest i am kinda afraid of being with him but will it be wrong to break up with him should i have him a chance i don't think you should break up with him over this if generally your relationship is good he obviously trusts you enough to tell you and it would do more harm than good to 'hunt down' his uncle it sounds like he just wants someone to talk to you could try and persuade him to go to the police it might help him put all this behind him a bit but in the end it's up to him if you don't feel comfortable with the foreplay you shouldn't do it good luck it's a sad situation i think the best you can do is to be there for him there's no way to change the past Social rule Human sexual behavior Theory of conduct Rape Oral sex Sin City EastEnders Friends Hey Jude Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Norway national football team The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Knots Landing Brian Close True Crime: Streets of LA Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Polyamory Cleveland Browns Scenes from a Memory One Tree Hill (TV series) Dead Like Me Michael Jackson Ex-gay Infantilism Zoophilia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sexual intercourse Birth control Bernard Williams Boston Public Laura Schlessinger Pedophilia Pittsburgh Steelers Alcoholics Anonymous The Human Stain Poker jargon Child sexuality Neighbours Ion Davidov Sant Thakar Singh Serial killer The Marshall Mathers LP Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Jack Charlton Ultimate Spider-Man Milton H.
