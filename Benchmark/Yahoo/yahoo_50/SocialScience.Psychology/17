have you ever been hurt so bad by a group of people that you wanted to kill them years after the occurences happened did your hatred keep you up at night and make your stomach turn into a big ball of knots it is dangerous thinking no matter what gender you are you don't need to be a man to fire a gun i feel for you wishing for peace my problem is that i can't forgive because what happened was intentional on their part and they knew what they were doing and thought it was funny it has made me so ill that i have thought about killing their children just so they will understand the pain they have caused me and my family grrrr if vengeance is only for the lord then so should the pain associated with the crime only be the lords i would understand that i will never be free or happy you can't unknow something that is known and what they did affected my innocence and the innocence of my children i have waited years and god has not exacted any vengeance i'm supposed to have faith in something i can't see and allow others to hurt me and my family on faith that some unseen force that can't be proven will punish them for destroying my life my happiness who i was after i am dead and gone meanwhile i am to continue to live this miserable life while they live high on the hog because they are dishonest con artists where is god right now this very minute he is all knowing right then he should know more than i can bear has been exacted upon me and correct it right or wrong i would not want eternal life or to live out the remainder of this one if this is what it is all about from this point forward i will believe when god shows me love and it better happen soon cause my string is very short if you get my drift i have sought proffessional help it is not me with the disorder but the ones who inflicted this pain upon me my emotions are natural and normal it is them that are not natural or normal and they are the ones who need psychiatric care we live in such a backwards society why can't people see that i'm tired of others making excuses for the degenerates that pretend to be civilized human beings in this society you think i am sick tell that to a rape victim who doesn't receive justice or a parent that loses a child to murder and doesn't receive justice tell them they need to seek psychological treatment because they need to forgive and they are psychologically ill we are one screwed up twisted society i say remove the degenerates from society permanently and make the world we live in a better place make people take responsibility for their actions i'll bet if enough people did this our society would become a better place yes i have it was frustration and anger and seem no one understand these people just terrible and all i can do is silent resentment then i find my behaviouf affect my friends and family i know its driving them away from me and hatred is covering my real self so i take a step back and look at the situation as overall and find that it was over and i i still keep on thinking on it i learn to let go and ignore these people for the rest of my life i can forgive but i cant forget but i feel better now at least i dun harbour hatred and is hurting me so u can do it too learn to let go and cultivate your loving self again because love and hate cant exist together good luck Theory of conduct EastEnders John Howard Yoder Domestic violence Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Evil A Course In Miracles Narcissism Sin City The Amber Spyglass Pitaten Days of our Lives Rape Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Transactional analysis Shaggy dog story The Death Gate Cycle Simone Weil W.I.T.C.H.
