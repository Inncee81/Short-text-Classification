imaginary friend like a lot of little girls i had one but i don't remember ever thinking of her as imaginary a part of me wishes i still had one is this terribly weird if i did decide to seek her in my imagination again is it ever possible to believe she was real like before young children are simply able to perceive these companions gaurdians or ancestors possibly because they aren't yet very far removed from their complete multi dimensional selves the selves we are all aware of as well as others when we are between lives sometimes as with myself and others we don't grow away from that kind of awareness completely and can still perceive some of the other dimensional beings places events etc we are so much more than most of us perceive ourselves to be or to be capable of we limit ourselves due to our socialization as we're growing up there really are no limits in this multi dimensional universe life except for the self imposed ones so yes it is possible all things are possible Ontological argument Theory of conduct Reality Artificial consciousness Religion Microeconomics Magical thinking Narcissism Marvel Universe Philosophy of mind Immanuel Kant Reincarnation Intelligent design Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Philosophy of language Carlos Castaneda The Fairly OddParents Franz Boas Paragliding Transactional analysis Karen Horney Rudolf Steiner Cyberspace K' The nature of God in Western theology Lucid dreaming Anthroposophy Social relation Milton H.
