how do some people commit suicide knowing what death means to me i guess it means nothingness but i don't know how can someone kill themselves knowing they face complete nothingness it's seems like living is always better do you think most people who kill themselves believe in some sort of afterlife i think when people kill themselves and get to that point they are not thinking and they don't care what death means they are in the moment and they don't want another second here on earth i think it's the strongest statement they can say about something they hate and that is themselves they don't think how they will make others feel or about the grief they bring to others that they leave behind they are consumed in their own living nightmare and they just want it to end not caring that they won't ever wake up or at least not here on earth some do it because they just want out others do it because they want someone to feel responsible for taking themselves out i had a cousin and a nephew commit suicide the female cousin was angry with her mother and left a suicide note stating that she hated her mother she was in her s and took a bottle of pills the nephew had been going through a divorce because his wife was having an affair he had got himself drunk he never drank and shot himself with a gun i don't know if either one of them believed in an afterlife but i think they could not have been thinking about to much because they both had to get the courage to get drunk to do it we found out that my nephew had been seeing a psychatrist that put him on medication that had suicide affects and maybe that caused it but no one knows it's so sad when things happen like this especially to the ones we love Knots Landing Pitaten Angel Sanctuary Suicide Friends Marilyn Monroe Phaedo Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Kurt Cobain Wang Mang The Marshall Mathers LP Humphrey Bogart Emperor Wu of Han About a Boy YuYu Hakusho The Lovely Bones Scenes from a Memory Days of our Lives Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Forty-seven Ronin Ten Commandments Theory of conduct Murder Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Jon Secada Euthanasia Blood (computer game) Cindy Sheehan Athrun Zala Luke and Laura Spencer Lauren Bacall Neighbours Max Payne W.I.T.C.H.
