it happens all the time why do i have this day dream all the time i'm stuck up with my imagination the dreams that i wish could happen to me getting to travel to work abroad to have one nice bf to do my masters its all something i wish i can do but its hard to happen cause im not rich i work hard but all my salary are used for supporting my family the day dreams are too much that sometimes it endup hurting me wheni realise that it can never happen do you also have so much day dreams sometimes it makes me feel really good is it normal to have so much day dreams well you can rest assured that you're normal here's a few pointers try to pretend that you earn dollars less each week and stash that money away or put it aside and place it into a bank account this will leave you with dollars in a year's time remember this money does not exist no matter what comes up also you would have to live on a better budget plan which means you would have to make some sacrifices for now in order to reach your future goals bear in mind the majority of people who have gotten wealthy have done so by making sacrifices going without certain things which aren't an absolute necessity to enable themselves to achieve successfulness it's a planned endeavor not a coincidence think of daydreaming as a way to escape a reality which you no longer desire to remain trapped inside of and in turn motivate you to install an ambition and game plan by showing you a way out but don't expect this to suddenly happen overnight you have to possess patience and tolerance every body has a dream they're necessary for without them we would simply give up hope our imaginations keep us alive and from losing our sanities give it a few years continue to daydream because each day and every dream only brings you that much closer to realizing them to actualizing them and don't allow nothing and no one to stand in your way and impede your lifetime goals god bless you and best of luck to you on your new voyages in life love peace and happiness Wheel of Fortune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada Kain (Legacy of Kain) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus S__ren Kierkegaard Shaggy dog story Summa Theologiae Simone Weil Sant Thakar Singh Social rule Out-of-body experience God Emperor of Dune Past teachings of Prem Rawat Philosophical skepticism The Amber Spyglass Microeconomics Goodness and value theory Soul Theodicy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Children of Dune Meaning of life Cliff Richard Virtual Realm W.I.T.C.H.
