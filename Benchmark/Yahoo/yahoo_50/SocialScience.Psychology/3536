i need some help please how can i fight my consciousness it's my problem in life it affects my love life and everything i'm tired of hiding myself to people especially when we have a report in class yeah i'm still in high school i know they're thinking that i'm irresponsible co'z i always run in my responsibility but what they do not know is i'm just shy to face people i can't think well infront of many people i get so nervous that i forget what to say or do what should i do actually i do know how to solve my problem but the problem is i can't do the solution can someone help me i used to be so self conscious that i wouldn't talk to people when they talked to me back in jr high i'm still not so great in groups and i tend to clam up around people that i don't know very well the best advice i can give is try your very hardest not to worry i've learned that decent people do not care about you saying silly things once in a while and from what i can tell you don't seem esp dorky or anything just take a small pause before you say something to make sure you don't blurt out something you don't mean be friendly most people are attracted to kindness and anyone who's just genuinely nice get out there and force yourself to be social the more practice you have the easier it will become to relax and think less i am no pro in social situations but these are just a few of the things that helped me in high school i know its so much harder than just trying not to think about what others are thinking but i do know that people don't really care about what you are doing as much as you in essence you are definitely your toughest critic good luck Social rule Transactional analysis Theory of conduct Richard Feynman Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Ashlee Simpson Show The Amber Spyglass Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Extreme Programming Theodicy Jon Secada Altruism Singlish Milton H.
