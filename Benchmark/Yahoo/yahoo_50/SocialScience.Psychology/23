everything happens for a reason or because of a reason i have my own thoughts on this but was wondering what your thoughts are on this topic of wonder people say everything happens for a reason and that sounds so pre determined do we not have power of choice yes we do so the saying should reflect that everything happens because of a reason as to make people more responsible for their choices which leads to cause and effect hmmm let me know how you interpret this thankyou jacy lee it's a matter of semantics we say 'for this reason' then give the reason we say 'because of a reason' and then may or may not give the reason it may be a matter of which 'sounds better' to our ears because of this reason makes as much sense as for this reason but since both because and for mean basically the same thing semantically in this case you may use whichever one you are more 'comfortable with' but don't expect 'other people' to understand what you say about 'responsibility' because they won't unless you want to explain that over and over and over and over again Logic Philosophy of language Social psychology Cognitive science Free will Meaning Theory of conduct Ethics Logical argument Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Predestination Denotational semantics Religion Microeconomics Neuro-linguistic programming George Lakoff Republic Causality The nature of God in Western theology Supernatural Propositional calculus The Apprentice 2 David Hume Social rule Economics Microphone Quantum mechanics Scientific method Coercion Poetry Supply and demand Determinism Second language acquisition Sexual orientation Universal pragmatics Traumatic incident reduction Truth Deconstruction Game theory Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Franz Boas Contract Sant Thakar Singh Democracy Datatype Spanish pronouns Prisoner's dilemma Science Modal logic Model (abstract) Sense and reference Interpretation of quantum mechanics Philosophical skepticism Evil Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Transcendental argument for the existence of God Pleonasm Karma Theodicy GED Unbounded nondeterminism Color Meaning of life John Howard Yoder Luminiferous aether Jon Secada Objectivist philosophy Belief revision Noam Chomsky Many-worlds interpretation Langmuir probe Species Originalism Catechism Extreme Programming Human Second Vatican Council Probability Atheism Faith and rationality Philosophy of science English grammar Expert system Metaphysics Cosmological argument Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Quantum mind Kripke semantics Legal research Epistemology Donald Davidson (philosopher) Knowledge representation Critique of Pure Reason Object-oriented programming Narrator Creator God Bass guitar Esperanto as an international language A Course In Miracles Person
