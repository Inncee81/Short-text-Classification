almost every dream i have i dream about my cousins in ecuador why do i keep dreaming that katya i don't know any details of the dreams you are having so it is impossible to interpret them however since your cousins in ecuador are always in the dreams they obviously mean a lot to you now whether they mean a lot in a good way or in a bad way i can't know again since there are no other details if it's in a good way i would assume you miss them and wish they were with you do you miss being in ecuador with them or do you wish they were here with you if it's in a bad way i hope not were there negative experiences with them that are starting to surface now let's go back to good ways i don't know how old you are katya but since everything here is speculation i'll go out on a limb are you between the ages and if so you are in the process of becoming an adult and with that taking on the responsibilities that go along with being an adult were you a child when you were with your cousins in ecuador if so then it's possible you're dreaming of a simpler time in life when you your cousins could play and didn't have to worry about the responsilities of the adults now all of my speculations could be wrong except for the fact that your cousins mean a lot to you i suggest that you keep a journal of some type and write down the dreams you have about your cousins write as much detail as you possibly can then when you have time sit down go over it and write down whatever thoughts come to you about the dream any connections it makes you think of compare the dreams what's happening in them are they similar different how do the dreams make you feel i hope you can figure out what the dreams mean are you in contact with your cousins do you talk on the telephone email each other or write do you want to do that i wish you luck Philosophical skepticism Infantilism Social rule Avenue Q Pitaten Plame affair Transactional analysis Autism rights movement Child sexuality Dream Sigmund Freud Out-of-body experience Unconscious mind Killian documents A Series of Unfortunate Events Time Out of Mind Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Karma Theory of conduct John Lott Shaggy dog story Time travel Kender The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Fairly OddParents The Star Wars Holiday Special Motivation Procrastination Luck Miss Saigon CPU cache Evil Artificial consciousness Milton H.
