how do you learnt to concentrate and motivate yourself at work i always find my mind wondering and if there is a large task i just can't be bothered to do it unless it is absolutely necessary so i just come on the internet or just walk around slacking off and my work piles up and i get more stressed because of all the work piling up around me which hasn't been done is there something wrong with me and what is causing this i need some motivation this might be a bit difficult seeing as to how the problem is that you can't concentrate but next time you do a task ask yourself would you rather spend about hours doing something that you can do within why not try to change this routine of yours and save yourself the time push yourself to concentrate if your mind starts wandering pull it back thinking the sooner you get the job done with the sooner you can have fun have fun in the sense do somethin you like maybe you can reward yourself for finishing something challenge yourself tell yourself i can't do this within an hour if i try why not try and prove myself right and you will automatically start the best thing is if you concentrate and do something you'll feel very good about yourself try doing it sometime observe people around you and see how their personality varies based on the way they work decide what kind of a person you want to be cool confident and efficient lethargic and not the least bit interested or motivated that brings up something maybe you are just not interested in what you're doing if you like what you're doing your concentration would naturally be at it's peak if you despise the job in question your mind would constantly look for a chance to deviate from the topic so try and find interest in what you're doing that should motivate you try competing with someone like a friend a friendly competition might also help you get motivated hope this helped and also don't worry about it it happens to everyone what do you think i'm doing here i'm supposed to be writing an essay and instead ahem look at what i'm doin so don't worry or feel bad the phase will pass Social rule Theory of conduct Milton H.
