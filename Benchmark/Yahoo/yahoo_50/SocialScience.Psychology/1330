what are the common traits of people who get these reactions if i felt rivalry coming from a slightly older woman in the changing fitting room of zara a fashion store while i was trying on some cute dresses there was definitely rivalry coming from her she seemed to be pleased about the way i was holding my left hand which i injured two years ago although everyone tells me the injury is hardly noticeable but i disagree would it be more likley that that was because i was pretty for her or ugly for her and so she wanted to be mean i'm not good at reading people's expressions i can't interpret very well that's one example a related question if older women smile at me is that out of pity for my ugliness or is that because i'm pretty because lately especially upon seeing the way i hold my left hand older women smile at me and i can't know what it means and if older men glare or frown at me after i make my left hand visible to them what in your observation experience do these reactions mean all the men older and younger smile at me so long as my left hand's thumb is not visible to them of it is probably all in your head if you are self conscious about the way you look you probably tend to think that everyone is judging you but the truth is everyone is so wrapped up in their own head most of the time no one is paying attention on the other hand if someone in the changing room notices you are acting defensive towards them they might think you are judging them and start acting competitively if older women smile at me is that out of pity for my ugliness or is that because i'm pretty it means nothing or at the most it means hi whether you are pretty or ugly is probably one of the last things on their mind especially with older women most likely its just because they are trying to be nice or are unsure of what else to do in that situation because you made eye contact so they give a small smile and completely forget about you seconds later Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aikido Cliff Richard Milton H.
