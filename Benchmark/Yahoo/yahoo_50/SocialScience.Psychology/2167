why do people think bullying others is funny it is not funny i suffer with anxiety and depression because of people like that it has ruined my life it is the reason why i cut myself off from socialising and having friends the only kind of socialising i do is on yahoo answers which is becoming difficult due to the troll problems on here which has made me leave on several occasions but i have decided to stay this time i need to socialise with people and as yahoo answers is the only place where i can do that i ve decided to say to myself stuff the trolls on here they re not worth me getting stressed or worked up i'm sorry you have anxiety and depression i can empathise with that i'm also virtually house bound because my child is terminally ill and i have to provide round the clock care either that or have her in a hospice which is quite a distance away and would be a long journey to get to her and this last week on here my life has been made hell by a few members they've written posts about 'fiddling' with my child that question was removed but some of the answers were just as bad it's one thing to bully me but to drag my child into it shows the level to which they will sink to find entertainment for themselves someone has cloned my id and has sent e mails to other members which has caused people to block me i actually have a code i add to my mails which that person wouldn't know about but it doesn't make a difference the bullies have their minds made up and they won't want to lose face by considering they might have got it wrong where's the fun in that for them i agree with the answer that said they do it to make themselves feel superior and those that join in do it to protect themselves if they're 'with' the bully then they grant themselves protection this was a place i came to 'socialise' i could pop in and out while my daughter was sleeping and at least feel i had a form of contact with the world but it's becoming too difficult because even though i can avoid the categories where they're writing their hilarious 'questions' it's the fact that i know it's ongoing and that while people support me quietly through e mails very few will add their support on the board incase they're next don't give up yahoo answers should be a place for anyone and if you want to participate then you have that right and i wish you good luck in beating that depression and anxiety Social rule Poker jargon Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Hikikomori Pitaten Clinical depression Anxiety Stuttering CPU cache Bully Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Joker's Wild Internet troll The Ashlee Simpson Show Game show Boston Public Transsexuality EastEnders Unemployment Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Vegeta Anorexia nervosa Violin 2000 Australian Grand Prix Transactional analysis Plame affair Friends The Fairly OddParents Palliative care Ex-gay B3ta IBM PC compatible Sauna The nature of God in Western theology Alignment (role-playing games) The Hobbit Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Kodocha Glen Jacobs A Course In Miracles Socrates Panic attack Insomnia Post-traumatic stress disorder Phoebe Halliwell $ale of the Century Obsessive-compulsive disorder Drag racing Wolfrider Fathers' rights One Tree Hill (TV series) The Amber Spyglass Hypoglycemia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Contender (television series) Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Great Teacher Onizuka Grief Aqua Teen Hunger Force Buffer overflow Have I Got News For You Surveillance Blood (computer game) The Marshall Mathers LP Jeopardy!
