i think i used to have trichotillomania and it's scaring me years ago i started a new school i was stressed and freaked out by the school's size i was only in th grade but was as stressed as ever then i started pulling my hair it was a stress release i would do it in between classes in the bathroom at home in bed and my mom soon caught on when she noticed me side parting my hair to cover bald spots i also would pick the skin on my head until i had scabs all over then i would pick those this continued for a while but after my mom told me i was going to go bald if i didn't stop i started to stop my hair pulling it took a while for all my hair to grow back and i used to sit and envy the heads of the girls sitting in front of me even when i was beginning to not pull i would still pick the scabs on my head my mom told me that that was not normal and she knew people who pulled their hair but not people who picked i have had anxiety issues since iwas in st grade but just read an article about this and i think i had it hello it definitely sounds like trichotillomania it also sounds like something else dermatillomania i've got the latter i pick my skin there's a great website that you should look through it's http www stoppickingonme com and it tells you more about it and gives you option on what to do about it your mom should not have gotten angry at you or tell you that you weren't normal on the other hand she was just trying to help my mom is the same way Trichotillomania The Inside Shaggy dog story Kodocha Haircut Dog training Wound healing phases Hair Paul Is Dead Sin City Tag Milton H.
