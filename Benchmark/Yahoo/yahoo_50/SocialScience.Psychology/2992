middle children i'm a middle child just curious to see what the middle child typically feels like you know how you always hear about the baby in the family what about the middle child i typically feel more like the rebel out of my siblings what are the basics is it typical for middle children to want to go against the flow to be more rebellious towards their parents especially i find that i have this problem more so than my parents wanting to express myself more independently sometimes i feel like i'm held back too much is this normal for a middle child the middle or second born child or children often have the sense of not belonging they fight to receive attention from parents and others because they feel many times they are being ignored or dubbed off as being the same as another sibling being in the middle a child can feel insecure the middle child often lacks drive and looks for direction from the first born child sometimes a middle child feels out of place because they are not over achievers and like to go with the flow of things being a middle child would mean they are loners they really don t like to latch on to a person in a relationship there fore they have trouble keeping one due to lack of interest not liking to take the limelight for anything they are not over achievers and just simply work enough work to get by and typically that goes with school as well as a career they are however very artistic and creative if forced to use abilities they will work well but do not work well under pressure they often start several projects but rarely keep focused long enough to finish a project the best career move for a middle child would be along the lines of using their creative going into a writing or journalism career and into a career that they could freely express themselves would be good anything that would have hours that are flexible and projects that frequently changed would be good for a middle born child since relationships are not of high importance to a middle child often times they are alone however the best possible match for a middle child would be a last born Autism Karen Horney Second language acquisition Hikikomori Milton H.
