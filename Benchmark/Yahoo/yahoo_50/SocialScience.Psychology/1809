what do you do think feel act in this situation consider you are in a city that most of people and government wanna you be and think like them some know that some don't and they are very powerful and some other people live their life by accepting this situation and you forbidded to do and live as you want even in your hauses while living in a society where freedom of speech prevails we confront difference of opinions on different issues so it is agreed accepted as a general rule to accept only that point of view which is acceptable to the majority of individuals of a society therefore every society has a right to make laws which are acceptable to the majority of individuals of that society and minority is bound to respect accept these rules this is what democracy is and that is why the elections are held however this rule does not apply on the religious beliefs of an individual or group of individuals no majority has the right to force minority to change their faith since a government is an instrument to implement those rules which are made and accepted by the majority of the individuals of that society thus a govt has the right to protect the people of that society against any violation of those laws we can not criticize a society for making certain rules with the consent of majority of its members if we don t want to accept respect those laws then we have a choice to migrate towards a place where we can find the followers of similar ideology what we can should do is to criticize only those rules which can cause harm to moral values or peace of the world since the moral values indirectly effect the peace so in my opinion any threat to these two should be dealt with force by the world collectively provided the peaceful means are failed Democracy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Coercion Value system Morality Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Non-aggression principle Social justice Utilitarianism Polyamory State Abortion debate Religious conversion Consensual crime Separation of church and state Hate speech Sharia French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Halakha Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Pacifism Human rights Lawrence v.
