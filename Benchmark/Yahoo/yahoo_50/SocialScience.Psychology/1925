are women made to be a totally self sufficient being with no needs apart from to give herslef to others i have been looking on the internet about how men need women more than women need men and how a woman has so many attriubutes and strengths in her that a man does not emotionally and practically i wonder is a woman really a totally self sufficient being and that is why she is able to make a life and give more life and does a man just take life and is a totally needy character i have had a terrible childhood and am very sick mentally and feel like an empty wreck i also believe i am not a proper woman even though i have a man i love but i feel a woman does not need love in fact she only needs to give and this is because she has everything inside her the fountain of life whereas a man is hopelssly inadequate but i feel so much empyness in me and inadequacy i feel women are just amazing and they can do anything and need nothing because they have it all anyway that is why a man goes after a woman to get what he hasnt got why does a women need anything first off i am so sorry that you feel emptiness inside and i think that the first to answer the question was right about not being fulfilled without someone loving you there are just different kinds of love there is only one thing that can fill that empty space in your heart and that is jesus christ he loves you so much that he was willing to take our punishment of eternal suffering and die that worst and most shameful death of crucifixion now he lives in heaven and he wants to come into your heart so you can love his father who also loves you so much that he created you in his image so you could bring glory to him he wants to have a relationship with you and you can ask him into your heart today if you want to know him or are just curious go to http zradio org index about jesus as for the man and woman topic i know from that man and woman go together here are some things i found genesis so god created man in his own image in the image of god he created him male and female he created them chronicles for as in adam all die so in christ all will be made alive but each in his own turn christ the firstfruits then when he comes those who belong to him i hope i could help and i pray that god spoke to you through me Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Justification (theology) A Course In Miracles Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eastern Orthodox Church Soul Sola fide Sin Trinity God and gender Church of Christ, Scientist Book of Isaiah Mary, the mother of Jesus Resurrection of Jesus Ten Commandments Simone Weil Merit Original sin Christian views of Jesus Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Angel Religion Love Origin belief Summa Theologiae Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Urantia Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Meaning of life Holy Spirit Roman Catholic Church Adam and Eve Mary Magdalene Satan Theodicy Creationism God the Father John Howard Yoder Sexual orientation Book of Mormon Apocrypha Capital punishment Charles Grandison Finney Sacrifice Homosexuality and Christianity Judas Iscariot Storytelling Opus Dei Prayer in Christianity Criticisms of Christianity Blood atonement Bhajan Catechism Rei Ayanami Endowment (Mormonism) Reincarnation Sant Thakar Singh Romulus and Remus Articles of Religion (Methodist) John the Baptist Michel Henry Theosis Infant baptism Duties of the Heart Paradise Lost Mortification of the flesh Incarnations of Immortality Eucharist The Pilgrim's Progress Heaven Church of Christ The Passion of the Christ Night (book) Immortality Purgatory Adam-God theory Characters of The Sandman Mother Teresa John Wycliffe Lucas Cranach the Elder Predestination Gospel of Thomas The Amber Spyglass
