i've noticed when i drink with birth control i get depressed and abusive to myself is it normal i've never been suicidal i'm not suicidal the first time i started taking birth control was a year ago when i started taking it after a week i got a little drunk and cried and i had no clue why i told a friend i wanted to die and i had no clue why and it scared me it's gotten to the point where i have cut my arms a couple of times and taken an excess amount of pills i wasn't like this ever before the birth control could the birth control be a factor it could be just think of how some pregnant women get when their hormones change b c pills are just that hormones you should talk to your doctor right away in the mean time certainly avoid anything like alcohol or pills that could be mind altering like pain killers etc keep talking to someone you trust also a tip i learned from a local hotline training is that if you ever feel like hurting yourself try gripping a piece of ice i've heard it helps good luck and prayers Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness The Inside Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Friends Pregnancy Birth control Hypoglycemia Clinical depression Knots Landing Acne Social rule Diazepam Suicide Alcoholics Anonymous Endometriosis Transsexuality Alcoholism YuYu Hakusho Psoriasis Caffeine Kodocha Miscarriage Diving Pitaten Cancer Coffee Teenage suicide About a Boy Sedative The Catcher in the Rye Maprotiline Humphrey Bogart Survivor (novel) Piccolo Junior Saga Insulin Hearing impairment Emergency contraception Folic acid Theory of conduct Dead Like Me Androgen insensitivity syndrome Borderline personality disorder Homosexuality and transgender Scenes from a Memory Sharon Tate Milton H.
