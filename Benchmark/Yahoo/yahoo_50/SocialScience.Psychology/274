on a psychology note why do people have fetishes some people have fetishes for certain body parts or objects why they are merely confused having at some point in their development attached sexual meaning to things that are non sexual usually it is a relatively benign harmless quirk but there are cases of extreme paraphilia where people say they are aroused by pain or even the harming or killing of another once i read a news blurb about a man who was killed when his wife complied with his request to drive their van over a board with him underneath it he had said the practice was sexually arousing to him strange excuse me lilykdesign you've been sold a bill of goods a fetish is not normal it's not courageous it is weird it's fake it's false and the only thing it has to do with sexual expression is that it may interfere with complete sexual expression the result can be stunted sexual development getting hung up on things that aren't sexual and making it public is not an improvement kissing might be considered a fetish if it is psychologically necessary and one fixates on it to the point that it precludes other sexual activity but really really liking something is not the same as necessity Paraphilia Sexual fetishism Human sexual behavior Infantilism Pedophilia Human sexuality Zoophilia Sadism and masochism Sexual intercourse Fetishism Transsexuality Childlove movement Clothing Homophobia Penis Transgender Cannibalism Urolagnia Asian fetish Reparative therapy Sexual dysfunction Child sexual abuse Foot fetishism Bondage (BDSM) Serial killer Motion picture rating system Inflation fetishism Sexual addiction Hentai Nudity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Kim Possible Hypnosis Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Transvestism Prostate cancer Rape Religion and sexuality High-heeled shoe Massage Masturbation Oral sex Shoe fetishism Cross-dressing Sexual attraction Ephebophilia History of sex Breast Medical analysis of circumcision Pregnancy fetishism Contract Pseudoscience Jehovah's Witnesses Friedrich Schleiermacher Incest Cancer Age disparity in sexual relationships Anal sex Cult Anger management Penile plethysmograph Autogynephilia Crush fetish Orgasm Necrophilia Capital accumulation Small penis humiliation Macrophilia Strap-on dildo Ex-gay Autism Pornography Deprogramming Domestic violence Erotic spanking American Psycho Idolatry Katelyn Faber Milton H.
