how to combat absent mindedness like yea if i get told something i can forget it quite fast then only recall it when that thing is over ohno i mean like yea besides keeping memos it's not possible to have so many stick it notes right what other ways are there and yea does hearing impairment both ears play a huge part in absent mindedness too lol you have about the exact same problem as me i don't really tend to recall things that happened few days ago but i remembered them if they were few years back funny isn't it tell you what just keep only one book to write the stuffs that you want to remember it can be a diary not as in those kind where you write about your day's events and etc but it is those kind that on each page there is a date so that there are dates on it like for example on monday you were told to bring something on thursday so you write in your diary what you have to bring on the wednesday page but the most important thing is that you have to make it a habit to look at it everyday or you can paste some notes very important things on those places that you will sure look at it everyday like for example your own cupboard lastly try to count how many things you have to remember and remember that number so when you try to recall it it may be easier at least it's that case for me i don't think hearing got anything to do with absent mindedness because absent mindedness is due to your poor memory or if you are in a rush to do something and you get messed up so you can't think of what you are actually supposed to do but it really isn't an incurable disease or anything if you put your heart and soul into trying to remember things you wouldn't find it too hard to remember them good luck p Time Out of Mind Social rule Theory of conduct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Pitaten Blonde on Blonde Milton H.
