help there's something wrong with me all my life i've found it difficult to open up to strangers and it's the same with my family i just can't express my feelings and thoughts properly to my friends i'm afraid that if i do they would not like me for who i am most of the time i'm cheerful in front of them but inside i'm afraid and upset it's damn frustrating i wish i could be popular like my friends it's not that i'm unpopular but i always feel like i'm second best i'm not ugly either and can be considered beautiful but i know the way i act sometimes put people off my facial expressions show that i'm afraid or angry when i to talk to them it's like all this is hindering me from achieving my full potential i used to be very good in my studies and now i just feel dumb i can't concentrate most of the time please help i wish all this could end you know something we're actually feeling the same thing and our avatars look alike i also always feel that no matter what i do i'm just the second best i also used to be part of the best in my high school but as i entered college i just feel dumb i also can't express my feelings and thoughts to my parents friends or to anyone at all i find myself sulking most of the time because i feel so inadequate yet people describe me as someone who is happy if they only knew what was happening deep inside right so you know what you're feeling it's actually normal nothing is wrong with you and nothing is wrong w me either hopefully so relax i can't really answer some of your questions like how it is difficult to open to strangers i have that trait too and maybe it's because i am an introvert and perhaps you are too another thing is that i am also conscious with how i appear to others which is why it is hard to share because they might judge me wrongly and my image would be ruined im trying to change this now by simply trusting my friends or writing my feelings in a blog i guess sometimes you just have to trust your friends that they would never judge you because of what you confide in them don't look at how you appear towards others too much just like what the previous comment said just be happy with yourself and i know this is hard it really is especially since like what you're experiencing it's not really easy to be happy with yourself because there are times when you just feel like you're the second best and that you feel dumb now when i felt this i actually had an identity crisis i thought that i was good at certain things but then when i started feeling like my efforts are futile i started to think that perhaps i'm not good at those things at all i guess one thing we should realize is that things in this world are not permanent our concept of the self just as this world is also an endless world of possibilities things like recognition they're just impermanent sometimes you have them sometimes you don't that's actually with accordance to abe a zen buddhist psychologically though i guess it's part of the transition of development we get to discover things about ourselves and sometimes these contradict with what we discovered from the past but just because you aren't the best now does not mean that you're not really the best just because you're not good now doesn't mean that you're dumb maybe before you were the top of your class life's just really like that i guess sometimes you're the one on top sometimes you're not but you shouldn't doubt yourself you should continue on persevering w c is hard i know you just have to find something that would motivate you i guess looking at it in the humanistic psy perspective it seems that you have an ideal self that you would like to achieve someone who is popular someone who is smart someone who is pretty everyone has their own ideal selves this isn't bad because it makes you want to work for something but i guess going to kant this time you shouldn't really be attached with this result or with any results for that matter if you wn't be able to achieve something that's okay just continue on believing in yourself and hopefully one day you would realize that your own self is actually the ideal already the only way this would end is given what you already know about yourself you try to veer away from it try confiding with a friend or try telling yourself that i'm am good in my studies and i still am instead of using the past tense though our identities may seem to change over time it does not discount the ones we formed before i hope that this helped i am still a student so i don't know how much this is helpful i honestly feelt what you were feeling but i guess what changed me was eastern philosophy which is why i have some philosophers there im actually a psych student and yes there's nothing wrong with you everyone actually experiences this adolescents etc we all want to be this ideal self and at the same time we all want to protect our self identities from other people i guess given that we should just learn to counter them i used to be the top of my class and i was also great in physics when i was in high school i'm in college now and i find myself mediocre and i just failed my physics test bfore i kept on doubting myself dismissing what i was in high school but i guess we don't really control the results in life even if this happened i vow to continue to persevere and just believe in myself w c
