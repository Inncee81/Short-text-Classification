frustration with anxiety excuse me while i vent here for the first time in almost years my anxiety panic has come back full force i have had a lot to deal with in the last years which i know contributes to my anxiety i have travelled extensively skydived taken care of my kids and myself for years with no help and now i feel like i'm afraid i'll go crazy if i sit on an airplane too long or i'll say something insane or i'll lose it and end up in a mental ward i know this is all symptomatic but it doesn't ease my thoughts anyway does anyone ever really conquer this can i really do this without medicine last time i took it i felt out of it and didn't like it one bit i see a therapist but all the talk is getting old and i'm frustrated any thoughts would be appreciated thanks i get anxiety myself and i have turned to self realization books keeps me grounded i read almost every night because these type of books help me keep my perspective straight on what's important why worry or be anxious we always seem to get through the challenges we face any way you know you're a survivor you said so yourself stick with that thought and build on it think of all the challenges and obstacles you faced in the past years and have overcome you are a survivor you will survive whatever comes your way so what's the point of anxiety as you think so shall you be and it's true try to think positive when you start feeling anxious capture those thoughts and spin them into something positive it's hard and takes practice but keep at it be consciously aware of what triggers your anxiety also exercise helps alot with that restless feeling you get i am restless too so i exercise x a week i am also trying to do the deep breathing and meditation best of luck i hope this helped just a little at least you know you're not alone Meditation Anxiety Clinical depression Procrastination Tai Chi Chuan Psychoanalysis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Panic attack Obsessive-compulsive disorder The Contender (television series) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Out-of-body experience The Catcher in the Rye Traumatic brain injury Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Stuttering Anorexia nervosa Series finale Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix God Emperor of Dune Kodocha A Course In Miracles Post-traumatic stress disorder Karen Horney Sigmund Freud Charles Darwin's illness The Ashlee Simpson Show Ex-gay Treehouse of Horror V Stress (medicine) Stone Cold Steve Austin Haven (TNG episode) Insomnia Aerial (dance move) Massage Social rule Psychotherapy Alexander Technique Adult attention-deficit disorder Jon Secada Neuro-linguistic programming Borderline personality disorder Professional wrestling holds Venom (comics) Clomipramine The Death Gate Cycle Characters in the Smurfs Baldness Chronic fatigue syndrome Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Diving Cannabis (drug) Kurt Angle Gestalt therapy Prostate cancer Jean Grey Jiddu Krishnamurti Eddie Guerrero Oh My Goddess!
