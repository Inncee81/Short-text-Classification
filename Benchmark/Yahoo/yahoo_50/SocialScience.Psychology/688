my friend has this terrible nagging problem my friend has a nagging problem she doesn't remember if she prayed for her male friend to be attracted to her or not last year sometimes she has the uncontrollable impulse to pray for things she doesn't want and when her prayer comes true she gets angry and frustrated she believes it's not right to pray for someone to be attracted to her so she wants this guy to feel about her the same way he would before the prayer how can she solve this nagging problem if he was never attracted to her before the prayer she'd be ok with it and move on but if he was attracted to her before the prayer and no longer attracted to her because of the stupid prayer she feels bad about that if he was attracted to her before the prayer and if there was no prayer that changed that she'd be happy first this belongs in religion second she could pray for him to feel whatever he would have felt regardless of her prayers third unless you are god you are way too involved in someone else's prayers Prayer Church of Christ, Scientist God The nature of God in Western theology Religious Society of Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gnosticism Five Pillars of Islam Goodness and value theory Gospel of Thomas A Course In Miracles Eastern Orthodox Church Fiddler on the Roof Canonical hours Friends Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Rich Mullins Spiritism Merit Theory of conduct Ramadan Idolatry Roman Catholic Church Avenue Q Hasidic Judaism Religious pluralism Theodicy Nachman of Breslov EastEnders Ed, Edd n Eddy Alcoholics Anonymous Shinto Pitaten Jewish services Prayer in Christianity Ludwig Wittgenstein Atheism Salah Scenes from a Memory Hulk Hogan Intercession of saints Transactional analysis Sabbath Marie Antoinette Social rule Rosary Karma Saint Pok__mon Live!
