what's behind nightmares i've been having them for about four months now and i'm really tired of them literally sleep hasn't been as replenishing since they started they're mostly about death people around me dying i'd like to understand why i'm having these nightmares and what i can do to stop them if anyone can be of any help thanks dreams are simply the unconscious mind talking to you they allow you to relieve stress by doing or saying something to someone you would never do in real life like shooting your boss after a dream many times you may feel better when you awake unfortunately it may work in reverse i may guess that in some way death has entered your life and made an impression on your subconscious has someone died are you watching death filled movies once your mind clears of these unpleasant thoughts all should return to normal good luck Dream Lucid dreaming Unconscious mind Jiddu Krishnamurti Insomnia Scenes from a Memory Out-of-body experience Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Oh My Goddess!
