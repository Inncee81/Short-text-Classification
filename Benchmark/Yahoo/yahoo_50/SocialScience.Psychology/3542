how to get over the guilt around five years ago i dated a woman but she was much too young for me she was at the time and we had dated for around a year we had become close but she wanted to go one way i wanted to go the other etc but she didn't want to leave and i knew it was not good for her to be dating someone wanting to settle down at when she didn't want marriage or children for another good ten years i ended up ignoring her i thought she would move on i ran into her friend in a club recently and i asked how she was i found out she had committed suicide a few months later i fully regret breaking it off how i did it was immature and so unbelievably selfish i cared for her i had no idea she was going to do this she was amazing i fully expected her to be married by now or at least her views set the thing that makes me sick to my stomach is the last message she sent to me was asking me to talk to her one more time i just thought ignoring her was the best to make her contin' her think i was a jerk and move on quickly i just wanted her to hate me make me be the big bad jerk and then move on apparently she went into a deep depression and blamed herself for everything for the last few months my sleeping has been off barely getting six hours of sleep and the rest of it is filled with nightmares of finding her body or just dreams of her in general i can t seem to eat anything anymore should i see a therapist i had this conversation with her friend and she suggested visiting the grave and saying my peace but i just think it will make matters worse i feel like i stepped into a fucking soap opera and the fact that im asking this on yahoo answers makes me feel a bit off i shouldn't have left her but it was hard enough to break it off because i would have married her if she wanted to get married but she didn't i just think if i had taken another course in this remained part of her life i could have helped her some how encouraged her to seek a therapist changed her views on commitment i should have saw this coming from little remarks she made about things being her fault i just thought she was being well i don't know how to describe the word for it i should have relised that she would have blamed herself i just thought she wanted a father figure and not a husband she often talked about her abusive father and how glad she was to have been able to finally leave her friend said she always talked of me constantly and was so glad she had found a man who wasn't going to hurt her i believe her friend threw what she said in for guilt but from the conversation i gathered that she had indeed looked at me as a fatherly figure i am shocked her friend even offered me help i failed her like her father failed her i regretted ignoring her five months into it but i was too ashamed to contact her again i just figured she would have found someone else and didn't want to stir things up i know how i treated her was wrong slowly canceling not replying and then apologizing for it and having her forgive me and tell me she cared regardless of it i figured that i was setting her up for a major feeling melt down by slowly doing it part of me never replied again after our last conversation out of fear from hearing the tears of someone i loved i just thought that making her think i was a jerk would help her to move on to a man more on her same track and i wanted it over as fast as possible i didn't want to keep leading her on with random lunch dates and never truly coming out with it and i couldn't bare to tell her i didn't want to speak to her again because in any way shape or form that sounds horrible and to say it to someone you care for and do not even want to leave it was done for the right reasons but i can't live with myself for the last few words she said to me having been please pick up the phone what did i do please stop no please let me talk to you one more time i love you while she was in tears i didn't speak to avoid her tears but i never took into consideration that she would still have them as for my views on god i try not to think about it i was raised christian but fell from it if i stood by christian beliefs she would be burning in hell at the moment i thought that we would just die but then it made the idea of her last words and the way i treated her even more painful she isn't around to apologize to and i cannot stand to see myself go out with another woman when i never stopped caring for her i broke up with her because she didn't want marriage so soon and yet i end up still being single at time where if i kept dating her she might have changed her mind i just would think of her from time to time think she found an apartment maybe she is engaged maybe she did this maybe she did that all while she was rotting six feet under i wasn't sure if she would have changed her mind and i didn't want to risk being with a year old who still didn't know what she wanted in life i met her when she was mid seventeen and the relationship ended when she was almost nineteen yes i know pedopedopedo it started without me knowing her true age i just saw her working as a waitress just starting out she was dropping things getting yelled at etc she looked ish i liked her and ended up getting her number we went out a few times before she told me she was only seventeen i was going to break up with her when she told me but i really did like her we were able to spend a lot of time together due to her father's lack of care about her existence and where she went alright it was a bit longer than a year year and a half i can't even remember the length of times anymore and i would prefer not getting nasty comments for dating a seventeen year old my intentions were not sexual and i did not use her if anyone was being manipulated it was me i thought she was twenty for about three weeks this couldn't be your fault so it was immature to ignore her but people ignore people all the time it seems to have become one of the main ways to break up with people retarded i know but it is the way it is she was dealing with more than just this break up to have committed suicide you need to forgive yourself see what part of this was you and forgive yourself for it and i don't know your standing with god but you can always go to him he will always comfort those who come to him for help if you still feel guilty maybe it is because you are to an extent god will forgive you if you ask him to and totally bring joy to your life he is an excellent restorer and then you should 'make peace
