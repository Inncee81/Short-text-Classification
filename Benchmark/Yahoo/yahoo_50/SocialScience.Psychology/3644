year old with possible obsessive compulsive disorder i have a year old that can't deal with things getting moved our any kind of change she would rather stay home all summer and make sure the house is clean than hangout with friends when we get done eating a meal before everyone is evenm done she is doing dishes and making sure everything is right back where it is supposed to be she avoids any acitivities that may cause her to get dirty we have decided to get her tested and are hoping they can do something to help her anxiety which will help her socially also has anyone been through this with a child and what were options doctors gave you how do you help a child who gets so upset over tiny things that seem so big to her i have mild ocd and was diagnosed at age although i already knew i had it way before then your daughter pretty much definitely fits the criteria for ocd when i was diagnosed i was prescribed anti depressants which have been shown to be very helpful with ocd i also have been going to therapy ever since then which helps a lot with anxiety one of the most common and effective treatments for reducing obsessive compulsive behaviors is exposure response therapy which i personally never did but in this the patient is exposed to a compulsion producing situation but then prevented from acting so your daughter might be put in a situation in which she'd like to clean a dirty room and then prevented from cleaning it eventually she learns that nothing bad happens when she doesn't clean good luck i'm sure things will get better once she gets help Obsessive-compulsive disorder Anxiety Clinical depression Post-traumatic stress disorder Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Clomipramine Cognitive therapy Anorexia nervosa Prostate cancer Asperger syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Psychotherapy Borderline personality disorder Autism Bipolar disorder Binge eating disorder Addiction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stuttering Controversies in autism Hypoglycemia Asthma Traumatic brain injury Eating disorder Fibromyalgia Karen Horney Behavioral therapy Phobia Adult attention-deficit disorder Friends Narcissism Transactional analysis Pitaten Child sexual abuse Multiple sclerosis Panic attack Tourette syndrome Milton H.
