would you like to see more rehabs mental health sites rather than shoving everyone in jail prison mental health sites are for those crazy people who engage in crimes like homicide rape etc they dont need help they need to go to jail to pay for their crimes and suffer people who are in jail for minor offenses dui drug dealing speeding shoplifting etc do not need to be in jail and dont need mental health sites by putting petty criminals in jail you make nice normal people more prone to agression violence and encourage them to participate in illegal activities rather than deter them when they go to jail they learn that to get by you must be tougher stronger and use violence to solve disputes even though these people went to jail being non violent people you made them violent when they go to jail they talk to other criminals they then become smarter about engaging in crimes so in summary we dont need more looney bins we just need less people in jail Consensual crime Arguments for and against drug prohibition Psychiatric hospital Mental illness Capital punishment Rape Murder Crime Domestic violence Illegal drug trade Life imprisonment Prisons in the United States Crime in Australia Tom DeLay Statutory rape Ol' Dirty Bastard Oz (TV series) Punisher Prostitution Serial killer Gun politics Age of consent Days of our Lives Paraphilia Beltway sniper attacks Trafficking in human beings African American contemporary issues Shoplifting EastEnders Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Darfur conflict Trailer Park Boys Suicide Evil Child pornography Assault Kurdistan Workers Party Abortion in the United States Albert Anastasia Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Anarchism in Spain British National Party Sin City Drug addiction Human sexual behavior Polygamy Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia Motion picture rating system Edward Bunker Addiction Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Three strikes law GG Allin American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Drug abuse Prison Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Beat generation Criminal record Anti-psychiatry Prisoner (TV series) The Dark Knight Returns Pornography Human rights in the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 John Lott Victimless crime Fathers' rights Hate crime Crime in Sydney Norte__os Kray twins Drunk driving (United States) Black market Pacifism Child sexual abuse The Untouchables Iraq War Involuntary commitment Schizophrenia Probation officer Abortion Spanking Jonathan Wild Post-traumatic stress disorder Pedophilia West Memphis 3 Drug test Treason The Inside Video game controversy Walker, Texas Ranger Race and crime Miscarriage of justice Hanging Insanity defense Melbourne gangland killings Barbara Boxer O.
