did you ever suffer from emotional abuse how did you heal from an abusive relationship such as emotional abuse ived been with man who is manipulative and controlling for a year and a half i l broke up with him for the second time yesterday and i feel like crap sometimes we can become addicted to bad relationships it feels like hell to get out and you feel like you are compelled to go back you don't want to but you do and you excessively worry about how the other person is doing instead of taking care of you when you're involved in an abusive relationship you carry far too heavy of a burden two people's happiness and truthfully you're not even capable right now of caring for your own i know i've been there what would probably really help you the most is to see a counselor or therapist who specializes in domestic violence these therapists also know a great deal about emotional abuse you'll be able to talk to someone who understands who has good advice to give who will listen and right now you need that you need to build your self esteem back up to gain confidence in yourself to be stronger you need hope it really helps to talk to someone who has the ability to understand and can give you good advice please think about it it will help keep you from going back to a life that makes you miserable you deserve happiness you are very vulnerable right now and you need all the support you can surround yourself with it is true that the victims of abuse are as sick or sicker than the abuser himself living with an abusive person takes a huge toll on the victim's psyche it's not easy to heal from but there are people out there who can help i want you to understand this emotional abuse is as serious as physical abuse the person who is being abusive isn't going to change they may say they want to and may even mean it and often they are even very sorry for it but in the end the chances of real change are almost none you can't change him there is nothing you can do to change him get the help you need for yourself learn to value yourself at least that much give yourself a chance at a better life getting help now will be easier than trying to do it later on and it will help you to not fall into this pattern again with someone else good luck to you Narcissism Borderline personality disorder Domestic violence Clinical depression Social rule Psychotherapy Hulk (comics) Psychoanalysis Divorce Dissociative identity disorder Reparative therapy Transsexuality Anger management A Course In Miracles Self-esteem Theory of conduct Traumatic incident reduction Ex-gay Transactional analysis Infantilism Boston Public Child abuse Scientology beliefs and practices Medicine Jon Secada Traumatic brain injury Alcoholism Drug abuse Post-traumatic stress disorder Nicomachean Ethics Kodocha Rape Gestalt therapy Phoebe Halliwell Child sexual abuse Galaxy Angel False memory Abortion debate Addiction Happiness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social psychology Prostate cancer Incarnations of Immortality Bully Child sexuality Shit Grief Procrastination Motivation Scenes from a Memory Laura Schlessinger Sexual addiction EastEnders Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Utilitarianism YuYu Hakusho Dead Like Me Premature ejaculation The Amber Spyglass Pitaten Anxiety Sin City Carl Jung Sant Thakar Singh Marriage Alexander Technique Numerology Serial killer Emotions (album) Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Milton H.
