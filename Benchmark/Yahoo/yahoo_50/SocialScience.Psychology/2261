has anyone ever had an overwhelming sense of feeling vulnerable today i got an overwhelming vulnerable feeling i just cant shake i guess it's because i've been a victim of backstabbing in the past and it ended up with me being evicted from my old apartment which in turn i lost my job and ended up having to use a emergency shelter well i just got a new job but doesnt' pay hardly anything and i'm raising two of my children i'm terrified i'm going to get kicked out of my apartment because i dont have time to continue to do all the volunteer stuff requred from me to keep my home i feel so caught up in the system and its bound to make me fail what do you do when you feel incredibly vulnerable any suggestions yes i know what that feels like i was a single mom once too i don't know what to tell you other than my heart hurts for you that has to be one of the worst feelings ever to have to experience i was incredibly fortunate to have had family members come to my rescue they helped me along with the state dept of vocational rehabilitation to get trained in a field that pays very well look into whatever resources are available to you sometimes we have to rely on welfare temporarily to help us get through the tough times i would also suggest that you get involved in a church if you don't like the first church you go to go to another one keep looking for one that you feel comfortable in church people are incredibly loving and generous when it comes to single moms there will be some women who will be jealous of you too because you're single they're afraid you'll snatch their man away from them so if you don't feel the love move on down the line oh yes i almost forgot it wouldn't hurt for you to turn your life over to god and let him help you deal with your feelings of vulnerability just ask him to come into your life to open your eyes spiritually and to soften your heart he will lead you in the direction that you need to go as well as bring people into your life that will help you along the way this is only temporary if you do something to change it it won't go away by itself you have too much responsibility on your shoulders to keep trying to do it all by yourself you're incredibly overwhelmed you need to reach out to the community through church for help you really need some help Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina New York Giants Sin City 2005 Kashmir earthquake Domestic violence The Inside Atomic Kitten Pittsburgh Steelers Phoebe Halliwell Dead Like Me One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends American Red Cross Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory Rich Mullins EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Piccolo Junior Saga Darth Vader Babe Ruth Alex Ferguson Rent (musical) New York Jets The Shining (film) The Death Gate Cycle The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Salvation Army Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Maison Ikkoku Ty Cobb Oh My Goddess!
