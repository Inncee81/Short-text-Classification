why does it always end befor it realy starts you get started with something and it all feels right its going great and it seems that everthing in life has turned around for the good then in less then five minutes it all goes up in smoke why is it something people set their self up for are some people destend for desaster i dont now the answers to any of this so i post them to see if maby someone else does i await your reply sometimes our expectations far exceed the reality then we are disappointed and disillusioned because things didn't turn out the way we expected i don't exactly know why this happens but my theory is that this life is not meant to be perfect and happy all the time for one good thing that happens ten bad things take the place if it's any consolation you are not alone practically everyone has experienced this same thing so try some reverse psychology don't expect wonderful things to happen and then you might be pleasantly surprised if they do worth a try anyway good luck Theory of conduct Social rule Goodness and value theory 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.
