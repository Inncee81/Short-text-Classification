i had this weird dream ages ago i can't get it out of my head why is this i had this dream a month ago of my music teacher who i hate he was stroking my hair i hate my music teacher because hes a prat who slates everyone or makes obseen coments i just hoped this dram would go away but it isn't i keep having the same dram every so often what is my subcontracts telling me i feel calm strangely i had this dream for since november fancy him god thats sick he's bald and hes no looker anyway i fancy my history teacher so i know my taste it's not to me he makes the sexual comments but he laughs when i get something wrong what part of i do not want him don't you understand it could mean that you fear your grade is in question because of your feelings for him if you hate him and he knows it he might lower your grade so if you're dreaming that he's stroking your hair you don't have to worry about your grade because people don't preen those they don't like it could mean something like keep your friends close but your enemies closer it could mean that you don't like hating people that in your mind the perfect situation would be one where you wouldn't have such negative feelings for him but for that to be the case he would have to be the one to change and your dream is just living that for you it could mean that you accept affection best by touch the person doing it doesn't matter so much it could mean any number of things honestly it could mean that you're eating something that your body doesn't like too soon before you go to bed it could mean you need to drink a glass of milk before you go to bed it could mean anything and you are the best judge in fact you are the only judge you are the only one who really knows what were key things in your dream you are the only one who knows what you felt heard knew in the dream if you have it again pay attention to the details and figure out what you felt about them individually then see what you think of the dream as a whole dreaming about the guy doesn't mean you like him actually the opposite is probably true and it sounds like it is we think about those we despise more than those we like Philosophical skepticism Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Transactional analysis Milton H.
