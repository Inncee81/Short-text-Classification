when you feel more tension in your work life and anywhere how do you deal with them hello nelly as you may already know i am a retired long haul truck driver and as such when i got tired or all heated from the job or the night time or even the hot weather i jus found a place to stop switch off that big screaming engine and throw my tired mind and body on the bunk switch on the air conditioner and just sleep for a while after i wake i would jump down from tha scania lock it and walk about for a half hour or so then make coffee and continue my journey umless i was parked up for the night then it's clothes off curtains closed television on and fall asleep with the television still on mmm nice but i am guessing you don't drive a tonne truck do you thought not but even this far into my answer to your query you can get an idea of what to do when tensions and stresses arise in your job your private time and your anywhere else just take a book read switch on the tv go out for a walk cook a meal invite a friend to come and taste it with you i wish i could cook but my wife has me banished from our kitchen because i drop things and some of those things get broken i am not stupid or clumsy i am disabled and not able to do close hands on stuff but i do laugh about myself and that is a joy in itself you should keep active though unless you would like to fall to sleeping then you are refreshed when you awake again oh nelly i do hope i have helped you in your quest tony m Shaggy dog story Truck The Amber Spyglass Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sin City Sleep Kill Bill The Inside Insomnia The Shining (film) W.I.T.C.H.
