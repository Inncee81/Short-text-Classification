if you've been hurt or harassed by a certain group please no judging or harassing i really want suggestions if you've been hurt and harassed by a certain group of a race and everytime you see someone of that race and a certain age you feel the hatred and flashbacks you used to love that race and its culture how do you get over yourself and get over the hurt and quit hating you need to remember that the hurt and harassment comes from the persons heart not their exterior conditions it is so true also remember that everyone is hurt by others on a consistent basis try to look at the big picture and realize that it is just not worth your energy pray Hate speech One Tree Hill (TV series) Alcoholics Anonymous Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Michel Henry Homophobia Alignment (role-playing games) Fruits Basket Harassment Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Beavis and Butt-head Blood on the Tracks The Shining (film) Anti-Defamation League Fair Game (Scientology) The Curse of Fenric Jon Secada Rich Mullins Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Racism Memento (film) W.I.T.C.H.
