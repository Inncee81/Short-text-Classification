mean gossip about me at work how to deal and not quit i heard recently through gossip that supervisor of my boss does not like me also that other people have said deragatory things about me insinuating that something is going on between my boss and i not true and disgusting but this is all gossip so there's nothing i can do about it i know i need to look for another job this is so nasty and unprofessional but how do i deal with going back there everyday until i can get out i am trying so hard not to quit before having another job but it's so hard any advice thanks since i am a retired private investigator i only have one suggestion hire a pi to get some information on the people who are trying to make your life miserable you need to level the playing field in other words you're losing the battle because you have no ammunition it's always helpful for your team to have as much leverage as possible when you begin slipping in some comments regarding things you know about them it will freak them out they'll see you in a different light they'll begin respecting you hey if they want to play hardball learn to play it better and then see how they want to play ignoring it changes nothing you're still miserable and they're still being malicious anyone who tells you to ignore it or rise above it isn't in touch with reality do what you need to do it will be worth it in the end you don't have to be a victim you can be a survivor it isn't revenge to do this it's justice they started it you're defending yourself that's it good luck i wish i was there to help you it would be fun Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Smoking Room Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pitaten Milton H.
