no social life i'm and don't go out with my friends that much i moved house when i was just when i was starting to go out and was getting to know everyone from the area i lived in i suddenly stopped going out now i feel like i've wasted the best years of my life part of the reason i don't go out i think is because i am afraid of confrontation on the street everywhere i seem to go there seems to be trouble i started going out last summer and ended up getting mugged by lads with knives while walking home froma friends house i got punched and my mobile phone taken off me which knocked the confidence out of me i feel ineed to start going out now as i think i will regret it for the rest of my life the way i regret not going out for the last years any words of wisdom when you change the way you look at things the things you look at change wayne dyer Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) The Amber Spyglass Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Lauren Bacall Kodocha Russian joke Diving 2000 Australian Grand Prix Friends Sydney Riot of 1879 Milton H.
