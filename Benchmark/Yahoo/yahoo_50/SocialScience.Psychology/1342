why does my family and my fiance's family look down on me for being an athiest i don't care what they believe in but they think i am so wrong for not believing in jesus we always have to say grace before meals and i never participate what is the big deal i think that if they are as religious as they say they are they should respect everyones beliefs i've been in same situation before and it is tough unfortunately whether you like it or not you have to learn to deal with ignorant people because they sure as hell aren't going to change i'd personally compromise with them i e show them respect in their home by being present during saying grace but if they ask you to actually say the prayer politely decline Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Roman Catholic Church Sin Religious pluralism Eucharist Fasting Baptism Abrahamic religion Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Christian eschatology Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses God Church of Christ Jehovah's Witnesses John Howard Yoder Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Heaven Prayer Christian-Jewish reconciliation Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Traditionalist Catholic Nation of Islam Thomas Jefferson Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sermon on the Mount Legalism (theology) Spiritism Hell Opus Dei Baptist Ranma __ characters Pacifism Theory of conduct Great Apostasy Ten Commandments Confucianism Separation of church and state Messianic Judaism Confession Church of Christ, Scientist Catholicism Divine grace Nahmanides Humphrey Bogart Theodicy Evil Religious Society of Friends Moral Politics Christianity Mirza Ghulam Ahmad George Fox Saint Jewish views of religious pluralism Wise Blood Ayyavazhi religious practices Justification (theology) Holy Spirit Soul Predestination Mary, the mother of Jesus Nonviolence Paradise Lost Unitarian Universalism Christian anarchism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Prayer in Christianity InterFaith Qiyamah Purgatory Salvation Gospel of Barnabas Who is a Jew?
