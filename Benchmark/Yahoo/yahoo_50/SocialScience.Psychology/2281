why doesn't he reply to my email will i hear from him a guy friend moved to another state a year ago and since then have kept in contact by chat once a mth or so even though we didn't know each other well before he left i have to visit his city for work in a few weeks and he said he'd love to meet up problem is i'm now thinkning about him a lot he wrote that he's going to fall in love with me also said hurry up and come we admitted we like each other thing is i don't know him that well i'm just worried as we don't chat very often now its a few wks since we've chatted usually he contacts me it's making me insecure worried but i do know he's really busy now so a week ago i mailed him to tell him the date i'll be there and am waiting a reply why hasn't he got back to me really he initiated all the feelings i reacted to this as i started having feelings too now why the silence when he always sounded so excited about the whole thing maybe it was easier chatting on line and the actual thought of your coming there physically has got him frightened as well he may be afraid that he won't measure up to what you were expecting or you may not be what he was really looking for other than a friend i would send one more e mail if he does not respond he has said it all by saying nothing at all i am sorry if you have hurt feelings but sometimes it is for the best or maybe he has met someone new in the mean time and it could be very awkward how ever it turns out keep your chin up and head held high you are a valuable person and your day and man will come along peace and good luck and thank you for asking my opinion Social rule Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Rent (musical) Time Out of Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada EastEnders Blonde on Blonde Sydney Riot of 1879 Night (book) Internet fraud Theory of conduct Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Plame affair E-mail Phoebe Halliwell Elvis and Me Ben Johnson (athlete) Domain Name System The Shining (film) Humphrey Bogart Real Love (song) The Death Gate Cycle Melanie Wilkes StarCraft Episode VI Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Haven (TNG episode) Cliff Richard Pok__mon Live!
