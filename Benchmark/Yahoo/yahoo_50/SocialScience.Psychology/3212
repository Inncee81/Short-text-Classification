please tell me if this a good piece of poetry for a loved one i wrote this goodbye my friend goodbye like a child in love i felt a tingling in my chest i felt like it feels when you feel your very best nothing else matters much i have what i miss most i stayed awake all night asking is this real or its a ghost i let go of myself feeling what its like to be on cloud nine all these tests i have been through some hard some just fine is this love i asked my soul or merely another hurt that just feels good at first then suddenly feels like dirt i have been hurt before so i build around a huge wall my love cried out for me but i couldn't just hear his call i am not the one you knew for i know you not too well my hopes flew high up once then suddenly gave up and fell i am not the one you had i gasped and struggled to tell my spirits not free anymore i crept back into my lonely shell one day perhaps to eagles i will ask to take her my sweet talk tell her this was from my heart and never did i ever mock her heart i may never win for the heavens may not even know that the one who spoke from the heart was the one to leave and go it is a good piece of work it shows your love your ache it opens the door to tomorrow in the end i love your effort you should try more it works for you i love writing poetry too goodbye my friend goodbye it's okay to repeat this word here like a child in love i feel a tingling in my chest bring to present tense to go with the first line i felt like it feels when you feel your very best too many feels and felts nothing else matters much i had what i'll miss most i stayed awake all night asking is this real or its a ghost bring to present tense like i stay awake at night asking i let go of myself feeling what its like to be on cloud nine all these tests i have been through some hard some just fine tests are never fine is this love i asked my soul or merely another hurt is it ecstasy formed then suddenly crumbles to dirt shows that from the beginning you had reservations i have been mangled before i've built around me a wall my love cried out to me but i shut my ears to the call i am not the one you knew and i know you ne'r too well my hopes took wing then suddenly tumbled and fell i am not the one you had i gasped and struggled to tell my spirit 'tis free no more i creep into my lonely shell one day perhaps an eagle i will ask to send you my sweet talk to speak from my heart and never will i mock not ever and never in the same line your heart i may never win and the heavens may not even know for the one who spoke to my heart is the one who has let me go is she speaking from her heart to everyone or just to you how do you know she spoke from her heart so i used the liberty to say she spoke to yours please don't be hurt as i critique writings in class have for years now you may use some suggestions and loose others as i don't know precisely what you're relationship to this girl is these are tips and things to watch out for in any writing don't repeat words over and over and esp on the same line you use the a lot and i use emotion and not common words or phrases like good or hurt describe how good as in a word like ecstasy or how hurt like broken or heart aches use the same tense present when possible in this case and if you are talking directly to her don't revert to speaking about her as if to someone else unless in your case you spoke to the eagle about her then make the distinction very evident then change back when not speaking to the eagle use the words me and i and my very sparingly 'i' struggle back into 'my' lonely shell too may ands are like too many bandades use them only if necessary take out words that can be taken out in poetry to make it light and presentable you can use two lines for one of your sentences like my spirit free no more it creeps into it's lonely shell use a question mark when needed don't use words that mean the same thing in the same sentence pick each sentence apart drop it if it's redundant use contractions if you can i don't know it all either Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten Cliff Richard The Shining (film) Time Out of Mind Sin City Miss Saigon Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory Hiberno-English Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Emancipation of Mimi Book of Isaiah EastEnders The Death Gate Cycle Piccolo Junior Saga Out-of-body experience Blood on the Tracks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Kodocha The Inside Spanish verbs Socrates RuneScape quests Humphrey Bogart The Lovely Bones Billboard Hot 100 W.I.T.C.H.
