this is a question mostly for psychologist counselors etc but anyone can answer i have been getting these angry responses from strangers for years now etc like people turning away from me avoiding looking at me rolling there eyes in intense anger at me or when i walk in the door the entire room is looking and staring at me angrly and whispering to each other while looking at me now i have often been told that my normal facial expressions looks angry but i am not angry these people are strangers to me this behavior happens within minutes what is happening and why if it is my facial expression it is wrong to judge me on one thing alone most of the time i have'nt even spoken a word yet also a lot of the times my own mother is with me when these things is happening she says nothing while it is happening when we are alone i ask her about the situations and she flat out lies to my face and says she did'nt notice anything as i started earlier this has been going on for years and my mother has been with me most of the time why is she lying to me this is difficult to explain in this kind of format what you're feeling from others is called projecting responses let me see if i can explain this without making you feel as though i am putting you down or pointing fingers i am not this is without the benefit of tone or inflection please understand that when we are young we feel certain things through a series of events we either feel rejected sad or angry with the outcome of those life experiences those issues are triggered within us by someone else's social behavior someone's words or someone's body language with that said what's happening to you is that you have a trigger inside when you go out you feel that people are going to be disappointed with you that they will reject you with their stares or glances that you will not fit in am i right you're projecting that which you fear and in return are getting exactly the response you are most afraid of the only way to combat this is to be honest with your self to identify what's made you feel this way to begin with and then to understand that you're going to have to do some homework you're going to have to do whatever it is that will make you feel confident enough so that you're not so afraid of their rejection that might be a tough one as you're so young like i said it's hard to explain here you will get there though you're a good person stop beating your self up Milton H.
