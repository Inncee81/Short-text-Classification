how can i stop being so bitter i hate being so bitter but i can't help it i hate everyone and rearly have any good memories of my life i have children and i do't want them to grow up seeing this what can i do you don't want your children to grow up seeing your bitterness so what you can do is stop sending them that message millions of people on this planet grow up into adults with no good memories from their childhood and earlier life we are affected by things that were not our fault and also by our own foolish mistakes that we have made on our life journey but you like all parents and those who find themselves in the position of nurturing raising and moulding the lives of children are at this time doing and saying the things that will affect them for the rest of their lives every bit of negativity that you project on to them will be absorbed by them and become a part of them in some way let go of the past and everything in it that is not a positive memory it's life it happened you can't un happen it but you did survive it and now you are designing your present and building your future if the future of your children isn't enough of an incentive for you to get the junk out of your trunk and start appreciating what you have got going for you right now there is nothing anyone can do to help you try to sit down quietly once in a while and just ponder over all the terrible awful horrendous things that are happening to so many millions of people around the world that make your life past or present seem like heaven on earth you know and i know that there are a ton of those folks who would swap places with you in a heartbeat if only they could i hope that perhaps that might put things in perspective for you a little bit a wise family elder once told me life is like living on the side of a mountain you have to keep moving and you can only go in two directions climb or slide sliding downwards is reeeeal easy but there is absolutely nothing at the bottom that you want to know about climbing is hard and it takes every ounce of will and every muscle to do it but the more you persevere the more you work both your will and your muscle and both grow stronger keep climbing because the view from the top is just wonderful Vegeta Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Pitaten Equine conformation Economic inequality Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Storytelling Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Shadow the Hedgehog Kender Children of Dune Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.
