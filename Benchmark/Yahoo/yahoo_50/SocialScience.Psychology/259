my mum always used to visit my sister alot everyday most times and and me not for months on end even though i lived a bus ride away and she used to visit my brother who lived in a different town more often than me i always felt inferior and could this be the reason for it a psychologist said it could be cos she even visited me once to bring a present up for a kid who was ill and stopped by my place this was after six monts and had to go quickly to catch a bus after mins i did not go to hers cos he boyfriend turned me away at the door its hard to forget these memories sometimes they can still affect how i think of myself how do i put the past behind the best remedy i can offer is from my own experience treat your own children better look after yourself replace the unhappy memories with new good memories all the better to remember in the future and get on with living your life in the very best possible way how we are treated in the past does not make us who we are not really they can shape how we feel but this masks the true identity of who you are be true to yourself and give yourself a pat on the back for not turning into your mum About a Boy EastEnders Phoebe Halliwell Little Britain Memento (film) Kodocha Days of our Lives Orthogonal matrix Charmed Sigmund Freud Hitchhiking Funeral Pitaten Dissociative identity disorder W.I.T.C.H.
