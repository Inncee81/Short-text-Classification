what is your impression of someone who resigns from a job and gives either no notice or half day's notice or reasons why someone would do that one of my coworkers had this past friday and monday off so she could be with her husband well she comes in monday afternoon and says she got another job isn't it common courtesy to give an employer weeks notice when resigning from a job i just find it incredibly selfish that people cannot do that if a new employer really found a good fit for a position i'm sure that they could wait so the person could resign the professional way i want to leave too but will give proper notice dogstarrr some of what you said makes perfect sense the prez at my employer runs hot cold and many times is just plain rude and insensitive my ex coworker and i talked about some of the aspects of the job as well as people that peeved us a few weeks ago i told her that i'd like to resign someday and she ends up leaving before me i reckon it comes down to whether or not one has a proper worked out strategy for resigning from a job i know the first time i resigned i wasn't sure how to deal with it and talked around the houses for mins or so before i came to the point and the second time wasn't much better i have this dislike of letting people down see and i felt that by leaving i was dropping the boss in it i also made pictures in my head of sad co workers etc making it really difficult for myself to go now if i were to make pictures of an exploding boss raining fire down on my a surrounded by jeering co workers who all want to scrag me for resigning i'm pretty sure i'd get so worked up by my hallucinations that i'd leave with no notice at all also i've known people who've left with no notice simply to get back at management for treating them badly in most instances the depth of the bad treatment has been an hallucination except for one instance where a guy left after a week and both parties were terribly glad about it Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Piccolo Junior Saga James T.
