are ghost real and how can i get rid of them i am quite scared late at night i keep thinking there is a ghost in my living shes an old elderly lady sitting on my couch praying with a robe sometimes i think shes walks through the hallway of my house this is my imagination right how can i stop believing in ghost it's hard to say whether or not ghosts are real many sighting can easily be disproved while others remain a mystery ultimately it is up to you to decide if you believe what you are seeing is in fact a ghost or not your problem is that you keep thinking there is a ghost in your living room it could be that you are forcing yourself to see something that actually is not there have you actually seen the ghost with your own eyes if so did you clearly see an elderly lady or was it just a shadow also did you see it directly or out of the corner of your eye remember a person's peripheral vision is very good at picking up movement but incredibly bad at determining what an object is what you need to do is ask yourself whether or not you believe in ghosts if you do then you could be setting yourself up to continue seeing the apparition however if you don't then take a step back and try to think logically and rationally ask yourself what exactly did i see or did i in fact see anything at all did i experience an unexplainable paranormal event or is it more likely that i just confused the lamppost for a person just try to reassure yourself that it's all in your head Unidentified flying object Supernatural Luck PANICS Goodness and value theory The nature of God in Western theology Macbeth Reality Ghostbusters The Shining (film) Spring Heeled Jack Columbine High School massacre Prank flash Expanded Universe (Star Wars) The Phantom Manor Tag Time Out of Mind RuneScape quests Sin City The Amber Spyglass Blonde on Blonde Theodicy Out-of-body experience The X-Files (season 1) Soul Eye Dualism (philosophy of mind) Scientific method Boston Public Ghost Dance StarCraft: Uprising Carl Jung The Time Machine Social justice Traumatic incident reduction Theory of conduct Stereoscopy Scientology beliefs and practices Anomalous phenomenon Mysticism The Invisibles Eastern Illinois University Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Volleyball Abduction Phenomenon Blood (computer game) Parapsychology Microeconomics Moral relativism Shadow the Hedgehog Human nature F.E.A.R.
