why do i never dream of girls i like when that is something that's on my mmind alot i like many girls male by the way i also study and learn about japan and the language so i always think about japanese girls and japan everyday but i never ever dream about them aside from the japanese girls i just like tons of girls american white latins or whatever but i never dream about interaction with women why is this what we dream about seldom reflects what we consciously think about and experience when awake at least not obviously so if you don't have many erotic or romantic dreams it could simply mean that you have enough of those things in your waking life in some form or other more important than what you don't dream about is what you do dream about for example if you often experience nightmares or dreams about stressful situations this could indicate a need to deal with something stressful happening in your real life if that's the case it's no wonder you don't have dreams involving romance your subconscious is concerned with something else Dream Out-of-body experience Lucid dreaming Consciousness Scenes from a Memory Unconscious mind Hentai Infantilism Miss Saigon Gender-neutral language Sleep Novel Psychology Social psychology Milton H.
