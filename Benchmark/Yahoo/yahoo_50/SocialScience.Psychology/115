my parents are miserable it seems like no matter what they will never be happy my dad has always had a negative attitude in general my mom or at least it seems used to be happy but now all she does is dwell on the past there are solutions to most of their problems but i guess they would rather not make the effort i understand that they are both depressed i have dealt with it myself but at a certain point i think you need to take responsibility try to do something about the things that are bothering you for example my mom has been unhappy because we moved away years ago now that they are moving to the same state she keeps telling me that she's not going to be able to stand living so close to some of my dad's other relatives it's like can't you ever be happy she's finally getting what she wanted so i don't understand what do you make of it and btw they also make excuses not to go to therapy sorry to hear about your parents for someone living in that kind of environment you have a very good handle on the situation good for you keep it up the reality is your parents need to help themselves they need to get their acts together examine what it is to make their lives marriage better if they can't be botherd to help themselves then nothing no one is going to do it for them your position is to keep their problems at arms length get on with your own life i know that's not easy when you love two people but in a situation like this you're options are limited hang in there good luck Transactional analysis Pitaten Theory of conduct Fathers' rights Divorce Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Happiness Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Nicomachean Ethics Social rule Polyamory Wonderland (McFly album) Shaggy dog story Rent (musical) The Fairly OddParents The nature of God in Western theology 2000 Australian Grand Prix Goodness and value theory Carl Barks Milton H.
