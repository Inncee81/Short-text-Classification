can somebody help me with this quote i can't understand it experience of one's own existence it is only through his own being that man comes in contact with reality the experience of self necessarily has many modalities but there is one basic experience which makes all the others possible and without which they couldn't be a friend asked me to explain this to her but its after my exams so i'm really not in the mood for something like this please help she said it comes from man by some croonenburg guy here is the gist of it which may be all you need there are many windows through which one's soul may look upon the world but there is still only one soul that does the looking i have elaborated on this below if you care to wade through all of it it does gets a bit long but i promise you that if you manage to read the whole thing it should deepen your understanding of the subject matter of the quote in question here goes in short it means that when we reflect upon our own self and our own nature we do so in a variety of ways that is necessary because self evaluation serves different purposes in different environments but it also indicates that even though we have these many faceted ways of scrutinizing ourselves there is still a single common thread that wends its way through all of our perceived roles and self images a common unified me to elaborate think of the mind as a building a house imagine that in the attic of this house there is a tiny person peering out through many windows they're not ordinary windows however these windows open up onto views of people places and things that might in reality be very far apart though their respective windows might be right next to one another or they may even show things that no longer exist or that never have existed but which one day might not only that but these windows also give the looker a glimpse of their own reflection in the window glass as one goes through life and encounters new things they add new windows into their ever expanding attic they fashion these windows in diverse ways according to how they encountered the new thing what they think of the new thing what the new thing is etc etc etc there are all sorts of optional decorations and other adornments one has the option to include with any given window so that is the mind a building your body of course moves through the day and often seems to be independent from the mind it can't be of course but sometimes that's how it feels especially if you're prone to operating on auto pilot as your body moves through the real world you encounter other people any time you do then think back to the building that is your mind any time you encounter a person or group of people that tiny little person in the attic runs to the window designated for that person or group so she looks out at the person and perceives them as she does but she also catches sight of her own reflection in the window glass what she sees in her reflection includes all of the decorations and adornments she chose to include in that window as that window was being formed the reflection that the tiny person sees represents her impression of how the individual at that window sees her we attempt all the time to figure out what other people think about us and this is what that reflection represents in any given window we attempt to discern how others are seeing us based upon us looking at our own reflection complete with all the decorations that go along with that individuals window when we are encountering them for instance when you encounter a neighbor some of the items assigned to that neighbor's window might be she's so nosy or she hates me so i must look down at the ground rather than make eye contact you'll be seeing these things mixed in with the reflection because these are things you've either chosen or learned to associate with that neighbor and thus things which were included in this metaphorical window if you are encountering a friend then you might see along with your reflection objects like we both love peaches or he makes me feel good so whenever we encounter someone else our tiny little person runs to that person's assigned window within our mind and causes us to take on the behaviors and attitudes associated with the various things we've decorated their window with Social psychology Sexual orientation
