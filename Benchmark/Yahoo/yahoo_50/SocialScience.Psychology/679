psychological or is it just me i'm years old and i was a very social person up until about a year after i graduated highschool i have trust issues and find it very hard to converse verbally i have worked in the same place for just over a year now yet i am still too shy to say the first hello to my fellow workers at parties i find myself wandering about by myself seperating myself from my friends when i am alone i find this is where i can be happy yet at the same time i would enjoy being able to go out and have fun socially i talk very quiet almost a whisper all the time i have no idea if this is psychological or what i want to see a therapist but i feel i won't be able to open up without having visits first i have a lot of heart and a lot of stuff in my head that i would love to unlock and have people hear what can i do you could be facing some sort of social phobia or anxiety you say that these feelings began to persist after high school did something happen to steer you away from trusting others do you feel as if people are constantly judging you the problem could be a psychological one in which a therapist would be able to help you understanding why you act the way you do is the first step are you afraid of people do you get sweaty or uneasy if so this could link to social anxiety if you get scared of talking to others you may have social phobia which persists for several months before that label is afforded to be given if you were to enter therapy the therapist would more than likely focus on your fears while helping you to devise goals and ways to tackel your emotions around others without being your therapist though i would recommend that you try to understand people are not judging you when you go to work or school make it your goal to simply say hello and ask your co workers how they are doing that will more than likely set the stage for further conversation you should not feel awkward for being shy everyone goes through with that just remember that you are a good person and people will see that they wont think you are weird Social rule Psychoanalysis Anxiety Phobia Reparative therapy Avenue Q Transsexuality Drama Autism Ex-gay Dissociative identity disorder Neuro-linguistic programming Homophobia Social psychology Panic attack Transactional analysis Stuttering Clinical depression Traumatic brain injury Traumatic incident reduction Agoraphobia Cognitive therapy Procrastination Gestalt therapy Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show W.I.T.C.H.
