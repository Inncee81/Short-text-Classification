is it possible to introverted and happy some people tell me it is but i can't see any pros of being introverted what are they saumitra it must be beyond your imagination too sice you're not telling me marie kiera kieransova how does being an introvert help me to be a better writer sure i'm decent at writing but i don't think being introverted makes me a better writer other than being able to write about my lonlieness added details something i forgot to mention is i love to talk i am always talking with my parents and siblings i just find it very hard to start conversations with other people sometimes unless it's in a private or at least one on one conversation so far it's not sounding like much good can become of being introverted on it's own good can come despite but not because of i'm an introvert as well and that's probably the biggest reason i'm unhappy don't get me wrong i'm happy most of the time but sometimes i do feel really lonely i have some friends not to mention a husband but i'm pretty sure they don't really understand me i have social anxiety disorder and that's just the way it is introverts probably are smarter as a rule but being smart doesn't always get you far in life actually from what i've seen being smart isn't as important as being social and saying and doing the right things in life oh well guess i can go back to criticizing everybody's intelligence now while i sit here and think maybe i'd be happier to be dumber but at least not socially awkward sorry i really can't see any pros as i've said us introverts probably tend to be smarter but what does it matter if we're still too quiet Theory of conduct Social rule Friends Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Asperger syndrome Pitaten Carl Jung Shaggy dog story The Emancipation of Mimi The Catcher in the Rye Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bernard Williams The Ashlee Simpson Show The nature of God in Western theology EastEnders Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Kender Goodness and value theory Rich Mullins Time Out of Mind The Smoking Room Hearing impairment Laura Schlessinger Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Intelligence quotient Dead Like Me True Crime: Streets of LA The Fairly OddParents Nerd Controversies in autism Philosophy of language The Amber Spyglass Smart and Smarter Avenue Q Transactional analysis Happiness Mojave people Utilitarianism Carl Barks Undergrads Jon Secada Narcissism About a Boy Anne Rice The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Gross domestic product Aladdin (1992 film) Dumb & Dumber Neil Postman Current teachings of Prem Rawat Plame affair Scenes from a Memory Moral Politics Cro She Loves You Nudism Microeconomics Ex-gay Blood on the Tracks The Lovely Bones Procrastination Mozart effect Negima Nashville Skyline Salad Fingers Extreme Programming Damn Yankees Bipolar disorder Great Teacher Onizuka Alcoholics Anonymous Blonde on Blonde Traumatic incident reduction Written Cantonese Boston Public Jiddu Krishnamurti Ethical challenges to autism treatment Fiddler on the Roof Chess strategy and tactics Milton H.
