do you want some changes in your life if so what are they unfortunately i find myself stuck in a rut some days and after too many months or years of the same routine i will change everything in my life last year for example entering the year i was unhappy with the way things were going i was working a job i hated to pay for university i was hooking up with girls that were not my type i didn't care for them i was just looking to get laid because of long work hours i was failing out of uni and the only people i hung out with were the people i worked with so no one would encourage me to stop because they were in the same boat and thought it was ok because the others were there so i made a choice i spent the next months saving up my money instead of spending it on useless stuff and then i went free fall for months i stopped working and lived off my saving i started getting high marks at uni and i started making great new friends hell a month later my old work rang me and offered me an ultra casual job that was way better than my last one earning more money than my old boss a little bit more dangerous but for the money and not being forced to work all the time it is worth it even now a year later even though it takes more effort to maintain friendships and uni commitments i feel i've made the right decision sometimes when you hit rock bottom it's good to stop what you're doing and trust that you have the skill to fall into something better Inflation One Tree Hill (TV series) Haibane Renmei Knots Landing Friends MMORPG Vegeta Freeters Social rule Spice Girls Wheel of Fortune Pitaten Humphrey Bogart Labour economics Unemployment Poker jargon Kodocha EastEnders Phoebe Halliwell Avenue Q Dead Like Me Married... with Children Economic inequality Polyamory The Amber Spyglass Graduate school Vernon Schillinger Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Education in Germany Marilyn Monroe Incarnations of Immortality Eddie Guerrero Grand Theft Auto (game) The Supremes Hillary Rodham Clinton W.I.T.C.H.
