can some one explain the roeschach controversy in detail cause i don't understand it at all and please dont giv eme answeres from qikipedia cuase i read that all ready and i still dont get it you want a detailed answer but there's a lot that goes into it the basic idea is that the test is supposed to have meaningless images so the controversy lies in that how can you determine personality especially psychosis from meaningless stimuli basically the question is raised that the test giver has to have some idea of what a normal response would be but again it's supposed to be meaningless images therefore some critics believe that in order to determine personality or mental illness a test giver has to have some notion of what answer the image would provoke in a normal person hence the test not being objective but instead subjective for example i'm giving you the test i show you a card w a blob on it i can't help but notice that the blob looks to me somewhat like a butterfly but you answer that you see a little child there is no butterfly there is no little child but i could interpret your answer to have underlying meaning because it truly looks nothing like a little child but does it look like a butterfly again it's meaningless stimuli so basically i'm projecting my thoughts onto the images and judging your responses based on my projections again a subjective not objective test which it claims to be does that make sense Extreme Programming Meaning Meaning of life Deconstruction Autism Scientology beliefs and practices Scientific method Psychosis Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Falsifiability Metaphysics The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of mind Causality Turing test GED Postmodernism Rorschach inkblot test Unconscious mind Epistemology Many-worlds interpretation Psychology Randomness The Giver Second language acquisition Cognitive science Originalism Hypnosis Science Objectivist philosophy Moral relativism Transcendental argument for the existence of God Franz Boas Problem of universals Determinism Traumatic incident reduction Microeconomics Art Civil rights Rudolf Hermann Lotze Louis Althusser Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Person Expert system Theodicy Reparative therapy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Social psychology Supply and demand Sexual orientation Philosophical Investigations Controversies in autism Normal distribution Neuro-linguistic programming G__del's incompleteness theorem Hypoglycemia Goodness and value theory Martin Heidegger Platonic realism Theology Conspiracy theory Existentialism Empathy Species Asperger syndrome Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal Phaedo Koan Infant baptism Milton H.
