look me in the eyes ok my question is a bit weird all my life and even now i have to have people looking me in the eyes when i am speaking to them or at least glancing and i've always looked them in the eyes but just recently i just don't seem to want to look at peoples eyes even if i don't know you or if i do know you what in the world could be in my subconscious or conscious mind that would make me not be able to and it's not like when someone is telling a lie and won't look at you it's not that at all it's almost like when i look into someones eyes i feel like they are judging me please help or at least try thanks well it could be that you're afraid of what their careful eyes might find for we all have a personal personality things we only share and think to ourselves and the truths that you discovered hiding in them you may subconsciously fear that they may find in you Eye contact Unconscious mind Social rule Theory of conduct Infantilism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Jon Secada Black (people) Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
