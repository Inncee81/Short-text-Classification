career choices life help i'm currently in high school and considering post secondary choices based on my interests and goals but lately i've done a lot of second guessing and changing my mind i need some opinions and advice fifteen years from now i see myself in a career in an environment where i get to interact with people in a creative manner perhaps a business but more on the aesthetically pleasing side not the bland accounting and spreadsheets kind side my interests include media but i'm afraid it's just a passing phase oh and the way people think and expressing my opinions careers that are running strong in my mind right now are media specialist psychology something in social sciences very general i currently live in ontario canada so my post secondaries would be like u of t or western or mcmaster etc i also have to choose between hs intro to psychology sociology anthro university prep or media studies open any advice would be appreciated thank you i know it's a tough question but a really personalized and thoughtful answer will be rewarded another note xd i'm asian and you know how they can be my father wants me to take life sciences and pursue careers in that i really don't think i want to do that but for him i'm keeping my options open p my opinion would be that you take the courses that lead to media specialist my reasoning is somewhat like this a specialty in media at this stage would give you a broad understanding of your choices in that field the field is new and is expanding exponentially if you do find that it gives you a lot of creative freedom and room to voice your opinions great you will have a head start on your career if you find that it is not for you the basic humanities courses will still have the basic introduction the introductory courses in this field have more history to cover Social psychology Ethics Franz Boas Sociology Education in Portugal Western philosophy Economics Psychology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Germany Theory of conduct Science History of science Rudolf Hermann Lotze Art Goodness and value theory Education in Romania Philosophy York University GED Sociocultural evolution Gender role Sexual orientation Philosophy of science Game theory High school Linguistics Geography Victor Cousin Scientology beliefs and practices SAT University of Maryland Baltimore County Soul Motivation Aesthetic Realism Cultural relativism Noam Chomsky Philosophy of mathematics Education in Australia The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Empathy Medicine George Lakoff Education in the United States Social sciences Juris Doctor Immanuel Kant IB Diploma Programme W.
