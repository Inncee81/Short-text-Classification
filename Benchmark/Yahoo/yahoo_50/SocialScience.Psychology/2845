what is the meaning of life very vague question so i know that this is vague and also cliche but i'm just curious what everyone thinks it is it could be from a personal point of view or a more widespread theory whatever you think in my opinion it is not an unjustifiable assumption that the answer to this question is always an opinion that is it is not verifiable using empirical evidence or any mathematical extrapolations personally i prefer my life to my death at the moment i have set rough goals in life and i look forward to accomplishing them so as to enjoy life whilst contributing to the physical and ethical advancement of our modern zeitgeist and thereby the future human existence i should hope that you as well as the rest of my species would do likewise considering the improvement on their own life as well as the world village's i hope you don't come down with any detrimental illnesses or suffer any physical injuries i hope that people would learn to live with appreciation and respect for one another for universal peace it is important that the elements which endeavor to destroy this ideal be eliminated who wants to live with a drug addiction who wants to be murdered raped molested starved enslaved kidnapped or beaten why does existence exits if existence didn't exist then there would be no purpose to anything there wouldn't be anything so here we are in reality sentient beings who can ask philosophical questions in the hopes that a practical answer can come of it have a nice life Abortion debate Intelligent design Peter Singer Goodness and value theory Theodicy Supernatural Altruism Epistemology Immanuel Kant Objectivist philosophy Philosophy of mathematics Science Neuro-linguistic programming Simone Weil Person Reincarnation Reality Sociocultural evolution Human nature S__ren Kierkegaard Physics Determinism Artificial consciousness Ethics Free will Multiverse A Course In Miracles Technological singularity Immortality Force (Star Wars) Philosophy of language Creationism History of science Human Fermi paradox The nature of God in Western theology Soul Animal rights Philosophy Bertrand Russell Philosophy of science Friedrich Schleiermacher Western philosophy Deconstruction Thomas Hill Green Political economy David Hume Karl Popper Utilitarianism Al-Ghazali Physical paradox Sexual orientation Creation-evolution controversy Pseudoscience Human sexual behavior Scientology Happiness Rape Scientology beliefs and practices Age of Enlightenment Afterlife Eugenics Aristotle Scientific method Socrates Prices of production Evil Falsifiability Consciousness Paradox Duties of the Heart Existence of God Willard Van Orman Quine Anarcho-primitivism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Problem of universals Atheism Nicomachean Ethics Capitalism Alfred Korzybski Anti-psychiatry Buddhism Deprogramming Love Kurt Cobain State John Wycliffe Law of value
