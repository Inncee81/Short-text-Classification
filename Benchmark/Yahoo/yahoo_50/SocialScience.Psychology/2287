i need some help about a situation ok so it is summer right and summer is a time of fun right well not for me i am like really stressed out because all of my friends live like at least miles away i cant drive and my bro and sis wont do anything with me i am totally bored in the summer every single day i dont want to get out and excercise because i have no one to do it with so i will look stupid i am desprate and i have barely been outside at all this summer anything i can do or do i jsut have to lay around the house and get fat i would bike over but the problem is the streets are too full of traffic and i am guessing the 'rents wont let me do that no worries you aren't the only individual who feels like that what you need to do is actually go outside and exercise despite your idiosyncracy that you'll look stupid doing it don't let idiosyncracys get to you like they do to me some of them that i have are just so ridiculous i'll admit and it really isolates you from doing what you want to do in the world do you really think people are going to be staring out of their windows and saying doesn't that kid look stupid excersing by him herself do you really think people are going to assume that i know i wouldn't see what we think sometimes is really not a major issue at all and is rather just a small misdemeanor you could easily just take a stroll around where you live for a little while or you could ride your bike you could jog or you could just sit outside and read or draw as i always say to people you have to push yourself into doing things just say to yourself you know what i'm going to actually go outside and do what ever i want without thinking i look weird do whatever you want this summer while your at home because if you don't you will regret it within a month when everyone's back at school Friends Social rule Shaggy dog story Garfield Theory of conduct The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Hey Arnold!
