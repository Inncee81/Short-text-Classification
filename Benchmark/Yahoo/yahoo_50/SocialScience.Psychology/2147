can your iq be your downfall i have an iq of its mostly slightly above average but my biggest problem is that i get bored easily i spend more time reading books because the different worlds provide an escape for me i fall into a book and literally live the story i read the final harry potter book in hours i read most novels in hours i love travelling and sports but battle to work in an office environment i know that iq doesn't mean that i can be an accountant which i wouldn't want anyway i am a creative person i love writing and creating things i love reading and see the world as my oyster i have never done an aptitute test but have spent most of my years wondering what i should do i can do anything but not everything makes me happy what should i do sorry please don't think i only read harry potter i read all books biographies history dickens crime etc i read at least a book every days or so harry potter and his books would get effing annoying to read every day of the week for the rest of my life don't let your iq have any effect on what you want to do with the average iq being you are clearly very intelligent and almost genius which most institutes specify as as minimum values but i think it never changes who you are like you i read a lot but i take so long to read a book because i only read at talking speed i'm not slow or dyslexic i simply feel that i don't absorb it all if i read any faster which could give the idea that i'm a little slow i'm also immensely musicaly based i've always been a good singer and i have picked up the guitar very quickly when a high intelectual attribute is said to sometimes stub musical ability however my iq is iq is just a measure of mental agility it doesn't specify exactly what you can and can't do just odn't let your high level of intelligence specify your strengths p s about what mafiagirl at the top entered this is bullshit again you shouldn't let you iq dictate what you want to read and learn about e g you may find a five year old with an iq of more than but it doesn't mean they shouldn't read whatever normal five year olds read the bottom line is that they're still five iq and interests are apples and oranges Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Dyslexia Equine conformation Harry Potter Visual Basic Social rule Charles Dickens The Chronicles of Narnia RISC Theodicy Grade (education) Hermione Granger Computer Literature Asperger syndrome Fight Club W.
