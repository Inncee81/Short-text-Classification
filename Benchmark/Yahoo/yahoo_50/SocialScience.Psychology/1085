what is wrong with me this year i've noticed that something is wrong with me there are times that i am bored to get out of home and meet up with other people either me friends or relatives i like being alone at home doing nothing but resting in front of the pc and chatting on the net with friends also when i go out with friends and as we discuss i get easily bored and stop taking part in the discussion and i think of other matters it's like my mind is tired even though it doesn't get much tired so as in the first minutes i'm fine in the next minutes i'm like so bored like i don't have power and i am not in the mood of talking with others or smiling and many times i'm also bored to even think do you have any interpretation for this hey nothing wrong with a little mind wandering but if it continue i suggest you get help but before you head to the shrink and they tell you that you have a d d try taking a weekend off to recharge by yourself and dont take you creature comforts no electronics just a few books and yourself see if that helps Time Out of Mind Social rule Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spidey Super Stories Hey Jude K' Singlish American and British English differences Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Humphrey Bogart W.I.T.C.H.
