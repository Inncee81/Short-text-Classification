anyone going to see the remake of halloween its out august st im watching the original on ifc right now i always liked it just curious if others like the original too and if you think the remake looks any good im unsure the trailer looks spooky though i've loved the halloween films since i was a child i was a bit worried when i heard they were remaking it i haven't been all that impressed with the remakes of my fave horror films so far but i'm a fan of rob zombie's and i'm probably one of the few that liked house of corpses and devils rejects i think that rob zombie is a big enough fan of horror to not disrespect the original film and its fans i'm sure he did what he could the make up looks awesome i love the whole look of micheal in the previews and the stills i've seen in horror mags like fangoria i have faith that it wont suck as bad as i've heard some predict it might be blind faith but faith non the less and my friends and i will be soem of the first in line to see the movie when it opens i do wish it was coming out closer to halloween time though all the other halloween films came out around halloween and i always thought that was neat but then i'm glad because we need a horror film out in theaters now Rob Zombie Horror film House of 1000 Corpses Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Halloween (film) Little Shop of Horrors Cult film The Simpsons Paul W.
