ps on lcd monitor i've heard bad things about connecting xbox 's to lcd monitor that it displays weird bars and has odd resolution and whatnot but how about the ps in a few years i plan to get a ps and put it right next to my computer and have it share the monitor my monitor is a widescreen hp with standard dvi and vga and x resolution will it work right it should it will display black bars on the bottom on top because the monitor is but thats expected anything else i should know the main thing with pc lcd monitors is that in order for it to work with the ps the monitor has to be hdcp compliant the monitor could have every type of connection known to man but if it isn't hdcp compliant the ps will not work with that monitor in other words if your monitor is hdcp compliant than you'll be fine otherwise you'll need to go out and get a monitor that's hdcp compliant if you're planning to hook up your ps to it hope this helps Digital Visual Interface Television Liquid crystal display Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Pixel Computer display Universal Serial Bus High-Definition Multimedia Interface 1080p IMac Laptop Computer display standard TFT LCD Liquid crystal display television Stereoscopy Sega Saturn IBM PC compatible Sega Dreamcast Nintendo GameCube Color Video game console Windows XP Display resolution Computer and video games Graphics card Super Video Graphics Array Handheld game console Enhanced Graphics Adapter Xbox 360 PowerBook Nintendo Revolution Apple Macintosh Xbox Refresh rate Diving regulator ATI Technologies Hercules Graphics Card Extended display identification data Konica Minolta Space Quest History of computer and video games Acorn Archimedes PlayStation 3 ZX Spectrum Danger Hiptop Rendering (computer graphics) 720p Atari ST Oscilloscope Blu-ray Disc SMPTE color bars Color Graphics Adapter Sharp Zaurus In The Groove (game) Digital photography Blue screen of death Knight Rider Geographic information system Interlace Dance Dance Revolution Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Gamut Light gun PowerBook G4 Game Boy Nintendo DS Bicycle frame Screensaver PostScript Watch Atari 8-bit family Amiga 3dfx Anamorphic widescreen Computer art scene Information Technology Infrastructure Library Cathode ray tube Plasma display Amstrad CPC Nintendo Entertainment System Domestic AC power plugs and sockets PlayStation Portable Arcade cabinet Sega Karaoke Light-emitting diode ThinkPad System/36 Map Aspect ratio (image) IBM Personal System/2 Computer wallpaper TeX G-Man (Half-Life) LAN party High-definition television Video
