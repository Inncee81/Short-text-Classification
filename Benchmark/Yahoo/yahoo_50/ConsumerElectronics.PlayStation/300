tom clancy's rainbow six vegas or resistance fall of man for my first ps game if i get rainbow six then i can still play the resistance demo and if i like it i can buy it but there is no rainbow six vegas demo because whichever one i dont get i may never get unless i find out that resistance is amazing cause my friend gets it cause he wouldnt buy rainbow six and if i dont get it now i probobly never will i love the tactical and sqaud command but i would also play the out of control crazy isane game i cant really make a solid decision but i think im leaning more towards rainbow six vegas cause its awsome and its now or never for it and resistance ill probobly gets pushed to buy when my friend gets it but i wouldnt get it for a while cause im getting the ps this weekend with one game and then when my next paycheck comes a few days later warhawk comes out and im gonna buy it the day it does please help and please notify if you own both games cause then i can trust you better than the guy who only owns resistance and never played rainbow six and sayes its way better please dont say get both im only getting one i preferred rainbow six i'm getting tired of run and gun games there is absolutely no place to find cover in resistance multiplayer the maps are poor and you often find yourself out in the open begging to get shot i dislike all the maps and refuse to pay an extra for a map pack rainbow six offers more stuff for multiplayer you have more weapons better maps night vision heat vision snake cam ranks that unlock new stuff you can use headsets and there are more game modes i play rs all the time but only played resistance a few times before getting sick of it it doesn't make sense that your friend wants you to get resistance because you can't talk to or find him online this is all my opinion of course resistance does have a lot of cool innovative weapons and plays a lot like halo find a person and shoot em i never got into that type of game though Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Advance Wars: Dual Strike First-person shooter Counter-Strike Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear Xbox Live Battlefield 2 Halo 2 Halo: Combat Evolved Unreal Tournament 2003 Computer and video game genres Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Quake III Arena Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Unreal Tournament 2004 SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Blood (computer game) America's Army Time Out of Mind Nintendo DS GoldenEye 007 Unreal engine Multiplayer GunZ The Duel Half-Life 2 Rainbow Six Battlefield 1942 Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
