i am going to school for medical insurance billing and coding at pinnacle career institute is this school good it is the only one i could find with a nine month program like most of the tech schools out here and am i looking at a good career field can i go for billing and coding most of the job descriptions i saw had billing or coding jobs not both and are the starting wages salaries good i have a son and looking to get married soon to add another to my family in the next years is this a good career move medical insurance billing and coding are two very separate fields i am personally a cpc through the aapc a ccp through phia rn and i am an auditor i have been a cpc certified professional coder since i have been doing this for some time i also have taught at the national college of business and i can tell you that your diploma will not help you in the job market however it may help you to learn the field how to code the basics etc but it will not help you otherwise you must get certified through the aapc american academy of professional coders or phia professional healthcare information association it all depends on what your state most employs that is something you need to look into as far as the job market it is in high demand if not locally you can work remotely or travel personally i travel i make anywhere from to per year you should really consider getting a mentor to help you with your career decisions i have mentored multiple people and trust me here it will really help you if you choose a mentor make sure that they are certified and that they have been for sometime there are many new certified coders and or billers out there that are new to the field nothing wrong with that but the real world in this field is totally different from you actually learn in school for instance when taking the cpc exam you can not use rules for medicare this is where it will become very confusing for you if you are already coding however if you know your stuff you will not have any problems the cpc exam is as hard or harder than the nursing boards i took if that tells you anything you really need to know your anatomy and all of your basics before you venture into the coding field billing this is more behing the scenes you will work with insurance companys etc with coding you need to work more hands on with the physicians nurses etc you have to know pretty much everything that goes on with the patients i have wrote a book on coding and believe me i could go on for days it is a good field and in high demand Nurse Physician Medicare (Canada) Health insurance Nursing General practitioner Health care in the United States Education in the United States American Medical Association Juris Doctor Community college Medicine Medicare (United States) Unemployment City and Guilds of London Institute Education in Germany Medical Assistant Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Canadian and American health care systems compared Software engineering National Health Service Insurance Podiatrist Teacher Chiropractic Pharmaceutical company Emergency Medical Services Accountancy Graduate school Social Security (United States) Labour economics Medical prescription Actuary Education in Romania Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Prostate cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in Australia Amstrad CPC Extreme Programming Physical therapy Certified first responder Psychiatry Corporate governance Lawyer Dentistry National Football League Vanderbilt University Public policy Scientology beliefs and practices Education in the People's Republic of China Master's degree Education in Hong Kong Midwifery Communist Party of China Economy of the United States Columbia University Visual Basic National Kidney Foundation Singapore GED School accreditation Taxation in the United States Pretty Good Privacy Freelancing on the Internet Physician assistant Compensation of employees Medical school Architect Economic inequality Conscription Electrical engineering Microeconomics American and British English differences Atari 8-bit family Certification Pharmacist Notary public Naturopathic medicine Palliative care Floppy disk Warren Buffett Risk management Trade union MUMPS Advanced Placement Program Profession Far Eastern University
