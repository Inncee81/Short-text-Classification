any pharmacists i'm a senior in high school and this may sound really cheesey but i want to do something that helps people but i was wondering how much patient interaction there actually is in pharmacy also what kind of hours do pharmacists work i want to have a life outside of work and a family so is being a pharmacist too much of a demanding career to have a life outside of work i know in retail pharmacy you would see the patients but what about in hospital pharmacy is it a satisfying career if youre a pharmacist do you really feel like you are helping people i'm not a pharmacist but i worked as a rn in hospitals for years pharmacists in hospitals get absolutely no patient contact they spend all of their day in the hospital pharmacy getting medications ready to send to the floors so that the nurses can give them to the patients from what i've seen in places like walgreen's is that every once and awhile a customer will ask a question of a pharmacist but they spend most of the time filling prescriptions i applaud you for wanting a career that is helpful to others and i think that you are very smart to realize that to have a satisfying family life you need to have a career that is not so damanding as to leave no time or energy for your family life i wish that i had realized that at your age both pharmacists and rns in hospitals work very fast paced demanding jobs you also have to spend extra time after work taking workshops and courses to keep abreast of new information pharmacists in retail pharmacies have first and second shift to cover in hospitals pharmacists work all three shifts also in both retail and hospitals weekend work is required as a rn i found that working different shifts and weekends was very detrimental to my private and my family life what i have come to realise is that if you can the best type of job to have a satisfying family life is a job where you work straight days and have every w e and holiday off i would encourage you to investigate what types of careers offer those work hours i'm y o now and think that i helped a lot of people working in hospitals but working different shifts and almost every holiday ruined my personal life Medical prescription Pharmacy Target Corporation Shoppers Drug Mart Physician Milton H.
