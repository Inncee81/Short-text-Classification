is it just me or is everyone acting like pac man jones is going to be a good acquisition for tna already suggesting storylines and putting belts on him when nobody has seen him wrestle or his mic work correct me but i thought thats why people watched tna not for big name athletes who come in get monster pushes then suck remember how happy everyone was when wwe got monty brown and what happened they showed he's a limited skill wrestler with mic skills thoughts anyone you make a good point and i agree the only thing he has is speed no strength Scott Levy Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling slang A.J.
