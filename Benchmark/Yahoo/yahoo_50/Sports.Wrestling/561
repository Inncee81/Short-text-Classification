which tna wrestlers have asked for releases i have heard alot have asked for releases but apart from konnan and ron killings who else has no one is releasing these names for whatever reason my opinion on probably who is trying to get released petey williams eric young robert roode alex shelley samoa joe raven vkm team d and konnan petey williams eric young robert roode and alex shelley all makes sense because scott d'amore is looking for a job in wwe wwe feels like if d'amore brings them tna talent then they would sign him to a contract this would explain williams jobbing for most of the year to other x division stars plus guys like williams young roode shelley and even chris sabin have had some kind of affiliation to border city wrestling d'amore's promotion in windsor ontario samoa joe wants a new contract and tna has lowballed in money joe is supposed to be the face of the company along with aj styles but the writers and executives feel that kurt angle christian cage and sting have more exposure and equal ratings if joe does not get the title soon he may return to roh next year vkm wants out of tna because they have not used them very well in the past i'm not talking about the dumb to the extreme storylines i'm talking about live kru kip and b g think that going back to wwe they will have better exposure and money team d specifically brother devon wants back into wwe because he is good friends with batista and does not like some of the things tna is doing raven probably wants out because tna has failed to push him over the past two years and he has had issues with tna management over drug problems konnan i don't know if he was officially released but he is in a lawsuit with tna over money tna gave him for his hip replacement and kindney transplant TNA Lockdown Bobby Roode TNA iMPACT! results, November 2005 TNA Slammiversary Scott D'Amore TNA No Surrender TNA Turning Point Planet Jarrett Eddie Guerrero TNA 2005 Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament Petey Williams TNA Hard Justice NWo Team Canada (professional wrestling) TNA Destination X 3Live Kru Scott Levy Richard Rood Jeff Hardy Professional wrestling match types TNA Final Resolution Jerry Lynn Frankie Kazarian Chris Benoit Monty Sopp Joe Seanoa David Cash TNA Victory Road The Great American Bash Tracy Brookshaw Chris Jericho Kurt Angle Shawn Michaels Terry Gerin Professional wrestling holds TNA 2005 Super X Cup Tournament Phil Brooks Paul Levesque Extreme Championship Wrestling Adam Copeland Matt Hardy Professional wrestling slang Border City Wrestling Virgil Runnels III David Bautista World Wrestling Entertainment Chris Sabin Glen Jacobs Dudley Boyz Chris Harris (wrestler) The Rock (entertainer) TNA Genesis Page Falkenberg Sean Waltman Jeff Jarrett Ric Flair Mark Calaway Pat Kenney Jimmy Hart Alastair Ralphs James Storm Ultimate X match TNA Against All Odds Leon White Eric Bischoff Chris Candito Bret Hart Paul Wight Terry Brunk Andy Douglas (wrestler) Scott Hall Kevin Nash Daniel Covell National Wrestling Alliance Roderick Strong Professional wrestling Brandon Silvestry Amy Dumas Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers John Layfield Devon Hughes Vince McMahon WWE RAW Survivor Series
