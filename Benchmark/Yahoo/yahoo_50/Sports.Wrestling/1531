a question for tna haters why do you hate it so i know that they use a lot of former wwe superstars and have some gimmicky matches but the wrestling there is quite good many times it can be more watchable than wwe is it that you have another legitimate reason for hating tna or is it that you just don't want to give it a chance because wwe is all you know don west is horrible i'm not a tna hater but i'll answer i think that a lot people give tna a chance just not a good one they watch it expecting it to be horrible they pick and look for reasons to not like it and then they claim to have given it a fair chance when in reality they gave it basically no chance at all and then they show up on y answers saying i tried tna once and i didn't like it blah blah blah and they give good reasons and then act like wwe is still better tna has its faults but it will never be worse than the wwe Matt Hardy Mark Calaway Roddy Piper Bret Hart Professional wrestling NWo TNA iMPACT!
