is this true or not about most wrestling fans i have been noticing alot lately when someone has a question about the wwe someone comes in and says wwe sucks or when someone has a question about tna someone comes in alot of people come in and say tna sucks it is pathetic that most fans cannot respect all the wrestling promotions that are on televison if you do not like one promotion so what keep it to yourself most people on here are not jamming it down your through if you are a true wrestling fan you like all wrestling matches from tna to wwe to roh to njpw to windy city wrestling to uwa so my question is can most wrestling fans respect wrestling like myself or are they going to continue like they have been and bash every brand correction throat thank you people need to understand that no one cares if you think tna or wwe sucks i watch all wrestling that comes on tv because i don't care who's in the ring i love the sport more people should realize they are not true wrestling fans if they only watch john cena and refuse to see anything else Professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling John Cena Eddie Guerrero Bret Hart Professional wrestling Matt Hardy Carly Colon National Wrestling Alliance Kurt Angle World Wrestling Entertainment Tag team WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
