my month baby girl never laughs or looks at people in the face is that normal she does smile all the time though i am used to boys i have three sons but they never acted this way she just never laughs or looks at me in the eyes i am a little concerned mabe it is just her personality i don't know i know she can hear and she can see but she has not laughed once since birth she may not know how to laugh yet most babies learn how to laugh at around months she could just be a little behind in developing laughter i wouldn't be too concerned and as far as the eye contact thing goes not all babies make eye contact could be a shyness issue i know shy people tend to shy away from making eye contact maybe she is shy she is probably just a shy slow verbal developer i think she'll turn out to be perfectly fine however you could always take her to her pediatrician for the reassurance blindness or deafness could be an issue but i doubt it a lot of people are saying autism autistic children don't make eye contact show emotion or talk until they receive proper therapy that is however your baby is too young to be diagnosed with autism that is usually diagnosed in a child's toddler years doctors usually don't know before then you did say though that your child smiles that's showing emotion so you could probably rule out autism now so yeah could be deaf if she responds to your voice then she is not deaf could be blind if you put a toy in front of her and she reaches for it then she is not blind could be shy someone said babies that young are not shy but they most certainly can be and that's probably all that is wrong with your precious cherub Autism Autism rights movement Social rule Asperger syndrome Autistic community Ethical challenges to autism treatment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hearing impairment Autism epidemic Hall & Oates Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Neurodiversity Joke Autistic culture Teletubbies Shaggy dog story Gifted Dyslexia Childbirth Stuttering Human sexual behavior Daredevil The Ashlee Simpson Show Abortion debate Deaf culture Bernard Rimland Autistic spectrum Shyness Autistic savant Drama Eye contact Theodicy Sharon Tate Pervasive developmental disorder Political correctness Traumatic incident reduction Body language Rugrats Friends Terri Schiavo Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum She Loves You Facilitated communication Sensory Integration Dysfunction The Flintstones EastEnders Aphasia Slow Train Coming Super Mario 128 Little Britain Time Out of Mind Pregnancy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Thimerosal Laughter Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Donald Rumsfeld Book of Isaiah Empire Burlesque Rain Man Eugenics Helen Keller Cochlear implant Daryl Hall American Sign Language Pedophilia Cephalic disorder Kodocha Hip hop collaborations Spidey Super Stories The Beach Boys AFI 100 Years series Neighbours Rais massacre Domestic violence Autistic enterocolitis Plame affair Cliff Richard Boom Town (Doctor Who) Transsexuality Glen Jacobs Good Morning, Vietnam Sant Thakar Singh Father's Day (Doctor Who) Prostate cancer Marilyn Monroe American Psycho I Am Furious Yellow Andrew Dice Clay Theory of mind Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rush Limbaugh
