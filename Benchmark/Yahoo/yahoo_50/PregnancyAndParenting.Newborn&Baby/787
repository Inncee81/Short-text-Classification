changing pediatricians would you i am stuck my husband wants to keep our pediatrician but i do not why we always have more than one hour to wait on thursday we went for our well visit and the ped wasn't there yet we had the first appt at and she didn't see our baby until by then our baby was hungry it was past lunch for her and tired so i nursed her and the ped walked in and made a face like ohhh kkk annoyed i was covered but our baby was hungry and we had been waiting for hours our waits are always long if she were seeing another patient i would understand but she's not i think she is late because she is late getting to work she is the only doctor and runs her own practice she doesn't support breastfeeding at first it didn't bother me but now it does at our baby's first visit she handed us cans of formula and i never used them i was annoyed my husband likes her because she is laid back but i am fed up would you switch how do you switch peds our son was diagnosed with autism and her response autism is highly over diagnosed we had asked for a referral for years and didn't get one we finally went for a psych consult when our son was in kinder to see what was wrong and he was diagnosed around her but not with her help i am frustrated that he had all the signs and yet she refused to see them he has never ever uttered a word in her presence ever our baby just turned one and her response to nursing cut her off at the tap now i plan to nurse until she is months old i am a teacher and bring home every single germ disease known to man including whooping cough last year bronchitis etc our baby never got it do in part to her breastfeeding i don't believe in cutting them off not for the baby's comfort and not for mine either we wait at every appointment each time once was as long as hours actually eharra we spoke many times about the autism many she told us we were new parents and just worried too much he is now and has no fine motor control cannot tie his shoes or ride a bike he recieves ot pt speech socialization groups etc likewise i don't care what other people say about the breastfeeding do you breastfeed how would you know i know my year old has been sick once and has never had an ear infection she also has words and is ahead of herself in all areas spoiled child i think not we have discussed these issues with her her response i am the doctor you are not my husband is annoyed but doesn't want to switch as he doesn't want to hurt her feelings i could care less at this point ok before i address any of your specific concerns let me ask you this if this were a gardener who showed up late ignored what you said and generally didn't do what you thought was a good job would you put up with it or would you fire them if you ran a business and the accountant was always an hour late would you fire them if you went to your doctor and they gave you free samples of girl guide cookies or worse prozac or some other drug what would you think your health and your children's health is the most important thing and you shouldn't put up with a service provider who doesn't provide you with the level of service you desire handing out formula is one thing it is despicable and disgusting doctors should not be promoting any products at all ever but they always do but to not even be comfortable seeing breastfeeding you shouldn't be a pediatrician most breastfeeding babies use breastfeeding for comfort you are going to see breastfeeding during and after shots and any other upsetting procedure also autism treatments should always be started as soon as possible she looses nothing by giving you the referral you ask for and that fact that she still doesn't seem to believe not only you but other doctor s that just wouldn't sit well with me of course you should continue breastfeeding if i thought it would make any difference i would say you should shove the american academy of family physicians see below breastfeeding position paper in her face and the admittedly less well written american academy of pediatrics statement assuming you are american she should be a part of the aap but of course she doesn't have to listen to them sigh trust me you won't hurt her feelings she doesn't care about you and she won't notice that you are gone find a pediatrician that will work for you not against you and do it now before you end up with a situation that gets worse because she ignores it Autism Shaggy dog story Asperger syndrome Medicine Childbirth Prostate cancer Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Theory of conduct Pediatrics Autism rights movement Milton H.
