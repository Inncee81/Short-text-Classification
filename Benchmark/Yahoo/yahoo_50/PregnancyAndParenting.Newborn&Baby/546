what do you think about bottle propping just wondering what you parents out there think about when people prop baby's bottles did you do it did you like doing it does it hurt the baby i do not prop bottles either just wondering what other people think about it and why some are against it i don't think it's that big of a deal my neice is months old and had a proped bottle since day one she's just fine i have beautiful boys my eldest is and my youngest is months with my first son i didnt start propping his bottle till he was about months old and i never had a problem i have been propping my youngests bottle since he was about weeks old propping bottles can cause ear infections because the milk can settle in their ears apparently but to this day i have never had any problem they baby will be fine as long as you check on them regularly and dont just leave them if you are using normal teats also you need to make sure you dont lay them on the same side all the time swap sides always my youngest always wants to be held due to being picked up constantly so now i am trying to minimise the amount of time i spend holding him i still play him all the time and sit with him and talk to him etc so i am not neglecting him or anything like that everyone needs to remember that babies are nose breathers so there is no need to worry about a bottle restricting their breathing and also if you are worried about choking there are non drip teats available for newborn babies to mths i use them all the time with my youngest and they are great they also have little dimples around them to massage the gums they are good because the baby wont have any milk running into their mouth unless they actually suck properly but everyone is entitled to their own opinion Breastfeeding Childbirth Social rule Dairy Milk Baby bottle Bong Carburetor Diving Teat Urinary incontinence Red Hot Chili Peppers Elephant Kodocha Professional wrestling holds Poker jargon Fiddler on the Roof Infantilism Cruising (maritime) Infant formula Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hearing impairment Code: Lyoko Atomic Kitten Cliff Richard Frankie Laine Champagne (beverage) Cat Jon Secada Koala Comanche Piccolo Junior Saga Pacifier Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kangaroo B-47 Stratojet Ben Johnson (athlete) Guinea pig 2005 English cricket season Macbeth Kender Bottle Yoko Ono Mississippi John Hurt Massage Gag (BDSM) Baby Blues Coffee Rugby union positions Joke She Loves You Fancy rat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Recurring South Park characters Halitosis Sin City Rugby league positions Vampire Premature birth Shaggy dog story Generation Y 1957 World Series Little Britain Hypoglycemia Britney Spears Happy Tree Friends Domestic rabbit Muslim ibn Aqeel Theory of conduct Paige Matthews Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Charles Goodyear FoxTrot Relative clause Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Congenital disorder Fecal incontinence The Catcher in the Rye Domestic goat The Shining (film) First aid Swimming Father's Day (Doctor Who) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Insomnia Singlish Dog Charles Darwin's illness Platypus Wine making Pregnancy The Super Milk-chan Show Spice Girls John Frusciante 2003 California recall Anger management Marilyn Monroe
