bottle warmer overheating i have a first year's bottle warmer it was working perfectly until it started to heat up the milk too much i keep reducing the amount of water i put in before i start it but it seems nuts that it is still overheating i don't think there is anything wrong with the unit as it still works but it is just so unpredictable i also notice lots of residue looks like calcium like in a coffee maker and want to know if anyone has tried to clean theirs with anything i have tried water with a papertowel but nothing comes off i have the same warmer and it is inconsistent i also noticed the same residue i just used hot water and a little soap and got it off it comes off easiest if you wipe it right after you just used it too Coffee Chocolate Dairy Milk Soap Bong Welding Water purification Dry cleaning Baby bottle Hyperthermia Thermal power station Water Soldering Engine cooling Calcium Wine Violin Energy development Charcoal Sewage treatment Bottle Sulfuric acid Carbon dioxide Hard water Ice cream Sugar Drink Soy milk Brewery Sugar beet Organic food Public domain Soybean Sento Tea Disinfection Bread Carburetor Incineration Entropy Renewable energy Coca-Cola Espresso Insulin Fire fighting Dishwasher Bass guitar Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Dietary fiber Protein Menstrual cup Car washing techniques Wok Tooth Portable stove Biodiesel Urticaria Cruising (maritime) Nuclear fallout E85 Molotov cocktail Turbocharger Breastfeeding Thermoregulation Indianapolis 500 Aluminium Red Hot Chili Peppers Randomness Social rule Mattress Hydrogen economy Microwave oven Tattoo Dishwashing Espresso machine Glossary of firefighting terms Internal ballistics Turkish coffee Kitchen Maple syrup Diving Cider Little Britain Food preservation Rum Incandescent light bulb Plastic Alcoholic beverage Daylight saving time Sodium Gas metal arc welding Hamster Lava lamp Heat Diving suit Instant coffee Temperature Pepsi-Cola
