at what age is best to circumcised a baby hi i just found out that i am having a baby boy and i was wondering what is the best age to circumcised him and how much would it be the younger the better i know they will circumcise up to weeks my dr anyway my oldest went into the nicu at birth they didn't want to circumcise him because all the testing they were doing they didn't want to add to it he came home at day and then the dr said he'd circumcise at his week check up being my first i didn't think anything of it it was horrific after it was done he had the shakes and was sweating he'd fall asleep for a few minutes and then scream fall asleep and scream and it was like this for about hours after that it got better but for me it was horrible and i just cried i told my husband if we ever had another son it would be done within days or not at all son number came along and had jaundice so they didn't circumcise him in the hospital he was done on day and didn't even scream it's like it didn't phase him so i would say have it done in the hospital or within the first days after birth do not let the dr wait until his week appointment i think it cost between to for the procedure Circumcision Medical analysis of circumcision Premature birth Breastfeeding Rais massacre Foreskin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Shining (film) History of male circumcision Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obstetrics Shaggy dog story Neonatal intensive care unit EastEnders Circumcision advocacy Jaundice Prank flash Childbirth The Jazz Singer Penis Brit milah Infant StarCraft: Hybrid Genital integrity Prostate cancer The Amber Spyglass Female genital cutting Roswell UFO incident AIDS The Family from One End Street Jam (TV series) Bat Boy Miss Saigon Cervical cancer The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Inside El (god) Darth Vader Brigadoon Babe Carey Hikikomori Gemini 9A Maria Korp Soap opera The Empty Child John F.
