going back to work questions input appreciated i have a darling month old daughter and due to financial pressure might have to return to work earlier than the year i was originally planning on like in the next month or so i don't want to pressure my family by having them look after her days a week so was thinking of sending her to child care or days a week and having my mum look after her the other days what should i look for in a child care how do i know they are going to look after my baby especially since she can't talk and tell me if anything is wrong did you leave your baby in childcare so young if so how did it go how did you cope based on personal experience what is the cost of good childcare a rough daily rate thanks in advance i know it is hard to leave your baby for the day but it makes it a lot easier if you know she is in the right hands the best infant care is designed to allow babies to discover their worlds naturally this means that you should see caregivers getting down on the floor with the babies but also allowing them tummy time and floor time while supervised when you go on visits ask not only the directors but the teachers about their philosophy if they are well educated and experienced they will have a more sophisticated answer than keeping the kids safe while they have fun watch out for daycares with too many swings bouncy seats and exersaucers while the children enjoy them if they have one for every baby they probably aren't getting held played with enough excellent childcares also have certified teachers even in their infant rooms also talk to parents who have sent their children there or are sending their children there i don't have children personally but i did go to school for early childhood education and i now am an infant teacher something to make things easier make sure your daughter is willing to drink out of a bottle whatever your preference for what she drinks is fine but one of the hardest things for infant teachers is when babies are only breastfed and don't know how to drink from bottles childcares' costs depend mostly on the area you live in i have worked in places that are a couple hundred a month week and even day in the end if you aren't comfortable leaving your baby there and you constantly worry that the caregivers aren't doing enough for her then it isn't the right place for you you should feel comfortable calling dropping by and visiting the room good luck and i hope this helps you Breastfeeding Infantilism Social rule Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Childbirth Day care Adoption Theory of conduct Fertility awareness Pitaten EastEnders Abortion debate Transsexuality Kodocha Little Britain Childcare Child Care Bears Infant formula Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pregnancy Knots Landing Floppy disk Philosophical skepticism Unemployment Friends The Death Gate Cycle Parachuting The Catcher in the Rye Fathers' rights Urinary incontinence Abortion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Parenting Attachment parenting Baby bottle Aerial (dance move) Full House Socrates Sudden infant death syndrome Kender Richard Feynman Shaggy dog story Paragliding Jon Secada Theodicy Melanie Wilkes Alcoholics Anonymous Fast bowling Early childhood education Education Phoebe Halliwell Postpartum depression Elimination communication Irish dance Sharon Tate Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Charmed The Adventures of Pete & Pete Extreme Programming Ethics The Fast Show Fecal incontinence Equine conformation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Giver Sant Thakar Singh Domestic rabbit Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Autism Sesame Street Child sexuality Children of God Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Karen Horney Transactional analysis Bouncy techno The Apprentice 2 Infant Teenage pregnancy Kibbutz Mattress Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist RuneScape quests Laura Schlessinger Champagne (beverage) Peter Singer Baby transport Strap-on dildo Jean-Jacques Rousseau Education in the People's Republic of China God Emperor of Dune The Star Wars Holiday Special Hormone replacement therapy (trans)
