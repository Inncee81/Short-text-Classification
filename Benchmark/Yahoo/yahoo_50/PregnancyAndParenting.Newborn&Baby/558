my month old daughter is breastfeeding every hours or less during the night what can i do to get some more sleep i was thinking that maybe my milk is not enough for her i tried to give her a bottle with formula milk with a plasmon buisciut for infants but she slept only for hours and a half before she woke up for another feed any suggestions i am with her all day as i am not currently working and during the day she feeds every hours i dont think its a growth spurt as this has been going on for more than a week now she might be having a growth spurt how often do you feed her during the day is she eating every couple hours as well if she's eating around the clock that's usually the sign of a growth spurt where she nurses more to increase your milk supply she will go back to a more reasonable pattern soon are you away from her during the day she might also be a reverse cycler where since she's not getting enough time with you during the day she nurses more at night to encourage her to sleep through the night make sure she's eating every hours during the day have a consistent bedtime routine ex a bath a lotion massage a song and place her to sleep when she's drowsy at her age she's way more aware of her world if you put her to sleep by nursing and then put her down she'll wake up and still expect to be nursing think about waking up and your pillow isn't there it's disorientating you can diagnose this because she'll wake up in multiples of minutes from the time she fell asleep i recommend the ferber book how to solve your child's sleep problem because it gives you the science behind sleeping if you understand why she's waking up you'll have a better plan for getting her to sleep edit ok it's definitely that she's more aware of her surroundings and is waking up because the circumstances of when she went to sleep aren't the same it's the not the breastfeeding it's the sleep training i highly recommend the ferber book i'm linking some info below that gives an outline you don't have to follow his plan exactly but he gives you some good coping tips Breastfeeding Sleep Fertility awareness Narcolepsy Childbirth Urinary incontinence Milk Insomnia Infant Hypoglycemia Cat Daylight saving time Infant formula Breast First aid The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dream Puberty Folic acid Dairy Co-sleeping Clinical depression Sudden infant death syndrome Social rule Apollo 8 Sleep disorder Terri Schiavo Delayed sleep phase syndrome Siesta Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fecal incontinence Diazepam Combat stress reaction Meditation Guinea pig Light pollution Massage Protein-energy malnutrition Traumatic brain injury Autism Breast cancer Prostate cancer Hypnosis The Time Machine Time A Day in the Life Cancer Industrial Revolution Whale Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Knots Landing Nipple piercing Chronic fatigue syndrome Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Rule of St Benedict Breast milk Shaggy dog story Mathematician Odyssey Glycogen storage disease type I Tooth Nestl__ boycott Kurt Cobain Human height Bottlenose Dolphin Cannabis (drug) Sleeping Murder Hera Stroke Garfield Dialysis Abortion Bedwetting Child sexuality Atkins Nutritional Approach Saturday Night Live Hansel und Gretel The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie John the Baptist Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Amber Spyglass International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye A Course In Miracles Sigmund Freud Hormone replacement therapy (trans)
