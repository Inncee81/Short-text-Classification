new baby what should i splurge on my nephew was born a few days ago and he's so gorgeous i'm wanting to buy him some really special keepsake from his only auntie any suggestions i've been leaning towards an engraved silver spoon from tiffany's but thought maybe someone out here could suggest something interesting i'm thinking of a keepsake a stroller is nice but he already has three and it's not something that he'll be able to have when he's older or be able to show his kids thanks for the suggestion of the handmade wooden horse i don't think it's silly at all i've already found quite a few sites that not only do the horses but other animals as well i would have never thought of this so thanks so much for the wonderful idea this might sound silly but when i was born my aunt had a rocking horse made just for me she had them engrave my name on it underneath along with my birthdate i loved that thing dearly as a young child it now sits in my son's room waiting for him get big enough to use it Shaggy dog story AFI 100 Years series EastEnders The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jon Secada Birthday Humphrey Bogart Salad Fingers Care Bears The McGuire Sisters Cliff Richard The Family from One End Street Monty Python The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Knots Landing Mickey Mouse The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Rugrats Mama's Family Indian English I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Episodes of Lost (Season 1) David Hume Jam (TV series) Time Out of Mind Baby transport They Might Be Giants Situation comedy Blood on the Tracks Pet Sounds SpongeBob SquarePants The Chronicles of Narnia Sharon Tate On Her Majesty's Secret Service Rod Stewart George Harrison My Little Pony Biff Tannen Treehouse of Horror V Tiny Toon Adventures One-hit wonder Billy the Kid It's All Gone Pete Tong Futurama (TV series - season 5) Milton H.
