how much do you think a baby should weigh at weeks if they weighed lbs oz when they were born my son is weeks old and he eats alot the doctor told me not to feed him more than oz at at a time but he's not satisfied with that he's so sweet when he's not hungry but lately that's not very often i know it's hunger and not a diaper or being bored nothing satisfies him except food he won't take his pacifier or anything my dad watched him tonight and he ate oz of milk and oz of water which the doctor told me to give him and that finally satisfied him that's alot to eat in a hour time period i don't want to try cereal so please don't tell me it will help fill him up cereal too young can mess up their stomach because they can't digest it completely so i don't know if i should only feed him the oz which seems like i'm starving him but i don't want to overfeed him also he's not overweight the doctor said he's not gaining as much weight as he should he weighs lbs oz at almost months so he's not even gained pounds since he was born i am just looking at my son's baby book he was lbs when he was born and lbs oz at weeks my doctor always said just feed him when he is hungry the baby knows better then we do i think bigger babies don't always gain as much because they already start with some weight yes there are one or two times when he over ate and threw up but for the most part he knows i would say just feed him when he wants it that is a lot to eat in hours but is that every hours or that one time my son goes through spurts when he eats a lot and then slows down for a day or two there were days when i feell like i just sat around feeding him all day one bottle after another without any break it does slow down he is now months and about lbs he eats solids two times a day and has about oz bottles and usually one smaller one good luck Breastfeeding Obesity Garfield Binge eating disorder Milk Dieting Sea-Monkey Adjustable gastric band Elephant Ben Johnson (athlete) Stomach cancer Social rule Humphrey Bogart Fasting Atkins Nutritional Approach Blue Whale Piccolo Junior Saga Fecal incontinence Little Britain Pound Anorexia nervosa Kodocha Gastroparesis Urinary incontinence Hamster Coeliac disease Guinea pig Terri Schiavo Childbirth Foie gras Domestic rabbit Diarrhea Breakfast Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Contender (television series) Mixed martial arts Domestic goat Hunger Shen Gong Wu Homer Simpson Bread Hansel und Gretel Paragliding Drawn Together Kangaroo Infant The Amazing Race Great White Shark Pregnancy Shaggy dog story Fugu Chocolate The Apprentice 2 Ron and Fez Koala Albatross Cheese Infant formula Giant Panda Little Shop of Horrors Weight Capercaillie Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma David Blaine Fancy rat Brown Bear Tooth Singlish Dairy Breakfast cereal Banana Kosher foods Pizza Chinese New Year Cattle Food The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II Kitten Make money fast Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
