my month old rolled off our bed what's going to happen some history i'm an idiot i walked away to go pee and her big sister was on the bed with her and seconds later i hear a thud and then screaming i can't believe i left a yr old to watch a mo old it happened about hours ago and she seems fine but anyone else experienced it was about feet to the ground now dont you dare feel bad this happened to me a lot with my two kids my oldest son was so jealous of my daughter when she was born and he was five every single time i had him watch her for a second or two she ended up getting hurt including falling off the bed not once but twice she is fine even though we never saw the doctor but my son sure got his butt reamed if you ever need another minute to pee take the baby and put her in her car seat and put that in front of the open bathroom door i know you will miss your privacy some but with your other child already around for four years old i bet you havent seen much of that in a while anyways but this way you can keep an eye on her while you 'go' just in case it takes more than a second or two you can also make a bed out of a bunch of quilts on the floor of your bedroom or whatever room is closest to the bathroom and leave her there only if it's safe from animals and such that way if she happens to roll over she doesnt fall anywhere meanwhile if you have any questions or concerns please go to this website run by the dr spock himself this book was my bible when my kids were young and so far my yr old son my yr old daughter and my year old younger son are just fine http www drspock com this guy knows stuff he used to be a doctor for real so stop worrying if your baby is not showing any signs of a concussion by now she should be perfectly fine just dont use your big sister as a babysitter anymore until she knows what's right and what's not acceptable in baby watching and maybe deals with a little jealousy herself totally normal for her age btw good luck and get some rest you are not a bad mom Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) The Fairly OddParents EastEnders What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
