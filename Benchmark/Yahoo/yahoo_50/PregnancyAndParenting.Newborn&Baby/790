why does this happen to the baby i am sitting for well the problem is he is pooping and it keeps coming out of his diaper is it his diet cuz he is only eating breastmilk or is it how much he eats or is it something else what can i do to prevent this from happening again it already happened twice today while i was waching him it's definately the diaper not fitting right either due to size or brand make sure the diaper fits well but not tightly around his legs other then that there isn't much you can do to prevent it rinse out his clothes with cold water and squeeze out the water put it in a plastic bag so mom can wash them and not end up with stains the runny poop is normal with breastfed babies and there is nothing you can or should do to change this Diaper Breastfeeding Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Infantilism Dairy Kimberly-Clark Corporation Comanche Menstrual cup Milk Procter & Gamble Masturbation Dialysis Sento Condom Laundry detergent Jaundice Parenting Car washing techniques Tofu Infant Kimi Finster Tooth enamel Egg (food) Upholstery Bong Genericized trademark Diving suit Dieting Mudvayne Demographics Dishwasher Saturday Night Live commercial Sailing Textile manufacturing Common cold Spina bifida Chair Strap-on dildo Cheese Emergency preparedness Phase (matter) Dry cleaning Shotgun Cryptosporidium Professional wrestling holds Mattress Deck (ship) Soap Jon Secada Nocturnal emission The dozens Jute Domestic rabbit Zinc Teletubbies Hard water Jackass: The Movie Characters in the Smurfs Wound Gram staining Dishwashing Childbirth Macbeth Washing machine Japanese tea ceremony Cytomegalovirus The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Plastic Frog Hamster Geography of Bolivia Shoe Nipple piercing Laundry Changeroom Coeliac disease Tea Chopsticks Dil Pickles Bedbug Undergarment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hand washing Hygiene Elimination communication Toilet humour Bonus Stage Leatherback Sea Turtle Pitaten Fancy rat Fertility awareness Drill bit Domestic water system Goldfish Bread Breech birth Rebreather
