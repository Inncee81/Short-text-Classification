leaky boobs wake baby to feed my baby is days old and my boobs leak and get engorged quite a bit i breastfeed her about times per day but i was wondering if it is a bad move to wake her up to feed when i am leaking and in pain i use nursing pads but when i am engorged and she is asleep i wonder if it would be a bad idea to wake her up to feed her or if i should just let her sleep and feed her when she wakes up i don't want to get out my breast pump because i don't want to be dry for her and it is kindof a pain to get out and use it all the time you should also think about pumping and storing your breastmilk this will be a tremendous help for you when you have things to do perhaps your partner can feed her instead once in a while etc it is a misconception that you will be 'dried up' after pumping yes it might take an hour or so to be back to your normal milk levels but your body makes enough milk for what is being consumed whether its by your baby or by your pump your milk is liquid gold so i understand your concern if your boobs are very painful you might want to just try to express some milk in the shower make sure you look out for any masses or balls in your breasts massage them out so you don't get any blocked ducts or mastitis like i did its awful if you are in serious pain you could think about taking a regular tylenol to help ease the pain but things should really start to regulate themselves by weeks i know it sounds like ages away but if you can stick it out until then you're giving your baby the best start and it will only get easier for you if not at least you tried as for waking her really try not to wake her up she will get up when she's hungry usually every hours my son went hours one day and i freaked out no only was i in pain but i thought something was wrong with him they are fine and will let you know when they need more fuel you just need to figure out the best system to deal with all this milk in the meantime do your best to sleep i know its nearly impossible with your boobs feeling the way they do but it will pass soon enough good luck to you Breast Urinary incontinence Childbirth Dairy Thermal power station Fecal incontinence Fertility awareness Breast pump Milton H.
