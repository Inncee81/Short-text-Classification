can my baby sit in the passenger seat in my miata i wanna take my month old baby to another city but i drive a miata which is a seater convertible i'm thinking if she can sit in the passenger seat without a baby car seat and do you guys think i should leave the convertible top down or up put the car seat in the front seat i don't think you can get a ticket for babies in the front of a seater car a month old can barely hold up their head so what makes you think you can put him her in the seat with no car seat i think you should keep the top up because to much wind takes away their breath and makes it hard for them to breathe Mazda Miata Sports car Car safety Pontiac Fiero Baby transport Indianapolis 500 Air New Zealand Rear wheel drive Jon Secada Airbag Car body style Emergency brake Dodge Neon Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling holds Seat belt Car handling Mazda 323 Time Out of Mind Jaguar E-type Chevrolet Corvair Paul Is Dead Chair U2 (band) Mazda RX-7 Seat belt legislation Martin Brundle Hall & Oates John F.
