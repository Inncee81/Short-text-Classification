sitting in back of car with newborn i have a newborn baby she is a week old and i don't go anywhere with her unless someone is in the back seat with her to make sure she is okay but my husband is going back to work and i will be alone during the days and when is it okay for her to be by herself in the backseat while i'm driving first baby thanks for all the help first your concern shows you are a good mommy already i was terrified to have my babies out of sight all three of them whether in the car or the house with my first i drug the bassinet around with me from room to room i got better with time though try a very short trip even if it means driving to your next door neighbor's house if that is how short it has to be for you to feel comfortable now get out and check baby has her head fallen over mine would slump their heads even with the positioners in if so you can roll a towel and tuck it under the carseat close to the back of the seat it is strapped into nurse at the hospital told me this different nurses at different hospitals so it's got to be okay if not and if baby seems fine try a slightly longer trip gradually you will become comfortable with having baby out of veiw and make longer trips also this is good because if there actually is any problem say with the carseat whatever it's better to find out withint two minutes than ten as for the backseat mirrors if you can get them positioned right they can be great for me they were mostly a pain i had to adjust one and then the other by myself guess and test fashion and then one would fall off going down the road besides which they are one more thing to pay attention to besides the road every single distraction however tiny raises the risk of an accident if you decide to try them just do be careful you're carrying precious cargo enjoy your precious baby they grow up fast and the baby you see today will be a new person tomorrow Childbirth Prostate cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Premature birth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Equine conformation Traumatic brain injury Hypoglycemia Car safety Recumbent bicycle Passenger car Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Strap-on dildo Breech birth One Tree Hill (TV series) Sin City Neighbours Obstetrics T'Pol Sento Aerial (dance move) Car handling STS-61 Menstrual cup Infantilism The Inside Medicine Casualty lifting The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) Humphrey Bogart Jam (TV series) About a Boy Good Times Crash test dummy Triage Upholstery Milton H.
