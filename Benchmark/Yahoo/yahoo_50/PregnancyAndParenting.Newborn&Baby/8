need some help my week old is constipated he is pooping hard balls i called the doctor and he told me to get him a laxative so i did but it kept coming out so i gave up and he started pooping normal again until yesterday he pooped twice with hard balls and i didnt want to give him the laxative so he pooped again today it was a little better but when will this stop what could i do i did have to change the formula so i thought that was the problem but that was a week and a few days ago he is taking enfamil for fussiness and gas could this formula still be a problem i dont want to change the formula because it has been working well i tried the similac sensitive but it didnt work and i looked into the nestle good but there wasnt formula for fussines and gas and second of all my baby coughs everyday but not a whole lot and he has been doin this for a few weeks now is that normal he isnt sick or has a cold or anything like that sorry so long but i need some help thanks everyone hello there it is terriably frustrating when your little one is constipated my husband and i are going through the same problems as you are what form of enfamil are you on if it is the soy version that can be horribly constipating we tried the similac sensative with some luck chalky bowel movements and lots of discomfort with regular similac advance we were happy on similac alimentum but the cost is outrageous enfamil have their version of it called nutrigmen i think i spelled that wrong and that worked pretty good for our little one i have heard that nestle goodstart is a very very good formula it is worth a shot if you are willing to change formulas otherwise you can try dark karo syrup in their bottle i wouldn't suggest prune juice because your little one is so tiny yet my first suggestion would be the enfamil version of the similac alimentum if you can afford it it is a wonderful formula best of luck to you and when in doubt call your pediatrician they are very good about talking to you about any concern you may have Fecal incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga Constipation Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breastfeeding The Contender (television series) Ron Weasley Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind Aloe Fast bowling Social rule Patent medicine Galactic Civilizations Milton H.
