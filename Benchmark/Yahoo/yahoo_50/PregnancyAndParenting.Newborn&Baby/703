i understand babies are natural space invaders are they supposed to be natural slavists too how do i tel my mom that watching my mo sis and playng with her for mins is more than enough im not jealous i got stuff to do i like to play with her when i feel like it not when someone thinks i have to i would like more details like how old are you does your mom also work and why does it bother you to watch her is it because you cant do things you want to do anymore well put yourself in your mothers shoes she is taking care of two children now trying to run a household and make sure you are both healthy she needs and deserves a break every now and then and if you want your mom to do things for you which i'm sure she does plenty for you already help her out too offer to help take care of your little sister and if that bothers you so much offer to do the things she has to do that leaves you watching her like do the dishes for her and let her take care of the baby if you know how and are allowed to cook dinner for her one night you'll get out of baby duty and help her out very much and shell be very appreciative its tough to be a mom and she deserves as much help as she can get from you if you really hate to watch your baby sister then tell your mom and why you hate to do it remember she gave up a lot more than you to take care of you and your sister i personally would consider my son to be selfish and spoiled if he felt this way about helping me take care of his younger sibling s i'm so glad my stepdaughter helps me out now and the baby isn't born yet and i know she'll be a good big sister Kodocha Theory of conduct Baby Blues Friends EastEnders What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
