trapped wind hey all sooooo ok my baby is and a half weeks old and screamin in pain constantly with trapped wind or colic me and my partner have tryed every method of winding her and it doesnt seem to help i cant give her gripe water or infacol because she isnt month old yet does anybody know of anything else i can do serious answers only plz shes in distress thanks in advance xx i used infacol from months but also used this way off soothing the colic and stretching out the tummy muscles not sure if it will make sense so bear with me place baby down on your knee face down and then lift her with your forearm under her cheek assuming she turns her face and your other arm supporting her along her tummy and chest i used to find it easier if i put arm between her legs for support gently rock her from side to side just as you would if you were cradling her on her back you will feel her tummy tightening as the colic takes hold but should find that after a while it will sooth as her muscles are stretching out and getting rid of the trapped wind it feels really uncomfortable and a little clumsy at first but you will soon get used to it my little one used to dribble all down my arm when i did it lovely eh but it worked a dream my neighbour had a really grisly baby with colic one day and i went round and tried this she used the method ever since and couldn't believe how well it worked good luck colic only lasts a few months but it can be a nightmare for you and baby Breastfeeding Professional wrestling holds Care Bears Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Suplex Equine conformation Professional wrestling attacks Cramp Weight training Breaststroke Mattress Casualty lifting Fecal incontinence Piccolo Junior Saga Piledriver (professional wrestling) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bringing It All Back Home Jon Secada Diving Breech birth Shen Gong Wu Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Atomic Kitten Glossary of partner dance terms Childbirth Glossary of ballet terms Strap-on dildo Swingout Carpal tunnel syndrome Horizontal bar Rigging Anatomical terms of location Menstrual cup Social rule Neckbreaker Blood on the Tracks Kurt Cobain Comanche Backstroke Norway national football team Friends Parade (military) Ben Johnson (athlete) Anchor Darth Vader Swimming Hey Jude Punt (boat) Sailing Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Psoriasis Naruto jutsu Textile manufacturing Captain Thunderbolt Paul Levesque Goofy Miss Saigon Tetrapod Alexander Technique B-47 Stratojet Front crawl Tourniquet Jam (TV series) Powerbomb Kurt Angle Butterfly stroke Cliff Richard Condom Eddie Guerrero The McGuire Sisters Prostate cancer AFI 100 Years series Chair Continuation War Fencing Backbreaker Cork City F.C.
