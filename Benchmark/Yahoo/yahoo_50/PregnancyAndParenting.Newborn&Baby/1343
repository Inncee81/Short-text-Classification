my wife is breastfeeding and has cracked nipples that are healing she put neosporin on and forgot to wipe it off before she fed this last round i read that this may promote yeast in the mouth it was a small ammount does anyone have any other info of the effects watch your baby for any unusual signs that the neosporin could have made the baby sick also call your pediatrician and let them know what happened to ease your mind and they would be able to tell you what could happen and side affects as far as the cracked nipples maybe even try letting them dry out and getting some sun on them instead of putting neosporin on them it has to hurt or be uncomfortable washing off the neosporin everytime you breastfeed i had this same problem i watched dozens of videos and read tons of info on how to breastfeed but when i actually tried it for the first time with my week old daughter i thought i knew what i was doing days after she was born my nipples hurt so bad and they were cracked and bleeding i was crying everytime she ate i went and saw a lactation consultant at my daughter's pediatric office i ended up having a bad latch my nipples hurt so bad they recommended that you rub your own milk around your nipple and try to let your nipples get as much air as they can like sleeping at night without a shirt bra they also said sunlight too but i'm not sure how that works because i know you would get in trouble if you just walked around town without a shirt and bra on lol anyways i had been using samples of that purple package for cracked and dry nipples called lasinoh spelling the consultant said still air and your own milk will heal them faster i also got a nipple shield from the consultant it's so great it's like a bandaid for your nipples lol they are clear silicone i think and go right over your nipple and the baby continures to nurse as normal they carry nipple shields at babies r us for they really help tell your wife about the shields it will make nursing more bearable while her nipples heal Nipple piercing Breast Nipple Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cat Infant Mastitis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Prolactin Infant formula Fertility awareness Guinea pig Salad Fingers Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Janet Jackson Stomach cancer Dairy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Catcher in the Rye Body piercing Certified Nursing Assistant Baby bottle Elephant Folic acid The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Urinary incontinence Jam (TV series) Babe Ruth Medical analysis of circumcision Futurama (TV series - season 5) Rais massacre EastEnders Macbeth Michael Jackson Coeliac disease Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy Cartridge (firearms) Social rule Vampire Jon Secada Puberty The Shield Obstetrics Internal ballistics Sydney Riot of 1879 Milton H.
