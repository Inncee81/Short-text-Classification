work and relationships after a baby i have a three month old daughter whom i completely adore i was suppose to be on maternity leave for a year instead it looks like i'll have to return to work in the next month or two due to financial pressure i'm devestated that i have to leave her especially since atleast two days a week she'll have to be in childcare with my mum watching her the other days did you put your baby in childcare and how did the two of you manage i feel so depressed at the thought that other people are going to be the ones to help my daughter experience life we are going to lose our bond and it just kills me inside i also resent hubby like you wouldn't believe because instead of consulting me about money he continued to muddle on until we were in this situation of me having to return to work he didn't try to rebudget anything he just kept believing we would be alright any advice i know you are worried about the bond with your little one but daycare will not compromise that it will make your time together much more special be sure to create routines for just the two of you to have special time together playtime books tubby time tummy time feeding etc as far as your husband i can certainly understand why you are angry you may want to seek couples therapy to talk through the issues and open communication channels with him it's hard enough having a little one intoduced into the relationship making time for each other in addition to mommy time let alone to have such a huge issue between you again you will always be mommy and it won't hurt your bond plus think of all of the great one on one time she will have with your mom my little guy spends hours a day with his godmother whom i have 'hired' to watch him while i work and though i am sad sometimes that it is not me watching him i know that he is getting intensive one on one time with an experienced mom it has not hurt our bond one bit hugs Breastfeeding EastEnders Days of our Lives Knots Landing Day care Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Friends Jean Grey Neighbours Laura Schlessinger About a Boy Postpartum depression Kurt Cobain Kibbutz Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Clinical depression Babe Ruth Marilyn Monroe Yoko Ono Cindy Sheehan Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Borderline personality disorder Social rule Domestic violence Piccolo Junior Saga Fancy Crane Narcissism Teletubbies Milton H.
