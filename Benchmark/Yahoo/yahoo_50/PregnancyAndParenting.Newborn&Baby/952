should i be doing anything to encourage my baby he started rolling over at about months old he did it a few times and he has not been doing it this past weeks he gets to a certain point and can't get over the shoulder and just stops i have helped him a few times in hopes that he will get back on track but he still isn't trying on his own a friend told me not to worry maybe he doesn't want to right now any advice my son did exactly the same thing he learned to roll over early and then seemed to forget just give him lots of tummy time and if you want you can roll him over just to see if he'll do it but he's probably focused on something else at the moment he'll roll again don't worry Kodocha Social rule Shaggy dog story Breastfeeding Friends Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Care Bears Blood on the Tracks Milton H.
