what did you think of the john from cincinatti finale i liked this show in the beginning but it started to drag i stuck it out for the season but i think i'm over it thoughts amen my sentiments exactly the first couple of shows i was like ok i'll take the ride by the middle of the season it really started to get messed up and the last episodes the it went completely off the the rails it is really sad when bad things happen to good actors as i was watching tonight i thought what a cast of really good actors and this guy milch has completely wasted a perfect opportunity for a great show and he trashed deadwood to do it that makes it even worse i don't know if they have renewed this show or not i hope not i hope they tell david milch to bring deadwood back NYPD Blue Poker jargon Friends David Milch The Ashlee Simpson Show 2000 Australian Grand Prix Deadwood (television) 1957 World Series Megan Griffin Weekend Update (sketch) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Major League Baseball television contracts Shaggy dog story War of the Worlds (television) Knots Landing Pitaten Humphrey Bogart 2004 Republican National Convention The Apprentice 3 Family Guy Futurama (TV series - season 2) Time Out of Mind Married... with Children History of SNL:1980-1985 Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Futurama (TV series - season 5) West Bromwich Albion F.C.
