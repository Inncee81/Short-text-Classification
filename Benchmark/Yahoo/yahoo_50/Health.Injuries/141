did i break my toe on monday night me some friends were doing a bit of running in a wooded area and i stumbled over a log or something it didnt bother me that much after that it did feel kinda numb or like it was bleeding which it wasnt and it did get puffy the next day and ever since then it looks like it's bruised and i can't bend it if i barely nudge it on anything it will hurt for a little while it's the toe next to the big one on my right foot do you think i broke it or is it just bruised it doesnt hurt really bad so i havent gone in to the dr what do you think you should cool your toe and keep it elevated but you should definitely see a doc i had a similar problem and didn't go and now my toe has a funky red mark that won't go away and still hurts when my dog steps on it only a doc can really tell you what is wrong with it hope you feel better Diving Equine conformation Bruise Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Atomic Kitten Mississippi John Hurt Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Shining (film) 1957 World Series Pump It Up Shaggy dog story Cincinnati Bengals Professional wrestling holds Garfield Spanking Glossary of ballet terms True Crime: Streets of LA Eddie Guerrero Characters in the Smurfs Marilyn Monroe Ron Weasley Goofy Jackass: The Movie The Wall 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blood on the Tracks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Figure skating Evil EastEnders Aerial (dance move) High-heeled shoe The Marshall Mathers LP Slayers St. Louis Cardinals W.I.T.C.H.
