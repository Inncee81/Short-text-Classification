in a car accident now i'm sore should i see a doctor i was in a car that hit another from behind dorks slammed on their brakes for no reason and i was kinda turned and leaned forward now my neck back is all stiff my muscles are sore my shoulder got bruised from the seatbelt should i see a doctor or do you think it's okay i can still move around all tylenol makes it go away i wouldn't be able to take any meds besides that anyways as i'm pregnant also i've never been in such a bad car accident i'm not sure if the injuries can get worse or if they can be kinda hidden or what it's not that bad now but if these things can get worse any advice thanks it could be whiplash really omg that would suck well yeah i'm pregnant i'm just about in my nd trimester but the lap belt was positioned properly not on my stomach at all i've had no indication that anything but my back neck was injured do you really think there could be somthing wrong that could effect the baby now i'm really worried it's always a good idea to get checked out by a doctor if the hit wasn't too hard it's probably just whiplash and some bruising from the seat belt it'll pass in a few days since you're pregnant and can't take too much medication i'd recommend keeping heat on the sore areas and using a topical ointment such as tiger balm to help ease the pain Car safety Equine conformation Seat belt First aid Crash test dummy Diving Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling holds Seat belt legislation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion Traumatic brain injury Weight training Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Fecal incontinence Sin City Eddie Guerrero Pregnancy Neckbreaker Motorcycle Bruise Miscarriage Prostate cancer Knots Landing Airbag EastEnders Spanking Osteoarthritis Whiplash Psoriasis Repetitive strain injury Mark Calaway Chris Amon Paracetamol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) 24 Hours of Le Mans Kurt Angle One Tree Hill (TV series) Aerial (dance move) 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Obstetrics Jackass: The Movie Pneumonia Chronic fatigue syndrome Humphrey Bogart Oral sex Childbirth Chris Benoit Carburetor Professional wrestling attacks Boxing Drowning Breech birth Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Urinary incontinence Theory of conduct Indianapolis 500 Tire Kasparov versus The World Myocardial infarction Professional wrestling slang Sandy Koufax Happy Tree Friends Jam (TV series) Recumbent bicycle Warfarin Babe Ruth Phoebe Halliwell Ernie Irvan LSD Piledriver (professional wrestling) Paul Levesque Medicine Hip fracture Chair Ben Johnson (athlete) Friends Piccolo Junior Saga Brian Close Poker jargon Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind John F.
