sprained ankle yesterday while running in the woods i rolled my ankle on a root i landed on the outside of the ankle and it hurt for about a minute and then my coach camp counselor who was with me told me it was best to keep running in order to keep the blood circulating after hobbling for a few steps i regained a semi normal stride and finished the mile run at a fast pace i iced somewhat and elevated but i had a six hour van ride later that day and mostly my ankle was kept still not really taken care of today i have a day off from running but this morning i woke up with extremely limited range of motion in my ankle i have to walk with my foot turned outward in order to be able to move at all it is as if my achilles tendon is also affected even though only the outer ankle is swollen it is as if my achilles will not bend fully in order to let me walk normally what the heck is wrong with my ankle and when will it get better should i ice it or heat it it's swollen and what kind of coach do you have ice elevate times a day for days wrap with ace bandage for added support and stay off it as much as possible on the third day use a bucket of hot water as hot as you can stand to soak the foot ankle for minutes then rotate the ankle slowly in both direction for about mins or so times daily repeat the above ice elevate immediatly after soaking a mild sprain will take atleast a week or longer if you have an old boot cut the top front off place your foot in place then wrap the bandage securly around all if still painful after days see a doctor for possible tendon tears Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws First aid High-heeled shoe Suplex Battles of Lexington and Concord Skateboarding trick Swingout Dairy Professional wrestling attacks The Dalek Invasion of Earth Fast bowling Hiking Marching band Decompression sickness Massage Horse Diving Osteoarthritis Professional wrestling aerial techniques Horse gait Bruise Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Pain Casualty lifting Achilles' tendon Stairway Prostate cancer Sandy Koufax Kurt Angle Glossary of ballet terms Diving suit Mattress 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Apollo 8 Shaggy dog story Figure skating Seismic retrofit Yosemite National Park Dialysis Climate of the United Kingdom Menstrual cup Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Volleyball Jet engine Textile manufacturing Tendon Bondage (BDSM) Sento Ravi Shastri Professional wrestling slang Snakebite (bite) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bryan Robson Gary Sheffield Paragliding Milton H.
