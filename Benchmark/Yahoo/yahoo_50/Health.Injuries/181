why can't i pop my ears it started weeks ago after i jumped off of a twenty foot bridge into a lake when i hit the water my right ear started to hurt and when i got out i could feel hear a lot of vibrations the next day the pain and the vibration senses went away but when i tried to pop my ears air just came out of my right ear i can't notice any hearing change and the same problem still occurs help you might have torn your eardrum or have an ear infection i would definitely go see a doctor for this one as they have the tool to check the eardrum good luck Diving It's All Gone Pete Tong Ear Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Sound Otitis externa Earwax Sense Pet Sounds Otitis media Traumatic brain injury Ossicles Grommet Barotrauma Billboard Hot 100 Body piercing Cabin pressurization The Beach Boys Snake Crocodilia Proprioception Equine conformation The Contender (television series) Oh My Goddess!
