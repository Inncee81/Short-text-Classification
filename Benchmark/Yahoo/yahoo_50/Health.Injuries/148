possible pulled ligament okay i think i might have pulled a ligament behind my knee of my left leg where i work i lift lbs sometimes up some stairs anywho my knee didn't bother me at work wednesday evening after work i got up from laying on the couch and went to bend my knee the back of it hurt only when i was bending it though i borrowed a knee brace from my friend and wore it to work yesterday i tried to keep as much pressure off my leg as i could when lifting things i took my brace off and it still hurt to bend it so i took the advice of a coworker and bought an ice pack and elevated my leg with ice underneath it all night maybe i shouldn't have done it that long also i bought my own leg brace anyways i wore the brace again today again trying not to put too much pressure on my leg i also tried some icy hot on the back of my knee at break time it doesn't hurt when i walk but when i bend my knee so far it hurts sometimes not each time i bend itthe back of my knee only so does this sound like a pulled ligament it hurts but it's not crying pain more annoying pain than anything i had broken my left thigh bone ten years ago and had a metal plate put in there i was on crutches for about months and it seems like that leg has always been more stiff since then is there anything else i can do i was thinking about seeing a doctor but if it's just a pulled ligament i don't think there's much more they can do i was going to clean a friend's house today but i had it rescheduled for sunday so that i could stay off of my leg for the rest of today and tomorrow sorry for it being so long any advice is appreciated if it bothers you more than a couple more days then you should make an appointment to see a doctor if you can go directly to the orthopedic doc its sorta hard to give you an idea of the problem b c your signs and symptoms dont scream out thing it could be a meniscus tear could be a bakers cyst could be strain to one of the muscles that attach in the back of the knee have a qualified professional examine you to make sure its nothing serious Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Knee Diving Anterior cruciate ligament Carpal tunnel syndrome Professional wrestling throws Shaggy dog story Osteoarthritis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Glossary of climbing terms Tetrapod Professional wrestling attacks Orthopedic surgery Jam (TV series) Babe Ruth Weight training Strap-on dildo Powerbomb Piledriver (professional wrestling) Dog training Figure skating Scoliosis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Iliotibial band syndrome Fecal incontinence Mattress EastEnders Dental brace Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Piccolo Junior Saga Urinary incontinence Breaststroke Hip fracture Drill bit Hal Trosky Knots Landing Scapula Tibia Jackass: The Movie Childbirth Chair The Inside Backstroke Recumbent bicycle Decompression sickness Denis Law Paget's disease of bone Milton H.
