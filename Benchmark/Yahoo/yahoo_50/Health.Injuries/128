i recently got hit at my soccerclass and now i cant open my jaw fully what should i do im only and i cant have tablets any ideas is their a cream i could probably use does bengay work thanx so much don't apply bengay or any other type of cream to your face it's too close to your mouth and can be accidently ingested making you sick if you are unable to open your jaw enough to talk or to eat then you should have your parents take you to the nearest emergency room or urgent care to have it checked out you said you weren't able to have tablets is this b c you can't open you jaw enough to take them if the answer is yes then you need to be seen by a dr asap if your parents aren't readily available then find another adult to take you to the urgent care emergency room you'll need to possibly have xrays done to make sure you didnt seriously injure your jaw for now you can try using warm compresses or a heating pack the type that is like an ice pack that you smash to heat it up apply it wrapped in a towel or something similar do no place directly on your skin for about mins at a time this might help loosen the muscles around your jaw allowing you to open it good luck First aid Gray Wolf Fecal incontinence Equine conformation Dog Professional wrestling throws Sauna Dinosaur Hyperthermia Professional wrestling match types 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Cat Dialysis Methamphetamine Sento Tire Ice cream Psoriasis Massage Triage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Professional wrestling holds Strap-on dildo Horse Ionizing radiation Glossary of firefighting equipment Violin Menstrual cup Paragliding Oral sex Tooth Myocardial infarction Zinc Coffee Customs and etiquette of Japan Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Traumatic brain injury Happy Tree Friends Discus (fish) Dairy Phase (matter) Bong Xenomorph Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Domestic rabbit Avalanche Welding Tetrapod Animal Tea Blood (computer game) Butter The Young Ones (TV series) Kenny McCormick Solar power Comanche Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tyrannosaurus rex Professional wrestling aerial techniques Hearing impairment Milk Social rule Kitchen Diving suit Platypus Shaggy dog story Tooth enamel Trigeminal nerve Spider Vowel Suspension bridge Naruto jutsu Dualism (philosophy of mind) Jet engine Shark Sharon Tate The X-Files (season 1) Consensus decision-making Health insurance Tofu Scuba set Face Manicure Skin Sperm Whale Thermoregulation Diaper Friends Antarctic krill Champagne (beverage) Adoption Crocodilia Cancer Diver rescue Hiberno-English Stem cell What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
