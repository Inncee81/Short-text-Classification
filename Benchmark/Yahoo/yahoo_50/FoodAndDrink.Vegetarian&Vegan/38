i'm going vegan can you help me with what to eat and stuff i don't really like soya products which i no isnt good if you're going vegan help would be much appreciated soy makes up a minuscule portion of the wide variety of vegan protein sources soy is the most common protein found in meat replacements but seitan a soy free protein source made from wheat can be very versatile and take on many flavors and textures when prepared at home then again if you aren't allergic to soy you may end up experimenting and find some very practical uses for some soy products there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm that is great that you want to become vegan my biggest word of advice is to study a balanced vegan diet and learn how to cook prepare everything that you will need to keep yourself satisfied before you start to label yourself as vegan this is important in keeping yourself healthy and working towards a fit body that can redefine vegan stereotypes your journey as vegetarian was just the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this should be due to the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating whey and casein you can then give up sodium stearoyl lactylate and l cysteine when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things
