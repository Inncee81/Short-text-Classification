just woundering dose any one know if a tomato is a fruit or a vegtable i was just woundering and what it is consitered when you eat it a fruit serving or a vegtable serving technically due to the ovaries it is a fruit but for all intents and purposes we tend to consider it a vegetable true fruits are developed from the ovary in the base of the flower and contain the seeds of the plant though cultivated forms may be seedless blueberries raspberries and oranges are true fruits and so are many kinds of nut some plants have a soft part which supports the seeds and is also called a 'fruit' though it is not developed from the ovary the strawberry is an example as far as cooking is concerned some things which are strictly fruits may be called 'vegetables' because they are used in savoury rather than sweet cooking the tomato though technically a fruit is often used as a vegetable and a bean pod is also technically a fruit the term 'vegetable' is more generally used of other edible parts of plants such as cabbage leaves celery stalks and potato tubers which are not strictly the fruit of the plant from which they come occasionally the term 'fruit' may be used to refer to a part of a plant which is not a fruit but which is used in sweet cooking rhubarb for example so a tomato is the fruit of the tomato plant but can be used as a vegetable in cooking Tomato Flowering plant Berry Potato Pie Sweet potato Banana Cuisine of the Southern United States German cuisine Antioxidant Watermelon Pachypodium brevicaule Strawberry Roman eating and drinking Hamster Maize Pancake Soup Peruvian cuisine Pea Sweetcorn Orange (fruit) Bengali cuisine Sauce Carpel Curry Ginkgo Salad Russian cuisine Celery Japanese cuisine Cajun cuisine Common bean Pachypodium baronii Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of the Philippines Bean Jam Cuisine of Singapore Squash (fruit) Jewish cuisine Food preservation Polish cuisine Pollination Food Organic food Legume Pachypodium bicolor Luther Burbank Cuisine of Brazil Almond Basil Veganism Agriculture Prunus Pumpkin Plant Chicken soup Cereal Blueberry Textile manufacturing Perfume Vegetative reproduction Rose Korean cuisine Drupe Chocolate Chili con carne Hot dog Carnivorous plant Cucumber Cuisine of Africa Essential oil Garden Strawberry Morphology of Pachypodium Yam Soul food Chinese cuisine Beet Kiwifruit Olive Coconut Coriander Loganberry Vicia faba Seed
