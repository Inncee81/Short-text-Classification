a question for vegans and others who find eating animals cruel first of all i just want to say i understand in america and other well off countries they produce meat and dairy products in huge commercialized amounts and from this most of the animals are not treated properly is it still wrong if you eat animals that were treated good i've read peta's website and nutritional reasoning as to why we shouldn't consume meat and dairy humans have been eating meat and dairy for hundreds of years so it seems unhealthy to me to suddenly take something away that has been part of our diet for so long you can look around the world and see there are places people live where if they didn't eat fish or meat they would die from starvation in colder climates and extremely hot climates it's nearly impossible to get enough different kinds of non animal foods to survive from not to mention human babies die if fed on a strict vegan diet what would you give the starving people in africa to eat only fruits and veggies i don't think so all kinds of foods can be contaminated you still have to wash off fruits and vegetables just like you would fresh meat in other parts of the country and in history people have eaten plenty of fish and meat and have never been obese it's the current methods of eating them like frying them in oil and loading them with sauces that's making people obese and unhealthy not the actual food in the definition of a vegan you do not consume animal products of any kind i don't know about you guys but a baby not being able to drink it's mothers own milk is what i call starving to death first of all my experience is that different people benefit from different type of diet i for example am native american i find i do very well indeed on fresh meat and vegetables plenty of seafood my people are fishermen and i thrive on lobster and other shellfish such as mussels and clams i consume two or three servings of raw organic dairy products every day of my life these foods have been consumed by the indigenous peoples for hundreds of years as a people we are healthy beautiful and well appointed well formed my husband does really well on fish with a few potatoes and a bit of salad thrown in he has a bad reaction to yeast and dairy products all except yoghurt he's allergic to bananas as i am probably because bananas don't grow in the areas where our people originated northern us canada for me iowa norway and sweden for him our bodies are very different also he is covered all over with a fine soft hair and i am virtually hairless except on my scalp eyebrows and lashes and pubic areas where the hair is very fine and silky although reasonably dense my personal use of the peta initials is as follows people eating tasty animals sorry if that's offensive that's just the way i feel i'm always fascinated about vegetarians and vegans who are in favor of choice a k a aborticide or fetal murder if you prefer i guess it's okay with those particular peta members if people treat humans badly as long as the treatment of animals is humane don't get me wrong i'm all in favor of treating animals ethically i have five cats four neutered males and one spayed female because i don't want unplanned kittens if people got spayed or neutered more often we'd have more ethical treatment of humans and animals because fewer unplanned kittens okay i probably didn't answer all your questions but i hope i was somewhat helpful best wishes to all Animal rights Domestic rabbit Dieting Tofu McDonald's Breakfast Taboo food and drink Cuisine of Brazil Egg (food) Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Denmark Milk Korean cuisine Raw food diet Kosher foods Cuisine of Africa Peruvian cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Dog Cuisine of the Philippines Vegetarianism and religion Pizza Bengali cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach French cuisine Hamburger Nutrition Foodborne illness Soybean Peter Singer Fish and chips Fast food French fries Cuisine of Singapore Chocolate Pet skunk Omega-3 fatty acid Meat analogue Food guide pyramid Organic food Coronary heart disease Theory of conduct Organic farming Cheese Cajun cuisine Fecal incontinence Fishing Agriculture Japanese cuisine Breastfeeding Fancy rat 613 mitzvot Meat Cuisine of Laos Abortion debate Domesticated turkey Stomach cancer Domestic goat Potato Roman eating and drinking Feral cat Vegetarian nutrition Trans fat Halaal Vitamin C Fugu Bread Environmental vegetarianism Ferret Chicken Genetically modified food Factory farming Prostate cancer Insulin Kitten Cyanocobalamin Escherichia coli O157:H7 Soy milk Agriculture in Australia Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Jewish cuisine Salad Paleolithic diet Sausage Soup
