vegetarian i have decided to become a vegetarian i have been for about months now but my parents are completely against it what should i do ultimately you control what goes into your body if they're against it that's their problem not yours here are a few good arguments though if they're giving you cheek about it vegetables are capable of providing all the same nutrients as meat protein from beans iron from spinach and other leafy greens and even avocados have fat in them and yes your body does need a certain amount of fat to function correctly a vegetarian diet is more humane and environmentally sustainable who's ever heard of mad corn disease seed and leaf disease exactly nobody vegetables are easy to prepare and easy to work into the family diet after all weren't your parents the ones that didn't give you dessert until you ate your peas i really don't see how someone could be against it but like i said it's your body even they can't argue with that fact Vegetarianism Veganism Food Dieting Vegetarian nutrition Atkins Nutritional Approach Organic food Omega-3 fatty acid Vegetarian cuisine Tocopherol Avocado Hamster Soybean Nutrition Raw food diet Environmental vegetarianism Nutrient Vitamin C Coronary heart disease Healthy eating Guinea pig Fruitarianism Low-carbohydrate diet Folic acid Potassium Egg (food) Brain Agriculture Protein Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Brazil Gelatin Bengali cuisine Cheese Coeliac disease Chinese cuisine Hot dog Cuisine of Africa Chili con carne MRE Cuisine of the Philippines Organic farming Soul food Domestic rabbit Milk Food guide pyramid Cuisine of Denmark Acorn German cuisine Common bean Peruvian cuisine Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Russian cuisine Spinach Crohn's disease Food preservation Trans fat Maize Anemia Cat Vegetarianism and religion Pea Fancy rat Ramen Tomato Ferret Liver Fecal incontinence Kashrut Dog Zinc Cantonese cuisine Malnutrition Fasting Vitamin British cuisine Famine Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Overpopulation Dim sum Insulin Pea soup Flowering plant Genetically modified food Antioxidant Neolithic Revolution Jewish cuisine Domesticated turkey Cereal Green Revolution Hamburger French cuisine
