becoming a vegan i'm thinking about becoming a vegetarian but not sure what all i would have to give up i know meat products but other than that i am clueless also what do i have to do in order to stay healthy keep all the regular vitamins that meat products supply me with protein etc thank you all so far i will probably stick with dairy products as i rarely eat a lot of them anyway as i'm already pretty much lactose intolerant i had gastric bypass in if any of you could provide websites that i could look at that would be helpful thank you as far as what you need to give up that depends on whether you want to become a vegan or a vegetarian becoming a vegan is the stricter of the two vegans do not eat anything that comes from animals that means no meat cheese eggs milk etc etc vegetarians however can vary immensely most diets are based on your person beliefs or goals as a vegetarian you can eat all diary products poultry and fish whether you want to cut out any of these from your diet is your own choice for example i do not eat chicken but i will eat fish and all diary products in order to stay healthy you should try to keep your diet as diverse as possible eating what you would normally eat as a meat eater just without the meat is the one mistake many new vegetarians make a book or web reference of vegetarian recipes is probably your best bet if you don't already have foods in mind another thing to keep in mind is that if you like the meat recipes you can always substitute the meat for vegi meat if you get the right brands it tastes just as good as the actual meat one of my family members is a die hard meat eater but when we served him a sloppy joe with ground meatless on it he didn't even notice is wasn't meat until we told him afterwards vitamins are a good thing to take as well i personally take vitamin c and d pills i get sufficient amounts of protein from other foods such as beans eggs and seafood i've been a vegetarian for a good majority of my life and i can tell you this much it ends up being a lot healthier than a meat diet if you pay attention to what you do Meat analogue Egg (food) Food Cheese Cuisine of Brazil Kashrut Hamburger Vegetarian nutrition Milk Soy milk Vegetarianism and religion Dieting Kosher foods Chili con carne Chicken Pizza Healthy eating Chocolate Lactose intolerance Soybean Pesco/pollo vegetarianism McDonald's Raw food diet Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Ramen Animal rights Nutrition Atkins Nutritional Approach Buddhist cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Environmental vegetarianism French cuisine Meat Peruvian cuisine Protein Omega-3 fatty acid Coronary heart disease Japanese cuisine Stomach cancer Hot dog Taboo food and drink Guinea pig Livestock Vitamin Korean cuisine Russian cuisine Dairy Jewish cuisine French fries Breakfast Cat Vitamin D Soul food Irish cuisine MRE Marmite Organic food Bengali cuisine Sausage Tlingit Barbecue Cuisine of Singapore Quorn Punk ideology Cajun cuisine Domestic rabbit Hedgehog Tooth Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Africa Breastfeeding Lisa the Vegetarian Gelatin Halaal German cuisine Curry Crohn's disease Soup Domesticated turkey Taiwanese cuisine Salmon Cuisine of the Southern United States Fecal incontinence Fruitarianism Adjustable gastric band Vitamin C Fugu
