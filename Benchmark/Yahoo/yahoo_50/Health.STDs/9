how long can the hiv virus survive outside the human body e g on a needle it completely depends on the amount of hiv the amount of fluid it is carried in and where it is hiv is very easy to kill outside of the body if you are talking about a drop of blood any hiv in it will be rendered non infectious very quickly if you are talking about a pool of blood it will take longer inside of a syringe hiv could theoretically stay infectious longer as there is limited exposure to air and the blood will take longer to dry out you can't really answer this question as there is too much variation and a lot of people have misunderstood the whole exposure to air will kill hiv as meaning that hiv is killed instantly outside of the body and that is incorrect it completely depends on the ambient temperature the amount of fluid which hiv is contained in ie blood semen vaginal fluids or breastmilk etc hope this helps ps needle stick injuries have a transmission infection rate of about HIV AIDS HIV test Hepatitis C AIDS reappraisal Breastfeeding Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Sexually-transmitted infection Intravenous therapy Transmission (medicine) Semen Cytomegalovirus Ebola Hepatitis B Rabies Pneumonia Safe sex Timeline of AIDS Prostate cancer Anopheles Syringe Anal sex AIDS pandemic Drowning HIV vaccine Condom Infectious disease AIDS in Africa Oral sex Malaria Human T-lymphotropic virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Herpes simplex virus Tattoo Carbon dioxide Common cold Toxoplasmosis Antiretroviral drug Earring Dialysis Nuclear fallout Poliomyelitis Human sexual behavior 28 Days Later Cancer Infectious mononucleosis Mosquito Stomach cancer Virus Immune system OPV AIDS hypothesis Decompression sickness Duesberg hypothesis Chronic fatigue syndrome Rocky Mountain spotted fever Methamphetamine Vaccine Bacteria Mesothelioma Pornographic movie Hepatitis Penis Smallpox STS-50 Cirrhosis Lassa fever Influenza Swimming Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medical analysis of circumcision Knife Jet engine Blood donation Dehydration Robert Gallo Carburetor Foodborne illness Diabetes mellitus Pathogen Multiple sclerosis Spacecraft propulsion Hypodermic needle Liquid breathing Blood pressure Coeliac disease Body fluid H5N1 Sterilization (microbiology) Motorcycle Apoptosis
