question about herpes im not sure if i have it or not but the symptoms seem to be adding up im gonna get tested tommorow but im curious if it is herpes id only have had the break out around my mouth does that mean the part of the skin that came in contact with the infected person is the only part that would get infected on me just curious cause i dont have any sort of break out below the belt also ive heard the first outbreak is the worst is this true both forms of herpes hsv usually associated with cold sores around the mouth and hsv usually associated with genital blisters sores although either variation can infect you either above or below the belt can be spread even if the infected person is not actively having an outbreak this is known as asymptomatic shedding where virus particles are given off it does require direct contact to get infected you can spread the virus from the original infection site to other locations by scratching rubbing touching the infected area and then another part of your body so if you or your partner have an outbreak it is especially important to wash well with soap and water after any possible contact with infected skin for most people the first outbreak is often the worst but also the first year can have some pretty bad obs your body does seem to adapt over time and outbreaks become less frequent and less severe stress is a trigger for outbreaks for many people as are a number of foods especially chocolate and nuts incluidng peanuts get tested and most reliable tests are the western blot test and the immunoblot test testing should be about months after exposure and possibly your first outbreak because it takes your body many weeks to generate enough antibodies to the virus to accurately detect and determine the variation hsv or hsv good luck and if you do have herpes there are plenty of support groups around the country as well as on line search in yahoo groups under heath Sexually-transmitted infection Cytomegalovirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome HIV test Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Syphilis Common cold Virus Group A streptococcal infection Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS AIDS reappraisal Avian influenza Psoriasis Pneumonia Ebola Chronic fatigue syndrome Influenza Herpes zoster H5N1 Foot-and-mouth disease Hepatitis C Urinary incontinence Eczema Smallpox Cancer Stomach cancer Herpesviridae AIDS Lassa fever Spanish flu Escherichia coli O157:H7 Breastfeeding Marburg virus Antibody Mouth ulcer Oral sex Hay fever Allergy Lupus erythematosus Genital wart Measles Infectious mononucleosis Conjunctivitis Computer virus Rotavirus Hepatitis B Lyme disease Poliomyelitis Multiple sclerosis Immune system Body piercing Acne Epilepsy Malaria Human papillomavirus West Nile virus Tattoo Entamoeba histolytica Radiation therapy Dandruff Gonorrhoea First aid Norwalk virus group Toxoplasmosis Coeliac disease Safe sex 28 Days Later Legionellosis Autoimmune diseases Anthrax Traumatic brain injury Peanut Epstein-Barr virus Protein Homeopathy Tuberculosis Bell's palsy Post Polio syndrome Antiviral drug Foodborne illness Influenza pandemic HIV HIV vaccine Autism Biological warfare Heartworm Chickenpox HIV Disease Progression Rates
