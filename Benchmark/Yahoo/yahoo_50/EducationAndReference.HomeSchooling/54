are there any independent studies that prove that homeschooled chilldren are better in areas like education behavior psychological social mental emotional etc when looking at things like achievement tests it's not necessary for the data to be independent of the homeschool 'lobby' if you will as long as the data are reported in peer reviewed journals the peer review process helps to take out much of the bias found in slanted journals brian ray has done much research in this area so you should check out his info at nheri yes it is a pro homeschool group but numbers don't lie when it comes to standardized testing as for social aspects i have seen only one peer reviewed journal article and it showed there was at worst no difference between homeschool kids and public private school kids and at best homeschool kids were slightly better in social situations the article was in the peabody journal of education volume pgs homeschooling is still relatively new it has only taken off in the last years not enough time to do much research then confirm that with further trials i'm sure in the next years we'll see much more research being reported of course the fact that the nea hasn't done or at least hasn't published any studies showing that homeschooling is detrimental to kids says volumes to me about its effectiveness if it weren't effective don't you think the nea would be all over that Homeschooling Psychology Education in the United States Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Race and intelligence Intelligence quotient Rind et al.
