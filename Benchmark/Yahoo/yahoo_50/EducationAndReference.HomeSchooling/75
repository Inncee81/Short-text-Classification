online elementary school hello my son and i are going with my husband overseas and i want to know what is a good online elemetary school i want to home school my son i heard that jubilee academy was but i wanted to get a second opinion plus i here that alot of homeschool kide are really smart because of the one on one attention with your child and i know that i can teach my son more things his school taught him when he was in public school my son is going to first grade and i want to home school him for one year any suggestions first clarify your educational goals for your son together with your husband for example we wanted a christian education for our sons before they were born but found later that we couldn't afford private schools we're so glad to be homeschooling because it bonds you as a family rather than everyone having their own private schedules also our goal is not to make our children smart we believe that all children are people are just smart in different ways homeschooling allows you to get to know who your child is and tailor their education to their bent or personal interests we want our sons to learn how to serve others with the knowledge that they gain not to become rich and famous you can do it girl you are equipped not because of a degree conferred on you i know that is highly offensive to professional educators but simply because you know your son better than any teacher could you are concerned about his well being so you can learn how to teach him it's not always easy but it is do able sonlight curriculum is what we use now and they have a user friendly website with discussion forums and telephone help too a lot of overseas parents love it shipping is great but for the first few years i sort of scoured the libraries and used book sales to put together my own stuff i love william bennett's book of virtues and ed hirsch's what every grader needs to know series for k th i think it's time consuming to make your own curriculum but very personalized for your child just do your homework and your child will benefit from seeing you learn to teach him why stop at one year my seventh grader just asked if he could be homeschooled for high school and my th grader told me i was getting to be a pretty good teacher those compliments can take me through the whole school year there are a lot of pitfalls and numerous joys as well when you teach your own go for it Homeschooling Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Waldorf Education GED Education Brown v.
