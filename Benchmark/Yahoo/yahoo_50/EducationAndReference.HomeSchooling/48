i want some time off school how can i trick people into thinking i should stay home i have been trying so hard at school recently and my mum thinks i am perfect i am feeling really run down and would appreciate some ideas thanks don't try to trick people about this tell your mum that you are feeling really run down the most likely possibilities for why you feel this way are not getting the proper nutrition you may need some extra protein more veggies and or fruit you are still growing and you are working to your capacity maybe even pushing yourself too far you need really good nutrition and some high protein snacks in between a handful of almonds and a glass of milk cheese and tomato juice that kind of thing not getting enough sleep this may boil down to discipline when i was pushing myself to the edge and beyond in school i found i needed more not less sleep this meant completely disciplined use of my time early to bed and a little bit later rising time not getting enough of the right kind of social life balance is important always you can push for a little while but you need the societal support of others not partying but just a coke with friends or a walk and a talk at least once or twice a week not getting enough physical exercise one of the best ways is just to walk or walk and run alternating between them for seconds at a time or swimming or whatever you like tennis instead of trying to trick people into rest enlist their support to help you do this really great thing you are doing for yourself the hard work will pay off but only if you learn the balance that goes with it you'll feel better all round and have good reason to be proud of yourself as well maggie Aerial (dance move) Social rule Hamster Veganism About a Boy Vegetarianism Breakfast Peruvian cuisine Milk Equine conformation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mojave people CPU cache Hypoglycemia In-N-Out Burger Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Potassium Weight training Food Little Britain The Book of Five Rings Theodicy Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Soy milk Insomnia Kender Avenue Q Cuisine of the Philippines Tai Chi Chuan Socrates Out-of-body experience EastEnders Prostate cancer Ketchup W.
