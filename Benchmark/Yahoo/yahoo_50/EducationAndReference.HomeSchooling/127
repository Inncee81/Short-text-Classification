i am going into th grade and i am afraid to go to school i have been attending a virtual charter school online and my mom now wants me to go back to school now so that i can socialize with other kids my age i am an a student and also a perfectionist my worst fear is taking tests did you ever hear of taking tests home well that is exactly what i want to do to ease my stress if they will not let me do that does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep calm and not worry my childhood years away is socialization the only reason your parents want you to go back to school honestly there are many social opportunities for homeschool kids google your hometown and homeschool or homeschool group and you should find them if you do end up going back to school the tests shouldn't be a problem trust me they're not as hard as you think they are designed to evaluate if you actually learned the material even if you don't make perfect grades on them which you may or may not you can still get good grades you may want to go ahead and get a book on test taking tips it may ease your stress your teachers probably won't let you take your tests home but if you talk with them they'll be able to give you some tips for not stressing through them it is a necessary skill to learn whether you're in a classroom or homeschool it's something you'll need to be able to do in college it's a lot easier to learn now when your transcripts don't matter as much than in high school or college just settle into it you're making it more stressful than it is if you can ace your homeschool classes chances are you can ace the tests Homeschooling Education in the United States GED Education Grade (education) Education in Malaysia Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania SAT School Boston Public Test (student assessment) A.
