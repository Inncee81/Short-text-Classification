i'm painting my office what color drapes to use i'm getting ready to paint my office there is a chair rail and the top half will be a dusty blue and the bottom half will be a pretty dark gray color the desk bookcase shelves etc are white i have used b w pictures in the room i want solid curtains but what color do i try and do the designer thing and use a completely different color that anything else in the room like fuschia or red or should i just go with something simple like a lighter gray or blue or should i look for printed curtains that complement the room colors yes it's the office in my house not a place of business consider a dark charcoal color for your curtains it has all the elements to ground all of your colors together and will fit in nicely most designers that have any sense will not suggest fuschia with this room and only red if you are planning on doing the room feng shui the only other option i can see without seeing a picture of the room is to opt for some really nice white on white curtains they are curtains that are all white but have a pattern in them in white usually a shinier white than the rest of the material unless you have something that leans towards gold in the room then you could do a goldish color curtain which could look really nice enjoy your new home office Color Francis Bacon (painter) Color theory Rococo Lighting Chair Sega Saturn Dragon Booster Japanese tea ceremony Billiards James McNeill Whistler Piet Mondrian Kitchen Blue Animal Crossing Wilton House Stage lighting Ultramarine Cascading Style Sheets Opportunity rover Chatsworth House Traditional animation Ammolite Passenger car Yohoho!
