i just installed an above ground oval pool and will finish it off with a nice deck i know i've probably turned off a lot of buyers for future sale but also may have attracted some anyone have any experience with this i know when i was first looking at homes if i found one i liked with a pool that would have been a plus i have kids and have always dreamt of having my own pool especially after having lived in apartments for years i'm just wondering if an above ground pool is a nice attraction if done well with nice landscaping i would say yes it does attract buyers actually it may be a wiser decision than adding an in ground pool because as expensive as in grounds are they barely add any value to the resale of your home i think that if it does have a nice deck with attractive landscaping and it's attached to the house it will be quite a strong selling point i also think it would depend on where you live if you reside in a warmer area like florida or california it's probably a big plus but if you're in wisconsin or iowa or someplace where it snows a lot it may not be quite so appealing Wisconsin Beverly Hills, California Star Trek Customizable Card Game Mid-levels Urban sprawl Milwaukee, Wisconsin Carlsbad, California Topps Harley-Davidson Make money fast Supply and demand Gated community Mobile home Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Prisoner's dilemma John Edwards Smoking ban Cranford, New Jersey Microeconomics Illegal drug trade Suspension bridge Disney's California Adventure White House McMansion Blackjack Time Out of Mind Lake District Mansion New York Giants Poker jargon Zerg Xanadu House Seismic retrofit Sento Epcot Chevrolet Camaro History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Sears Catalog Home Iowa class battleship Minnesota The Contender (television series) Angel Stadium of Anaheim Buildings of Iowa State University My Little Pony Autograph New York City RKO Pictures Blackburn Rovers F.C.
