how does a person figure a bid for sheetrock finish and painting my brother has been doing sheetrock and painting work mostly residential and bids the jobs by going in and measuring each wall space that he has to do he has the chance to do commercial jobs finish the sheetrock and paint each between to sq ft but can't figure out if he's supposed to bid on the floor space sq footage or the wall space sq footage this could be his chance to really get going on his own and he's afraid of not bidding right but we already know that a bid of a sq foot is expected just not if that means the sq footage of floor space or wall space i hope this makes sense and someone can help really soon this most likely would be floor space that way all bids come in from other trades in a similar and comparable format for example assume an electrition putting in a bid he or she wouldn't be able to fiqure out by sq ft since he is really dealing in feet of wire laid a carpet installer would be floor footage ductwork at yet a different scale so by having all trades bid at per floor square footage everyone is putting their bid's in at the same level Stairway Carpet Drywall Wall Street Glossary of partner dance terms Scale model Basement Ra (board game) Poker jargon HVAC World Trade Center Urban planning Dundas Square Super Mario 64 Wallpaper group Donald Trump Electrical wiring Seismic retrofit Sundial Tesco The Haunted Mansion Freedom Tower Steve Nash Cyberport Decibel Dark matter Auction The Star Wars Holiday Special London 2012 Olympic bid Saturn V Solar power Wood carving Alex Ferguson Chatsworth House Professional wrestling holds Symmetry Budd Dwyer Boeing Xanadu House Anderson Cooper King Khalid International Airport Contract bridge Swingout Petronas Towers Ethernet New Urbanism Bowl Championship Series Drawing John Cage Opportunity rover Glen Jacobs Andy Warhol Pipe organ Light pollution Squash (sport) Doom engine Tag Billboard (advertising) Palpatine The Champions Deck (ship) Mattress Wall Street Crash of 1929 Telegraphy Asbestos Wal-Mart Professional wrestling match types Land use forecasting Bus models used in New York City Transit Public domain Fan (implement) Le Corbusier Kitchen Monopoly (game) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories The Doctor Dances Eiffel Tower Wheel of Fortune Fahrenheit 9/11 St. Peter's Basilica Cyberspace North York, Ontario Game of Death Mount Everest Sears Tower Masonry Big Brother (USA TV series) Software engineering Chair Economy of Russia Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, California Bratislava Castle Arbitrage Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Alanis Morissette Free trade Aerial (dance move) Furnace Fenway Park
