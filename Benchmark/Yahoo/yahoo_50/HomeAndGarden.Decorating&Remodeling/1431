toddler bedroom decor my daughter just moved to a big girl bed and so i went out and bought her a new bedspread and all white furniture the comforter is bright pink lime green purple orange and teal i am trying to decide what color to paint the walls i was thinking of doing a lighter green like lime but lighter and then doing a bright pink stripe around the room or else painting the room a light teal with a purple stripe does that sounds too grown up for a year old i want it to be a room she can grow into but i don't want the colors design to be too much for her what do you think any other cute decorating ideas i hate just one color walls so i'm trying to use two colors to decorate thanks i think a soft lime green with a medium pink strip would be adorable i don't think it would be too grown up it should serve her well into preteens at least another idea for longevity in a kid's bedroom paint the walls a solid color and then decorate them with the peel and stick wallies or other precut images that can be adhered to the wall temporarily you could put some flowers or butterflies on the wall now and then when she gets older and wants something different you could put polka dots or something geometric like that good luck Pysanka Dragon Booster Color theory Color Billiards Wood carving Chatsworth House The Brady Bunch Rainbow flag Comanche Carpet Hamster Rainbow Brite Buckingham Palace Rococo Yellow Rum Paint Blenheim Palace Wilton House Discus (fish) Lighting Calvin and Hobbes Pok__mon Snap James McNeill Whistler Leather Colours, standards and guidons Plaster Nintendo GameCube Wassily Kandinsky Yoshi Japanese tea ceremony Beret Cuisine of Denmark Christmas tree Wood Vincent van Gogh The Adventures of Pete & Pete Reservoir Dogs Customs and etiquette of Japan Glass Microsoft Paint Shaggy dog story My Little Pony Pottery White House Furniture Fanta Lane M.C.
