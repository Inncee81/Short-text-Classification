bedroom ideas i'm moving and i need an idea for my room i love new york and other big cities ok well it depends what kind of look you want to go for exactly new york city theme you should draw and paint some tall buildings on one wall in your room it would be nice to make the buildings on the one wall a darker color and the backround darker too as to make it look like a nighttime setting then to add more of a girly piece to the room you should paint the other walls in your room a similar but brighter color add some pictures on the other walls maybe of buildings or other stuff put in nice carpeting furniture a new bed spread and maybe a plant or two and some new curtains now if that is too much buildings for you you can go for more of a girly feel paint the walls a bright pretty color chose an accent color then buy a new bed spread of a different color of the walls buy curtains to match the bed spread hang some nice pictures and you're good if you want a claming room i would say to paint the walls a soothing neutral color like a beige or something then i would add in a bed spread i think the bed spread would look nice if it were white and then you go bold by adding in red throw pillows add in some black and white family photos or photos of u and friends on the walls red curtains to match the pillows would look nice next add in some plants and furniture i would also buy a nightstand or bookshelf and then put some pretty candles on it this will definetly make your space very calming hope i helped and happy moving Upholstery Color theory Animal Crossing Grace Cossington Smith Wilton House Rococo The Time Machine Wheel of Fortune Sento Mid-levels Professional wrestling match types Wassily Kandinsky Care Bears Francis Bacon (painter) The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Hamster Wood carving My Little Pony Fancy rat Color Dragon Booster Theory of conduct Kitchen Marilyn Monroe White House Japanese tea ceremony Textile manufacturing Monopoly (game) Xanadu House Great Teacher Onizuka Autostereogram Pysanka Paint Camouflage JPEG Brett Whiteley Passenger car Marc Chagall Billboard (advertising) Mattress Fischer Random Chess Humphrey Bogart Gamut Basement AFI 100 Years series Undergrads Irish Houses of Parliament Plastic Christiansborg Palace Bedbug Carcassonne (board game) Poker jargon Symmetry Out-of-body experience Light-emitting diode GunBound Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Hemp Bedroom Wrigley Field Avenue Q CIE 1931 color space Chess terminology Opportunity rover Drawing Color space 2000 Australian Grand Prix Photography The Arnolfini Portrait The Brady Bunch Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Roxette Yohoho!
