kitchen floor slate i am redoing my kitchen floors from linoleum to slate i am on a budget so do i have to use a backer board what is the difference if i do or dont pls help the tca tile council of america which is the flooring industry installation standard for tile will allow you to install slate on a clean flat and cured concrete slab without a backer board if you have any kind of wood sub floor you need to use it for proper installation if you have height concerns we recommend a hardibacker board or equal luan or other wood underlayments are not acceptable unless they make a total of at least of wood sub floor but it really is not the best choice also note that when installing your slate assuming it is real slate you will need to seal it before as well as after grouting it will likely be uneven also so we would recommend you using a premium thinset mortar and a x x notch trowel so you have enough mud to shift the tiles and get them as even as possible one other option would be a metal lath and self leveling compound but this will likely not save you any money and be more difficult than backerboard our recommendation save up the cash and buy the hardibacker its not that expensive and you'll have a lifetime floor visit us and support us and watch us grow at http www flooringprofessor com Drill bit Seismic retrofit Tile Microeconomics Life insurance Insurance Kitchen Lathe Hyperinflation Inflation Tire Scrabble Drywall Basement Mattress Dundas Square Woodworking Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Poker jargon Mahjong Linoleum Gramophone record Wallpaper group Commodity markets Stairway Epoxy Reinforced concrete Pavement (material) Mission San Juan Capistrano MapleStory Light-frame construction Variable universal life insurance Slot machine Chimney Autonomous building Money Anchor Stucco Bretton Woods system United Nations Security Council Tai shogi Plastic Solar power Carpet Option Architecture of the California missions Keynesian economics Building material Monetary policy Arlington House O scale Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Hard disk American and British English differences Taikyoku shogi Violin Ra (board game) Asbestos Brush Gold as an investment Uniform Resource Locator Prostate cancer Spark plug Solar cell Gold standard San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Credit card Labor theory of value Lloyd's of London Sento Free trade Warren Buffett Diving ALGOL 68 Screw Social rule Portsmouth Block Mills Interest Knife Straw-bale construction Headlight Billiards Lighting Coalition Provisional Authority McMansion Capital accumulation Dam FairTax Corporate governance Go (board game) Passenger car Flat tax The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Kitchener, Ontario Plywood Mosaic STS-114
