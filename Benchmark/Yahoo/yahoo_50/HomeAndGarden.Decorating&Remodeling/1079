hardwood flooring or ceramic tiles i am getting my kitchen done over in weeks cost is not a factor i cant decide to do tiles or harwood flooring which is better for the kitchen i have two kids and definitely get tile my brother and his wife got a harwood floor in their kitchen my dad and i tried warning them against it now they are all the time worrying about putting dents in the floor if they drop something or ruining the look by accidentally dropping and leaving an ice cube on the floor if you have kids that only increases the chances of stuff like that happening tile is much more durable if you don't like the feel of cold tile on your feet then add a heater wire under the tile you can set the floor temperature to almost any temperature you prefer you only have to seal the tile about once every years with a hardwood floor you'd have to wax or seriously clean it that often anyway with tile you also don't have to really worry about stains unless you use a light grout and don't seal it well grout comes in a wide variety of colors so you can color coordinate the grout however you please an tile isn't that hard to clean with a mop my brother is big into farming and very meticulous about everything it'll be funny to watch when his kids want to start playing with ertl tractors on the hardwood floor Ra (board game) Aerial (dance move) Drill bit Sento Knife Shaggy dog story Plastic Social rule Tile Seismic retrofit Furnace Coffee Carburetor Kitchen Upholstery Diablo II Ceramics Wood Mattress The Adventures of Pete & Pete Tessellation Diseases of the honeybee Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Billiards The Brady Bunch Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Diving Thermostat Vacuum cleaner Stirling engine Basement RuneScape quests McMansion Vacuum tube The Human Stain Milton H.
