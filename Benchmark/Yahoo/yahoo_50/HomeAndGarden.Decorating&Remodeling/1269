old tile countertop can it be grouted my countertop tiles look awful especially the places between tiles i clean it very often with clorox but in days it's black again i can't replace it because i live in a rented apartment what can i do to make tiles look nice maybe grout my countertop thanks yes you can have it re grouted if you want to spend the money not sure what color your tiles are but you might want to consider a colored grout instead of white another thing you might want to try instead is soaking a little soft scrub with bleach on the grout and scrubbing it with a soft tooth brush amazingly this tends to work a little better than just clorox alone i'd give it a try cheaper than re grouting Brush Dishwashing Seismic retrofit Bong Plastic Tile Clorox Tooth Manicure Mahjong tiles Textile manufacturing Space Shuttle program Arcade cabinet Scrubs Taikyoku shogi Sento Tied Test Tai shogi Nacre Drill bit Mosaic Hoover Dam Laundry detergent Tooth bleaching Contact lens Asbestos Typewriter Upholstery Technicolor STS-114 Maka dai dai shogi Car wash Mahjong Cast iron Flour Pottery Tessellation PC Engine Super Nintendo Entertainment System Something Awful Dishwasher Carcassonne (board game) Lionel Corporation Oral hygiene Ra (board game) Heraldry Rummikub Pavement (material) Tooth enamel Wallpaper group Kitchen FoxTrot Campaign finance in the United States Leather White bread The Brady Bunch Francis Bacon (painter) Wood pulp Nintendo Entertainment System Hamster King Khalid International Airport S.
