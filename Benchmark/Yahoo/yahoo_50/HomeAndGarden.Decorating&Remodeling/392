should i redecorate my fiance's house i'm going to live there one day anyway so i think it would be best to get started right away with redecorating some of the rooms i was thinking of redoing the bedroom in like a seagreen and ivory theme with seashells and one of the bathrooms in a sky blue and yellow floral theme i also want to change the title in the kitchen to something more bright and interesting then the dull kind he has now he's going out of town and i'm going to surprise him with it when he gets back i'm sure he'll be okay with it but i'm not sure would you like what i chose big red flags and buzzers going off are you really sure that you will be living there i'd wait until after the wedding to start to change his house you never know what might happen between now and then the worst thing would be that he would see how you're going to come into his life and change everything he may get the idea that you will be very controlling and it just may drive a wedge into the relationship i've seen it happen with a close friend of mine its never a good idea to to take over a man's place and change it drastically do it in small steps with him there to agree or disagree as he sees fit believe me you will be better off for it Friends Buckingham Palace The Shining (film) Sin City Piccolo Junior Saga Father's Day (Doctor Who) Kitchen The Brady Bunch The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie EastEnders The Marriage of Figaro Traffic light About a Boy Avenue Q Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Chatsworth House The Time Machine Bad Wolf About Schmidt Milton H.
