how do i ask my mom if i can get new furniture i would pay for all of it myself i just got a new bed desk about two years ago but they were pretty cheap and the desk is kind of broken now all i want is a new bed but i'd want a futon sort of thing a new desk and then new sheets since i have a different size bed right now how do i bring this up i've already found everything i want from stores online stores we can go to target office max ikea etc so i know the price and i have enough money speaking as a mom i think you need to go about asking her responsably start by telling her school is coming up soon and you've been thinking about how you're gonna get your act together your desk is broken and you're wondering how you'll get your homework done properly then go on to mention that you've matured and know that as a parent she already has a heavy enough financial burden so you were wondering if since you think you need new furniture she would be willing to help you out tell her you're willing to pay for the furniture yourself can you afford it a futon costs around to dollars depending on where you buy it if you buy used show her a plan you've come up with to pay for the furniture cause somehow i get the feeling you'll be paying monthly payments make a plan if you can't afford to pay for it all ask mom what you can do that would help her out and could help you pay for your new furniture the thing to remember is this if you come to her with a problem and no solutions then you're part of the problem think about how you'll pay for it all set it down in black and white on paper and most importantly ask when you can speak to her about something important when she has the time i can guarantee if you just start talking about it without considering how she's feeling when you ask she may be tired after a hard day of work and still has to get supper going and do a load of laundry she'll say no so get her when the mood is right and she's feeling rested and in a good mood i don't know how old you are or if you'll be going away to college but you can always use the argument that when you do move out of the house you'll already have a couch cause you'll be able to use the futon good luck nice to hear kids say they'll pay for things themselves Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Futon Desk Microeconomics About a Boy Mattress George Costanza The Inside Social rule The Shining (film) Mutual fund U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Economy of Russia Charles Ponzi Economy of the United States 2000 Australian Grand Prix Futurama (TV series - season 5) Calvin and Hobbes Economics The Apprentice 2 Student loan Extreme Programming Capital accumulation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Surplus value Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Monetary policy Money Upholstery Gross domestic product Grandview, U.S.A.
