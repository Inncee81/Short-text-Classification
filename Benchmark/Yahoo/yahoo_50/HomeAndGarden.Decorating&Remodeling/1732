redoing my room i need a lot of help okay so i'm completley redoing my room and all i've done so far is cut out a lot of magazine ad's that i'm going to tape together on different parts of my wall other then that i'm stuck i'm thinking maybe pink brown for the color scheme but i'm really not sure i hate floral prints tacky bedding so i'm kinda having a hard time finding anything i like i need a carpet paint color new bedding sheets a rug possibly a desk and those kind of accessories by the way i'm a year old girl and i like bright colors but not in a circus like way lol just so it looks cute i got a bedspread first with the colors i liked i picked purple blue and green i have a room in the basement so i had a lot to do use a neutral color for your carpet like a biege or a tan something that'll blend because you want the emphasis to be on your walls that's what people will see first if its a smallish room use a brighter color s to make it seem bigger i had a big room so i use a darker purple to make it seem cozier get a dresser that isn't finished yet so you can finish it yourself to the color you like and it's a lot cheaper the part where my bedroom is a light blue like a sky to help me relax my way to sleep and my bathroom is a bright green for bathrooms get the paint specially made to deal with moisture it'll last longer and won't run like normal paint make sure that when you paint your walls to use primer first so that the color you want it to come out as is as vivid as possible notice paints will dry either darker or lighter than the color they seem so be careful and ask the person at the paint store what it will do once its dried as far as rugs go nuts if you keep the carpet a neutral you can do anything with a rug it can be as crazy as you want it and make it a contrast to your walls to make it a little more cooler and cuter pink and brown would work really well i think go with that if you like it green is an excelent contrast to pink funky lamps are a great way to light up your room i have a stand up lamp with the five arms with different colors show your personality with what you put out in the room be creative Color theory Color Fluorescent lamp Carpet Upholstery Chatsworth House The Legend of Zelda series enemies Light-emitting diode The Brady Bunch The Wall Dormitory Sunglasses Lighting Blood on the Tracks Bedroom Grace Cossington Smith Camouflage Stage lighting Basement Impressionism Wood Bubble Bobble Coffee Tobacco The Shining (film) Color blindness Dragon Booster Diamond Invader Zim Pysanka Bicycle lighting Cigar Sin City Super Mario 64 Pink Floyd Drawing W.I.T.C.H.
