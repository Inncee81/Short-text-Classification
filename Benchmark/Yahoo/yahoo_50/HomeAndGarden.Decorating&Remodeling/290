update a room with a brown shag rug i just looked at a fantastic apartment but it has this horrible brown shag rug in the main room it just looks way too retro and reminds me of my grandparent's basement rec room the landlord said the apartment could be painted it would have to be painted back when we left and right now the walls are all white what can i do to bring this room into i was thinking of a nice brown accent wall or even painting the window trim any ideas are welcomed i think shags are in style again i saw on hgtv the decorator put a brand spanking new shag rug in an apartment love your shag rug go native with safari feel khaki or sand colored walls heavy dark accessories and plenty of lighter tan colors to balance such as pillows etc chocolate curtains with tan sheers in between that's what i see for your room be sure and put in a great big green plant or two don't get so jungle y that it looks artificial but do hang an old looking world map on one wall and maybe a nice little jute or other sisal rug under your coffee table to define your conversation area don't forget a few punches of bold color such as red in some of your accessories and a few of your pillows think of parrots bright and bold sounds like fun to me Lighting The Time Machine Rococo Color theory Blood on the Tracks Tobacco Chatsworth House M&M's The Wall Color W.I.T.C.H.
