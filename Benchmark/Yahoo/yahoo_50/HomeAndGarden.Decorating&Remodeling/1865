i want to pain the dark wood drink and doors in my house white what's the best way all my doors and trim are a dark stained wood i want pain them without a lot of hassle i e no sanding would a primer base coat be the best idea my house is small and you can see all the main rooms from anywhere in the house excluding bedrooms and bathroom should all the trim throughout the house be the same color what about the doors there is a product called liquid sandpaper that would work in lew of sanding on your project it works as easily as pouring it on a rag and wiping it on the surface it will degloss the existing finish and open up the pores so that a latex primer will stick to the surface after that is done prime with a good quality latex primer my favorite is bullseye after you have primed them you may paint them with the paint of your choice i would recommend a good quality semigloss latex enamel valspar has the best one that i have found in its signature line it is available at lowe's after the paint cures for about days water base paints continue to release moisture solvent and physically harden over this time i would use some automotive wax to completely seal the new paint this will stop stains form going into the surface and will harden the finish so it will not mar or scratch do not use furniture wax as it will leave a film behind and can darken the finish as far as the color is concerned you should have all if the trim the same color if it is visible through out the house if you want to add any additional colors i would pick out a wall that you would like to showcase and paint it with an accent color you could also accent using the doors if you wanted you could paint them a different color Paint Casting Plastic Primer (paint) Glass Upholstery Wood Vitreous enamel Opportunity rover Explosive material Menstrual cup Mattress Tooth enamel Stucco Manicure Xanadu House Plaster Corrosion Coffee Liquid crystal Lacquer Leather Sand casting Chewing gum Cartridge (firearms) Epoxy Internal ballistics Wood carving Bong Dodge Charger The Brady Bunch Hamster Water (molecule) Sandpaper Tofu Motor oil Titanium Tooth Turquoise Handloading Polyurethane Wilton House Fire extinguisher Stainless steel Fecal incontinence TARDIS Water Stairway Wood finishing Chatsworth House Laser engraving Gilding Items in the Metroid series Friction Gamut Pennsylvania Railroad Extreme Programming Technicolor Mars Shoe polish Aluminium Drill bit Violin Billiards Glossary of sculpting terms Blood Simple De Lorean DMC-12 Strap-on dildo Cookware and bakeware Planet of the Daleks Varnish Doctor (Doctor Who) Mach kernel Toyota Camry The Shining (film) Surrealist techniques Water purification Pastel Architecture of the California missions Diamond enhancement Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gesso Desert Bullet Organic peroxide Ultraviolet Reinforced concrete Window Polymerase chain reaction Laserdisc Staining (biology) Polymer clay Concrete Fancy rat Lighting
