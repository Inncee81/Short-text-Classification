if i'm using a tall floor lamp in my living room do i need to buy end tables and put lamps on them or would i be just fine with a living room table sofa recliner and the tall floor lamp i want the best look your lamp or lamps have nothing to do with your end tables if you wanted for the people on the sofa to be able to read of have a softer lighting then you could have the lamps on end tables or placed upon other furniture in the room end tables have taken on another life they are now used to show art they are also best known as a comfort spot for you or your guests to place their beverage i don't think anyone uses them for the placement of lamps anymore maybe because the use of overhead lighting in so many homes these days also you don't have to have two you may choose to have one at one end of the sofa and another placed by the chair it's all in what and where feels the most comfortable then of course you may decide that you don't want any in your room which is fine as well in this day and age as long as you have some type of table your coffee table in this instance and a piece of art you're great Furniture Couch Chair Upholstery Lighting Kitchen Japanese tea ceremony Mattress The Phantom Manor Grace Cossington Smith Cuisine of Denmark The Shadows The Brady Bunch Buckingham Palace Professional wrestling match types Palace of Westminster Incandescent light bulb Berghof (Hitler) Rococo Saturday Night Live Animal Crossing Movie theater Color temperature Traffic light Light pollution Cosmo Kramer Drawing Stage lighting President (game) Electrodeless lamp Milton H.
