can you dye lamp shades i found perfect bedside table lamps for our bedroom but i would like the lamp shades to be one or two shades darker right now they're a deep red and i would like them to be more of a maroon burgundy it depends on the fabric as to what you may be able to do do you have a joanne's michael's or any hobby craft stores by you i would take the lamp shade in and speak with an expert explain exactly the type of look you are wanting and if it is possible to achieve if it isn't you can still return the lamp shades and get your money back or you could check on the store or manufacturer website and see if they come in another color i don't suggest spraypainting them or blindly going into this project on your own without advice you could end up with a terrible lampshade and won't even be able to return it good luck Light-emitting diode Red Color Incandescent light bulb Ultraviolet Compact fluorescent lamp Camouflage Bicycle lighting Color theory Kerosene lamp Hash table Hair coloring Pigment Stage lighting Expert system Bus models used in New York City Transit Marilyn Monroe Fluorescent lamp DLP Minor characters in Morrowind Drawing Maroon (color) RuneScape Random Events The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Paintball Hair color November (film) Traffic light RuneScape quests Eye color CPU cache Upholstery Stained glass Textile manufacturing Crayola Headlight Pixel Middle-earth Television MySQL Cigar Mercury-vapor lamp Aladdin (1992 film) Mattress Textile manufacturing terminology The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Color temperature Friends The Legend of Zelda series enemies Computer graphics Human skin color High-intensity discharge lamp Cheating in poker Joy Electric Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Law of value Shaggy dog story Fancy Crane Clause Solar cell Characters of Naruto Ontological argument Flag of the Philippines Anodising Legal research Plame affair RuneScape skills RuneScape locations Sub-Zero Ra (board game) Sharon Tate Black Coffee Shroud of Turin Rubber stamp Koi Cincinnati Bengals Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sodium chloride Leather Web colors Liquid crystal display The Apprentice 2 New York Jets Russian joke Sicilian Expedition CD-R Arsenal F.C.
