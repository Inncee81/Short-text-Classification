how long will it take to paint my bedroom moving into a new house if i paint it how long will it take before it can be livable and move all my stuff in that really depends on the size of the bedroom but a typical bedroom say a x after prep taping etc if you spray minutes if you roll an hour or two if you brush forever either way hours is a good rule of thumb when waiting for paint to dry it will still smell but it will be good to move in it will dry sooner than that but just to be safe Paint Friction Halitosis Super Chief Chief (passenger train) Bedroom community Mies Painting Instant coffee Knife Donald Neilson The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hamster Menstrual cup Softball Chatham Square Vincent van Gogh The Commons Vista Way Wildfire Aftermath (album) Kart racing Dry cleaning Car washing techniques Fuel injection Poker jargon Manicure Cricket Aerial (dance move) Baseball Bedbug Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Longitude Drawing Brush Drew Struzan Self Portrait Richmond upon Thames Japanese tea ceremony First aid Henri Cartier-Bresson Perfume Arcade cabinet Curling Upholstery Eli__n Gonz__lez Oil painting Change ringing Foodborne illness Nirvana (band) Myra Hindley Dairy Galileo spacecraft Textile manufacturing Paintball Walt Disney World Railroad Radio controlled airplane Casting Xanadu House Blenheim Palace Illegal drug trade Gas metal arc welding Big Brother (Australian TV series) Fire fighting Typewriter Smells Like Teen Spirit Marching band Lisa the Vegetarian Cricket pitch Carnegie Mellon University Audio tape length and thickness Highway 61 Revisited Coconut crab Thermal power station Comanche The Brady Bunch Cannabis cultivation Triage Magnetic tape Lisa's First Word Apocalypse Now Dog agility Electronic music Mansion Idli Policy Debate Insomnia Breastfeeding Glossary of firefighting terms Bryan Ferry Breathing gas Risk (game) Toilet paper American Black Bear Nuclear fallout Paris Hilton Panel painting NorthBridge Apartment Complex Acrylic paint
