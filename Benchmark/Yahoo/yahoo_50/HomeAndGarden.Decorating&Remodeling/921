how do i blend colors on wall i want to use a lavender color on the the lower and blend it into a pale teal on top a little mermaid nursery should i use a glaze shold i dilute a latex paint not sure latex dries so fast though so i know i need to use something don't want to use oils due to the fact that i'm preg and it's going in the nursery and it's hot out would stink up the house are there lengthening agents for latex wall paint i know there is for latex art piant but not sure hmmm help thanks in my other dughter's room i used a border to seperate colors but i want these to blend it's supposed t o be kinda under the sea like a chair rail or brder would be easier but wouldn't quite work for the effect i'm going for too bad what i have done before is to go one wall at a time paint the top portion and then the bottom portion as soon as you are done rolling the colors on take a rag dipped lightly in water and using a swirling motion blend the two colors together you can also pick up a little more paint onto the rag if need be when one wall is done move onto the next wall and repeat it is a little time consuming but well worth the effort if all else fails get a friend or two to help have one person paint the top part one person paint the bottom half at the same time and then the third person can go behind and immediately blend the two colors together good luck Mattress Casting Glaze Coffee Thermal power station Manicure Tobacco Tea Equine conformation Drawing Aerial (dance move) Traditional animation Fire fighting Bubble Bobble Lavender Skateboarding trick Volleyball Menstrual cup Wood Painting Temporal bone Stairway Craps Anal sex Seismic retrofit Tofu Upholstery Piccolo Junior Saga Pottery Pastel Cheating in poker Fire extinguisher Grace Cossington Smith Espresso Make money fast Gilding Wassily Kandinsky Wallpaper group Strap-on dildo Hot dog Fire Sento Camouflage Lionel Corporation Poker jargon Acrylic paint BNSF Railway Chinese painting Vitreous enamel Plastic Illegal drug trade FairTax Diving suit Green tea Condom Heraldry ATI Technologies Union Pacific Railroad Steam engine Tattoo Sub-Zero Boy's surface Cigarette Jennifer Lopez Roxette Impressionism Violin Glass Jazz Titanium Stucco Korean cuisine Inflation Ron Weasley Tempera The Brady Bunch Akatsuki (Naruto) Kurdistan Workers Party Transformer Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Alsace Leopard High-speed rail Francis Bacon (painter) Lead Fast bowling Black Zinc Georges-Pierre Seurat In-N-Out Burger 2003 North America blackout Blood on the Tracks Perfume Black tea Perfect Dark Mary Cassatt Textile manufacturing E85
