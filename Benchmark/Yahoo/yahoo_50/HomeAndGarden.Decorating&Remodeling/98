choosing tiles for ensuite how do i choose tiles to make room look smaller any good sites that have ideas should it be matt or gloss should the storage unit doors be matt or gloss or does that depend on tiles being matt gloss should color in ensuite match bedroom decoration going mad help no i meant bigger ahhhh ok first take a deep breath then to make a room look bigger don't tile the whole room unless you're making a wetroom use standard size tiles rather than large ones or even mosaic tiles if your taste runs that way paint the walls in a light complementary colour it doesn't have to be white and don't forget to use a proper kitchen and bathroom paint the choice between matt or gloss tiles is again a matter of personal taste gloss tiles are more reflective and could give the impression of more space but in my experience they don't make a huge difference cupboard doors can be whatever you want them to be go for what looks good against the tiles a block dark colour such as wood could look a little heavy and make the space look smaller but there aren't going to be a large number of cupboards you can really go for whatever you want use a large mirror over the basin to give an impression of more space don't forget lighting you need to make sure that it's appropriate for use in a bathroom it's a good idea to complement the decoration of the bedroom in the ensuite you're basically creating a suite of rooms and they should run together it looks better i've attached a couple of links for you to look at to give you some ideas good luck http www surfacetiles com roomsets htm http www worldsendtiles co uk tile listing asp http www livingetc com gallery main php g itemid http www housetohome co uk galleries bathroom html rev on page on subslug galleries bathroom ensuite Kitchen Color McMansion Buckingham Palace Wallpaper group HTML The Brady Bunch Sento Mahjong Tessellation Wilton House M.C.
