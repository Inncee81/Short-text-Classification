what type of latex paint should i use to paint my kitchen i have a small kitchen i want to paint red but i'm not sure whether to use satin or gloss latex paint does anyone have any input on what finish is best for kitchens and whether a particular finish affects some colors more than others another note i'll be painting over freshly painted white paint i'm moving into an apartment that i'm allowed to paint but the management will have had my place repainted white before i move in should i still have to prime if it's a new paint job there is a special paint made especially for kitchens and bathrooms all paint companies make it kitchens and bathrooms are high humidity rooms and this paint keeps mold from forming in your kitchen definitely go with this and hurrah it's latex just make certain that if you have oil paint already on the walls or don't know if it's oil or latex then you should prime with oil based primer you can paint with latex over oil based primer but you can't paint latex paint over oil paint as it will peel scratch and chip off easily oil and water don't mix the primer is also part glue so anything sticks to it also if you're painting red have your primer tinted to match the paint this will keep you from having to paint or coats of paint as red is one of a few colors that are hard to paint well over white if your walls are bumpy have nicks and stuff then go with as low a shine as possible in your paint think satin instead of gloss be it high or semi as glossy paint shows all defects in the wall more bright colors such as red also show defects more which means you'll be disappointed if you choose a high gloss paint you'll also want to wash all of your walls and ceiling before you apply any paint do this with liquid tsp which you'll find at any home hardware store tsp removes all grease and grime which will keep your paint from adhering properly use liquid tsp instead of powder the powder is harder to mix is toxic and you'll have to rinse after you won't have these problems with the liquid version enjoy your new kitchen Casting Plastic Handloading Sewage treatment Internal ballistics Menstrual cup Pottery Tofu Bulk vending Stucco Glaze Glass Cartridge (firearms) Kitchen Drill bit Explosive material Vitreous enamel Material properties of diamond Lighting Lacquer Leather Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Thermal power station Fluorescent lamp Soap Condom Color Chocolate Mattress Billiards Gilding Light-emitting diode Sento Powder metallurgy LaTeX Titanium Strap-on dildo Transformer Tea Japanese tea ceremony Cosmetics Dairy Bullet Cookware and bakeware Pastel Liquid crystal display Fecal incontinence Dishwasher Eczema Manicure Brazing Hamster Epoxy Paper marbling Portable stove Gesso Wallpaper group Vinegar Tempera Volleyball Lionel Corporation Primer (paint) Painting Gas metal arc welding Lead paint Polymerase chain reaction Oscilloscope Dry cleaning System/34 Xanadu House Carburetor Cheese Chewing gum IPod Watercolor painting White phosphorus incendiary Atari 8-bit family Soy protein Brewery Liquid crystal System/36 Technicolor Solar cell Vacuum Varnish In-N-Out Burger Carpet Fiberglass Welding
