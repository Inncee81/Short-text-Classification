i want to paint my house can anybody help me with the color selection i have a three room apartment all is in white which i find pretty dull my husband got this before i got married but now i want to change it i am not good with colors there are so many and i am confused can anyone help i also want to paint the doors which are also in white try going to some paint websites they have interior design help on nearly all of them some of them even sell inexpensive cd roms that will allow you to take a digital picture of your room and virtually paint it they aren't perfect representations of the color but they give you a good idea most paint lines will also offer already done palettes meaning they've already put together to colors that go nicely so you can look into those too i've included links to some good paint companies as far as color choices stick with neutrals and tans for the majority of the space you can paint accent walls or to foot sections of a wall called color blocking in bold bright colors this will bring color to the space without being overpowering you can also use easier to change items like area rugs pillows and curtains to bring in bold or bright colors the other advantage to neutrals and tans is they will be easier to paint back to white when you move out most aparment complexes that allow you to paint expect you to put it back the way you found it Color theory Stereoscopy Color Upholstery Gamut Strap-on dildo Chatsworth House ROM hacking Camouflage Dodge Charger Marching band Game Boy Atari 8-bit family Sento Sundial Floppy disk White House My Little Pony Blenheim Palace French Defence Wood carving Grace Cossington Smith Game Boy Advance Billboard (advertising) Kitchen Light-emitting diode Traditional animation Wassily Kandinsky Chess strategy and tactics Piet Mondrian Lionel Corporation Mouse (computing) Lighting Bally Astrocade Francis Bacon (painter) Passenger car Pottery Autostereogram Pixel Art Nintendo GameCube Redundant array of independent disks Wallpaper group Rococo Jumpstart 3rd Grade Central processing unit Opportunity rover Commodore 64 Wilton House Manual transmission Final Fantasy (video game) TRS-80 Color Computer ALGOL 68 Xanadu House Super Nintendo Entertainment System Glossary of American football Color space Chess terminology AmigaOS Web colors Color Graphics Adapter Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Irna Phillips Digital circuit Pump It Up Pools of Darkness Nintendo Revolution Paint Skateboarding trick Leica Mid-levels Fischer Random Chess Sistine Chapel Mnemonic CIE 1931 color space Baroque Le Corbusier Digital camera Bicycle lighting Virtual memory Quicksort Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Carl Barks Pysanka Internal ballistics Plastic Circuit design Digital photography Digital image editing Drawing Henri Matisse Typeface The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Masonry Buckingham Palace Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February JPEG Brett Whiteley
