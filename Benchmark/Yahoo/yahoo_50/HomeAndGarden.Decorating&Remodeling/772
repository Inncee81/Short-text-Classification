how to makeover a school conference room my elementary school has a conference room with a mish mash of items the soundproofing on the walls is gray on one wall the carpet is red yikes but no changing that the room is very dark and dingy with old furniture that does not go together i'm trying to give it a makeover to make it a calming pleasant place to be not a dark dungeon my first thought chair covers maybe a table runner in a bright color and some sort of window treatment with color one wall is a white board floor to ceiling another is the gray soundproofing and the other two are a beige type color maybe once upon a time white there are small windows but being in alaska it doesn't bring in much light during the winter any ideas to make this dark dreary room into a beautiful comfortable space how about painting the walls all a soft butter cream and putting a red and white checkerboard border around to tie in the carpet and soften the effect then cover all the furniture in a canvas duck or denim so they are casual and easily cleaned the white board wall should be cleaned and accessorized with magnets or clings to make it cheery then bring in some potted plants and a few side lamps hit yard sales and ask for donations i think if you approach the room with a casual country look it will be pleasurable for many years to come good luck Lighting Carpet Kitchen Japanese tea ceremony Cuisine of Denmark Tag Upholstery Sento Grace Cossington Smith Wilton House Color theory Color Animal Crossing Rococo Wassily Kandinsky Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Bubble Bobble Bus models used in New York City Transit Wallpaper group Poker jargon Basement Mattress Mid-levels Buckingham Palace Fancy rat Toilet Plastic Chair Pysanka Strap-on dildo M&M's Billboard (advertising) My Little Pony Wood carving Stairway Xanadu House Comanche Pools of Darkness Magical objects in Harry Potter Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Bad Wolf Wood John Cage Tlingit Items in the Metroid series Alhambra Yu-Gi-Oh!
