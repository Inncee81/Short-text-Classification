what are some of the major differences in brick and stucco i am going to build a house and wanted to know pros and cons of both espcially price pricewise the brick will be more expensive but is a heck of lot nicer i use the word heck because i am new to answers and don't know the rules too well it's a word we used when i was around my architect father who taught me all about construction stucco is a mix of cement with fibres that is applied to wire mesh nailed to plywood or building board it can come in colors so you can get a nice effect that is cheaper than brick in the south where i learned my first building trades and didn't need the thermal protection that brick offers many owners opted for brick veneers houses built of wood on all sides but enhanced at the front of the house with specially chosen brick attached to the plywood over pine stud framing yankees who went by in the old days were fooled into thinking the house was all brick but then they never were as smart as us southerners in conclusion brick is nicer stucco is cheaper Seismic retrofit Masonry Stucco Light-frame construction McMansion Drill bit Straw-bale construction Timber framing Adobe Natural building Wood Plywood Microeconomics Textile manufacturing Tudorbethan architecture Plastic Tea Parquetry Iranian architecture Mattress Wrigley Field Asbestos Brick Boat building Arlington House Solar power Upholstery Poker jargon Modem Radio controlled airplane Commodore 64 Insulation Siding Rochester Institute of Technology Concrete Architecture Air-raid shelter Magic: The Gathering Wayne Corporation The Wall Theory of conduct Dog agility Radeon Temple (Mormonism) Model aircraft Canadian National Exhibition Bridgwater Bicycle brake systems Transformer Rail tracks Aluminium Geodesic dome Dragon Booster The Apprentice 2 Window The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Angkor Wat Autonomous building Naval mine Egyptian pyramids Maya civilization Sport utility vehicle Apple Macintosh Roof United States Capitol Lego Badshahi Masjid Milwaukee, Wisconsin Gambling Assonet, Massachusetts Ridge Route Hoo Peninsula Tariff Bungalow Construction Atari ST Ceramics ATI Technologies IPod Oriented strand board Platform framing Supply and demand New York Giants Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Domus Aurea One Tree Hill (TV series) GeForce 4 Satchel Paige Welding Chimney Humphrey Bogart California Polytechnic State University Blockland Illegal drug trade De Havilland Mosquito Reinforced concrete Shepherdstown, West Virginia Steel Paintball
