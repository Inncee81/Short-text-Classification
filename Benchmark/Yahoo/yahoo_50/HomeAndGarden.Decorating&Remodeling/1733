grout for tile installation we just had our tile installed and the contractor asked on the nd day if we would be putting corner round down i said yes but the end result is that they left of the walls without grout and stated that you should put caulk down before the corner round the reason being is that the caulk will give more than grout would when heat cold causes things to expand contract there are some areas in door jams linen closets pantry where i feel like it should definately should have grout you aren't going to put corner round there for one and two caulk would look tacky there on it's own i need everyone's advice please help i need to get these people back out here to fix this thanks i realize there is caulk that will match but is that the way it should be done on a professional install we paid to have this installed and i want it done correctly and not just what will 'work well' first off i have been in the flooring business for almost years and have never heard of leaving expansion space around the walls on a ceramic installation normally the tile is run right up to the base board and the quarteround is installed on top of the tile as for the doorways its sounds as if the installers did not use a jamb saw and undercut the doors if this method had been used it would appear that you had a full tile going under the door i hope you are dealing with a reputable company because it defiantly sounds like you have some installation issues if you paid by credit card i would dispute the charges or put a stop on the check until the issues have been taken care of to your satisfaction if you can't get the store or the contractor to cooperate you may want to have the job inspected by a certified flooring inspector having their report in hand can go a long way they usually charge between and for the inspection but from what you are saying it may be money well spent they are correct about the caulk being more expandable but it sounds to me like they are trying to get out of doing a lot of work by the way if you do use caulk you can purchase caulk that matches the grout color yo have selected Poker jargon Kitchen Internet fraud Tile Inflation Ra (board game) Sento Wal-Mart Annuity Elevator Asbestos Surveillance Mahjong Wallpaper group Handloading Oil-for-Food Programme National Health Service Lighting Seismic retrofit Social rule Drill bit Scrabble (game show) Spark plug Wood carving Stairway Wall Street Plame affair STS-114 Mac OS X Windows XP Avenue Q Nuclear proliferation Credit card London Underground Tic-Tac-Dough Textile manufacturing Door National Kidney Foundation Singapore ISO 9000 The Parting of the Ways History of Microsoft Windows Fischer Random Chess Mutual fund King Khalid International Airport Time Out of Mind Alex Ferguson Hyperinflation The Sims 2 Solar power JPEG Slot machine Software engineering Space Shuttle program MTR Topps Dundas Square IPod Insurance Nuclear power Knots Landing Microeconomics Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ITV Cheating in Counter-Strike Internal ballistics ROM hacking Carpet Bush v.
