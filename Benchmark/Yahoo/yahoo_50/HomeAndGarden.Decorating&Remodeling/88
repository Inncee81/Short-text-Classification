better bathroom lighting i currently have tube fluorescent light over the vanity and a ceiling light with three watt compact fluorescent bulbs in them i hate the lighting in the bathroom i can't see anything my friends bathroom has great lighting i'd like to improve mine two problems i have one it's a rental so no remodeling and two there is only outlet it's on the vanity fixture so it's just a single not a double wall outlet so i can't plug something in since i need the outlet for blow dryer curling iron etc are there other types of bulbs or fixture covers that will enhance skin makeup details etc thanks mikelyt but i did think of that and cleaned them not much difference i think they are original to the house which was built in the 's so the fluorescent one is like that bakelite plastic and the ceiling one is the beveled glass i hate fluorescent lighting for everything but especially the bathroom but one fix that might help a little not the end all answer but improvement check the kelvin rating on the light bulbs ignore things like cool white warm white daylight ect the on the bulb will usually have a at the end like or this will give you the color kelvin is really yellow kelvin is similar to cool white i think it looks a little blue makes you look dead or k i think is the best its the brightest whitest so this might help bring up the light in there a little k most people see a little red with this this will make you look better in the mirror like adds color to your skin so not a good color if its the room where you put on makeup Lighting Compact fluorescent lamp Fluorescent lamp Light-emitting diode Stage lighting Glass Color temperature Color Vacuum tube Solar power Japanese toilet Washroom Fan (implement) Light Bicycle lighting Cannabis cultivation Ultraviolet Black body Houseplant White Headlight Kitchen Fluorescence History of street lighting in the United States Bathroom Microscopy Electrodeless lamp Brewery Diode Mercury-vapor lamp Temperature Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Bus models used in New York City Transit Light pollution Diamond color Staining (biology) Game Boy Transformer Wayne Corporation Christmas tree Material properties of diamond Wallpaper group Thermal power station Reef tank Laser Soap bubble M16 (rifle) Basement Gamut Diamond simulant Diamond Buckingham Palace Rei Ayanami Photometry (optics) Toilet Paul Is Dead Switch Human skin color Electrical wiring (UK) Technicolor Compact disc William Murdoch Color blindness Flush toilet BS 1363 Ammolite The Brady Bunch Milk Sunglasses Drag racing Turquoise Hamster Carburetor Filter (optics) Nuclear weapon design EastEnders Battery (electricity) School bus Beryllium Casting Spectrophotometry Toilet paper Aluminium Acne Paint Poker jargon The Young Ones (TV series) Characters in the Smurfs
