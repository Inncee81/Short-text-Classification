how much would it cost to put up walls in a nyc apartment the space is a duplex apartment with basically two loft style floors we would be creating bedrooms out of this space so we would need approximity walls with doors built i'm not sure of the exact dimensions but figure each wall would be about feet long and feet high since we are on a tight budget we would be looking to do this as cheap as possible if we hired someone to do this work around how much would it cost and how long would it take thanks the best way for you to figure out cost is to figure out how many studs you will need figure one at the top and bottom and then roughly for the actually walls if you build it on center then figure out your sheet rock standard size is 'x ' so you would need maybe per side of the wall then figure some misc lumber for headers and what not on the doors and then price the pre made doors from lowes and home depot add some for materials like screws nails finish for the sheetrock etc and you should have an idea of cost you could spend about an hour or so at a lowe's or hd and get a rough idea of cost as far as labor for someone to do it who knows check and see if you have to have a permit to do it if not maybe your building super could do it for some side money Drill bit Stairway Light-frame construction Seismic retrofit Door Timber framing Poker jargon Slide rule Straw-bale construction Upholstery Solar cell Screw Microeconomics Glossary of partner dance terms Wal-Mart View camera Kitchen Bus models used in New York City Transit Gross domestic product Dundas Square Xanadu House Economy of Russia Chatsworth House Wrigley Field Items in the Metroid series Passenger car Wood carving Brewery Solomon's Temple Redundant array of independent disks Architecture of the California missions The Apprentice 2 Solar power satellite Wilton House Inflation Hartford, Connecticut Campbell, California Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Free trade Glacier Public transport Air-raid shelter Saturn V Floppy disk Wall Street Professional wrestling throws Solar power Rigging Volleyball Preferred number Pickup truck Mattress Equine conformation Boat building STS-61 Hamster Lumber Welding Geodesic dome Rail tracks Milwaukee, Wisconsin Handloading Harp De Lorean DMC-12 Swingout Keynesian economics Electrical wiring Labor theory of value McMansion Contredanse Dam Labour economics Masonry Space Shuttle program Tesco Piano Coffee Mutual fund Softball Port Authority Trans-Hudson Asset Cost accounting Abbey Betting (poker) Donald Trump Bungalow Platform framing Tide Personal rapid transit TGV Lighting Window Social Security debate (United States) Blood Simple Golf club (equipment) Horseshoe Blackjack Amateur telescope making
