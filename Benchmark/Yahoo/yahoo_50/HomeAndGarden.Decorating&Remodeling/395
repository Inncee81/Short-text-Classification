will i need planning permission to build a conservatory on my patio my house was extended when i bought it and has a raised patio for which there was planning permission i want to erect a small conservatory m by m so will i need to seek further planning permission to do this i got conflicting advice from two different conservatory companies thanks at the moment the government says you need planning permission pp for any permanent building over meter in length you will need pp for a conservatory at the moment but there are plans in the pipeline that will take conservatories and loft extensions out of the planning process phone your local council and ask them to put you through to the planning dept for advice and then speak to the council's building control depts for what you may or may not do before you even buy a brick they will give you the law building regulations and all the in outs of what you may may not do before you even start if it comes to within meter of a neighbours propery then there may be other problems all cases are different but the local council will sort it for you building control advice help is free and pp will cost you around i think ignore the conservatory companies at the moment as they will say what is more suitable for them and gives them the most profit find your facts first and then you can tell the companies that you know what you are taking about and save yourself Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal Public domain Capernaum Capitalism Asian financial crisis Economy of the United States Externality CPU design Copyright Plame affair Judicial functions of the House of Lords Royal Assent The Brady Bunch President of Ireland Privatization CPU cache First Amendment to the United States Constitution Donald Rumsfeld Stock Privacy MTR Parliament of the United Kingdom Life insurance Zoning Monopoly Democracy Microeconomics Poker jargon United Kingdom corporation tax Compiler optimization Neighbours Media in Hong Kong Edward Gibbon Wakefield Lechaina Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Battersea House of Lords Parliament of Canada Ford Motor Company Government of India United States House of Representatives Cray-1 Economic calculation problem Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Emerson College Israeli settlement Abortion debate Trade union Enron Corporation Extreme Programming East Germany The Inside Corporation International law Cable television Copyright law of the United Kingdom Mergers and acquisitions UK telephone numbering plan Smoking ban Woking America Online Corporate governance Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Council house Mach kernel Privy Council of the United Kingdom Timeline of the Enron scandal Head of state Turkey Mutual fund Robert Walpole Coombe, Croydon Landmark decision Health insurance Sega Saruman Legal research Monarchy in Canada American individualist anarchism Bolivian Gas War Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center Divorce Archaeological field survey Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Judicial review RISC ITV John Kerr Kingsley Hall Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ethical consumerism TGV Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Intellectual property Search engine optimization Short selling O'Connell Street British East India Company
