new house needs redecorating help where to begin just bought a new house it's awesome but dated where should i even begin the updating do you suggest working on one room at a time or painting everything first or what so overwhelmed i would start at the top down by that i mean start with infrastructure and repairs such as replacing lighting and fixing ceiling wall cracks any type of plumbing or electrical rewiring should come first you want to do most of the dirty work before painting and certainly before you redo any floor treatments i would choose to start in my bedroom so i have a nice relaxing finished place to rest as i work on the whole house or you may want to begin in the living or family room for the same reason you want to finish one room so you have somewhere to go that doesnt need work congratulations on your new home and have fun Kitchen Buckingham Palace Chatsworth House Wilton House Xanadu House Japanese tea ceremony Basement House Viva La Bam Blenheim Palace Sento McMansion Super Chief The Amazing Race Dundas Square Christiansborg Palace Assonet, Massachusetts Sundial Sicilian Baroque Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Jumpstart 3rd Grade Wood carving Rathfarnham Professional wrestling match types Bungalow Francis Bacon (painter) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Bus models used in New York City Transit Home repair Animal Crossing Lighting Enigma machine Seismic retrofit The Brady Bunch Drag racing Out-of-body experience St Albans Cathedral Holkham Hall Le Corbusier Siegfried Line Bratislava Castle Home improvement Scenes from a Memory Harrow School De Lorean DMC-12 Irish Houses of Parliament Fan (implement) 10 Downing Street BMW The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past National Statuary Hall Urinary incontinence Sistine Chapel Thermal power station Hikikomori Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur Mansion Swingout University of Virginia Bathroom Preston, Minnesota British Rail Class 86 Perfect Dark Grand Central Terminal Monticello Tuileries Palace Lance Armstrong Plastic Timber framing Toilet Paint Solar cell Dialysis The Young Ones (TV series) Squidward Tentacles Tintoretto Fire fighting Toyota Prius Washroom Serenity (Firefly vessel) Rachel Whiteread Hogwarts Floor Directory Light switch Carnival Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Ca' Rezzonico Counter-Strike Sea-Monkey Daylight saving time Elevator Roxette Grace Cossington Smith GunZ The Duel Semiconductor device Lionel Corporation CPU cache Airbus A380 __atalh__y__k John Cage Palace of Westminster
