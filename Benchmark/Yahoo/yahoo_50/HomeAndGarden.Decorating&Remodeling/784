need opinions on what color to paint my front door i live in a brick ranch which is a very boring tan color the roof is a light brown it's all very neutral and boring i want to paint my front door to add some color the window in my front door has a covering over it which is in purple tones so people can't see in i was thinking of going with an eggplant color one neighbor says it'll look good and the other said it won't i also thought about going with a bronze color but again my neighbors said its too orange any ideas no red please go for the eggplant color it's your house not your neighbors if you don't like it simply paint it again green would work great it is opposite purple on the color wheel which means it will work with the window covering plus it will stand out against the light colored brick one other option is to put blinds over the window so that the window covering isn't seen from outside hope this helps Color theory Color Dodge Charger Poker jargon Color blindness Dragon Booster Pysanka Porsche 993 Grace Cossington Smith Microsoft Paint Sento Shaggy dog story Light-emitting diode Dodge Aspen Ford Thunderbird Wayne Corporation St Albans Cathedral Wilton House Wassily Kandinsky BZFlag Synaesthesia School bus Camouflage Honda Prelude Window Cleveland Browns Wallpaper group Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Fluorescent lamp Sunglasses Wood carving BMW M5 Georges-Pierre Seurat Collectibles in Bionicle In-N-Out Burger Sistine Chapel Bungalow Stage lighting Lighting IPod Purple Mnemonic BMW Z1 Lamborghini Diablo Eagle Talon Beret Japanese tea ceremony Paint G-Man (Half-Life) Pontiac Trans Sport Mercedes-Benz A-Class Door M&M's Mario Car body style Station wagon Marching band Chatsworth House Michel Henry Eye color Romney, West Virginia Gamut Volkswagen Type 2 Black PNG De Lorean DMC-12 Sega Saturn Buick Skylark Architecture of the California missions Chess strategy and tactics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Colours, standards and guidons Imperial (automobile) Newark, New Jersey Human skin color Tag Political colour Volvo 200 series The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll CIE 1931 color space Humphrey Bogart Pantheon, Rome RGB color model BNSF Railway Nintendo GameCube Judo Lamborghini Countach Rainbow flag Palace of Westminster Garnet Skateboarding trick Property tax Bus models used in New York City Transit Gothic architecture Rais massacre McMansion Wheel of Fortune Arsenal F.C.
