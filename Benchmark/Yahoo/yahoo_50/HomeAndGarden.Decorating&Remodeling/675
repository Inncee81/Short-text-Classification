hanging wallpaper border on painted walls ok so my walls originally were wallpapered when we moved in then we painted them and then we painted them again i want to do a border so how should i go about doing that will it even stick any special types of glue tape just follow the directions on the border it should stick if not wait until it is dry and where you have a spot that is not sticking use a glue stick and that will hold it another tip is to make sure you don't move the paper around to much make sure you put it where you want it and have a wet rag to smooth out the bubbles and wrinkles Wallpaper Wallpaper group Upholstery Stucco Skateboarding trick Adhesive Papier-m__ch__ Genericized trademark Paper Aerial (dance move) Glaze Painting Glossary of partner dance terms Sandpaper Masking tape Radio controlled airplane Paint Autostereogram Inhalant Fan (implement) Casting Billiards Glossary of climbing terms Tag Bookbinding Arcade cabinet Pottery Violin Surrealist techniques M.C.
