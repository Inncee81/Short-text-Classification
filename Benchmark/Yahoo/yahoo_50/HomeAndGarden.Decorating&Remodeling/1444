can you help me out with room design my room is being rebuilt wright now i am years old and i am kinda into salsa dancing and stuff therefore i would like to have my room design inspired by this latin motive but at the same time it should be comfy help would be needed with walls floor etc if you have any suggestions about something that i should put in the room please share your idea thank you in general when you're starting from a fresh pallet it's easiest to start out with the most bold patterned items first which is usually area rugs bedding and artwork with latin design you will want a lot of bold all over so starting with these first is even more important because you want things to come together when you feel like you have enough bold and pattern with any combination of these things then take the colors in those pieces and find your paint and other solid colors when i think of latin design i think of colors with lots of contrast reds yellows oranges maybe even a dark primary blue since you're i'm guessing either at home or in a rental i would recommend doing this in painting the walls with these colors as permitted of course a rusty yellowy orange would be fun because it's inexpensive you your parents can always paint over it if need be also bedding and area rugs are a great way to express yourself but you can take it with you when you move a bold area rug would lend to your need for the salsa style but also make it comfy too also there is nothing wrong with putting an area rug over plain neutral boring carpeting i hate it when people fight this because the color of an area rug makes such a difference in the room even if carpet is there already hope this helps good luck Care Bears Carpet Color theory Wood carving Glossary of partner dance terms Color Blood on the Tracks Salsa music Wilton House Casting Salsa (dance) Fancy rat Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Light-emitting diode Music genre Color blindness Grace Cossington Smith Art Time Out of Mind My Little Pony 2000 Australian Grand Prix Wassily Kandinsky Rococo Camouflage Strap-on dildo Mid-levels Fischer Random Chess Drill bit Wallpaper group Squidward Tentacles Objective-C Animal Crossing Cascading Style Sheets Baroque music Bubble Bobble Super Mario 64 Red Collectibles in Bionicle Pysanka Wood Consensus decision-making Tarot Textile manufacturing terminology Sento XML Kitchen Opportunity rover Stanton Macdonald-Wright The Young Ones (TV series) Culture of Korea Xanadu House Milton H.
