our bed is in the corner how do i define the space behind it my hubby and i have our queen size bed on an angle in the corner of the room so there's a big cavernous triangular space behind it i want to do something dramatic in that space or on the walls to frame the bed but don't have any good ideas we have a small wood headboard on our bed already any ideas i did this when we had our room arranged that way i got plastic trellis from the lumberyard and put that up to the ceiling behind the headboard and across the ceiling over the bed i bought some fake ivy from michael's and wove that into the trellis and put a few mini lights in for special effects i painted the walls sky blue white linens on the bed and grass green area rugs on the hard wood floor i also used ivy as tiebacks for the sheers i thought it looked very nice my husband wasn't quite as enthusiastic about it we changed it completely years later Chatsworth House Kitchen Carpet Mattress Wilton House Lighting Seismic retrofit Wood carving Milton H.
