i'm a beginning guitarist what is the best acoustic guitar to start out with as a beginner the best acoustic guitar that you could start out with in my opinion would be one that someone could loan you this will help you figure out not only what types you like how big neck width etc but it will help you really decide if you actually like the instrument it would be a shame to spend loads of money on a guitar and end up getting frustrated deciding you can't possibly make this instrument make a half decent note and have it end up in the attic but i found that buying one from a used guitar place is pretty good for when you feel that you are committed to this instrument and want one you can call your own the guitar i got was a slightly used wash burn guitar wash burns are not top of the line like fenders and gibson but are pretty good check for the appropriate size guitar body for you because of course you don't want one intended for a child so that when you play it looks like your playing a ukulele also check for the width across the neck where the strings are at the top can your hand fit comfortably around it small hands need small necks spanish styles guitars usually have a wider neck so big hands would be better for this one decide weather you are a lefty or a right left handed guitars shouldn't be hard to find in the more expensive stores but they can be harder to find a make you like that is also lefty in used guitar place try holding it ask for help if you need it from staff do you feel comfortable holding it strum it dose it sound good if it doesn't ask a staff member if they could tune it up for you once you picked one out ask about cases if they come with the guitar or are separate usually you get it with the guitar and if not they are about dollars they are a good investment to keep your guitar safe from scratches and such depending on how nice the staff is and how good of a barterer you are you could get the guitar and case for a reasonable amount i got both for plus some picks and a chord book free picks are cheap about cents each pick up a book with some chords on it don't go to expensive though you can get chords and tabs so songs on the internet for free personally i like this site easy to read got loads of songs http www ultimate guitar com practice like mad enough so you start to get callouses on your fingertips you'll know when you have them because it wont hurt you fingers when you press them on the strings take about months with regular guitar playing to get good ones once you get really good you can get a really cool guitar that can switch between acoustic and electric awesome really and amaze your friends good luck god bless happy playing Electric guitar Violin Double bass Tablature Acoustic guitar Mandolin Banjo Twelve string guitar Jimi Hendrix Slide guitar Harp Ukulele Dobro Charango Fender Telecaster Pet Sounds Eddie Van Halen Social rule Floppy disk Highway 61 Revisited Bluegrass music Saxophone Stevie Ray Vaughan Brian Jones (musician) Pedal steel guitar Theory of conduct Clarinet Aerial (dance move) Time Out of Mind Equine conformation Poker jargon Menstrual cup Brian May Jazz Piano Cello Floyd Rose Handloading Hyperinflation Sampling (music) Queen (band) Textile manufacturing 1957 World Series Trey Anastasio Blues Strap-on dildo String instrument R.E.M.
