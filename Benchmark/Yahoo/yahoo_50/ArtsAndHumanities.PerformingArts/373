an acoustic guitar for beginner i'm looking for a decent acoustic guitar for no more than i'm planning to buy it online preferably at musician's friend buying online should be a last resort with most brands even when you pick a great brand two different axes made the same day right after each other will have vastly different temperments taylor is really the only brand i'd trust buying without actually playing one taylors are expensive the brands that tend to be best for somebody new to a guitar would be ibenez or seagull both make pretty good quality low end guitars often they are competitive with mid price range guitars but are very inexpensive fender and gibson both make beginner packs but your going to get a much better guitar going with ibenez or seagull for the same price range some of the low end yamaha's are also pretty good guitars if you stretch your budget to you get into the mid range guitars and then your talking about gibsons fenders alverezs yamahas worth owning you might even find a used dean or ovation or taylor in that price range that doesn't mean the music shops around your area will have a good one so you want to actually go in and get a feel for the guitar play it see how it feels too you you want to look for any warping of the neck you also want acceptable action action is the distance between the strings and the frets the higher the action the harder it is to play the guitar just as important is you don't want dead spots or buzz on the strings if your never ever going to play down past the th fret you still want a guitar that doesn't buzz or have dead spots to check for buzz and dead spots play each fret down the fretboard they should all sound clear a buzz will make the same sound as if your not holding the string down tight enough that means the action is too low and the string is actually impinged by the fret a deadspot is a note that has a noticiably lower volume than other notes on the fretboard always triple check to make sure you've fretted the string correctly before deciding a fret buzzes or has a dead spot normally strings either buzz up at the st or nd fret or buzz down past the th fret dead spots tend to be in the th to th frets and i've never heard a guitar that had dead spots in consequetive frets so pick a guitar that speaks to you one that fits well with your hands that has the sound that you want that is why it is so hard to buy a guitar online Violin Electric guitar Double bass Fender Telecaster Tablature Fret Floyd Rose John Myung Acoustic guitar Brian May Sitar Slide guitar Cello Mandolin Twelve string guitar Fingerboard Dobro Berimbau Lap steel guitar Clarinet Van Halen Lute Classical guitar Stevie Ray Vaughan Jimi Hendrix Chapman Stick Mike Watt Audiophile Piano Time Out of Mind Fender Stanley Jordan Poker jargon Bluegrass music Pedal steel guitar Hurdy gurdy Microeconomics Banjo Fender Stratocaster Tapping Strap-on dildo Equine conformation Gibson Les Paul Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Acoustic bass guitar Synthesizer Player piano Guqin Authentic performance Vowel Gramophone record Harmonic series (music) PRS Guitars Bicycle lighting The Beatles' influence The Jam Intonation String instrument Pet Sounds Pat Metheny Mattress MP3 Flute John Frusciante Tony Iommi GunZ The Duel Blonde on Blonde Equal temperament Chess strategy and tactics $ale of the Century Power chord Stradivarius Anthony Jackson Textile manufacturing Zakk Wylde Alexi Laiho Loudspeaker Musical acoustics Alembic Inc Jethro Tull (band) Multitrack recording Epiphone Therion (band) Grateful Dead String theory Saxophone Mutual fund Pop punk Surveillance
