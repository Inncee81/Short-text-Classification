cello help i have been playing cello for about months my teacher isn't that good so she doesn't really teach anything 'extra' so my question is how can i make my cello sound sweeter the only chord i can play okay is d but a sounds very loud and harsh then g c sounds blurry if you know what i mean the longrt the answers the better chords do you mean notes a chord is a series of three notes which would necessitate playing a double stop or triple stop two or three strings at the same time i believe you are talking about playing open strings at lest i hope so the cello is not really set up to play chords that's the reason the bridge is so rounded if you are having trouble with tone there are several things ayou may want to check is your bow primed when you first get your brand new bow you need to run it across your rosin from frog to tip about one hundred to one hundred and fifty times when the bow starts pulling against the rosin it is probably ready to try against the strings after that you should run it across the rosin four or five times every time you get ready to play how fresh are you strings many school and rental instruments have strings that have not been changed since the instrument was purchased strings are expensive so i don't say this lightly but if the windings are starting to separate or the string is starting to sound dead it might be time to change it you can also improve the sound of your strings by cleaning them if there is built up rosin on the bottom of the strings especially down towards the bridge it will definitely affect the way the instrument sounds is your sound post set properly look into the f hole and you should see a wooden dowel running up and down the center of the instrument almost right under where the bridge should be if you don't see the dowel or if the dowel is tilted or loose let your teacher know right away you may have a mute installed between the bridge and the tailpiece look at the strings on the other side of the bridge if there is a big black piece of rubber on there it is a mute and it might be muffling your tone you may not be bowing perpendicular to the instrument if you are bowing at an angle or swaying with your bow you are not going to get that sweet full sound you are looking for your teacher should be able to help you there if you have a couple extra minutes to spend or just make absolutely sure you are bowing straight across halfway between the fingerboard and the bridge there are two little notches at approximately the center of each f hole if your bridge is not set at the notches or is tilted in any way it will affect your sound also cello bridges can often warp which will move the strings too close to the fingerboard that will also deaden the sound one of the things you can do with little or no problem is to try out a friend's instrument or an instrument at the music store if you have the same problem with another instrument it is more likely to be your technique you need to examine if you can get a good sound on another instrument but not yours it is more likely to be your instrument i posted a few links to help get you started down towards the bottom there are sites that have free music and scales for the cello if you run out and need something more just give me a shout Harp Guitar Bass guitar Mute (music) String instrument Big band Bow (music) Mandolin Musical terminology Timpani Poker jargon Viola Hurdy gurdy Harmonic series (music) Saxophone Double stop Fingerboard Upholstery Guqin Bassoon Gramophone record Drill bit Harmonica Sundial Billiards Shaggy dog story Fret Professional wrestling holds Santoor Slide guitar Archery Social rule Embouchure Berimbau Harmonic Blood on the Tracks Equine conformation Pinball Musical mode Vibrato Trombone Uilleann pipes Equal temperament Banjo Movie projector Tonality Floppy disk Orchestra Sonata form Mattress Krzysztof Penderecki Anchor English longbow 1957 World Series Harpsichord Viol Key (music) Sonata (music) Halting problem Legend of Zelda series songs Tablature Blues Glossary of partner dance terms Mario Davidovsky Olivier Messiaen Trumpet Volleyball Hardingfele Wood Bridge (stringed instrument) Japanese tea ceremony Trigonometric function International Phonetic Alphabet A Hard Day's Night (song) Bow (weapon) Chess terminology Fender Telecaster Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Electric Light Orchestra Old-time music Stairway Pet Sounds Glossary of nautical terms M16 (rifle) GunBound
