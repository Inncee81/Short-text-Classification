did audience members actually throw tomatoes at bad performers in the past this question might sound ridiculous i know but i wanted to know the answer i always wondered where the hell the audience got tomatoes to throw from i can't imagine people going to a show carrying a big box of tomatoes just to throw at performers whom they think it's bad did audiences actually used to throw things on stage at people who they thought sucked or is this some old joke myth tomatoes cabbages rotten fruit and eggs deadly potatoes anything was fair game they didn't bring bushels in by the way it was all carried in the large pockets of their waistcoats and other discrete hiding places you cannot imagine that the proprietors would approve of such a thing but it was all part of the entertainment spoiled food was relatively easy to find since there was no refrigeration and if you got to throw it at someone then you still got some value out of it i suppose the performer didn't have to be bad either if the performer was doing something that wasn't to the crowd's taste or if the overall mood was bad even a good performer could receive a blessing this was especially true of late shows after the audience had already had some refreshment or shows at the end of the month or just before payday it was your responsibility as a performer to lift that audience out of it's foul mood and woe betide you if you did not play to the audience there were some performers who refused to even set foot on a stage during a full moon but an audience was just as likely to heap praise upon you if you were successful so that superstition eventually died out remnants or this tradition exist today how many country bars and biker bars have chicken wire draped over the stage to deflect beer cans and shot glasses how many comedians end their careers because they cannot overcome the hecklers that inevitably show up at every performance the tradition may have become watered down but it has never died and who knows if the best that the recording industry can offer us are spoiled teenage alcoholics who can't sing or act their way out of a traffic court the whole thing might just be revived again Tomato Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Lucille Ball Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Magic (illusion) Saturday Night Live Ron and Fez Clown MRE Russian joke Joke Volleyball Theory of conduct Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Cuisine of Denmark Film RuneScape quests Conker's Bad Fur Day McDonald's Spidey Super Stories EastEnders Poker jargon Chili con carne Minstrel show Hey Jude I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Stand-up comedy Whose Line Is It Anyway?
