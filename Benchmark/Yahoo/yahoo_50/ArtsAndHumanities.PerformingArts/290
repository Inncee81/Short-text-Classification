would it be wierd if i added snares to my piece gretsch i found a nice little dw side snare x and a pacific snare x to go with a pork pie little squealer x but i can't tell wether or not to buy them all to replace my current birch snare do what you want to it's your set i know of one jazz cat who had snares on everything but his tenor toms and bass he liked the sound he got with brushes who knows he never had a night off so i guess it worked for him have you added a tenor tom to the left behind your high hat yet that is also a really effective piece and a real show stopper when you half stand and play the toms to the left and right of you i used to have a high hat with a sizzle cymbal on top and a lead plate on the bottom man could that thing put out some sounds it can also be very effective to get one of those center mounted high hats you really have to squeeze it in there between the snare and the alto toms but it makes for some really effective cross sticking never hurts to get triggers placed in the drums along with built in mikes if you are looking for different sounds you might as well go whole hog and plug in a sound bank mixing a taste of the synthisized sounds with your acoustic kit can really blow the room away best of luck no matter what you decide to do Drum kit Marching percussion Big band Snare drum Mike Portnoy Hi-hat DrumMania Timpani Bass drum Tom-tom drum Trombone Saxophone Harmonica Percussion instrument Marching band Double bass Bass guitar Clarinet Pet Sounds Wrigley Field 2Step Trapping Bouncy techno Danny Carey Blonde on Blonde Flute King Crimson Herbie Hancock Drum and bugle corps (modern) Trey Anastasio Electric guitar Jon Theodore Clef Concert band Neil Peart Highway 61 Revisited Violin House music Streetlight Manifesto Grateful Dead Guitar Jethro Tull (band) Empire Burlesque Cello Maureen Tucker Magical objects in Harry Potter Drum stick Drum 1957 World Series Travis Barker Hip hop music Western concert flute Hornbostel-Sachs Tris Speaker Ride cymbal Disco Sampling (music) Microphone Roland TR-808 Bolero (Ravel) Winning Streak Blink-182 Songs in the Key of Life Hatful of Hollow Genesis (band) Synthesizer Animal Crossing The Four Tops Real Love (song) Pat Metheny Drum and bass John Coltrane Rabbit Sizzle cymbal Electronic drumming Mike Watt Buck Fever The Velvet Underground March (music) Blood on the Tracks John Frusciante Lars Ulrich Tom Waits Harp The Waterboys Miles Davis Paul Is Dead Incubus (band) Bassoon Roland TR-909 Curling Bagpipes Placebo (band) Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band High on the Hog Uilleann pipes
