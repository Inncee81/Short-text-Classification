does anyone know any amusing soprano baritone duets i have a recital coming up this spring and i'd like to do a duet with my boyfriend who is a baritone i am a soprano does anyone know of any entertaining classical style duets for these voice types other than the zerlina giovanni duet from don giovanni which we've already sang other than la ci darem la mano from don giovanni there's also crudel perch finora from the marriage of figaro there's also figaro and susanna's opening duet from the marriage of figaro though figaro is technically a bass the role is in the range of most baritones of these my favorite may be crudel perch finora susanna is tricking the count into supposedly meeting her int he garden for a tryst which he is all too willing to do it is the countess who will be waiting there for him dressed as susanna and throughout the duet susanna is desperately trying to keep her story straight the opening duet from the marriage of figaro is cute with figaro measuring their new bedroom for a bed but it's not really that amusing unless you do the whole scene consisting of the first duet the following recitative the second duet the next recitative and figaro's first cavatina through these numbers susanna is able to convince figaro that the noble count wants to sleep with her granted this sequence is not very long but it might be a little much for a recital especially given that your boyfriend would have the big solo not you there's also the papageno papagena duet from the magic flute papageno has been wishing throughout the opera for a mate who will suit him near the end his wish is granted and he finds himself with his feathered beloved they stutter a lot it's lots of fun by the way if you do stuff from the marriage of figaro in translation i recommend the w h auden translation in the score published by boozey and hawkes if you can find it the g schirmer edition with the ruth and thomas martin translation is much cheaper and more widely available but auden was by far the superior poet Don Giovanni Die Zauberfl__te Soprano The Barber of Seville The Creation Baritone Carmen The Queen of Spades Saxophone Mezzo-soprano Opera Tenor Coloratura Rigoletto (opera) Trombone Igor Stravinsky Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Shaggy dog story Madama Butterfly Bassoon La boh__me Rom__o et Juliette Philip Glass Bryn Terfel Hilary Duff Baritone saxophone Die Entf__hrung aus dem Serail Don Pasquale Porgy and Bess Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven) Tosca Turandot W.
