i am left handed and would like to play the guitar should i get a left or right handed guitar would a natural left hander playing a right handed guitar be a better player than a natural right handed person because of the natural left hand using the fret ps i am a total novice with no guitar but am thinking of getting one hey my son is left handed and we just had to address this issue like above i would advise you to do whatever seems natural to you try holding strumming and plucking a right handed guitar if it doesn't feel totally weird go that direction if it does feel totally weird go to a music store that has a left handed instrument and try that attempt to learn the one that feels least unusual this is the advice i got when i asked somebody the same question on behalf of my left handed son at the end of the day we bought him a right handed guitar that he is learning to play as you probably already know most left handed people are more capable with their right hands than are right handed people with their left hands Bass guitar Tablature Mandolin Double bass Pedal steel guitar Twelve string guitar Sitar Blood on the Tracks Banjo Guitar Plectrum Violin Dobro Lap steel guitar Chapman Stick Fret Michael Hedges Guqin Music of Ireland Classical guitar Lute Stanley Jordan Viol Blonde on Blonde Sampling (music) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Bon Jovi Appalachian dulcimer Cello Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (album) Slapping String instrument Acoustic guitar Time Out of Mind Cliff Richard Left-handed "Weird Al" Yankovic Fingerpicking Rush (band) Pizzicato Blackjack Slide guitar Hey Jude Contredanse A Course In Miracles Kurt Cobain Tapping Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Goodness and value theory Harp Infidels Monarchy in Canada Jewish principles of faith Tony Iommi Timpani The Beatles' influence David Hume Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Andr__s Segovia Guitar/synthesizer Jimi Hendrix Musical notation Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead Rent (musical) Slow Train Coming Richard Kruspe-Bernstein Sonic Youth Vihuela Fender Stratocaster Plame affair Authentic performance I Want to Hold Your Hand Whose Line Is It Anyway?
