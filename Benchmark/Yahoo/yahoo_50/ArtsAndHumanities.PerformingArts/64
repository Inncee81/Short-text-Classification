how do you create vibrato when playing the clarinet i play the clarinet and i was wondering how do you do it indeed most clarinetists do not use vibrato in the same way a singer or a flutist does and many do not use vibrato at all some classical clarinetists jack brymer david shifrin will use vibrato to highlight a specific note or section of music as an expression like a dynamic level different styles of clarinet playing however require different tone colors and different levels of vibrato much jazz and ethnic world music require a much less refined tone quality than that used in classical playing for what i do which is balkan folk music the vibrato is used as a part of the tone color i use my abdominal muscles to pulse the sound throughout the tunes and occasionally color the sound further with a jaw vibrato to use the abs just think ha ha ha ha to begin with and eventually smooth out the initial h sounds to use the jaw just think aw aw aw with lip jaw motion and eventually with practice you can smooth that out too either way requires considerable air support and control as well as embouchure development and ab muscle control Vibrato Clarinet Embouchure Violin Western concert flute Authentic performance Trumpet Bassoon Music genre Viola Flute Oboe Synthesizer Bass clarinet Timpani Harmonica Timbre Music of Albania Recorder Piano Serialism Electric guitar Harmonic series (music) Clarinetist Music Harp Trombone Farfisa Mouthpiece Musical Instrument Digital Interface Orchestra Jazz Multiphonic Marching band Double bass Puberty Classical music era Guitar Musical terminology Tin whistle Shakuhachi Tonality Jack Brymer Tone cluster Klezmer Drawing European classical music Dixieland History of music Igor Stravinsky Eddie Van Halen Guqin Choir Interval (music) Music of Brittany Electronic organ Effects unit Music of Egypt Uilleann pipes Music history of the United States during the colonial era Music of the United States American popular music Bass guitar 20th century classical music Steve Reich Henry Cowell Video game music Electronic musical instrument Miles Davis Music history of the United States Funk Aspect of music Music of Nigeria Consonance and dissonance Sonata (music) Baroque music Louis Armstrong Surf music Tone (linguistics) Chess opening Conducting Music of Ireland Harpsichord Acoustic guitar Chinese language March (music) Salsa music Concert band Swing (genre) Folk music Mario Davidovsky Harmonium Ornette Coleman Original Dixieland Jass Band Renaissance music
