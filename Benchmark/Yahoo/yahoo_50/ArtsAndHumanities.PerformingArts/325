how do i make up a guitar solo i can play a ton of stuff that other people wrote after a while it's all just more of the same so i started making up my own stuff and while i can string chord progressions together i get completely bogged down trying to come up with any kind of solo where do i begin the important thing to remember is to play from your heart yes cheesy i know but also in order to write great guitar solos like so many rockers before you you have to bear in mind that they played the notes that sent chills down their spine most people don't realize that most solos were discovered just by goofing around your heart can tell you when a solo is right pick up your guitar and play it no particular strings just play any note you think up when you hit a certain chord sequence or something similar your heart will give a certain shudder build off of the chord sequence until you have your solo if your heart pounds at one sequence but slows at another take out the one that slows your heart etc the same thing happens to me on the saxophone when i play notes that no one has ever written down in the same order before i can always depend on my heart to tell me what greatness can come from it and sorry for making this answer sound like the end of a cheesy disney movie just play by your heart it wont let you down Phil Collins Chord (music) Double bass Buddy Guy Bluegrass music Key (music) Self Portrait 10cc Twelve string guitar Blonde on Blonde Big band Guitar Musical mode Shine On You Crazy Diamond Harmonica Bass guitar Empire Burlesque Figured bass Video game music Slide guitar Heavy metal music Blood on the Tracks The Who She Loves You Trey Anastasio Eddie Van Halen Musical terminology Supertramp Rod Stewart Sampling (music) Rich Mullins Umphrey's McGee Jazz Goldberg Variations Violin Tonality Red Hot Chili Peppers The Beatles Chick Corea Journey (band) Slow Train Coming Mandolin Britpop Jam band Steely Dan Hey Jude Brian Jones (musician) Wes Montgomery Tai Chi Chuan Pet Sounds Blues Nu metal Power chord Rock (music) Bohemian Rhapsody Albert King Death Cab for Cutie Musical notation The Isley Brothers Pedal steel guitar Syd Barrett Bringing It All Back Home A Hard Day's Night (song) Steve Reich Elton John Timpani Notable lines in the Star Wars series Acoustic guitar Split Enz Rhythm guitar Synthesizer Nine Inch Nails Cuatro Chicago (band) 1957 World Series Iggy Pop Sex Pistols Herbie Hancock Roxette Street-Legal Please Please Me Sonata (music) Jon Secada Layla Electric guitar Harp Crazy Little Thing Called Love Echoes (1971 song) I Want to Hold Your Hand They Might Be Giants Songwriter Joe Pass Mike Watt Brian May Highway 61 Revisited Vowel
