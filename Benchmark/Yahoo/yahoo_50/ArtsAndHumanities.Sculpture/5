hey sculptors is bronze sculpture an amiable profession fiscally i've looked into sculpture plenty of times and have made some pretty good amateur stuff at least i got in a publication once my concern always comes back to the extreme expense of getting something bronzed not to mention the amount of time it takes making a bronze from a to z by the time the thing gets sold are you really making anything worthy of a living half a living thanks for your opinion hi again thanks to all of you for great responses i don't find any response better than the rest i'll leave it to the voting population no you could get a job in a foundry though but a lot of foundries struggle as well and it will be a tough job if you have a daytime job don't quit until you sold enough pieces to give you an impression you can make a living of it it really depends how many comissions you get and not many get enough to make a living if you get a comission you would add the price for getting it cast in bronze into the total price if you work as a freelance sculptor you don't really get to do what you like you have to do what other people like Henry Moore Auguste Rodin Social rule Steel Norway national football team 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind Illegal drug trade Jacob Epstein Sampling (music) Microeconomics Aladdin (1992 film) Inflation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hey Jude Plastic Labor theory of value RuneScape quests Art forgery Digital photography RuneScape weapons Plaster The Apprentice 2 Wood carving Bronze sculpture Miniature figure Empire Burlesque EastEnders Glossary of sculpting terms Buffalo Bills Supply and demand The Kiss (Rodin sculpture) Sand casting Gross domestic product Capital accumulation 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Atomism Jacques Saly Mid-levels Iron Michelangelo Tax Art in Ancient Greece Plame affair Social Security (United States) Mattress National Kidney Foundation Singapore Jack Charlton It's Walky!
