when is the best time of year to transplant a peach tree i noticed a volunteer peach tree on the edge of the woods behind my house about feet tall can it be transplanted this fall or should i wait until spring i live in the mid atlantic states the best time to plant any tree is in the fall especially if it is dormant however don t waste time transplanting a volunteer fruit tree especially peach that tree has sprouted from seed and most peach trees grown from seed revert back genetically to poor quality and small peaches if you really want good peaches buy a modern variety that is almost always grafted onto good root stock it s a shame to waste years of taking care of a fruit tree only to have it start bearing fruit not fit to eat which is probably what will happen Fruit tree propagation Peach Apricot Grafting Sequoia Ginkgo Pruning fruit trees Apple Pollination Seed Tree Olive Flowering plant Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Fruit Johnny Appleseed Kiwifruit Tomato Agriculture Bamboo Citrus Prunus Vanilla Plant Cereal Luther Burbank Cannabis cultivation Durian Coconut Date Palm Acorn Pawpaw Liriodendron Maize Coffea arabica Vegetative reproduction Avocado Toxicodendron Dutch elm disease Mango Rowan Eucalyptus Pomegranate Pine Banksia Wood Black pepper Orange (fruit) Almond Rambutan Coast Douglas-fir Garden Strawberry Giant Sequoia Deforestation Fancy rat Peanut Green Revolution Hamster European Beech Banana Pear Agricultural machinery Organ transplant Monstera deliciosa Potato Weed control Budding Nut (fruit) Watermelon Health insurance Elderberry Wheat Frugivore Alfalfa Glastonbury Abbey Coriander Bonsai Flax Bone marrow transplant Malus Drupe Loganberry Cherry Wisteria Equine conformation Gypsy moth Fruitarianism Coffea Talbot County, Maryland Weed Ivy Logging Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Arecaceae Adjective Pikmin 613 mitzvot Pinophyta
