why is my butterfly bush wilting and dying off i have had a butterfly bush or years now it looks real good until it starts to get the buds it may have one or two blooms on it and then it starts to wilt and the center turns dark brown and the it dyes off this has happened every year since i have had it i have given it plant food and it gets the right kind of light but i am not sure what's going on with it please if you know anything about these plants give me some ideas thanks you don't mention how the leaves are during the bud dying process is it just affect the buds or leaves too where do you live how much sun does it get in any case wilting can be caused by both underwatering and overwatering ironic but true they are also susceptible to a few fungus diseases and occasionally get spider mites but i would think you would notice problems with the leaves too if those are the causes if truly the flower buds are the only parts affected then that's a head scratcher for me the fact that your bush is years on and then only gets one or two flower buds on it tells me there a possibility you are over fertilizing you should have way more flowers forming than that fertilizing some plants often will get you great looking foliage but precious few flowers i never really never fertilize my butterfly bush and it blooms profusely for lack of any other diagnosis i would refrain from fertilizing it and see what happens next year Flowering plant Leaf Gypsy moth Banana Carnivorous plant Biological pest control Physiological plant disorders Sunflower Soil pH Olive Bud Apple Pruning fruit trees Pysanka Hippeastrum Pinophyta Date Palm European Beech Tea Tobacco Prunus Eucalyptus Reproduction Soil life Plant Pachypodium brevicaule Rose Garden Strawberry Diseases of the honeybee Gooseberry Honey fungus Peach Flower Species AIDS Tomato Pachypodium ambongense Auxin Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pansy Spider Potato Wheat Butterfly stroke Insect Houseplant Fungus Illegal drug trade Pine Carbon dioxide Aphid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alfalfa Fruit tree propagation Pachypodium bicolor Allergy Animal The Ashlee Simpson Show Puberty Fruit Coeliac disease Wisteria Compost Morphology of Pachypodium Dutch elm disease Cotton plant The Time Machine Pachypodium baronii Bougainvillea Ragwort Butterfly Sex Bee Cannabis cultivation Dandelion Pollination Green tea Survivor (novel) Jellyfish Cephalic disorder Bonsai Tillandsia Capercaillie U.S. presidential election, 2000 Peanut Mitochondrial genetics Aesculus Livestock D'ni Ages Amaranth Fertilizer Chronic fatigue syndrome Grafting Wood Phytophthora infestans Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Algae
