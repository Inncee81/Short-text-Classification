can anyone suggest an edging for my small front garden i have a very small front garden which is paved and open plan at the moment i have flower tubs on it but children tend to play around there and because it's open plan they pick my flowers etc i was wondering if anyone could suggest a cheap edging to put around the garden it's a weird shape just to discourage small children from playing on there bearing in mind that it is paved and not soil any suggestions would be welcome thanks for answers so far can i just explain that i live in a quiet country village at the bottom of a cul de sac not a city town built up area i don't remember saying i lived in a built up area anyway i am a primary school teacher so well used to dealing with kids i am not averse to the children playing just want to define my area a bit more these are year old children who really shouldn't be playing out on their own but because we live in such a quiet rural area their parents think they are safe i just wanted to make it clear that we are not dealing with older children or an inner city area here just a little garden definition sorry for confusion if at the edge of the paved area there is a strip of soil to dig into you could edge the area with bricks either put into the ground vertically or at a degree angle my parents did this at their house and it looks quite nice another option is black plastic garden edging that you can pick up at a local hardware store Drill bit Seismic retrofit Airport Floppy disk Sega Saturn Knife Skateboarding trick Shaggy dog story Japanese tea ceremony Textile manufacturing Social rule Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Poker jargon Anchor Avenue Q Opportunity rover Wonderful Town Customs and etiquette of Japan Bicycle lighting Kibbutz Rathfarnham Wind turbine Boat building Spider Microeconomics Radio controlled airplane Whitton, London Land mine Hamster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sundial Chatsworth House Flowering plant Tin can Swimming pool Autonomous building Toowoomba, Queensland Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Amber Spyglass Property (ownership right) Wimbledon, London Amateur telescope making Pavement (material) Stairway Breastfeeding Gramophone record Generation Y Taj Mahal Drainage Nintendo Entertainment System Fixed-wing aircraft Golf Chess strategy and tactics Lechaina Christmas tree Oscilloscope Bamboo Roxette Species City Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Knitting The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Burning Man A151 road P-47 Thunderbolt Epistemology Air-raid shelter Organic farming Bong Calvin and Hobbes Affton, Missouri King Khalid International Airport Strap-on dildo Redundant array of independent disks Weed control Covent Garden Kerikeri Screw West Bank P-61 Black Widow Irrigation Bladderwort The Inside Bird Masonry Kitesurfing Magic Kingdom Cannabis cultivation Mars Exploration Rover Milwaukee, Wisconsin Rapid transit Bonsai Five Dock, New South Wales Shopping mall Street Headlight STS-114
