help with lavender bush this year i planted a lavender bush in a large pot in the garden it has grown really well and has flowered but in the last few weeks it seems to have grown very high and leggy quite scraggy looking although the foliage at the bottom is still quite dense underneath it is very brown despite regular watering and drainage i have it on my patio which is in shade during the morning and sun during most of the afternoon just wondering what i'm doing wrong does it need an even bigger pot even though it's in a big one or is lavender really suitable for pots or is better suited for garden planting also does it ever have to be cut back and if so when would be grateful for any help as i don't want to ruin it as it smells wonderful thanks i am not a gardener but i keep lavender for the smell and also as a hedge i keep cutting off the flower stalks for use in vases and lavender bags etc and when all the flowers are used up i cut back the wood to about inches in length next year they all come back just like a new plant underneath can be very brown or dead looking but this i think is caused by lack of sunlight etc but you can cut back to beyond this my lavenders are now years old and still thriving well they are hardy and need very little attention apart from cutting as above Houseplant Carnivorous plant Leaf Begonia Fruit tree propagation Pachypodium baronii Garden Strawberry Basil Potato Cannabis cultivation Bonsai Eucalyptus Shrub Pansy Tobacco Bamboo Bong Essential oil Hemp Hydroponics Perfume Pachypodium bicolor Snooker Textile manufacturing Japanese tea ceremony Alhambra Peanut Flower Poker jargon Rose Coffee Dundas Square The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Flowering plant Wood carving Tea Tofu Honey Pruning fruit trees Beetle American lobster Venus Flytrap Orchidaceae Pachypodium ambongense Weed control Lake Gypsy moth Garden Moss Coca Hippeastrum Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne Kitchen Anemone nemorosa Monarda Hedge (gardening) Lawn mower The Time Machine Comfrey Little Shop of Horrors Hamster Honey fungus Wandering Jew (plant) Drainage Gardening Forsythia Plant Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Jute Chatsworth House Dame's Rocket Wood Christmas tree Irrigation Rainforest Grafting Apple Kudzu Sage Equine conformation Solar power Green tea Mango Tillandsia Rocky Mountains Perennial plant Maize Sundial Forest Sea-lavender Tree Operation Market Garden Pine Captain Thunderbolt Somerset Levels Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Pruning
