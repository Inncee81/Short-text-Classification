what kind of potting do rubber plants like i have a foot rubber plant ficus elastica in the pot i got it in from home depot inches i'd really like the plant to grow taller it's under full spectrum lighting at my work but was wondering if the plant will grow faster if i got a pot a size or two up do rubber plants like to have their roots bound tightly or will it propagate growth in a larger roomier pot any other growing tips appreciated you are correct a larger pot size will work ficus will become stunted if their roods are crowded example the people i bought my house from planted ficus benjaminas in the front yard in the late s i bought one in the mid s and kept it in a inch pot the one in a pot is feet high the in my yard were stories tall with huge surface roots that were endangering my house and had to be removed last year they would have been taller except for some winter freezes and pruning you don't need growing tips it sounds like you have a good handle on things with the lighting they will get at your work and normal watering let the soil get dry between waterings and a pot or sizes up the plant should do very well sizes up could get you the soil moisture problems that the other person mentioned besides it would be too big for the office Houseplant Bonsai Ficus elastica Cannabis cultivation Wood Fruit tree propagation Hamster Carnivorous plant Pruning fruit trees Hippeastrum Betting (poker) Rubber Pachypodium Desert Coffee Hydroponics Tea Irrigation Hemp Root Weed control Japanese tea ceremony Floppy disk Garden Strawberry Carbon dioxide Begonia Fig Cookware and bakeware Poker jargon Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Sugar beet Soil Olive Kitchen Thermal power station Auxin Textile manufacturing Stratification (botany) Yosemite National Park Pachypodium baronii Explosive material Banyan Dairy Human height Great Lakes Bamboo Venus Flytrap Tobacco Leaf Tire Lake District Diving suit Sorghum Pea Snooker Banksia Curling Pachypodium habitats Orchidaceae Nepeta Car handling Plant Fossil fuel power plant Strangler Fig Desertification Water (molecule) Spirit rover Lichen Knife Severe weather terminology (United States) M16 (rifle) Mount St. Helens Seismic retrofit Prosopis cineraria Erie Canal Bladderwort Upholstery Flax Apple Saxophone Death Valley National Park Hop (plant) Sewage treatment Precipitation (meteorology) Opportunity rover Pruning Wood carving Tree Mattress Earthworm Grand Teton National Park Trireme Equine conformation Draw poker View camera
