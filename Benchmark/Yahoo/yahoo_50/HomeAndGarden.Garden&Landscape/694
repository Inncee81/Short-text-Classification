does anyone know how to keep the neighbors dog from going in my yard tried store bought didn't last lone i've purchased lawn granuals from depot and aco but it just will not stop crapping and peeing on my lawn sometimes even while the neighbors are out i don't want poisons let me make that clear i don't want to hurt the dog just keep it in it's yard oh yeah they have a cat too those old time remedies that you sometimes hear about before the stuff you have to buy every eight days this is a human problem the responsible thing to do is inform your neighbor that the dog and possibly the cat are on your property and using it if your neighbors are indeed neighborly they will control their pets properly i had this same problem i love dogs and pets i have no respect for those that do not properly control them nor take responsibility for them i my case eventually i began to collect the dog dirt in bags and leaving it for the neighbors on their steps for them to dispose of i didn't dump it out or anything like that just left the bags so they would get the point the problem improved slightly the neighbors began to make efforts to monitor their pet finally i explained to the neighbor i would be left to contact township and county animal welfare if they could not keep their dog contained in their back yard oddly enough the neighbors inabaility and lack of responsibity to control or train the dog eventually lead me to train the dog myself it took me only a few days while i was on vacation and a home depot squirt bottle filled with water it worked and the dog and i are better friends than the neighbor and i Shaggy dog story Domestication Dog The Fairly OddParents Dog training Richard Chase Neighbours Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Knots Landing Dairy Fancy rat Pet skunk Kim Possible The Lovely Bones Burial Hamster Ferret Domestic rabbit Plastic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sears Holdings Corporation Plame affair El Chavo del Ocho Tick Fox hunting Insulin Tai shogi Humphrey Bogart A Day in the Life Lisa the Vegetarian One Piece minor characters Dai dai shogi Moe Szyslak Taboo food and drink Pitaten Thermal power station Animal rights Toilet humour Housebreaking EastEnders Maison Ikkoku Zoophilia The Inside Bill Clinton Homer Simpson Billboard Hot 100 Ballwin, Missouri Pet store Spidey Super Stories Autonomous building Vulcan (Star Trek) Working dog Teacher's Pet (Disney) The Amber Spyglass Cat Dilbert The Caves of Androzani CatDog Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Keeshond 1957 World Series Cray-1 The Ashlee Simpson Show Plastic bag People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Animal Liberation Front Social rule Peter Griffin Artificial neural network Pet Agar plate The Critic Kodocha Chuck Cunningham syndrome Naval Station Norfolk Craps Las Vegas, Nevada Animal shelter Socialization Dennis Rader Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Microeconomics USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Community emergency response team New York City Subway Steven Wright RuneScape quests Kevin and Kell Sango (InuYasha) Family Guy Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Atari 8-bit family Abigail Folger Ren and Stimpy Neopets Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Lady and the Tramp
