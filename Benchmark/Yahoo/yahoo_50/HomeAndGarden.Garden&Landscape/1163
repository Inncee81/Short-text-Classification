what exactly is a mulcher and the difference between a side discharge i am getting ready and started to mow the lawn and i got a new lawn mower according to the manual it says your lawn mower was shipped ready to be used as a mulcher but it also says i can convert it to a side discharge or a rear bagging which i don't want is it the mulcher or side discharge for grass to be clipped and unnoticed on the lawn the mulcher works when the side and back vents are closed by swirling the grass clippings around the blades and basically chopping the grass into tiny bits the side discharge will blow the clippings out the side no mulching what we aren't told is this only use the mulcher on shorter grass because it just doesn't work well with tall grass i basically quit using the mulcher feature and now bag the cuttings my lawn looks so much better too go figure Mower Lawn The Lawnmower Man Hay Tractor Tennis M16 (rifle) Briggs & Stratton M60 machine gun Steam engine McMansion Equine conformation Silage Golf Dodge Neon Microphone Knife Transmission (mechanics) Airbag Mercury Atlas 6 Carburetor Weed control Rigging Syphon Filter Drill bit Internal ballistics The Ashlee Simpson Show Combine harvester Mulch The Star Wars Holiday Special Table tennis View camera Rocky Marciano Episodes of Lost (Season 1) String trimmer Automatic transmission Springfield 1903 rifle Wind turbine Real tennis Xeriscaping Frogman Repeating rifle Futurama (TV series - season 3) Revolver Heinkel He 112 Poaceae Axe Jackass: The Movie Tick The Contender (television series) Rebreather Firearm Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Shaggy dog story Zuiderzee Works Mitsubishi 3000GT M1 Garand Military slang Table saw Comfrey Mercury 4 Hot air balloon Reservoir Dogs Visual Basic Naruto jutsu Animaniacs Internal combustion engine 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Explosive material One Piece minor characters Water turbine Krag-J__rgensen Time Out of Mind Rove Live Chevrolet Nova Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Agar plate Motor oil Odyssey Bowls Universal Century Technology Coachella Valley Laws of cricket Carcano Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Kimono Airsoft R-Type Glossary of nautical terms Ice resurfacer Car safety Steyr Mannlicher M1901 Carpal tunnel syndrome Leaf Sin City BASIC programming language Autopsy
