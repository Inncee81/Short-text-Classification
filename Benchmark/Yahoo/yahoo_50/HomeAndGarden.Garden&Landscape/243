what kind of container or pot can i use to start my brussel sprouts out in hey brussels sprouts can be started from seed easily of course purchasing them already started in cell paks is acceptable for starting them in a container before planting them in the garden try using clean cell packs aka packs use fresh planting mix moreover potting soil plant according to directions on seed packet probably deep and 'cover' with soil i suggest misting the soil instead of watering it the pressure from the hose can blow the seed out of the soil you can also water the soil before you plant the seed cover with clear plastic or not and place in warm location out of direct sun until seeds germinate keep the surface of the soil moist and watch for the sprout s and transplant into garden when about high a seedling that has filled the individual cell pack with roots is a healthy seedling and will fare much better than some spindly seedling with few roots you can also start the seeds directly in the garden in full sun they prefer soil rich in organic material which drains well make your row s plant according to directions space seed apart then thin from apart water gently and keep evenly moist weed as necessary after you have identified the brussels sprouts seedlings brussels sprouts are 'exotic' looking plants and very easy to grow they prefer cooler temperatures than most summer veges and they are frequently started in the early spring and late summer watch for cabbage loopers you'll notice the adults as those white moths fluttering about the plants they lay eggs on the underside of leaves although i do not advocate the use of any pesticides sevin dust and a 'safer's soap' product are the least harmful to the environment happy gardening Hydroponics Weed Cannabis cultivation Flowering plant Tobacco Hamster Gypsy moth San Pedro cactus Vermicompost Houseplant Wood Pine Bong Hemp Biological pest control Compost Organic farming Root Textile manufacturing Apple Carnivorous plant Comfrey Stratification (botany) Brewery Orchidaceae Irrigation Tea Seed Earthworm Leaf Coast Douglas-fir Plant Japanese tea ceremony Apricot Cannabis (drug) Plastic Jute Organic food Pansy Solar power Drooping Brome Desert Flax Gooseberry Herbicide Mattress Agriculture Rice Sugar beet Vegetarianism Peanut Germination Chlorophyta Bread Pachypodium Environmental concerns with electricity generation Sunflower Soil life Tillage Diseases of the honeybee Pottery Kudzu Climate of the United Kingdom Giant Sequoia Genetically modified food Bonsai Banksia Soil pH Soil Aspen Cabbage Sea ice Fire extinguisher Hydrogen economy Sprouting Moss Cuscuta Chicken Deforestation Pebble bed reactor Acorn Hippeastrum Christmas tree Menstrual cup Pinophyta Fancy rat Sorghum Casting
