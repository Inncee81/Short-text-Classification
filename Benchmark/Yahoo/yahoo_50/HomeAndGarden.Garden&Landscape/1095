advise on tomato plants we live in a nice subdivision landscaped and manicured everywhere in may i had some grape tomato seeding which i started in pots on our apartment balcony they were already outgrowing their pots and i didn't have time to make a proper bed for them when we moved into the house so just stuck them out in my flowerbeds figuring they be finished producing sometime in late june and i'd remove them now in early august they have grown into the huge ugly monsters they are over feet tall flopping out of their cages and the bottom leaves are all yellow brown and dying however they are loaded with tomatoes i'm picking or every day which my family is eating and is helping keep our grocery bill down they are also still making blooms at the tops of the plants and setting new fruit problem is my neighbors hate them because they are unsightly and have begun to complain and ask when i will pull them up do i pull them up to be a good neighbor or wait until they finish making it seems like such a shame to pull up plants that although unsightly are still producing fruit why not just apologize to the neighbors and offer them some of the tomatoes with a promise that you will be more prepared next year to locate the plants where they won't offend anyone's senses tell the truth just as you did here you just moved in had already started the plants etc i really think that since the end of the season is coming up they might be more understanding than you think hmmm maybe you could get a good salsa recipe and make up a few jars to offer with a little tag on them that offers the apology draw a silly picture of the gangly plant and make it from the plant Textile manufacturing Poker jargon Fruit Cleveland Browns Hamster Fancy rat 1957 World Series Houseplant Good Times Potato Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Garden Strawberry Peanut Ketchup Johnny Appleseed Comfrey Hot dog Japanese tea ceremony Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Snooker Manicure 613 mitzvot Fruit tree propagation Korean cuisine Flowering plant Tea Breakfast Brewery MRE New England Patriots Cuisine of the Philippines Piccolo Junior Saga Avenue Q Weed control Professional wrestling match types Draw poker Cannabis cultivation Garfield Satchel Paige Peruvian cuisine Hamburger Pomegranate The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Vegetarianism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cuisine of Denmark Tenshinhan Loganberry Maize Apple Roman eating and drinking Rose Banana Tobacco Berry Bob and George Futurama (TV series - season 5) Brian Close Chicken Coffee Humphrey Bogart Cuisine of Brazil Aerial (dance move) Garlic Los Angeles Clippers Tofu Cuisine of Africa Barbecue Equine conformation Kosher foods Pittsburgh Steelers Pot Noodle Knots Landing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Acorn Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Kasparov versus The World Agriculture Kenny McCormick Basil Irrigation Mandrake (plant) Boise, Idaho Shaggy dog story Apricot Buckingham Palace Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wheat Black pepper Grape Hydroponics 2004 American League Championship Series Pok__mon Live!
