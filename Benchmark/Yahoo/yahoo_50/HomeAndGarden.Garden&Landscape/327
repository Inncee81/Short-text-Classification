is there any way to make a fruit bearing tree not bear fruit we have an apricot tree in our backyard and while i like the shade it provides during spring and early summer the fruit falls on the ground and causes a terrible ant problem is there anything we can do to make the tree stop bearing fruit short of having the tree removed that would be the last resort but we will if we have to it's driving me nuts and we can't enjoy the backyard because of it oh for the love of mercy there is a product that will do it but i can't for the love of remember what it is called it's from a company called ferti lome hi yield might also have something it was intended for crab apples but i suspect that it would work on your apricot too they are related trees i would check with your local independent garden center or nursery i doubt that the big box stores would carry such a specialized product you have to spray the tree while in bloom the spray does something to retard the flowers i'm sorry i can't remember the product name but at least i'm sure of the product manufacturer i hope that this helps Apricot Fruit tree propagation Prunus Grafting Peach The Time Machine Fruit Christmas tree Hamster Pruning fruit trees Malus Gooseberry Orchard Bulk vending Ume Ginkgo Rambutan Pollination Garden Strawberry Aphrodite Biological pest control Coconut Johnny Appleseed Pollination management Cashew Pansy Flowering plant Food preservation NeXT Almond Poker jargon Cannabis cultivation Avocado Coconut crab Adam and Eve Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Giant Sequoia Leaf Mango Organic food Fire fighting Plum Vanilla Olive Pinophyta Tree Food storage Mammee apple Peanut Fecal incontinence Screw Date Palm Aesculus Irrigation Camp Lazlo Watermelon Nut (fruit) European Beech Casting Agriculture Quince Diseases of the honeybee Black pepper Manchukuo and Mengchiang (agriculture, farming, lumber and fishing) Cherry Wood Apostrophe (mark) Wintel Kellogg Company M4 Sherman Blue Ridge Parkway Sears Holdings Corporation Yosemite National Park Lemon Oil palm Maize Spot the Dog Jackass: The Movie Kosher foods The Tale of Genji One Tree Hill (TV series) Fruit tree pollination Kashrut Original sin Tree of Life Durian Ice cream Thermal power station Luther Burbank Tomato French cuisine Pruning Flower RuneScape quests Pollinator decline Forest gardening Bob Hope Weed control Hey Arnold!
