where is the best place to plan oregano thyme and basil hi all plants do well in an area that gets a lot of sun and has nice soil with lots of organic matter in it but planning where to put oregano and thyme is important because they are perennials they don't spread as badly as other plants but put them in a spot where you won't want to move them next year i put them on the side of the garden so i don't have to worry about disturbing them when i till in the spring basil only lives for one season so you can put that wherever you have room although many people like to put their herbs all together i am lazy so i don't recommend pots or planters i put them right in the ground and once they get growing i never need to water or really care for them other than swome weeding in pots you will need to water frequently in the summer good luck Weed control Oregano Houseplant Basil Thyme Hemp Tillage Comfrey Lawn Weed Mid-levels Organic gardening Hydroponics Plant Yarrow Betting (poker) Tea Bonsai Hippeastrum Flax Ragweed Fruit tree propagation Italian cuisine Carnivorous plant Vinegar Perennial plant Textile manufacturing Herbicide Tobacco Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sugar beet Biodynamic agriculture Temerin Bamboo Botany Global warming and agriculture Gardening Soil Cheating in poker Essential oil Coffee Creeping Charlie Soils retrogression and degradation Japanese tea ceremony Agriculture Garden Zuiderzee Works Xeriscaping New York Giants Hamster German cuisine Alfalfa Mulch Garlic Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Soil pH Kudzu The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Water Cannabis cultivation Irrigation King Khalid International Airport Theory of conduct No-dig gardening Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Stratification (botany) Sage Snooker Yosemite National Park Gypsy moth Burning Man Chess strategy and tactics Soil life Earthworm Nepeta Polygonum Las Vegas metropolitan area Mosquito Cannabis Anemone American and British English differences Old growth forest Social rule Palouse Monster Rancher monsters Organic farming Logging Chatsworth House Upholstery Ragwort Erosion Iris (plant) Absinth Wormwood Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Stinging nettle Oat Apricot Peanut
