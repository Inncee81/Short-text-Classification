how often should you water the garden plants is it true that you should water your garden plants every night for one hour and never to water them on a sunny day the best idea is to make sure that your garden doesn't need watering dig in plenty of organic material to increase the ability of the soil to retain water and get it to the plant roots if the ground gets baked hard it isn't worth watering it as the water will not get to the roots in that case you need to get a fork lightly move the soil to open it up a bit when you do have to water vegetables annuals are really the things that may need attention lightly water first then go back give a bit more water minutes later the first watering breaks the surface tension without there being too much water which will just run away best time to water is very early morning or early night after the sun is down although some plants hate having wet roots overnight when they aren't really making use of the water and of course the length of time you take to water you garden depends on the size of the garden and the method you are using if you are dragging watering cans around in a big garden it would take you a lot longer than with a sprinker in a small garden if your plants need the water then you should water them whatever time of day it is but watering in bright sunlight makes less water available to the plants as it will be being drawn up as by the heat of the day and unless you can water at root level you run the risk of leaving water on leaves which could well bake them Irrigation Wood Hydroponics Carnivorous plant Solar power Soil Desert Plant Textile manufacturing Soil pH Cannabis cultivation Drainage Earthworm Drill bit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Erosion Brewery Garden Strawberry Energy development Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sugar beet Organic food Weed control Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Anchor Bonsai Flax Leaf Comfrey Pachypodium Water purification Sunlight Pile Hamster Bread Coffee Casting Mattress Cocaine Flowering plant Sewage treatment Campfire Sorghum Photosynthesis 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Bamboo Hemp Potato Equine conformation Swimming Solar panel Bong Root Autonomous building Opportunity rover Gypsy moth Social rule Kudzu Rainforest Weed Environmental concerns with electricity generation USS Tunny (SS-282) Sundial Hangi Eutrophication Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Coal Knife Passive solar Time Out of Mind Glossary of wildland fire terms Ecology Cookware and bakeware Ecohydrology Seismic retrofit Extreme Programming Fire fighting Floppy disk Compost Fruit tree propagation Gooseberry Sun Weather lore Dundas Square River Illegal drug trade Season Mosquito Jute Soil salination Power station Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Fast bowling Soils retrogression and degradation Capercaillie
