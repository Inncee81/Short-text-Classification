review of a walker brand lawn mower for cutting lawns i am interested in buying a lawn mower for starting lawn business i looked at walker brand with grass catcher and also a x mark navagator with the same features can any one tell me what one they would buy and why i have used walker mowers for about years i love them i know them inside and out every nut bolt sensor pulley and wire i know nothing about the navigator except that exmark mowers are widely used in the business and they designed the machine to include the features that walkers have always had that brings this line to mind why buy the copy when you can have the real thing walker has been refining that design since or so they have learned alot about that design and have slowly introduced new features that have greatly improved on the original design today's walker mower is light years ahead of the original in terms of productivity and durability last year they upgraded the ghs blower that sucks up the clippings and that has once again transformed the machine now it can move through heavier grass even faster than before and can handle wet grass even better the exmark does have alot of plastic on it that the walker doesn't have the exmark sits taller than the walker which is a big deal first when you sit closer to the grass you are way more aware of the cut quality you will know if you need to sharpen your blades or clean out your deck right away when you are that close to the grass and you can lean over and pick up sticks and trash and rocks plus you can mow under low hanging limbs easier if you are lower and can mow hills better because the center of gravity is lower the efi machine with the large bagger a deck is the commercial standard in southern maine and most of new england it is the machine to have and i believe customers expect to see it get the power dump feature and you will thank yourself a hundred times a day there also is a high dump feature that lifts the bagger high and then dumps into a truck that looks great too test both machines but remember that the correct tool may be harder to use the first time using it but when you train yourself to use it properly you will be better off than buying the machine that is easier the first time out but limited in capability long term enjoy Knife Tank Combine harvester Wind turbine Poker jargon Equine conformation Glossary of climbing terms Carburetor Sears Holdings Corporation Casting Drill bit Mattress Car handling Gramophone record Steam engine Tractor Lawn Anchor Motor oil M60 machine gun Internal ballistics Gliding B-47 Stratojet M16 (rifle) Combine (Half-Life 2) Plastic Glossary of wildland fire terms Naval mine Rigging IBM PC compatible Software engineering Mach kernel Table saw Windows XP Meccano Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Textile manufacturing Motorcycle Sailing Typewriter Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Paragliding McMansion TGV Mouse (computing) Windows 2000 Airbus A320 Strap-on dildo Computer RISC Fixed-wing aircraft Universal Century Technology Transformer Briggs & Stratton Bulk vending Sword MS-06 Zaku II Radio controlled airplane Tennis Fan (implement) Internal combustion engine Volleyball Machine gun Atari ST Screw World Trade Center Climbing equipment 24 Hours of Le Mans Ammunition BEAM robotics Autogyro Gross domestic product Upholstery Shaggy dog story CPU design Whitewater Airsoft Konica Minolta Rail terminology Industrial engineering Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Japanese toilet Autonomous robot Chair Messerschmitt Bf 109 Skateboarding trick General Dynamics F-111 Heinkel He 112
