why are my blueberry bushes dying this is our second summer in our new house first summer our blueberry bushes had mass amounts of blueberries first summer we didnt do a thing to them except cover them with netting and keeping squirrels away from them this year ugh we mixed in some alum sulphate we were told to do this by our local gardener bushes went from a rich green to all their leaves being a yellowish colour and hardly any berries at all the ones that are there are wilted and stopped growing i am so frustarated i dont know how to care for them should i get my soil tested and if so who does that sort of thing local gardening place had me buy a ph tester but the needle doesnt move no matter what soil i stick it into please help any advice when you mentioned that your entire plants are dying might suggest that your roots might be suffering from a disease called phytopthora root rot this fungus survives in the soil and usually attacks blueberry plants that suffer from inadequate soil drainage and spreads from plant to plant by water bushes suffering from root rot usually have smaller leaves that begin turning red or yellow in mid to late summer if you think you might have drainage problems you might have to consider digging up the soil to improve the drainage or consider planting in raised beds benches to alleviate your problem in the future if you think it might be a soil issue such as heavy clay you may need to incorporate some organic matter compost beef chicken manure also consider using some humic acid which will open up pore spaces in the soil and allow water to penetrate through the soil much easier and decrease the chances of standing water which promotes the incidence of phytopthora from re occuring since blueberries prefer slight acidic soils to ph to grow properly you'll have to detemine where your soil ph is and adjust accordingly i think i purchased the same ph meter as you and you may need to open the battery compartment and dislodge the plastic piece separating the batteries from making contact please keep in mind that overapplications of aluminum sulfate are quite toxic to blueberry plants a better and safer method to reduce soil ph is to use iron sulfate instead to make sure whether your plants have been attacked by phytopthora you should dig up an infected plant place it in a large plastic bag and the take your sample to your local county farm advisor's office a qualified advisor can either tell you immediately or send your sample to a lab for further analysis to determine what's wrong with your plant you might have to furnish as much information about your plant soil conditions fertilization history etc hope this information helps solve your problem please feel free to contact me directly for further help good luck certified professional crop consultant with over years of experience and a degree in plant science Irrigation Compost Houseplant Hydroponics Sewage treatment Fertilizer Opportunity rover Organic farming Soil Vermicompost Hemp Earthworm Comfrey Gypsy moth Weed control Dairy Organic food Carnivorous plant Wood Physiological plant disorders Textile manufacturing Sugar beet Humus Garden Strawberry Tea Simone Weil Waste management Ecology Green Revolution Carbon dioxide Fruit tree propagation Prostate cancer Illegal drug trade Permaculture Drainage Global warming and agriculture Hamster Leaf M16 (rifle) Sulfur Escherichia coli O157:H7 Seismic retrofit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Livestock Jute Eutrophication Bong Honey fungus Bonsai Coffee Cancer Plant Tofu Medicine Nuclear power Factory farming Organic gardening Autonomous building Sulfuric acid Battery (electricity) Chicken Desert Ammonia Insulin Potato Welding Volleyball Carbon dioxide sink Gooseberry Renewable energy Cannabis (drug) Portland cement Thermal power station Peanut Water purification Erosion Species Environmental concerns with electricity generation Cannabis cultivation Methamphetamine Plastic Photosynthesis Zuiderzee Works Pneumonia Green manure Shifting cultivation Biodynamic agriculture Hardpan Olive Banana Alcohol fuel Gas metal arc welding
