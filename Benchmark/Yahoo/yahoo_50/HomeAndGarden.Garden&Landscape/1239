how to keep english ivy weed free there was a previous question regarding english ivy and i am award that english ivy is considered invasive but i have a large very steep hill in my back yard that works well with ivy i also keep the ivy trimmed ft from my fence to keep it from going into my neighbors yards that being said my issue is that i have many other plants growing up through the ivy including wild roses rasberries virginia creeper bamboo and others i would like to simply have the ivy and nothing else on the hill i've been trying to weed the hill but it is very steep and difficult to keep up is there a specific product herbicide or defoliant or method other than weeding i can use to keep the english ivy but prevent the rest for the very aggressive weed brush such as bamboo and wild roses you can use a 'brush b gone' sort of product lay some burlap or heavy not to be used again bed sheets down over the ivy and spray the foliage of the plants to be killed with the herbicide this will require repeated use but eventually over the course of years the brush will be permanently killed be sure to let it die back from the chemical give it at least days before you cut it to the ground don't pull sometimes roots that are left behind will lead to more plants rather than one weaker one spray as needed there is a 'smart bomb' product that can kill weeds without killing your ivy ortho sells it as 'grass b gone' though i personally like the ferti lome product called 'over the top' both recommend a trial area to be sure it doesn't kill your groundcover both are expensive comparatively but they save you huge amounts of time and frustration neither will kill brush just herbaceous weeds and grasses the box stores home depot and the like probably don't carry these products you'll have to go to your local independent garden center or nursery good luck i hope that this helps Weed control Herbicide Gypsy moth Creeping Charlie Agriculture Bamboo Poker jargon Sorghum Green Revolution Hemp Lawn Irrigation Ivy Genetically modified food Organic farming Illegal drug trade Anchor Sugar beet Wildfire Textile manufacturing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Auxin New York Giants Organic food Oat Hamster Yosemite National Park Monsanto Maize Livestock Lawn mower Tag Fire fighting Poison-ivy Fusion power Hydroponics Sewage treatment Perfume Fruit tree propagation Pesticide Sniper Joker (comics) Tobacco Long Path Leaf Teller-Ulam design Rapeseed 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Cannabis (drug) Deforestation Hay fever Tillage Coffee Agent Orange Island restoration Cannabis cultivation Palouse Casting The Tale of Genji Dog training Coca eradication Bong Tooth Biological warfare G-Man (Half-Life) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Pittsburgh Steelers Organic gardening Theory of conduct Hydrogen economy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Genetic engineering Surveillance Baseball Tick Bulk vending Energy development Christmas tree Avalanche Golf Solar power Elis Prefecture Drill bit Glossary of wildland fire terms Donald Neilson Wrigley Field Fish farming Vine
