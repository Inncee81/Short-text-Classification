something wrong with my aloe vera plant well i broke a piece off today i have never really used my aloe vera plant we hardly water it but it grows anyways and manages to stay all green but today when i broke a piece off i opened it and as i got further to the top of the broken piece the gel in the inside was brown there was green aloe gel too but i didnt trust the brown gel what is that brown gel haha i know its silly but like i said i never really use the plant so i dont want to put just anything on my scars my gemma grandma has always had one of these and i had one from her and have always had one since although i have rarely had to use one i've never encountered the brown gel i personally wouldn't use it i am thinking that since leaves die from the tip back that what you encountered was a sign of aging and eventual death for that piece of foliage i found a discussion thread that seems to go along with much of what i said you can check it out at http forums gardenweb com forums load cacti msg html i also found some interesting info at http www mayoclinic com health aloe vera ns patient aloe http www quackwatch com quackeryrelatedtopics dsh aloe html hope this helps Aloe HyperText Transfer Protocol Pachypodium bicolor Houseplant Leaf Pachypodium baronii Cross site scripting Snooker World Wide Web Pachypodium Suicide Uniform Resource Locator Pachypodium brevicaule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Web server JavaServer Pages Internet Representational State Transfer Anchor Hemp HTTP cookie Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pachypodium ambongense Domain Name System Wound healing phases Tobacco Kasparov versus The World HTML element Pink Floyd Website Internet forum Breast implant The Legend of Zelda series enemies Blog Biodiesel Stage lighting Staining (biology) Brown Bear Cleveland Browns Hello world program Gmail Chlorophyta Ajax (programming) Sunburn The Amber Spyglass Extraterrestrial hypothesis Friends Wood Textile manufacturing Billiards BitTorrent Leon White Wireless Application Protocol Banana XHTML Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Wall Neopets Antiretroviral drug Pern Agarose gel electrophoresis RuneScape cheats B3ta Tea Quotation mark Wget Carnivorous plant Phishing Ninja Scroll U.S. presidential election, 2008 Common Unix Printing System Strap-on dildo Garnet Internet troll Chess strategy and tactics Orchidaceae Screw RuneScape quests Smallpox The Shining (film) Pretty Good Privacy Coffee Polymerase chain reaction Onion Apache HTTP Server Pine HTML San Pedro cactus Switzerland Rovers Return Hamster Root Consensus decision-making E number Roswell UFO incident Samurai Deeper Kyo Anonymity Columbine High School massacre Sub-Zero
