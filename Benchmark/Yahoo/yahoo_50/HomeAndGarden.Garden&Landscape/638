my neighbour's raising the level of her garden how does this affect my lowered level garden long term wise my next door neighbour is currently having major works done to her back garden the land directly on the other side of our common fence is being raised im worried that i will be having problems with drainage as more water will be coming down from her side into my land no proper retaining wall was built just planks of wood to retain the soil away from the fence does anyone know if i can do anything to stop this and how badly will it affect me many thanks you could just kill your neighbor and bury her in your own garden thereby raising your soil level also but seriously you probably won't have any immediate problems in the first year or two take advantage of the water runoff from my experience most raised beds and berms tend to dry out faster she will probably have to water her garden more often and you can take advantage of the runoff by planting water loving plants in the long term years the wood planks will rot and sag or tip over and probably end up damaging the fence at that point you may have legal recourse Irrigation Wood Seismic retrofit Drainage Lake District Desertification Deforestation Eutrophication Carnivorous plant Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Equine conformation Hamster Punt (boat) Instant-runoff voting Dam RuneScape quests Basement Houseplant Erosion Stairway Sea level rise The Fens Flax Wall Bonsai Geography of Russia Autonomous building Billiards Lake Environmental concerns with electricity generation Israeli West Bank barrier Jute River Mattress Palouse Bladderwort Clinker (boat building) Trail Weed control Vermicompost Canal lock Chernobyl accident Light pollution Garden Soil salination Siphon Wildfire Zuiderzee Works Geology of the Grand Canyon area Physiological plant disorders Retaining wall Desert Masonry Aral Sea Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Passenger car Pok__mon Abilities Soil pH Livestock Xeriscaping Spark plug Pachypodium Drill bit Florida Keys Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Agriculture DDT Natural Selection (computer game) Leaf Plant Geography of Mexico Nassau County, Florida Effects of global warming Electrophysiology Lumber TGV Wind turbine Dune Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Twelve leverage points Dog agility Thermal power station Acid mine drainage Manawatu-Wanganui Mulch Hydroponics Salton Sea Ionizing radiation 2003 North America blackout Water resources Honey fungus Compost South Province, Cameroon Ecohydrology Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Global warming and agriculture Ecco the Dolphin Chatsworth House Shaggy dog story
