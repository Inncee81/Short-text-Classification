how can your preserve bamboo i have a bamboo tree in my yard and would like to bring some stalks inside for decoration however they die quickly and turn brown and i'd like to keep them in their vibrant green state any suggestions thanks i have tried everything to preserve the bamboo stalks and nothing works they always turn brown when removed from the plant however the good news is that once they are dried out you can paint them to return to that color i've used both acrylic and latex with a lot of success and just tried spray painting one if you use spray paint however i think you really need to come back over it with some acrylic especially at the joints because it just looks too fake being monochrome Paint Bamboo Bong Acrylic paint Lacquer Casting Japanese art Tobacco Cleveland Browns Stucco Comanche Painting Textile manufacturing Tattoo Textile manufacturing terminology Paper marbling Green tea Pachypodium baronii Laser engraving Manicure Gesso Pysanka Air pollution Peanut Japanese tea ceremony Mattress Pachypodium brevicaule The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter Bonsai Vitreous enamel Pottery Cannabis cultivation Maize Netsuke Woodworking Latex Christmas tree Pachypodium bicolor Color theory Grace Cossington Smith Mummy R-Type Aliens of London Lighting Arcade cabinet Pastel Chatsworth House Dragon boat Pachypodium ambongense Emily Kngwarreye New York Giants Knitting Chernobyl accident Hemp Cotton Instant coffee Grand Central Terminal Union Pacific Railroad Tofu Coir Tibetan people Cincinnati Bengals Irrigation Super Bowl XIV Pittsburgh Steelers Wassily Kandinsky Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sushi Paper Wood carving Thuja plicata Blood on the Tracks Tree Microsoft Paint Japanese painting Thermal power station Garden Strawberry Dundas Square Durian Andrea del Sarto Bacon Deforestation Cantonese cuisine Plastic Chinese art Mushroom hunting Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Rubber stamp Lake British Rail Class 411 Graffiti Lechaina Fan (implement) Fire fighting Dice The Scream Nicolas Poussin Leather CSI: Crime Scene Investigation
