how much sun is needed for my palm tree i bought a majesty palm a few weeks ago it is about feet tall and has wide shoots i have it on my back patio where there is barely any sun during the day it seems to be fine there i wish i had it in my front yard though my front yard recieves no direct sun until about pm and then the sun leaves at about however if i put my palm tree there i am worried that it will have heat stress what do you think is it okay to put it there eventhough the area recieves about hours of direct sunlight degree heat i dont know maybe this was due to transplantation to a new pot but i am afraid to put the palm out to the front yard because when i just got it and it spent two days in my front yard the leaves started having brown dry edges eventhough i watered the thing i have a large approx ft to the top of the fronds date palm in my front yard it practically has full sun all day and it is hot and humid here with mild winter below freezing for maybe a couple of weeks a year it has a corner of the yard to itself the ground is slightly raised so there is no standing water i don't think one would thrive like that in my shady backyard however i have several nice sago palms there the more sun the more you should water your palm it may need fertilizer and or epsom salts Coffee Dundas Square Leaf Textile manufacturing Coconut Climate of the United Kingdom Professional wrestling throws Swimming Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Desert New York Giants Sun Weather lore Shaggy dog story Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Snooker Fishing Water Tofu Carnivorous plant Tea Volleyball Salute Sunlight Billboard Hot 100 Brewery Hippeastrum Bonsai Venus Flytrap Super Bowl XXXVI Double bass Dead Sea Skateboarding trick Renewable energy Canadian football Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Garden Strawberry Severe weather terminology (United States) Glossary of American football Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Professional wrestling holds European Beech RuneScape quests Equine conformation Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Thermal power station Coachella Valley Aerial (dance move) Solar panel Giant Sequoia Chatsworth House Drag racing Fast bowling Hyperthermia Cuisine of Malaysia Car handling Spirit rover Psoriasis Florida Wrigley Field K__ppen climate classification Sundial Carbon dioxide Opportunity rover Cleveland Browns Cannabis cultivation Viva La Bam Suplex Sauna Tree Gypsy moth Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Explosive material Dairy Nuclear fallout 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens U.S. customary units Rathfarnham Avalanche Diving suit Compost Glacier Date Palm Moon Sukkot Pysanka Backstroke Cincinnati Bengals Seismic retrofit Barbecue Cuisine of Brazil Las Vegas metropolitan area Caatinga Mattress Climate of India
