different types of grass growing i have always been complimented on my lawn i use scott's fertilizer every months however two years ago my lawn must of gotten a disease and was over taken by weeds i have gotten rid of all the weeds but now there are many different types of grass growing and it still looks aweful to me what is the best way to get rid of the various types of grasses growing now and to replace it with all one type of grass unfortunately most herbicides will either kill broadleaf weeds kill grass or kill both there is nothing you can buy at a home garden store that will allow you to selectively kill only certain types of grass without harming others if it's really bothering you you only have two options first my least favorite option you can start over you'll need to use a non selective herbicide like roundup on your entire lawn this will kill off everything then spread the grass seed of your choice and begin growing a new lawn second the option i strongly recommend you can keep your lawn and adjust your expectations and method of lawn care i suggest you never buy scotts fertilizer again you can have a much healthier more drought and disease tolerant lawn by practicing organic lawn care a couple recommended websites to let you know how organic lawn care works http www richsoil com lawn http faq gardenweb com faq lists organic html Herbicide Lawn Agriculture Weed control Weed Organic food Organic farming Sorghum Genetically modified food Rapeseed Lawn mower Roundup Fruit tree propagation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Creeping Charlie Comfrey Flowering plant Pesticide Green Revolution 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid Plant breeding Organic gardening Gardening HyperText Transfer Protocol Vegetarianism Glyphosate Oat Neolithic Revolution Genetic engineering Global warming and agriculture Domestic rabbit Hemp Wheat Breastfeeding Rice Maize Irrigation Gypsy moth Hamster Mozilla Firefox Cancer HTTP cookie Compost Sugar beet Tillage Common Unix Printing System Gmail Monsanto Deforestation Auxin Cannabis (drug) Guinea pig Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Anchor Hypoglycemia Autonomous building Stem cell Sears Holdings Corporation Uniform Resource Locator Alfalfa Abortion debate Tennis Bonsai Diabetes mellitus Tobacco smoking HTML element Tomato Tick Stomach cancer Percy Schmeiser XHTML Ragweed Soft tissue sarcoma Dog HTML Illegal drug trade Famine Organic horticulture XML Fish farming Omega-3 fatty acid Norman Borlaug Kudzu Health insurance Dietary fiber Turnip (brassica rapa) Patterson's Curse Discus (fish) Birth control Biology Mulch Fertility awareness Masanobu Fukuoka Cross site scripting Genetically modified organism Chicken Document Type Definition Moss
