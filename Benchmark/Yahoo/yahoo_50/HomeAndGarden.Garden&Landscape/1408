what does pollenated papaya mean i got a small gallon size papaya at walmart today it appears to have small trees in the same pot no more than feet tall each i thought papayas were self fertile but i guess not what does pollenated mean does that i have both male and female trees in my pot or does that mean it is self fertile also at this size how long do you think it will take to fruit thanks found this for you papaya is polygamous with three primary sex types female male and bisexual there are some cases where plants produce more than one kind of flower at the same time bisexuals are usually preferred for home plantings because sex determination prior to flowering is practically impossible two to four seedling plants are grown together until flowering to assure females for fruit production and males for pollination sounds like you buy the group hoping you get some of each sex the article also stated well tended papayas should produce fruit within a year of planting with mature plants capable of producing to pounds of papayas per year i hope you like this fruit a lot or have many friends to share with Plant sexuality Flowering plant Fruit Apple Pawpaw Rambutan Fruit tree propagation Plant Papaya Honey Hermaphrodite Vanilla Conifer cones Sexual reproduction Cannabis cultivation Kiwifruit Pinophyta Date Palm Malus Sex Watermelon Sunflower Fertilisation Peanut Banksia Pollinator Houseplant Illegal drug trade Bisexuality Weed control Biology and sexual orientation Fruit tree pollination Ginkgo Pruning fruit trees Species Logging Avocado Agriculture Pachypodium baronii Grafting Kakapo Mountain Gorilla Largest organism Alder Tree Coast Douglas-fir Apricot Infantilism Honeybee Bonsai Peach Coffea arabica Blackberry Gender role Carnivorous plant Group sex Fig Puberty Orchidaceae Biological dispersal Pine Loganberry Comfrey Cucumber Feijoa Intersexuality Garden Strawberry Wood Hemp Bee Juniper Ovary Refrigerator car Cherimoya Alternation of generations Orchard Neem Pachypodium brevicaule Soil life Gamete Cannabis sativa Orgasm Durian Ecology Pollinator decline Ragweed Organic food Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Black pepper Elderberry Deforestation Organic farming Life insurance
