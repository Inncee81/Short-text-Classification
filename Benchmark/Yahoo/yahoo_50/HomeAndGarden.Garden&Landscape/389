this question is for all you rose gardeners out there i'm new at this just started my garden this year i planted david austin roses and i'm following the instructions closely to care for them one thing i did not see mention in his instructions with regards to trimming back the flowers for a second blush there is new growth spindly and tall no flower buds on them do i let them grow or are they suckers only knowledgable people answer please i want to grow the best rose garden this side of halifax thanks fellow rose lovers thanks for all the advice d austins advice for new plants was to cut the first cut back to or three groupings of leaves after the first flowering the second cut comes after the second blush of flowers and then you only trim back to the first set of five leaves this is to establish a good shape to the plant yes i'm sure they will flower again they are repeat flowering shrubs the mary rose which was my mom's name david austin is a specific brand of roses from one breeder some of his roses grow like climbers others like hybrid teas etc mary rose is one i've seen in person before and it grows like a 'grandiflora' with larger flowers in clusters when you remove dead flowers cut the stem or cane back to where the cane is the thickness of a pencil just above a leaf the thicker the stem the larger the flower that will be produced and a thick stem will support the weight of the blossom the leaflet rule is intended to get you down far enough but don't be afraid to go further roses grow like crazy and bloom like crazy too sometimes you can end up with 'blind' canes that is to say no flower develops treat them as you would a cane after blooming cut it back after you cut the cane apply a little 'elmer's glue' to the end that will prevent rose borer from entering the cane several answerer's think that you might have 'suckers' they would come up from the ground and those if present should be removed it sounds more like 'blind wood' to me i'd also suggest a good rose fertilizer i like 'rose tone' from espoma it's a nice mostly organic fertilizer applied once per month i hope that this helps good luck Rose Flowering plant Leaf Species Bamboo Flower Hemp Japanese tea ceremony Brooklyn Botanic Garden Plant Grafting Wood Tobacco Olive Orchidaceae Kudzu Weed control Loganberry Pruning fruit trees Potato Carnivorous plant Gypsy moth Sugarcane Textile manufacturing Peanut Hop (plant) Bonsai Aloe Cannabis cultivation European Beech Sunflower Pinophyta Maize Tree Wisteria Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Apple Agriculture Garden Strawberry Pansy Hamster Hippeastrum Drill bit Nepeta Pachypodium brevicaule Puberty Alfalfa The Amber Spyglass Auxin Sage Pachypodium Camellia sinensis Pachypodium ambongense Bud Hen and chicks Banana Shrub Flax Houseplant Hellebore Eucalyptus Prunus Bladderwort Honey Essential oil Tournament of Roses Parade Goldenrod Banksia Knife Iris (plant) Jute Phalaenopsis Honey fungus Pachypodium baronii Hiberno-English Upholstery Vanilla Anemone Pine Capercaillie Date Palm Coffea arabica Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Strawberry Singlish Shaggy dog story Sugar beet Moss Green tea Mattress Yarrow Reed (music) Darwin from Orchids to Variation Titan arum
