has anyone ever used the year warranty on plants you buy like at target home depot or lowes i've noticed that a lot of these places that sell flowers plants actually offer your money back if your plant doesn't make it through the first year i've always wondered if this worked i bought some plants at target months ago and half of them are dead i still have the receipt to prove the purchase but how in the world do i prove they are defective can they blame this on me do i have to bring in the dead plant actually pull it out of the ground i'm very confused and was curious to see if anyone has ever tried to do this any experiences do you get your money back get an exchange or what thanks you will need to bring a copy of your receipt and the dead plant you must dig it out of the ground for the lifetime warranties offered on plants it only applies to perennials and you must bring in the receipt as well as the plant Warranty Arbitrage Gross domestic product Mattress Mortgage Implied warranty Babylonian law Stock Supply and demand Monetary policy Tesco Perennial plant Warner Bros.
