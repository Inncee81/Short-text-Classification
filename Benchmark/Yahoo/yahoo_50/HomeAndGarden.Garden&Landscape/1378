are mums annual or perennials i'm confused i just bought some mums from the store and plannted them in a plannter at home thinking they were annuals my mother in law told me that mums are perennials i read on the internet that next year if i pinch off the stems this will help the plant to grow fuller with more blooms what part of the plant am i pinching off the hardiness of the plant depends on which usda hardiness zone you're in part of the confusion is in how they are retailed most garden mums are sold in the late summer fall they are perennials but in my hardiness zone there isn't enough time for the plants to reliably root in before winter so to keep customers from becoming disappointed we sold them simply as 'garden mums' not as 'hardy mums' or 'perennial mums' many of my customers threw them out at the end of the season or used them as patio porch decor if you do grow your mums as perennials you'll be pinching back the first set of flower buds mums want to bloom in june july but we like them in the fall by pinching them you delay their bloom and also make the plant more compact with more flowers ofcourse if you're growing them like an annual no pinching is needed you should remove faded flowers to help prolong the bloom time i hope that this helps Perennial plant Flowering plant Plant Weed control Apple Flower Rose Sunflower Fruit tree propagation Bamboo Wisteria Orchidaceae Kudzu Iris (plant) Sagebrush Pollen source Sears Holdings Corporation Anemone Baseball Begonia Sage Pruning fruit trees Comfrey Illegal drug trade 1957 World Series Apricot Hippeastrum Alfalfa Cannabis cultivation Globe artichoke Pruning Chrysanthemum Pollination Daylight saving time Clover Bonsai Christmas tree Crocus CPU design Papaver Los Angeles Dodgers Little Britain Leaf Floppy disk Tomato About a Boy Xeriscaping Sweet potato Daylily Ginger Pittsburgh Steelers Houseplant Bladderwort Ragweed Hellebore Mirabilis (plant) Zion National Park Sugar beet Giant Hogweed Cleveland Browns Tillandsia Pachypodium brevicaule Cyclamen Hop (plant) Delphinium Pachypodium ambongense Hen and chicks Peanut Cereal Bulk vending Dandelion Cigarette Amaranth Herbicide Textile manufacturing Pinophyta Tesco Japanese tea ceremony Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University Potato Goldenrod Pineapple Dame's Rocket Grafting Carnivorous plant Sam Walton Christmas Morning glory Biology of the Sierra Nevada Watermelon Customs and etiquette of Japan Gooseberry Charles O.
