how do i keep my dogwood from drying out so fast on a hill i planted a new cultavar of dogwood up on my hill as an understory tree and the leaves are drying out i have watered it but it is still losing leaves the hill isn't that steep but the hill drains so great it drys out to quickly it has been very hot so i know this has contributed to mositure lost but it didn't dry out when i had it on level ground iost another dogwood from a storm so i planted this new dogwood but then my old dogwood started sending new shoots up so i had to move this new dogwood help dogwoods are sensitive and will experience root shock when being transplanted i've transplanted several and in some cases i lost all the leaves but then the following spring they budded out beautifully as far as watering dogwoods can benefit from watering the leaves and branches directly from the hose also you may want to consider using a soaker hose until the weather cools down and the tree is better established if that's impractical try using those stakes with the holes in the bottom you insert a soda bottle upside down into the opening of the stake this allows for a gradual steady flow of water to the tree also good luck Atlanta metropolitan area Irrigation Bong Dogwood Carbon dioxide Wildfire Glossary of firefighting equipment Soil pH Pine Bamboo Leaf Brewery Climate of the United Kingdom Tree Wood European Beech Teapot Pachypodium Capercaillie Drainage Piccolo Junior Saga Diving regulator Aloe Siphon Fire fighting Henry W.
