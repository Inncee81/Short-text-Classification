next year how long would it take for annuals that are inches tall to grow very wide and large i bought this little booklet about annuals and there is a colored flower bed with all annuals like zinnia begonia sage impatients petunias periwinkle and african marigold on the cover the bed is very full with no space in beween the flowers it shows a step by step instructions on the side of the page on how to make it look exacly like the picture and your supposed to plant the plants about inches apart and the flowers are still small when they are planted how long would it take for them to be about a foot wide and tall when would i have to plant them next year all the flowers in the pictures look very full thanks how long it takes for them to get bigger depends on the plant and growing conditions weather soil season etc you would have to plant them after the fear of frost is gone and they should continue to grow size height until the cold weather comes in annuals do not return year after year so each spring you would need to go out and replant everything if you are putting in a bed for the flowers i would suggest going with perenials each year they will return and be larger until the reach their maximum size you can add the annuals each spring to give you more color and blooms through out the seasons Peanut Wood Opportunity rover Flower class corvette Begonia Hippeastrum Hemp Flower Pachypodium baronii Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Liriodendron Perennial plant Mattress Textile manufacturing Pachypodium ambongense Kudzu Alfalfa Climate of the Alps Comfrey Sunflower Bamboo Japanese tea ceremony Stairway Pachypodium key to species Flax Potato Zinnia Fruit tree propagation Garden Pachypodium bicolor Marching band Rose European Beech Digital photography Houseplant Carnivorous plant Pachypodium brevicaule Desert Largest organism Sento Biological pest control Pebble bed reactor Biology of the Sierra Nevada Topps Habitats of Pachypodium of Southern Continental Africa and Madagascar Funeral Apple Sage Equine conformation Hamster Yosemite National Park Spring (season) Cannabis cultivation Leaf Olive Drill bit Bladderwort Severe weather terminology (United States) Tulip Brewery Dog agility Drainage Plant Grand Teton National Park Customs and etiquette of Japan Hop (plant) Thermal power station Garden Strawberry Cuscuta Maize Flowering plant Pollen source Betting (poker) Pickup truck Madagascar periwinkle Morphology of Pachypodium CPU cache Atlanta metropolitan area Comics Tire Billiards Quicksort Hash table Cloud Vermicompost Bed (furniture) Sewage treatment Climate of the United Kingdom National Weather Service Ragweed Capercaillie Prosopis cineraria Katamari Damacy Irrigation
