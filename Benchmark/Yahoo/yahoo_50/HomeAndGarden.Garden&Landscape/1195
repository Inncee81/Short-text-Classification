my turf is now weeks old what now i laid turf two weeks ago most of it is growing very well and is a luscious deep green there are some patches of dead which will be highlighted when the turf is cut i was told to leave it weeks before cutting is this true it will be waist high by then also some of the grass is beginning to flower should i cut it before it flowers too much lastly i hope to reseed the dead patches but do i had to dig up the dead grass first or just scatter the seed onto the dead patches thanks in advance cut your lawn before it flowers flowering will only weaken the root system while it is getting established one word of advice for the first couple years only use granular weed and feed i wouldn't do it any longer this year but next spring would be fine keep it moist the healthy grass will spread into the dead areas Lawn Weed control Comfrey Flowering plant Golf Weed Tobacco Alfalfa Turf maze Wheat Wood Drainage Sod Bamboo Herbicide Sorghum Casting Hemp Peat Creeping Charlie Flax Agrostis Cannabis cultivation Pansy Xeriscaping Hop (plant) Gypsy moth Flower Potato Tennis Avalanche Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir Kudzu Fireweed Jute Orchidaceae The Amber Spyglass Cricket pitch Longleaf Pine Watermelon Elis Prefecture Poaceae Wisteria Grand Teton National Park Battles of Lexington and Concord Cannabis (drug) Fruit tree propagation Sweet potato Guinea pig Monarda Clover Beetle Monocotyledon Rice The Championships, Wimbledon Apple Eucalyptus Little Shop of Horrors Carnivorous plant Garden Strawberry Maize Black pepper Bread Biodynamic agriculture Ragwort Lechaina Vowel Diseases of the honeybee Gooseberry Burdock Kasparov versus The World Plant Tree Vegetation Patterson's Curse Drooping Brome Cannabis Cortaderia selloana Coachella Valley Hamster The Fens Coconut A151 road Biological pest control Tamarix Equine conformation Sugar beet Christmas tree The Catcher in the Rye Auxin Deforestation Glacier Dandelion Wandering Jew (plant) Chapterhouse Dune Pollinator decline Herbal tea Cuscuta Campfire
