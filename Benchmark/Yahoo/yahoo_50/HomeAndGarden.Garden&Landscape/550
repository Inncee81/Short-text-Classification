how do i dust dried flowers spring cleaning time i have aot of dried flowers in baskets all over my home mostly babies breath and roses that are dried how do i get the dust off them any suggestions the best method i have found is using a swiffer dust cloth you can either use the cloths for the floor swiffers or look for a dusting tool also made by swiffer with fluffy replacement heads in a box just gently wipe over the surfce with these cloths to remove the dust the more delicate dried flowers may do better with being dusted off my an air can duster these can be found at office supply stores as they are used for dusting computer keyboards etc just make sure when you use the air can you stand back far enough so the air stream pressure is lessened also remember that dried flowers also have a shelf life when they get too tattered or too dusty or too crumbly it's time to say goodbye hope this helps and good luck Vacuum cleaner Fecal incontinence Japanese tea ceremony Carbon dioxide Upholstery Textile manufacturing Hard disk Dialysis Drill bit Hemp Collecting fossils Mattress Carpet Typewriter Fire fighting Glossary of firefighting equipment Air filter Tofu Air pollution Knife Menstrual cup Earwax Caving Dry cleaning Tlingit Pysanka Tattoo Hamster Pottery Table saw Irrigation Wind The Curse of Fenric Breathing gas Diving Vanilla Dust Apple Drowning Weaving Washing machine Charles Goodyear Cannabis cultivation Mars House dust mite Thermal power station Mario Radon Ammunition Electrostatic precipitator Dairy The Time Machine Sesshomaru Soul Japanese toilet Urinary incontinence Little Britain Honey Brewery Gas mask Cosmic dust Diving suit Halitosis Tea Wok Puff pastry Flower Christmas tree Sento Toilet paper E Street Band Loudspeaker The Star Wars Holiday Special Gliding Wood carving Password Floristry Diseases of the honeybee Gaia Online ITunes Laundry Gramophone record Toilet humour Diatomaceous earth Fan (implement) Aerial (dance move) Glossary of firefighting terms Atari ST Library Hay Hydrogen peroxide Clothing Seismic retrofit Haloalkane Dust devil Hat Plastic Oscilloscope Customs and etiquette of Japan
