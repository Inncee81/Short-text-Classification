how do you get rid of gophers without killing them they're eating up the backyard is there something in the store that i can buy that will make them go somewhere else i refuse to harm them first let me commend you on your commitment to allowing wild animals their right to life and for your conservation of nature first do you know whether you are dealing with gophers or moles because that makes a difference in how you'll go about getting rid of them moles make long tunnels just under the surface that may run for several feet in an erratic fashion gophers will make a large pile of dirt in several spots with the tunnels being concealed by their depth moles are insectivores that eat things like grubs earthworms and small burrowing animals spray the yard with an insecticide like diazinon to kill the bugs and the moles will leave remove the food source and the nuisance animal should move on gophers are rodents and vegetarians that eat plants again remove the food source and the nuisance animal should move on if you have a garden or weeds in your yard this may be what is attracting the gopher see what sorts of large rooty plants are available and remove them and in a few weeks the gophers should move on too another method is to place nocuous materials in the burrows i have heard that castor beens are effective as well as used cat litter http www american lawns com problems gophers out html there are also commercial gopher repellants http www critter repellent com gopher gopher repellent php sometimes flooding the tunnels with a garden hose is effective if you have loose slightly sandy soil that gophers particularly like this may not work once you get rid of the gophers moles you may want to invest in keeping them out i've had great success with digging around the perimeter to the enclosed area until i hit clay or about two feet down neither animal regularly tunnels through clay then i place sheet iron vertically in the trench and fill it back in with the sheet iron acting as a wall this method may be effective at keeping moles and gophers out of an area for forty years or more it's a heavy labor investment as well as financial but it works well for a very long time Hamster Pocket gopher Cat Irrigation Earthworm Compost Casting Hedgehog Mosquito Hydroponics Organic farming Biological pest control Carnivorous plant Vermicompost Pesticide Weed control Dairy Seismic retrofit Deforestation Trench warfare Fancy rat Sewage treatment Gopher protocol Fauna of Australia Guinea pig Blesmol Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Erosion Creatures in Bionicle Textile manufacturing Anchor Glossary of wildland fire terms Combine (Half-Life 2) Mole (animal) Drainage Siege Snake Cannabis cultivation Burial Fire fighting Gray Wolf Hemp Air-raid shelter Vegetarianism Tobacco Domestic rabbit Drill bit Spider Nerpa Richardson's Ground Squirrel Ferret Uniform Resource Locator Seabird Lawn Comfrey Vegetation Angling Golden mole Stalag Luft III Livestock Acorn Insecticide 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Happy Tree Friends Blood (computer game) Gypsy moth Gas metal arc welding PHP Soil pH Soil Pollinator decline Mattress Volleyball Poker jargon Caterpillar D9 Surtsey Pottery Gardening Animal Crossing USS Whale (SS-239) Rodent Pile Web browser Soil life Textile manufacturing terminology Dam Worms weapons and tools Mountain Beaver Weed Coffee
