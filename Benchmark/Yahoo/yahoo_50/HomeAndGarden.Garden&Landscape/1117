how do you lay turf grass i have a lawn but the grass is really patchy with weeds coming through i have decided to buy some rolls of lawn because it is quicker and easier then planting seeds and looks nicer when laying the rolls of turf can i just lay them on top of my old lawn or do i have to turn the earth over before laying it you will need to remove all current growth on lawn including weeds the grass can be sliced off using a spade or equipement which can be hired you will also need to dig out the weeds or if you not worried about using chemicals its is easier to apply weedkiller containing glyphosate eg round up you may need to treat the area a few times before all the weeds die off you may have to allow time for the weedkiller to inactivate before laying the new turf see manufacturer's guide once the soil is cleared you will then have to even out the surface esp if you have dug out some of the more stubborn weeds a landscape rake is an excellent tool for the job and it will take some time to get the whole area level you will then have to consolidate the soil to prevent the lawn becoming uneven when the soil settles do this by shuffling over the area with pidgeon steps on your heels walk up and down the area from edge to edge don't walk about on it randomly as this may lead to more unevenness after the area is consolidated you will then need to rake the soil lightly with a metal rake so that small crumbs form ie a fine tilth is obtained and fine levelling can be done at the same time try not to move too much soil with the metal rake as this may lead to more unevenness and the job could take all day very time consuming but necessary you can then either lay turf or sow seed both should ideally be done in spring or autumn if you are going to lay turf purchase the turf as close to the day as you intend to lay the lawn if you have to buy it turf a few days before you lay it then unroll the turves and lay them in a shady area and water daily very prone to drying out and dying try not to leave them like this for more than absolutely necessary start laying the turves from one corner and lay them in a brick fashion making sure the edges butt closely together otherwise the edges will dry and you will be left with an outline of dead grass on edges of each join do not walk on the laid turves and use a plank of sturdy wood to stand on once each turf is laid place a wooden plank on top of the turf and gently walk up and down the plank to ensure good contact with soil and grass roots work methodically over the whole area leave fiddly corners edges etc till last you can cut out any awkward shapes later use an old but sharp kitchen life for this water area well and keep off the turf until roots established you will notice new growth when this happens it may take a few weeks so take care not to walk on it and make sure you water well even daily if necessary maintaining the lawn once established is another matter altogether and requires time and effort as you know seed sowing takes more time and patience but can eventually lead to a tougher more hardwearing lawn if you want to sow seeds choose seed type according to the kind of wear and tear the lawn will take many varieties of seed mix available for a tough lawn choose a mix containing ryegrass in for a fine lawn use a mix which contains fescues manufacturer will usually specify as a rule of thumb you need to use g seed per meter squared of soil measure out quantity needed then divide in half it is a good idea to measure out an area of soil approx m x m and sow g of seed to check the density of sowing requred sow seed by broadcasting ie holding a handful at just below waist height and scatter evenly working in one direction take the other half and broadcast at degrees to the first half of seed gently rake over the whole area to cover the seeds taking care not to dig too deep you will then need to water if soil very dry growth can take anything from days do not walk on the area until strong growth seenwhich could take up to a month once grass reaches cm you can then mow the lawn on a high setting for the first time if you cant be bothered to do either consider gravelling or paving over the area very low maintenance if you have a busy lifestyle hope this is useful and good luck Flax Lawn mower Weed control Drainage Wood Equine conformation Mattress
