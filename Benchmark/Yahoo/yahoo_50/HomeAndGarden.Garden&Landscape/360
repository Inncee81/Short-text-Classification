i have a rosemary bush which is going brown does anyone know what i can do about it its in a small pot and i water it regularly but not too much some of the leaves are looking dead what can i do to save my plant it probably need to be repotted in a bigger pot it could be root bound or it may need to be fed with plant food i would repot it and feed it give it a good watering and see if it comes back to life in a week or growing and caring for rosemary plants the three fundamentals for successfully growing rosemary are sun good drainage and good air circulation if you live in a frost free area you can grow rosemary in the ground year round provide a sandy well draining soil and hours of full sunlight rosemary is not a heavy feeder but fertilizing in spring with a fish kelp emulsion will get it off to a good start for the season periodic foliar sprays with the emulsion will keep it looking great bringing rosemary indoors where the winter temperatures dip below degrees f rosemary plants will have to spend the winter indoors in this case it's easier to grow your rosemary in a container all year since rosemary likes it on the dry side terra cotta pots are an especially good choice just be sure it doesn't bake and completely dry out while outdoors during the summer bring the potted rosemary inside once the temperature inches into the s it can be a little trickier to keep rosemary happy inside your rosemary plant will still require hours of full sun so artificial lights may be necessary heat is not as crucial as sunlight pest and problems of rosemary plants the biggest problem with growing rosemary indoors is its tendency to get powdery mildew powdery mildew is a white powdery fungus that can develop if the surrounding air is humid and there is not enough air movement powdery mildew won't kill your rosemary but it will weaken the plant keep the humidity low by allowing the soil to dry somewhat between waterings keeping the plant in sunlight and if necessary running a fan for a few hours a day to create a breeze also be on the lookout for aphids and spider mites these pests seem to live on houseplants for the winter catching them before a total infestation will make them easier to control repeated spraying with insecticidal soap per package directions should take care of the problem maintaining a potted rosemary move your potted rosemary back outdoors once all danger of frost has past as with most potted plants the soil in your rosemary pot will degenerate through watering and root growth repot at least once a year spring is a good time to repot your rosemary but it should be fine no matter what time of year you get to it when the rosemary plant puts out considerable growth or looks like it just can't get enough water it has outgrown its pot and needs to be transplanted into a larger one if you want to maintain the size of your rosemary plant root prune it by slicing off a couple of inches of the roots from the bottom and sides of the root ball and replanting in the same pot be sure to trim some of the top at the same time to lessen the work load of the roots and the stress placed upon the trimmed plant then allow your repotted plant some time to regroup it should reward you with many more seasons of snippings Cannabis cultivation Hydroponics Garden Strawberry Hippeastrum Gypsy moth Hamster Carbon dioxide Biological pest control Thermal power station Diseases of the honeybee Organic farming Fancy rat Weed control Wheat Poker jargon Vermicompost Coffee Desert Lake Tea Wood Irrigation Fruit tree propagation Tobacco Comfrey Tillandsia Sorghum Sewage treatment Solar power Upholstery Aquarium Agriculture Venus Flytrap Climate of the United Kingdom Kudzu Casting Autonomous building Pottery Textile manufacturing Peanut Avalanche Pruning fruit trees Dundas Square Drainage Flax Sunlight Las Vegas metropolitan area Banana Renewable energy Volleyball European Beech Barbecue Soil life Cookware and bakeware Atlanta metropolitan area Weed Gas metal arc welding Olive Equine conformation Fish farming Begonia Fire fighting Energy development Mattress Bread Tofu Dairy Sugar beet Death Valley National Park Brewery Physiological plant disorders Bee Fertilizer Maize Japanese tea ceremony Christmas tree Hemp Creeping Charlie Chicken Yosemite National Park Soil Daylight saving time Water Greenhouse Bamboo Utah Chocolate Aphid DDT
