why can't fred weasley have a portrait okay so you know how when all of the headmasters of hogwarts die they get a portrait in the headmaster's office where they can live eternally in hogwarts well as a solution to fred weasley's tragic death can't he have a portrait made of himself one could hang in the weasley joke shop and another could hang in the burrow how can someone get a portrait made of themselves and if it's only for important witches and wizards wouldn't fred's death be considered martyrdom seeing that he died for the greatest good utilitarianism should deem importance any thoughts hi actually believe it or not i've though of this from the beggining of the books i've always asked myself why couldn't harry's parents get a portrait this intensified on book when i saw sirius' mother's portrait at grimauld place why some and not others the explanation i've come up with is that the person should make the portrait while being alive and maybe there is a kind of charm that activates part of the portrait once the person dies i've given this quite a lot of thought as you see all of hogwarts headmasters and headmistress go through this process when they are named headmasters or headmistresses so automatically when they died they get a portrait i guess that people with money as sirius' mother can have it done if they want too i think it takes a spell and a good painter of course or a brush that is a wand god i certainly hope jk rowling gets that encyclopedia out soon goodluck Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Blood purity (Harry Potter) Magical objects in Harry Potter Dates in Harry Potter Diagon Alley Hogwarts Ron Weasley Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Wizarding world Hermione Granger Albus Dumbledore Hogwarts subjects Rubeus Hagrid Lord Voldemort Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Weasley family Molly Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Harry Potter: Book Seven Order of the Phoenix Battle of Hogwarts Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Ginny Weasley Minor characters associated with Quidditch Luna Lovegood Phineas Nigellus Sirius Black Severus Snape Neville Longbottom Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Portraits in Hogwarts Charmed Grimmauld Place Horace Slughorn Draco Malfoy House-elf Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Dolores Umbridge Minor Slytherins Hogwarts Houses Minor Hogwarts teachers Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Remus Lupin Minor Ravenclaws Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) J.
