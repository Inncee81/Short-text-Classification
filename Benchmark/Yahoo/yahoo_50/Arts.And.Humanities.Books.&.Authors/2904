anyone ever publish their own children's books i am currently illustrating a series of children's books i've done so far and i've got about more to do in this series with more on the way i'm sure i and the writers of these books have never published our own books before we have started marketing and selling them at craft fairs and we have a few good leads to selling them nationwide the books are about native american fairy children who learn basic life lessons has anyone else out there published their own books and if so what would you care to share with me about that thanks in advance self publishing is a dangerous route to travel on generally people self publish when they can't find a traditional publisher your books sound very interesting i bet you anything that numerous publishing companies would be very interested in something so original i understand selling them at craft fairs isn't really enough but please consider traditional publishers there are many worldwide who deal with childrens' books self publishing involves you spending the money doing all the marketing and advertising major book stores don't carry self published books you might find yourself back at the craft fair as the only place to sell the books while your pockets have been emptied by the self publishing companies traditional publishers don't consider works that have already been self published so please be careful write a query letter to as many publishers as you can find with a sample of the books asking if they would like to see more keep trying til you get a positive response and i'm sure you will Children's literature UK Singles Chart The Hobbit Insurance Publishing Publicly funded medicine Laura Ingalls Wilder American comic book Fair use Carl Barks Roxette Surveillance Health insurance Gary Snyder Short selling Hangul Aesthetic Realism Vanity press Prolog Neopets Cable television Burger King Self-publishing Mergers and acquisitions Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Image Comics Fairy tale Video game publisher Commodore International The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Microeconomics Globalization Storytelling Ethical consumerism Kender Neil Gaiman A Course In Miracles Say's law Nurse Endgame Nintendo Novel Esperanto as an international language Boeing Michael J.
