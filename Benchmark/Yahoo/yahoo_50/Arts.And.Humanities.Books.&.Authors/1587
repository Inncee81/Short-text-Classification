mansfield park by jane austen if any of u have read that book can u plz share ur views with me about edmund bertram im confused about his character does he sincerely love fanny price or was it just a reconcilation that he couldnt get mary crawford it all happens pretty quickly at the end of the book doesn't it but i think austen meant for us to understand that edmund really did love fanny he'd considered her a friend for all those years and didn't stop to think about her in a romantic way until after ending his romance with mary crawford edmund never truly loved mary he was attracted to her because of her looks her wit and the fact that she was someone new but he didn't understand what her personality was really like at the time once he realized the truth about her he wasn't interested anymore this also helped him to see that fanny had the qualities he wanted in a wife like kindness and modesty qualities that mary did not possess Mansfield Park Mary Wollstonecraft Jane Austen Charmed Novel Days of our Lives Taken EastEnders Pride and Prejudice Mary Shelley Kodocha Mary Jane Watson Gwen Stacy Agatha Christie Fanny Burney Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) English literature Joan Crawford Hermione Granger Love Charles Dickens Anne Louise Germaine de Sta__l History of modern literature History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Knots Landing Daredevil Eastern Orthodox Church Percy Bysshe Shelley Soap opera Nicomachean Ethics John Howard Yoder Metonymy Marilyn Monroe Gia Carangi Ginny Weasley Epistemology Sense and Sensibility The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy AFI 100 Years series Neighbours The Origin of Species Sharon Tate Deconstruction Frank Herbert Desperate Housewives English novel Ron Weasley Theodicy Sexual revolution Richard Aldington Fancy Crane Past teachings of Prem Rawat Friends Mary Sue Urantia Oasis (band) Jiddu Krishnamurti Desire (album) The Europeans Romance novel The Invisibles The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mary Poppins Pendennis Modesty Blaise Fanny Blankers-Koen Anne Boleyn Henry Thrale The Country Wife Thomas Chatterton Tintin in Tibet Ten Commandments Theory of conduct Girly Guiding Light Blood on the Tracks Lancelot Sin Mystique (comics) 2004 Republican National Convention William Shakespeare Predestination Philosophy Rowland Taylor Cardcaptor Sakura Scenes from a Memory The Silence of the Lambs Past characters (Neighbours) Edmund Burke New Morning Ultimate Spider-Man Prince Edmund (Blackadder) All My Children Michel Henry Clarence Thomas Shrek 2 The Amber Spyglass Value Argus Filch
