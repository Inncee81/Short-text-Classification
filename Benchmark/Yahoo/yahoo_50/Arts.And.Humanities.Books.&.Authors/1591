did you really like harry potter and the deathly hallows i am not saying it's rubbish or anything but don't you think the book was a bit too fast harsh and small this was the last book and jkr could have easily made it about a pages it was as if she was in a hurry to finish the book hedwig harry's faithful owl is blasted and dead in the first pages madeye the best auror of the ministry is killed like a gibbon virtually without a fight by voldemort and in hogwarts snape dies within lines after being bitten by a snake now that's outrageous to kill a prince like that i was expecting him to die fighting voldemort or harry in case he was bad lupin and tonks die unnoticed and jkr very cruelly rips apart the weasley twins by cutting off george's ear and then killing fred and to add to all these voldemort dies without a fight surrounded by his enemies like vultures surround a dead body what's the use of describing a person as the darkest wizard if the only time he really shows his power is against dumbledore in order of the phoenix again after all this is over there is no mention of very important characters like mcgonagall luna lovegood kreacher dean thomas cho chang the only thing that touched my heart was the valiant death of dobby sad he had to die anyway do you think jkr did justice to the series that she so craftfully constructed for years mindy it's not a spoiler and i am not saying that i didn't like the book but she could have done with killing the important characters with a bit more dignity hazeltin snape was not only 'prince' but also a 'prince' in his acts too i agree that all the deaths were harsh but since i follow jo's press statements closely i have to say that there is symbolism in every death for instance the death of hedwig was to indicate that the innocent were not spared during war and personally for harry it indicated that it was time for him to step up the book was fast definitely some loose threads are still left but no worries jo's writing a wizarding world encyclopedia the lupins not getting a death scene was really cruel though i knew they were goners the moment remus named harry ted's godfather somehow it hit me snape the tragic hero however great a wizard he maybe i think magically voldemort is much greater and i also get the feeling that snape didnt want to save himself fred i am heartbroken about his death i cant imagine the magical world without fred voldemort's death was caused by a rebound curse i guess it just shows that you dont need avada kedavra anyone to win harry would've never been able to actually use the killing curse on someone dobby's death too was heartwrenching but the fact remains that the magical world was in a state of war and in war people die Hogwarts Dumbledore's Army Harry Potter: Book Seven Draco Malfoy Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Hermione Granger Nymphadora Tonks Peter Pettigrew Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Horcrux Ministry of Magic Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Diagon Alley James and Lily Potter Weasley family Bellatrix Lestrange House-elf Minor characters associated with Quidditch Sybill Trelawney Minor Ravenclaws Rubeus Hagrid Horace Slughorn Dolores Umbridge Wizarding world Neville Longbottom Minor Hufflepuffs Half-Blood Prince (character) Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Luna Lovegood Magical beasts (Harry Potter) Fred and George Weasley Potions in Harry Potter Cedric Diggory Lucius Malfoy Rita Skeeter Dark Art Fawkes Ordinary Wizarding Level Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Dobby Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) R.A.B.
