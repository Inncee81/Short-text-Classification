harry potter did snape actually like love harry i seem to get different answers and so i got a bit confused its the part where dumbledore asks snape if he cares for harry and snape casts a patronus and he asks after all this time and snape answers always is it that snape has grown to care about harry and always has or that he denies that he cares for harry and summons the patronus to show that he only does this because he cares about lily also in the book it says that someone had tears in their eyes i thought it was snape but i read it over and it could have been either one i think it's quite clear snape never liked harry he was blinded by the fact that he was the son of the woman he loved i get that actually if you're the right sort of insanely jealous person you'll always hate the child of the person you love because you'll be thinking 'he should've been mine ' also harry constantly reminded snape of james who he hated snape casts the patronus to remind dumbledore of it's form a doe symbol of lily the female stag i e james i'd always assumed it was dumbledore's eyes that had tears in them but you're right it's a bit confusing depending on how you read it everything he did was for lily he only protected harry for her but i think it's plainly obvious he despised him when snape dies he wants to look at harry's eyes so he can see lily's eyes one last time which i find a bit creepy personally chalice Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix James and Lily Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Magical objects in Harry Potter Lord Voldemort Order of the Phoenix Albus Dumbledore Hogwarts Houses Ron Weasley Horace Slughorn Hogwarts subjects Dates in Harry Potter Hermione Granger Battle of Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Rubeus Hagrid Magic (Harry Potter) Patronus Charm Death Eater Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Fawkes Half-Blood Prince (character) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Minor Hufflepuffs Sirius Black Dementor Ginny Weasley Peter Pettigrew Draco Malfoy Nymphadora Tonks Blood purity (Harry Potter) Dursley family Legilimency Hogwarts Luna Lovegood Minor Harry Potter Beasts Occlumency Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Minor Ravenclaws Alan Rickman Harry Potter Deer Poppy Pomfrey Hogwarts Floor Directory Fan fiction Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Relatives of Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Unbreakable Vow Cho Chang Sybill Trelawney The Death Gate Cycle Phoenix Neville Longbottom The Devil Wears Prada Spoiler (media) Ministry of Magic Book of Isaiah R.A.B.
