deathly hallows agaaaaain but why did dumbledore set up the hallow quest for harry if he knew that lilys blood in voldermort would help him survive the avada kedavra they helped him master death and accept it buut how how did the stone and cloak and wand united mean he had accepted death s hi i think the quest itself allowed harry to grow up in many aspects and allowed him to understand many many things besides you have to remember that real quest was for horcruxes not for hallows the experiences he lived allowed him to accept dead because he embraced what he though his destiny was to die for a greater good you may say that if you don't fear something then you master it ergo that would have made harry the master of death it is true that harry never had the three hallows physically at the same time but when he faces voldemort all three of the hallows were his actually he had the stone and the cloak he didn't have the wand but without knowing it he already was his master so in a way he was the master of the hallows right lily's blood is a permanent protection no doubt but he didn't die when voldemort killed him because he harry had two souls inside of him his own and a piece of voldemort's voldemort killed out his own piece when he struck harry giving chance to harry's soul wow this is complicated i hope to have been of help goodluck Lord Voldemort Harry Potter (character) Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Dates in Harry Potter Death Eater Horcrux Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter: Book Seven Battle of Hogwarts Severus Snape Magic (Harry Potter) Ron Weasley Sirius Black James and Lily Potter Kain (Legacy of Kain) Order of the Phoenix Peter Pettigrew R.A.B.
