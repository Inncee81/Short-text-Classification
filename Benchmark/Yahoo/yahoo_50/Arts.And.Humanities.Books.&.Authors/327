how do i stop being so obsessed with the harry potter series not knowing your age this is a very difficult question to address regardless the true of the matter is when compared to other literary works harry potter is not among the classics ask yourself this question if not for the extensive marketing and hype created by the publisher would you still read this series my suggestion is to expand your mind and consider reading something else i am sure you are an intelligent person and do not need someone telling you what books you should be reading Harry Potter J.
