how are author's paid is it a commision based on each book they sell do they get paid differently for domestic and international sales generally speaking at what level does an author begin to be able to command a fee for a speaking engagement or reading these questions don't pertain to mega superstar authors i am just talking about the average new to the business writer it depends on the publisher in the case of smaller publishers you most likely receive no advance just royalties on sales they are paid according to contract quarterly bi annually whatever the contract states most smaller publishers don't have the money on hand to advance one thing you must remember is that with these small publishers there is a lot of scamming going on you are entitled by law to see the books and records of the company to ensure they are not underpaying you you can also go to distributors like ingram and bakertaylor and use their automated lines to type in your isbn and find out exactly how many of your books are sold you can do that with any book it is your job to make sure you're paid fairly ask for records if you are with a large publisher you will receive an advance the formula for figuring an advance is of the expected royalties on the entire first print run in other words the average print run these days is thousand copies if your book sells for your royalty would be per book or for copies half of that would be that would be your advance it would be paid to you less which would be sent directly to your agent who negotiated the deal when and if your book sells more than copies you start getting royalties on additional sales again less your agent's fee depending on your contract a second third and subsequent print run may pay royalties on an increasing scale with even bonuses for hitting certain levels if you are lucky and you have a good agent your book may end up in a bidding war and your advance can go way up you can also get a bonus if two or three major publishers really want the book that is your agent's job to do what they can to push your book and encourage more than one publisher to show interest there are clauses in your contract concerning international sales usually your american publisher will give you the rights to sell to a foreign publisher quite honestly most authors don't make much on foreign sales some authors get next to nothing they just want to see the book in other countries it is cool to have russian and japanese and french copies of your book on your bookshelf but don't expect a fortune unless the book ends up being a runaway best seller as for commanding fees for speaking engagements and readings the answer is that most authors don't ask anything except perhaps travel expenses you are selling your books readings and signings mean additional sales and they really benefit the author more than they do the bookstore most authors are happy to do it you must remember that as a new author it is highly unlikely that your publisher gives you a marketing budget so promoting the heck out of your book is something you do to help yourself i personally know of one author who would sign on street corners if you let him he took a children's book to on the ny times bestseller list and got himself a very huge contract for a second and third book by promoting himself like crazy it worked for him if he hadn't his book would have gone nowhere fast i would say that unless you are in that megasuperstar category don't push the issue of fees you will probably get told never mind and the store will find another author hungry enough to do it for free just to increase sales hope that helps pax c Publishing Contract Copyright Vanity press Monetary policy Public domain Insurance Microeconomics
