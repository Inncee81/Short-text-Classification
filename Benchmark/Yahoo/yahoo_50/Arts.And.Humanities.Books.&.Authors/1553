what do you think of harry potter book this is for who read it i was disappointed i thought there would be more actions more twists and more love story between harry and ginny and ron and hermione the plot was a bit boring and i would have liked a bit more about bill and his licanthropy plus the american version is pages more than the uk version i mean that is lots of pages more and lots of more story and probably a bit more about bill what do you think sorry maybe i didn't mean boring i did like it but not as much as the others and skullian what do you mean by different set i liked the book but i wish jkr had done a bit more justice in killing many important characters like madeye moody snape lupin and even voldemort with a bit more dignity and i didn't like the death of fred dobby and hedwig at all also nothing is mentioned about the after life of the weasleys the dursleys luna cho chang professor mcgonagall and the other hogwarts staff kreacher and even harry ron and hermione i was also hoping fawkes would make a comeback into the story the british edition could easily have been a pages and the american over pages the american edition is bigger because it has sketches more spacious writing and all Dates in Harry Potter Ron Weasley Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Severus Snape Battle of Hogwarts Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter: Book Seven Weasley family Hogwarts Houses Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Order of the Phoenix Blood purity (Harry Potter) Minor Ravenclaws House-elf Diagon Alley Dumbledore's Army Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Death Eater Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Harry Potter Luna Lovegood Rubeus Hagrid Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Fred and George Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Neville Longbottom Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Minor Hufflepuffs Remus Lupin Magic (Harry Potter) Dobby Minor characters associated with Quidditch Draco Malfoy Magical beasts (Harry Potter) Professor Quirrell Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) James and Lily Potter Cho Chang Sybill Trelawney Potions in Harry Potter Half-Blood Prince (character) Minor Hogwarts teachers Rita Skeeter Fawkes Hogwarts Floor Directory Boggart (Harry Potter) Percy Weasley Minor Slytherins R.A.B.
