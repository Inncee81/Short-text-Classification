what to do with an empty book diary notebook see i had bought this fab custom made leather bound a book with posh heavy cream paper on the spur of the moment in venice reputed for its venezian paper however i dragged it with me each time i moved place and i never found the courage to use it for what it was intended for diary writing as i do not think i would be good at writing since it is in pristine condition i thought i would give it to someone special someone i know who would use it properly do you think i am making the right decision http www lyravenice com eng about htm the website doesn't work but this is the shop i bought it from lyra venezia and they make the stationary by hand which is the one place you may want to go should you go to venice whatever you decide to do with the book is the right thing someone mentioned that you are putting too much pressure on yourself i agree i know where you are coming from though i've picked up journals before and put them aside because i wanted them to be filled with something special now i get one and write what i want to in it if you decide to give it as a gift do so because you have someone special in mind who will use it if you keep it for yourself write what you want in it writing isn't about being brilliant or prolific all the time writing should come from the heart good luck The Amber Spyglass The Subtle Knife Extreme Programming Jiddu Krishnamurti Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon The Diary of a Young Girl Coming of Age (TNG episode) Philosophy of space and time About a Boy The Inside Theory of conduct EastEnders Publication of Darwin's theory Chuck Palahniuk Bookbinding The Apprentice 2 Social rule Bernard Williams Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ludwig Wittgenstein Ayyavazhi mythology Upholstery UK Singles Chart Shaggy dog story Customs and etiquette of Japan Bushido Kasparov versus The World Drag racing The Catcher in the Rye W.I.T.C.H.
