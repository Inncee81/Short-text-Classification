if you were to make a part to the entire first series of harry potter what would your storyline be the scar had not pained harry for nineteen years all was well and then a prequel similar to starwars to worked in the movies so probably james potter and the feuding brothers would work the same way and i'm sure children will still read it besides james potter is an equally lovable and colorful character there is no way to make a true sequel to the story because of the grendel gendel's mother problem if you kill off a villian the only way to revive the story is to come up with a bigger badder villian voldemort is already worse than hitler so where do you go from there i'd like to see that fantasy world live on as something lighter and less epic maybe a hogwarts kids cartoon featuring the kids mentioned in the epilogue dealing with difficult teachers learning spells teenage drama and those meanie slytherin kids but nothing that makes them save the whole world or anything Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter Severus Snape Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter: Book Seven Sequel Minor Hufflepuffs Blood purity (Harry Potter) Ginny Weasley Hogwarts subjects Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Canon (fiction) Albus Dumbledore Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Death Eater Sirius Black Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Science fiction on television Weasley family Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Hogwarts Houses Beowulf Messiahs in fiction and fantasy Daredevil Magic (Harry Potter) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Hermione Granger Spider-Man Horcrux Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Glen Jacobs Rubeus Hagrid Minor Slytherins Half-Blood Prince (character) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Guiding Light The Hogwarts Founders Rita Skeeter The Chronicles of Narnia One Life to Live Dark Art Star Wars Draco Malfoy R.A.B.
