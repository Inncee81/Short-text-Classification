the necronomicon this book would help me understand stuff better if i knew where to get it so does anyone know where i can get my hands on this thx depends on what you're looking for for starters the necronomicon is a fictional book mentioned in hp lovecraft's cthulu stories then there's artist hr giger's collections which while not tied directly to the lovecraft stories will give you nightmares for months giger designed the creatures for the 'alien' film series finally there's a paperback that purports to be a translation of the actual necronomicon and no i don't remember the author sorry that one was out or so years ago and i haven't seen it since according to lovecraft every mortal human who ever attempted to read the necronomicon went stark raving mad must've created all manner of problems for the editors and typesetters not to mention the reviewers check any of the on line book dealers especially alibris or amazon be prepared to pay a bit extra as i haven't seen anything new in the last years or so Necronomicon H.P.
