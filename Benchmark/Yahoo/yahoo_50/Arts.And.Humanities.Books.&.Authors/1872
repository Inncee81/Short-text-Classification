your thoughts on stephenie meyer's latest eclipse i have mixed feelings towards this book i would love to say it was amazingly fascinating and each page was utter bliss well i am never a liar so i'll be honest and say it was a pure bore that's right it was boring in my opinion maybe i'm just not open minded and cannot accept the fact that bella the bella swan that is so crazily in love with edward is also in love with jacob it doesn't make any sense and the fact that she has this undying connection with edward and can not see herself with any other person forever she sure does love kissing that idiot jacob i wanted to kill jacob so so badly i actually wanted him to die but bella would go all physco crazy if that happened i feel as if bella completley lost her mind and was more in love with jake than she was with edward which is strange please comment your thoughts on this book did you like it team edward or jacob was bella annoying to you i would love to read everyone's comments yes unfortunatley she realizes that she's in love with him sorry for no spoiler warning hun however she's still in love with edward too it's as if she has two soul mates if edward and vampires didn't exist she would end up with jake cos' edward would be dead but edward is her soulmate however ugh the next book better have no jake whatsoever lorlor i respect what you wrote and i agree and understand that the ending bit with jacob bella totally summed it off that if the world had no suxh existence of vampires monsters and such edward would be dead however because there is such a thing and she already fell so deeply in love with edward that she'll choose him over anything i understand that jacob is bella's soulmate as well i just hope that he gets imprinted or whatever to another girl because i cannot take him being sad and lonely cos we know bella will get all emotional blaming it all on herself the sick cycle i just hope that the jake mess is over and done with i want edward and bella to concentrate on their relationship and future not a silly love triangle even if it is deeper than that i'm hoping for the next book breaking dawn to have much more edward bella interaction and perhaps go deeper into married life and bella as a vampire lol well i'm going to keep adding i suppose everytime someone responds so here it goes skeleton i agree with everything you are saying twilight was obviously the best book and the most planned it's obvious stephenie probably didn't even think that twilight would get so popular therefore twilight was kinda like an ending already therefore new moon had to spark up some extra storylines the epilogue to me was confusing can anyone explain that i didn't understand jake's thoughts my thoughts of the book are in between i liked the book but at the same time i hated it i hated the fact that bella fell in love with jacob just like you hate it actually i hated all parts with jacob in it i felt that jacob was ruining everything bella and edward ever had and ripping it into pieces i also thought that both bella and jacob were taking advantage of edward's good nature jacob tricked bella into kissing him by telling her that he would kill himself during the battle and that pissed me off big time i agree with you in that jacob should just leave and not return in breaking dawn however i did like the fact that we did get to learn more about jasper and rosalie and that helped me understand their characters more i also like that bella finally agreed to marry edward although i'm not sure considering the whole jacob thing and to answer your question on whose side i am on it's edward One Tree Hill (TV series) Kain (Legacy of Kain) EastEnders Knots Landing God Emperor of Dune The Apprentice 2 The Amber Spyglass Sin City Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Kodocha W.I.T.C.H.
