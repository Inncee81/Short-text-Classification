a question on the proles and their relation to newspeak i am currently reading this novel and i have come across some confustion in part section winston is talking to syme about newspeak and syme states that by no one will be able to understand anything other than newspeak winston states that only the proles will and syme replys back that the proles are not human i know that the proles are the working class but if the language is changing why wouldnt the proles be involved wouldnt they be involved in the change from oldspeak to newspeak and why are they refered to not being humans when they are thank you in the book the proles are seen as machines or animals that do not have any control over what goes on in the country the party controls everything they basically manipulate the truth and reality from history to language to literature there is a continuous tendency of minimizing the old lexis and introducing a new language based on contradicting expressions in order to manipulate not only the truth but thought as well the party's control however does not entirely embrace the proles since they are thought to be puppets rather than human beings the proles are not seen as a danger to the party and the system because they are kept in cages that is they are thought not to be aware of the extensive manipulation the proles are seen as some dumb creatures who can believe anything the party wants them to but winston believes that if there is a ray of hope it lies in the proles he hopes that some day they will rise and overthrow the system similarly he is certain that once newspeak is totally adopted by the members of the party and oldspeak is completely forgotten the proles whose language use is not rigorously controlled by the party will continue to pass on the remains of the old language winston believes that the party's neglect of the proles will eventually cause their fall and will keep the language alive to some extent Nineteen Eighty-Four Newspeak Doublethink Philosophy of mathematics Logic Postmodernism Human Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Martin Heidegger Theodicy Proletariat Fundamentalism Urantia Reality Social class Cultural relativism World government Modernism Ingsoc Oceania (fiction) Liberalism Sociocultural evolution C programming language Philosophy of language Meaning of life C plus plus Scientology beliefs and practices Brave New World Education Neuro-linguistic programming The Age Opus Dei Rhetoric Rudolf Steiner Alfred Korzybski Tacitus Age of Enlightenment Simone Weil Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) The Origin of Species Meme Serialism Law of value Religious pluralism Lisp programming language Vulcan (Star Trek) Civil rights Political correctness G__del's incompleteness theorem Friedrich Schleiermacher Culture Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Dialectic Days of our Lives The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Anthroposophy Anti-communism Working class Free will Theodor Adorno Marvel Universe Milton H.
