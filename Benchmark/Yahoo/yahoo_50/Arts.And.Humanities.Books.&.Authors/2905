with eclipse being so popular why are no stores selling it at midnight like they did with harry potter or if they are and i missed the news can you tell me what stores thanks mara a for your brilliant observation of course it is not as popular there are only books and alot of people won't even read a book unless it's been made into a movie first i think there was some event called the eclipse prom a while back but i don't know any details i really wish there was a party for it and to the answerer who said there was a party because hp was up to the th book that's not entirely true i remember the parties dating back to at least the fourth or fifth book when i starting going and the twilight series especialy eclipse has gained mega popularity so there should be a party and it's so idiotic to think that there can only be a party if the book was made into a movie twilight new moon were awesome and eclipse is going to be just as fantastic with or without the movie coming out first if you go to www barnesandnoble com on the left side of the home page they'll have a store locator you can find in store events there maybe your state has a party or some type of author event maybe they'll have a party for breaking dawn the next book but we have to wait til next year to see Solar eclipse Canon (fiction) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Eclipse Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Twilight Zone Hipparchus (astronomer) J.
