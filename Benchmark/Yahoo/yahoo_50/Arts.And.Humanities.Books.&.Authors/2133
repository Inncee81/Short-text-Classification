eclipse by stephenie meyer what are your thoughts on it warning spoilers omg i stayed up all night reading eclipse and i finished at like am it was so good after reading it i was totally speechless for the first few minutes all i could say was wow i mean seriously this was the best one although stephenie said that this book was lighter than new moon lighter in this case meaning not as depressing some parts still made me cry you know reading new moon i never would have guessed that it would turn out that jacob loves bella i thought it was just a really big crush nothing like what it turned out to be it seems that he loves her as much as edward and i was really suprised that she actually loved jacob too you know with edward being the love of her life or more like existance and all but i guess that's understandable considering what she and jacob had been through in new moon when edward left her and i was also suprised to find out that if things had been different if she had met jacob before edward if the world she lived in was normal jacob would have been the love of her existance not edward now i feel really really bad for jacob he loves bella and she loves edward more than him and that we've seen more about him got to know him better all i can hope for is that he finds someone to imprint with someone to ease the pain t t another part i was shocked about was the sex i know it never got to that point yet but i never expected it to be mentioned in the books but looking bella's and edward's situation it was bound to come up eventually one thing i'm wondering though at the very end of the book in the last couple of pages is jacob running to any particular place or is he just running randomly in the forest one thing i forgot to add wohoo victoria's dead d i just now finished because i had to go to school yipee but i loved it i do think there was a little to much bella jacob relationship though a lot of it needed to be there to answer all of those questions i've never been a big jacob fan and she loves jacob my response was wtf just no and then she kissed him that was just stupid hello you belong with edward you know it we know it everyone knows it i was a little confused about edward not fighting a little more for her but i was also glad that he didn't because it meant that he realized that it caused her pain bella and edward will marry in the next book and she will be made into a vampire i always suspected that jacob loved her not a surprise but the surprise was her loving him that's not supposed to happen i thought the sex issue was hilarious i got to that part in ap english this morning that was torture becuase my teacher started talking and then i had to wait for my next class to read anymore and edward's reason that was hilarious and awesome and made sense he's old fashioned and it's coupled with stephenie meyer's own mormom upbringing i don't think jacob was running anywhere in particular i think he was just running to try to forget everything he was running to become the wolf the animal instead of the man instead of jacob black i had expected jane to do more or say more and there were other parts that i felt like something that had been cut out i guess we'll just have to wait for the out takes from it yes victoria's dead i was so glad to hear that all the back history was great especially rose that explained so much Jon Secada Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Scenes from a Memory Social rule Shaggy dog story About a Boy Miss Saigon Avenue Q Pitaten Glen Jacobs One Tree Hill (TV series) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Amber Spyglass EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Sin City The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sydney Riot of 1879 Milton H.
