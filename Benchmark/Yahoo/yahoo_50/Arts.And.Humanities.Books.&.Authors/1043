isn't voldemort the most powerful i've heard that the most powerful wizard in the harry potter series is dumbledore but in the seventh book it's revealed that he had the elder wand i think that he wouldn't be as powerful as voldemort if he didn't have this assistance i don't know while that is a very good point thanks for bringing it up by the way you also have to consider the wand wielder even if dumbledore's wand was super powerful it wouldn't have done much good if dumbledore wasn't a good enough wizard to know what spells to cast and how to cast them and didn't it say something in the book i only read it once and a friend's borrowing it so i can't check about the wand only being as powerful as the wizard Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Albus Dumbledore Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter (character) Severus Snape Harry Potter: Book Seven Magic (Harry Potter) Rubeus Hagrid Dates in Harry Potter Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Diagon Alley Ministry of Magic Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince James and Lily Potter Rita Skeeter Death Eater Sybill Trelawney Horace Slughorn Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Minor Ravenclaws Harry Potter Draco Malfoy Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Wizard Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Fawkes Battle of Hogwarts Minor Hufflepuffs Hermione Granger Wizarding world R.A.B.
