harry potter deaths why does she whiz over them jk rowling writes strange deaths in hallows madeye died too soon and it was glossed over and so i didn't feel like as if it was a great loss hedwig the same i think lupin was done fairly well what him being a favourite character of mine and having a lonely son by far the best were fred and dobby because jk gave it a few sentences each but the deaths were too quick and we weren't given the time needed to mourn these guys i think it was a rush however the most powerful death of the series was snape it is the only one i look back at and wonder in amazement i completely agree i wasn't sad about the deaths except snape i thought his death or his memories rather was the saddest part of the book everyone else except snape was just killed they just died without much said about their deaths Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter: Book Seven Order of the Phoenix Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Magical objects in Harry Potter Lord Voldemort Hogwarts subjects Hogwarts Houses Remus Lupin Battle of Hogwarts Ron Weasley Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone James and Lily Potter Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter Hermione Granger Horace Slughorn Peter Pettigrew Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter J.
