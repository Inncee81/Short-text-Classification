why was the seventh and final harry potter book called the deathly hallows please read the deatails i understand the relevence the deathly hallows had in the book but j k rowling kept stating that when you have all three hallows you will become master of death but no one became master of death so why call the book 'the deathly hallows' horcruxes played a much bigger roll in the plot than hallows did please tell me is there something i have missed in the final book harry used all three of the deathly hallows to overcome voldemort the elder wand when voldemort tried to use it against him and it backfired the resurrection stone to receive the protection of his parents sirius and lupin when he went to face voldemort in the forest and the invisibility cloak to hide himself after voldemort thinks he's killed him when harry opens the snitch he physically possesses two of the hallows resurrection stone and invisibility cloak and he is the master of the elder wand so at that point he is the master of death once he loses the resurrection stone in the forest he is no longer the master of death he chooses to not try to be the master of death by choosing not to keep the elder wand or to retrieve the resurrection stone the elder wand was also very important in that voldemort wanted it too if he had been able to be master of the wand then the story could have turned out very differently harry defeated voldemort because of his use of all three of the deathly hallows without them i don't think harry could have defeated him Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter: Book Seven Magical objects in Harry Potter Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Diagon Alley Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Sirius Black Death Eater Hogwarts Albus Dumbledore James and Lily Potter Order of the Phoenix Horcrux Magic (Harry Potter) Severus Snape Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Rubeus Hagrid Harry Potter Blood purity (Harry Potter) Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts Regulus Black R.A.B.
