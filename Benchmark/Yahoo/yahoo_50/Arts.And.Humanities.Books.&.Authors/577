is it okay to send my manuscript out to multiple literary agents at the same time i've heard you're only supposed to concentrate on one literary agent at a time but that seems like it would drag the process out longer than necessary wouldn't it be smarter to send it to a bunch of agents at once i've heard you're only supposed to concentrate on one literary agent at a time but that seems like it would drag the process out longer than necessary wouldn't it be smarter to send a manuscript to a bunch of agents at once or should i forget about the manuscript and just send out a bunch of query letters to various agents instead my dear you have been given a ton of wrong information today i don't know who your first three answerers are but they have misled you terribly first of all to the answerer directly above me a query and a submission are the same thing it is really bad when you don't know the correct answer and you just guess at it or make stuff up it is wrong to mislead people the correct answer only if the literary agents who you are interested in querying state in their submission guidelines that multiple submissions are accepted can you send a submission to more than one at a time i would never send to more than two at a time and then only if both state multiple submissions are accepted it is industry standard that you afford each of them the courtesy of letting them know you have submitted elsewhere at the same time you don't have to identify the other agent just so they both know you have sent a query out twice to send to a bunch of agents at once is completely unprofessional and amateur and a pretty sure way of getting yourself a very nasty reputation in the industry the process is a slow one there is nothing you can do about that these agents receive thousands of submissions a week especially with all the misinformation going on here and at other forums this is the process in a nutshell you select one or two agents who are currently reading in your genre take a look at who they represent are you familiar with any of the books they have sold that tells you their track record use either writers marketplace which you can buy anywhere for bucks or literary marketplace at a library's research section you can buy one but it costs bucks a year libraries have them in the research section to use there but not check out you investigate the agent go to preditors and editors absolute write water cooler's bewares and background checks writers weekly com and writers wall among others and look for complaints against that agent if there are any move on all of those sites are free to use and you can write to the people who run them if you are in doubt they will all write back if they have any info you should know if the agent checks out read their submission requirements entirely and follow them to the letter that usually means a query letter and perhaps a synopsis of a certain length never send a manuscript to anyone unless you are asked to the submission requirements spell that all out if you are sending out two submissions state that in your query letter it is rude for an agent to get excited about a manuscript not knowing it is in someone else's hands too if you get a bite you will be asked to submit a full or partial manuscript along with a book proposal a book proposal is a very specific document there are several books out there telling you how to write a good one if you are smart you have already had your book edited and your editor will assist with the proposal a good editor knows how to write a great proposal your proposal is the number one selling tool for your book it is what an agent uses to sell your work to a publisher if the agent likes what they see they will sign you however that is just the beginning of your journey that agent now has to shop that book around and try to sell it it could take another year or more to get the book actually sold there are no shortcuts expect a lot of rejection letters gone with the wind got over james patterson got over most writers got stacks of them before they sold a book and don't be surprised if the agent eventually gives up trying to sell your book and fires you happens all the time then you start over looking for another agent i find it appalling that people post incorrect information here i don't know where they get their information or what their track record is but the sad part is often a person with genuine information misses the question and the bad information goes out i am here to tell you this is the proper way to do it i don't know why people feel they have to act like they know what they are talking about when they do not pax c Plame affair Theory of conduct Social rule Peer review Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Open Directory Project Publishing Plame affair timeline Friends Screenplay Killian documents Milton H.
