in the harry potter books i think it's the th harry is in a care of magical creatures lesson and hagrid takes the class to see the thestrals how comes harry never saw them before even though he witnessed his both parents die but when cedric diggory dies he now can see them yeah but in the rd book harry hears his mother dying through the dementors voldemort tells her to step aside so harry did see i doubt at his age he would of shut his eys but even if he did that shouldn't make a difference and neville and luna who can see the thestrals were young as well when they witnessed someone die yet they can still see them and even if harry did see the green flash he would of seen his mother lying there as hagrid picks up harry from the cot crying his eyes out he must of been there for some time so doubtlessls would of seen the body yes but if you go back and read the book luna and neville can also see the thestrals luna mother exploded herself i don't know why neville can but he can it was book that he finally saw the thestrals i always thought that he never saw the thestrals before because he couldn't actually remember his mothers death he didn't see his father die because his father was in the other room his mother did die in his bedroom but i always thought that since he couldn't remember it he couldn't see the thestrals however cedric died in front of him when he was grown enough to remember everything just my opinion Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter (character) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Blood purity (Harry Potter) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Dates in Harry Potter Magical objects in Harry Potter Hogwarts Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Hogwarts Houses Ron Weasley Hermione Granger Magic (Harry Potter) Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Cedric Diggory Death Eater Diagon Alley Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Rubeus Hagrid Severus Snape Rita Skeeter Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Neville Longbottom Magical beasts (Harry Potter) Minor Hufflepuffs Wizarding world Harry Potter: Book Seven Sybill Trelawney James and Lily Potter Ministry of Magic Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Little Britain Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) Triwizard Tournament Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Hogwarts Express Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Minor Hogwarts teachers Azkaban Shaggy dog story Sirius Black Battle of Hogwarts Horace Slughorn Minor characters associated with Quidditch Tom Riddle Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Wand Minor Slytherins Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter Draco Malfoy Incarnations of Immortality Peter Pettigrew Dementor The Amber Spyglass Columbine High School massacre The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dumbledore's Army Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dursley family Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Father's Day (Doctor Who) True Crime: Streets of LA Piccolo Junior Saga Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets The Shining (film) Tom Riddle's diary Dark Art Professor Quirrell Night (book) Fancy Crane Pansy Parkinson Kill Bill One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
