how do i actually get around to writing a book i've written a couple of short stories and poems and stuff and my head is full of ideas for more stories and novels and charecters but i find it impossible to actually get it all out of me onto paper and into a form that makes sence and is enjoyable to read my writing style is good and i think that my content will be good i just need to get it down and i have the perfect oppertunity now as i have a job where i have time to write and i finish at so plenty of time to brainstorm etc i just need some tips etc i know what you are saying it is hard what you should do is write all the thoughts you have in your head on paper they don't have to be in order or anything just write then when all the thoughts you have are on paper put them in order then when you are all organised when you have a thought write it on a peice of paper even if you don't use that thought it will help you to think of more stuff and free your self from keeping all the thought in your head hope this helps if you do this it will trust me The Catcher in the Rye Publication of Darwin's theory Book David Hume Thomas M.
