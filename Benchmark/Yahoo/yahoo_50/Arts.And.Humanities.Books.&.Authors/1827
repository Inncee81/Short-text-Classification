how can you tell if a book is collectible like on amazon com you can post your book as collectible how do you know in general for a book to be considered genuinely collectible it should have limited availability it was published some time ago and or in a limited edition or it was extremely popular but is a first edition first printing or hard to find for some reason secondly the book should be a publisher's edition not a book club version book club editions typically are a somewhat smaller format may have book club edition printed on the inside of the dust jacket and not a discarded former library book the dust jacket should be on the book and both book jacket should be in good to excellent condition although exceptions may be made for a book that is really difficult to find first editions generally tend to be collectible and if it's signed by the author that will add to the value paperbacks would only be considered collectible if they're really rare or if the book was never published in hardcover i'd be cautious about accepting an ebay description i've seen too many instances where sellers describe an item as something that even a little checking will show is not accurate i'd suggest that you check the book in alibris com or abebooks com to see what copies in good condition are currently selling for make sure that it's the same edition as the one listed a first edition is much more collectible than later editions a friend of mine in the antique business says i buy junk sell antiques and i find that there are plenty of people willing to represent their junk as antique or collectible to make a buck keep in mind that there are a lot of specialty collectors too a book that wouldn't be considered collectible for the general public might be worth more to someone looking for it to add to or complete an existing collection Publishing Poker jargon Out-of-print book Textbook Gramophone record Philatelic investment Ebook Abebooks Legal research Vanity press Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Oxford English Dictionary ISBN Trademark Comic book collecting Microeconomics Coin collecting Stamp collecting John Lott The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Betting (poker) Supply and demand Amazon.com Dictionary Doctor Who missing episodes Encyclopedia Comic book World of Warcraft Trade paperback (comics) Magic: The Gathering Gmail Computer Yu-Gi-Oh!
