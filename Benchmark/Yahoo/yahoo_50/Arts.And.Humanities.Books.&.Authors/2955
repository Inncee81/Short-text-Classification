since 'harry potter' is nothing but left wing liberal propoganda should we still let kids read it the novels series is nothing but liberal propoganda and i think we should stop kids from reading them groups such as the john birch society whose articles are referred to by rowling's christianity based opponents have criticised her for a supposed liberal socialist bent and for her admiration for unrepentant socialist and death fetishist extraordinaire jessica mitford who has been her heroine since the age of the potter books read in places like diatribes against the modern middle class especially whenever harry confronts his ludicrously dysfunctional and downright abusive adopted family the dursleys also rowling's portrayal of the bureaucratized ministry of magic and the oppressive measures taken by the ministry in the later books like making attendance at hogwarts school compulsory and the registration of mudbloods with the ministry is an allegory criticizing the state and goverment i will not let commies to poison the minds of our kids ban the potter book hey if million copies of it sold then i guess in your opinion that would mean millions of poisoined minds how are you gonna get those poisoned minds back to normal if you want to ban a book ban it before it sells million copies Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban J.
