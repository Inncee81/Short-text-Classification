who what are the people facts who caused the tragedy in romeo and juliet give explanations please thanks assuming that the tragedy you are referring to is the deaths of romeo and juliet i think most of the characters are in some way or another to blame romeo and juliet themselves were too passionate and unlike as was the pattern of the renaissance times were not very temperate as compared to a character like friar laurence they allowed eros love to overwhelm their logic and romeo especially seemed unable to see a world without juliet look at how he reacted when he was banished this indirectly led to their drastic measures to outsmart fate leading to their deaths friar laurence who interfered in their fate was also responsible as he was the one who gave juliet the potion and also backed romeo in his marriage to juliet many see this action as him being altruistic for the good of society as he believed that the two families would stop feuding but throughout the play it is seen that he gets happiness from making others happy in a way this makes his actions pragmatic lord and lady capulet were hypocrites they told juliet to be temperate and yet themselves were very violent in their responses when she refused to marry paris they did not care to try to understand their daughter and lady capulet even tried to dictate how juliet should feel and behave in a way lady capulet is a lot like mrs bennet from jane austen's pride prejudice as both were intent on conforming their daughters to the gender roles that their respective societies placed neither character cared much for the interests on their own daughter though juliet did albeit sneakily admit to her mother that she had married romeo it is obvious from the relationship juliet had with her parents that telling it to them bluntly and seeking their understanding was never an option this indirectly drove her to such drastic measures of course in the context of that time one could blame it on what we now call 'raging hormones' there was a renaissance belief that if a girl did not have sex get married soon after she reached the age of thirteen the eros energy within her would go haywire leading to lonliness depression thus lord capulet implying that juliet was a whore i know i haven't really nor fully answered your question sorry Pride and Prejudice EastEnders Transsexuality Rom__o et Juliette Mary, the mother of Jesus Gender role Romeo and Juliet (1968 film) The Sims 2 Sigmund Freud Sexual orientation Laurence Olivier Shakespeare on screen Ranma __ characters Altruism Narcissism Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky) The Picture of Dorian Gray Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sharon Tate Aphrodite William Shakespeare Meaning of life The Merchant of Venice Legacy of Kain Novel Marilyn Monroe Nicomachean Ethics Anne Boleyn Polyamory Homophobia Rape Romeo and Juliet (1996 film) Macbeth Recurring South Park characters Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pitaten Epistemology Dynasty (TV series) Franz Boas Capitalism Fathers' rights Social psychology Second language acquisition Same-sex marriage Scientific method The Amber Spyglass Microeconomics Homosexuality Marie Antoinette Simone Weil Wang Mang Iago Tragedy Pedophilia Coercion Philosophy of language Religion Utilitarianism Sense and Sensibility Homosexuality and Christianity Dead Like Me Knots Landing Atheism Objectivist philosophy Drama Predestination Infantilism Feminism Human George III of the United Kingdom Divorce James I of England Alignment (role-playing games) Cross-dressing God Emperor of Dune Democracy One Tree Hill (TV series) Ten Commandments Neighbours Podkayne of Mars Philosophy Abortion debate Jane Eyre Sociocultural evolution Theodicy Adoption Autism Love Nancy Witcher Astor Vittorio Alfieri Incarnations of Immortality Cult Mystique (comics)
