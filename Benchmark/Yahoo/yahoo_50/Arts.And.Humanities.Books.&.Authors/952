how does harry potter and the deathly hallows end okay so the deathly hallows are three objects that are said to be able to conquer death harry's invisibility cloak is one the guant's ring is another and the third one is a very powerful wand called the elder wand or the deathstick the true ownership of the wand can only pass from person to person if one succeeds in defeating disarming counts the previous owner dumbledore obtained it when he defeated grindelwald now when dumbledore was killed remember that malfoy disarmed him with expelliarmus than snape came in and killed him snape is good by the way he had agreed with dumbledore to kill him if nessecary because dumbledore was going to die soon anyway because of the curse that was put on the ring horcrux another important point is that when harry is trapped at the malfoy's mansion he disarms draco this makes harry the true master of the elder wand voldemort then takes the wand from dumbledore's tomb but it never works correctly for him he finally figures out that it is because he never defeated dumbeldore himself he than assumes then that snape is the owner and kills snape in order to gain ownership harry watches as snape is killed snape and voldemort were in the shrieking shack when it happened and harry was in the enterance and when voldemort leaves he goes in and is there when snape actually dies snape gives harry his memories and harry puts then in a silver flask that hermione congures they go to dumbledore's office to look at the memories and harry discovers that snape is on the good side and that he loved lily his entire life he also sees a memory where dumbledore tells snape to let harry know that harry was accidentally made into a horcrux harry realizes that he has to die for voldemort to die and goes to let himself be killed even though one other horcrux is left besides himself nagini voldemort kills him and harry is in this place full of mist that looks like king's cross station and dumbledore is there and talks to him explaining that harry is not actually dead yet he can choose to die or go back and that the peice of voldemort's soul that was in him was destroyed so he is no longer a horcrux what's left of voldemort's soul is also there a miserable creature huddled under a seat harry decides to go back instead of going on and returns to his body meanwhile voldemort had also passed out his death eaters were worried he was dead something to do with the fact that voldemort had used harry's blood to ressurect himself but when harry comes back voldemort gets up too narcissa is sent to check if harry is dead she lies and says he is and voldemort goes back to the castle and shows everyone that harry is dead during the distraction caused by neville killing nagini harry pulls the invisibility cloak on top of himself and watches as the death eaters are defeated one by one as house elves order members teachers students and other creatures band together when molly kills bellatrix voldemort is furious and is about to kill her but harry casts a shield charm to protect her and takes off the invisibility cloak harry taunts voldemort in front of everyone in the great hall informing him that snape was on the good side all along and calls him tom riddle which of course makes voldemort very angry he also explains that snape was never master of the elder wand that malfoy actually was but you're too late said harry you've missed your chance i got there first i overpowered draco weeks ago i tok this wand from him harry twitched the hawthorn wand and he felt the eyes of everyone in the hall upon it so it all comes down to this doesn't it whispered harry does the elder wand in your hand know its last master was disarmed because if it does i am the true master of the elder wand harry potter and the deathly hallows pg voldemort gets really mad and shouts avada kedavra and harry casts expelliarmus but the elder wand refuses to kill its own master and the curse rebounds on voldemort killing him once and for all his horcruxes having all been destroyed the elder wand flies through the air towards harry and he catches it everyone's happy because voldemort is dead but at the same time sad because so many people died fighting him etc etc etc the epilogue takes place years later harry and ginny and their kids are at king's cross station james the oldest is teasing albus
