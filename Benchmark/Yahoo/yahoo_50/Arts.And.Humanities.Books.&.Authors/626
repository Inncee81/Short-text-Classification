has anyone read the daring to dream trilogy by nora roberts i have read the first one and liked it but from the summaries of the others they sound completely different and less exciting were they just as good i just re read that series about a week ago i have to admit daring was my favorite but i still enjoyed finding the dream and keeping the dream its also really nice to be able to see more of the characters you've already read about and see margo and josh's relationship develop even more i definately recommend reading the other two All My Children One Life to Live Neil Gaiman Avenue Q The Good Life All About Eve Carl Jung Scenes from a Memory Sports Illustrated Trilogy Serial killer Nora Roberts The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age) Killian documents Dog training Days of our Lives Lucid dreaming Maryland General Assembly Election, 2006 Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Shaggy dog story Isaac Asimov's Robot Series Donna Moss Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Law & Order The Subtle Knife Daryl Hall John Berryman History of As the World Turns (1980-1989) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Ray Walston On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Ocean's Twelve Dream Job (Season 1) FoxTrot The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Josh Lyman Lost in a Good Book Spy Kids Maison Ikkoku The Ashlee Simpson Show Babylon 5 Philip K.
