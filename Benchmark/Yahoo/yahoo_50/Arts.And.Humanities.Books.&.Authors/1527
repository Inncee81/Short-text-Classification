what book s did you read as a freshman in high school as a class assignment i'm looking for something unique and interesting for my students to read this year i tried my antonia by willa cather last year and also have a novel set of great expectations but today's students don't seem to really get interested in them the only ones i can remember are romeo and juliet the lord of the flies a biography on william t sherman and the two towers the first two were class reads that is to say the teacher picked out the book and we had to read them whether we wanted to or not the second two i picked for book reports and i only finished the biography as i just couldn't get into tolkien at that time i've managed to read the lord of the rings since then personally i don't think it's just today's student that don't get intrested in books for school i loved to read at home and when it was my choice but for school i was much more likely to be willing to read as long as it was something of my own choosing and when i only had to keep a reading journal rather than do a book report it then became much more acceptable i despised being forced to read books for class or book reports and i wasn't the only one if the teacher said it was a good book or a book you absolutely must read before you die it was anything but to most of the class only one teacher could get most of us to actually want to read what was assigned for class and that was our tenth grade english teacher but he tended to earn our respect and make the lesson no matter what it was with the notable exceptions of the history of english a documentary on the english language and the first book in the foundation sereis highly intresting we read animal farm the odessey edith hamilton's mythology a book on annie sullivan and helen keller i don't remember it actually being the miracle worker for his class and most of us actually wanted to do so something we wouldn't have wanted to do for any of our other english teachers most of my junior and senior high school english teachers were too often here is a book that is an absolute for you to read the problem was most of them actually failed to make it something most of the class would want to read the only reason we'd even bother reading it was so we didn't flat out fail since tenth grade i've always felt that if a teacher could get their students to want to read the books they assigned then most of those books would be viewed in a different way by the students Education in the United States Graduate school J.
