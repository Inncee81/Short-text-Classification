i loove to write i love to write but i'm pretty young to be a writer how do i get there i could post some examples of my stories the one problem is i'm sort of shy about the whole thing my parents don't even know that i've worked on several stories for a couple years i don't know how exactly i got hooked into this but since i was about i feel in love with writing if i am shy about people reading my stuff how can i become a real writer some day if that is my path defnitely don't be stressed about it most writers take years and years to publish their work and at the age of thirteen you probably aren't at the top of your game yet having said that though gordan korman published his first book at so if you really want to go for it then don't be discouraged by your age there are three things i would suggest for you keep writing write for the love of it write different things and in different styles read as much as you can consider writing online this will help the shyness factor because it's so anonymous you could try some freelancing fanfiction or even maintain a blog you can check mine if you want it's http carynswark blogspot com go ahead and try submitting some short stories there are a lot of magazines that specifically publish work by young people i would target one of these instead of trying for a more adult oriented publisher of course there's no reason in the world you have to state your age in a cover letter i was about the same age as you when i started writing i'm now and i've published some freelance work etc but nothing major i've only just started dedicating a lot of time to my writing though and seriously trying to publish it i don't regret waiting so long it took me this long to be accomplished enough to feel comfortable distributing my work so i don't think you should feel any pressure to hurry good luck Ex-gay Theory of conduct Anne Rice Transactional analysis Time Out of Mind Social rule Don Rosa Publishing I Want to Hold Your Hand Theodore Kaczynski Internet troll Andrew Sullivan J.
