was war of the worlds a news paper series first i know it's official publication was in just wonder if if spent time as a series first as i believe novels use to do i have my reasons for wanting to know any constructive contribution will be appreciated mr tumnus what is a novella a novella is somewhere between a novel and short story a novel is generally pages and a novella is anything below that until it gets into short stories where i would put a safe limit of pages war of the worlds was originally a book but it may have been published in a magazine in serials they didn't usually use newspapers instead they used papers like the saturday evening post or collier's which would have been the two most popular at the time i don't know if you can look among the archived versions of these magazines online but you might want to check Doctor Who spin-offs Short story Comics Frank Herbert Novella The Times Novel Yu-Gi-Oh!
