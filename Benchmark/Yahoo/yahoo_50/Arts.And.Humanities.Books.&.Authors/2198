didn't severus snape deserve a little more importance from harry i mean in the last book harry was there doing heroic staffs just because of the sacrifice severus made but after the death of severus harry didn't bother to pay homage to him even after knowing everything from the pensive he seemed worried about the possibility that he had to dye not about the fact that sev had already died don't you think it was extremely unfair i think he should of named his kid severus albus potter not albus severus potter cause didn't dumbledore like not care or something snape cared more about harry and was willing to sacrafice himself for him dumbledore gets the middle name if anything snape should have the st name Severus Snape Albus Dumbledore Hogwarts subjects Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Lord Voldemort Remus Lupin Dates in Harry Potter Magic (Harry Potter) James and Lily Potter Battle of Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Death Eater Draco Malfoy Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Minerva McGonagall Professor Quirrell Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Potions in Harry Potter Hogwarts Half-Blood Prince (character) Occlumency Hogwarts Floor Directory Unbreakable Vow Minor Hogwarts teachers Aberforth Dumbledore Ginny Weasley Rubeus Hagrid Sybill Trelawney Minor Hufflepuffs Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Sirius Black Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Wizard Minor Ravenclaws Poppy Pomfrey Ron Weasley Rita Skeeter Nymphadora Tonks Alan Rickman Filius Flitwick Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Peter Pettigrew Legilimency Horcrux Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Hermione Granger Neville Longbottom Blood purity (Harry Potter) Tom Riddle Ministry of Magic Dursley family Narcissa Malfoy Diagon Alley Wizarding world J.
