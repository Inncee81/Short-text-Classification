what are some good books ok i love the harry potter series and i'm looking for a good book or series have any suggestions anything you think i might like is great thanks if you like fantasy you may want to check out the earthsea trilogy by ursula leguin her style is quite different from rowling's there's much more narration but she builds the same equisitely detailed world and mythology she also wrote a novel called 'gifts' and i beleive her most recent is 'voices' check out her site http www ursulakleguin com i have no idea how old you are but if you're at least high school age you may want to check out john irving he read from 'a prayer for owen meaney' when i went to 'harry carrie and garp' a charity event where j k rowling stephen king and john irving each read in new york last year i love love love harry potter but i enjoyed irving's reading even more owen is a unique character there is some foul language violence and sexual content and serious regan bashing so if that stuff isn't your thing you've been warned Harry Potter Ursula K.
