tell me a summary about the right stuff the book tell me everything character events that are happening anything author wolfe wrote that the book was inspired by the desire to find out why the astronauts accepted the danger of space flight he recounts the enormous risks that test pilots were already taking and the mental and physical characteristics required for and reinforced by their jobs the right stuff wolfe likens the astronauts to single combat champions from an earlier era who received the honor and adoration of their people before going forth to fight on their behalf the story is more about the space race than space exploration in general the soviet union's early space efforts are mentioned only as background focusing entirely on an early portion of the u s space program only project mercury the first operational manned space flight program is covered emphasis is given to the personal stories of the astronauts and their wives rather than the technical aspects of space travel and the flights themselves the storyline also involves the political reasons for putting people into space asserting that the mercury astronauts were actually a burden to the program and were only sent up for promotional reasons reasons for including living beings in spacecraft are barely touched upon but the first option considered was to use a chimpanzee and indeed chimpanzees were sent up first another option considered were athletes already accustomed to physical stress such as circus trapeze artists wolfe states that president eisenhower however insisted on pilots even though the first crewmen would not actually fly the spacecraft when gus grissom lands at sea and exits his space capsule saving the capsule seems more important to the recovery team than saving the pilot because of the value of the data another political issue mentioned in the film not in the book concerned the appropriateness of grissom's names for publicity purposes neither his nickname gus nor his real first name virgil were considered good names for an astronaut but his second name was ivan and that was even less appropriate as it was a common russian name both sides of the space race us and ussr used experienced german engineers and rocket scientists in a particularly humorous moment in the film version senator lyndon johnson attends a meeting where the politicians are reacting to the news of sputnik's launch senator johnson asks is it their the soviets german scientists that got them up there first at that moment the german scientist a composite character heavily patterned on wernher von braun responds no senator our germans are better than their germans this may have been based upon the fact that as a result of operation paperclip most of the german managers and engineers went to the united states while the soviet union gained many manufacturing workers another test pilot highlighted in the movie is the late scott crossfield crossfield and yeager were fierce but friendly rivals for speed and altitude records wolfe contrasts the seven with yeager who was shut out of the astronaut program after nasa officials decided to use college degreed pilots not ones who gained their commissions as enlisted men such as participants in the usaaf flying sergeants program in world war ii chuck yeager spent time with tom wolfe explaining accident reports that wolfe kept getting all wrong publishing insiders say these sessions between wolfe and yeager led wolfe to highlight yeager's character presence thoughts and anecdotes throughout the book as an example yeager prides his speech to the society of test pilots that the first rider in the mercury development program would be a monkey not a real test pilot and wolfe plays this drama out on the angst felt by the mercury astronauts over those remarks yeager himself downplayed the theory of the right stuff attributing his survival of potential catastrophes to simply knowing his airplane thoroughly along with some good luck Saturn V Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Project Gemini Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Apollo 8 Apollo 1 Project Apollo Moon landing European Space Agency Sergey Korolyov Unidentified flying object Soviet space program Space exploration John F.
