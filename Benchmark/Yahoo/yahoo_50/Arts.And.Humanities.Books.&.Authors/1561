felix felicis the wizarding form of marijuana im a harry potter fan but this topic is a bit troubling to me if anyone here hasnt read hbp they willl have no idea what i am talking about but if you have i'd like your opinion in my first reading the substance seemed wonderful and could be a really good weapon for harry to use on his quest agains voldemort then i thought about everything we knew about the potion and if you remeber when we were introduced to it all of the characters clearly wanted to get their hands on some professor slughorn the potions teacher set up a contest in which the student who could most successfully brew the assigned potion nwould be awarded one flask of it as it turned out harry ultimately received the potion real surprise not through his own intellect but him being given a deifferent potions book enabling him to brew the best potion anyway the point i'm getting at is that when harry ultimatly took the potion the feeling he experienced was like a high leading him exactly to the point he knew he should go to the potion led him to retreive the memory from slughorn which was the vital piece of the series in a sense the next morning the trio discussed last nights events and came to the realization that this was a positive substance and they had thoughts of possibly brewing more of it examining these fact i have come to beleive that felix felicis is not only addictive and highly detrimental to the user but also in a way worse that marijuana this drug leads the user to beleive it is positive when all it does is blatantly lead him her away from reality he should go to the potion led him to retreive the memory from slughorn which was the vital piece of the series in a sense the next morning the trio discussed last nights events and came to the realization that this was a positive substance and they had thoughts of possibly brewing more of it examining these fact i have come to beleive that felix felicis is not only addictive and highly detrimental to the user but also in a way worse that marijuana this drug leads the user to beleive it is positive when all it does is blatantly lead him her away from reality after all what is luck but probability and chance luck isnt an idescribable force that one can gain spirtiually luck isnt hope luck isnt love luck in this case can be a highly dangerous substance as it seems to me this potion doesent bring out ones luck but creates it scary thought you are missing the point i am not comparing the effects of the substances i am talking about the ability to abuse it and what chaos would outbreak if it was what's up with madis u are confusing ur books not to mention missing the point i should have realized this would be over all of your heads after all what is this but a place where losers who have no lives or intelegence spend their days marijuana doesnt make you lucky felix felicis actually does make you lucky marijuana doesnt lead you in the right direction the wrong direction most likely Ginny Weasley Ron Weasley Felix Felicis Luck Potions in Harry Potter Half-Blood Prince (character) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hermione Granger Severus Snape Magical objects in Harry Potter Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter One Tree Hill (TV series) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Hogwarts Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Phoebe Halliwell Minor Ravenclaws Negima James and Lily Potter Neopets RuneScape quests Horcrux Harry Potter (character) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Hobgoblin (comics) Drug addiction Characters in the Smurfs Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Ordinary Wizarding Level Minor Slytherins Drug abuse Kryptonite Rudolf Hermann Lotze Dates in Harry Potter Magic (Harry Potter) Daredevil RuneScape skills Synchronicity Boston Public Diagon Alley Luna Lovegood Friedrich Schleiermacher Blood purity (Harry Potter) Summa Theologiae Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Minor Harry Potter Beasts Diablo II Baseball Stars Time travel Rita Skeeter Infantilism Shadow the Hedgehog Prohibition (drugs) A Course In Miracles Arguments for and against drug prohibition Fighting Fantasy Game Books Hogwarts Houses Epistemology The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Victor Cousin Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Cocaine Neville Longbottom Remus Lupin 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cliff Richard Methamphetamine Green Goblin Motivation Minor Hufflepuffs Sesshomaru Draco Malfoy Out-of-body experience Sigmund Freud Characters of Naruto Final Fantasy XI Theodicy The Apprentice 2 ELO rating system Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Paige Matthews Knots Landing LSD The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
