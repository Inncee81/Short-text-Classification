have they used a gun while stealing nor have they ever robbed a white man he and his friend gus watch a plane skywriting an advertisement bigger reveals that given a chance he could fly a plane the

second movie takes place in tribal africa with naked black men and women dancing to the wild beat of drums bigger stops paying attention lost in a daydream imagining that once he is working for the daltons and surrounded by people of wealth he can learn the secret to getting hold of money bigger realizes that he does not want to rob blum's now that he is likely to get a job that could lead to money and success when the friends meet in the pool hall he attacks gus without provocation threatening him with a knife and humiliating him in front of the others the owner doc warns him to stop so bigger slashes the felt cover of the pool table when the scuffle is over bigger announces that it is now too late to rob blum's as he has to go see about a job still carrying the gun he has retrieved from home to use in the robbery he travels to the white neighborhood where all his bravado and the images inspired by the movie dissipate as he agonizes over whether he should knock on the back door or the front a white housekeeper admits him and bigger finds himself in an alien environment with welcoming chairs indirect lighting and fine artwork on smooth white walls though angry and uncomfortable when the white haired mr dalton greets him he responds with excessive deference he meets mrs dalton a blind woman who uses long words bigger does not understand to explain to her husband why according to the relief agency's report bigger should move in and begin work at once mr dalton asks about bigger's past and his home life we learn that mr dalton's company owns the slums in which bigger and his family live then explains bigger's duties as a chauffeur mary dalton interrupts them he hates the girl for her easy familiarity thinking her talk of capitalists and trade unions will cost him his job mr dalton however takes mary's inquisition in stride and explains to bigger that he will hire him even though bigger has a reputation as a troublemaker because mr dalton supports the national association for the advancement of colored people the housekeeper peggy feeds him supper and explains that an additional duty of bigger's will be to attend the furnace on his way to get the car to drive mary to the university bigger meets mrs dalton in the kitchen she expresses disappointment that bigger shows no interest in furthering his education he is startled by her apparent ability to see exactly where he is and what he is doing by the sounds he makes mary has no intention of going to the university on this last night before she is to take an extended trip to detroit she asks bigger to pick up her friend jan erlone as does mary erlone addresses bigger as an equal asking to be called by his first name and shaking bigger's hand rather than putting him at ease this makes bigger feel his blackness as a badge of shame he forms a dumb cold inarticulate hate toward the white couple for their presumptions erlone and mary get into the front seat of the car rather than the back with the former driving and mary pressed up against bigger when they ask him to eat with them at ernie's kitchen shack a place where colored people eat he considers stalking off leaving the job behind but he does not at ernie's he encounters not only his friend jack but his own quasi girlfriend bessie mears the three drink beer and share a bottle of rum while driving around the park as erlone and mary talk about communism erlone hands bigger some pamphlets before weaving drunkenly off to catch a train when bigger and mary reach her home she stumbles at the front steps realizing that she is unable to get to her room without waking the entire house bigger tries to guide her but is reduced to carrying her up the stairs and laying her on her bed there he kisses her lightly and considers doing more just as he feels her body begin to respond he hears a creak at the door mrs dalton enters the room calling mary's name softly mary is mumbling incoherently and afraid she will give his presence away bigger presses a pillow to her face to silence her for a moment mrs dalton smells liquor in the room and steps away remonstrating her daughter for being dead drunk and leaving the room bigger realizes how narrowly he has escaped being caught in a white woman's bedroom if mary's father had been the one to enter or if mrs dalton were not blind bigger would surely have been caught his relief is short lived however when he discovers that in his attempt to keep mary quiet he accidentally suffocated her she is dead the direness of his situation creeps over bigger first he decides that he must disavow having been the last person to see her alive and resolves to cast suspicion on erlone recalling that he was to have carried mary's traveling trunk to the station the next day he sees a chance to both explain a reason for any fingerprints he may have left and a way to implicate erlone he realizes that by using the trunk to remove the body from the bedroom he can make it appear that mary has run off to detroit as planned he forces the body to fit in the small space and carries the trunk to the basement where he is inspired to burn her body in the furnace and remove any proof that she is dead and not simply vanished under the accusing glare of the daltons' ever present white cat bigger shoves mary's body into the furnace only to find that it does not fit entirely inside using his knife and a nearby hatchet he cuts off her head shoves everything into the furnace and sends a fresh load of coal into the fire finding mary's purse on the ground near the car he removes a wad of bills from inside and hurries home to the slums to sleep in the tiny crowded room
