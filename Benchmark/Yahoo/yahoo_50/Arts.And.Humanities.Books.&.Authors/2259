my question's in the form of a peeves ish e limerick this thing 'tween ginny and potter started slow but soon got hotter in the deathly hallows they're never e'en close yet end up with sons a daughter thanks everyone but what i mean is there is very little by way of background on this issue and as for hp thinking of her a lot he thinks of voldemort a lot more ginny's character too is woefully under described she's just the hero's consort hermione's even bellatrix's character is dealt with in more detail a shade too chauvinistic and this from the author who painfully lays the foundation in the first book for something that's going to happen in the last every small detail is explained no loose ends left for such a scrupulous writer to blatantly ignore her hero's true love is what bothers me they didn't really have a chance to be close throughout deathly hallows they hardly saw each other they shared a passionate kiss at the start and harry often thinks about her and wants to protect her during the battle at the school but he has more important things on his mind for most of the book following the death of voldemort i think we can assume they get back together pretty quickly as harry no longer needs to stay away from her to protect her from being targetted by voldemort Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter (character) Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ron Weasley Lord Voldemort Death Eater Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter: Book Seven Dates in Harry Potter Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Hermione Granger Lucius Malfoy Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Sirius Black Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Neville Longbottom Magical objects in Harry Potter Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Weasley family Hogwarts Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Ministry of Magic R.A.B.
