does anyone have tattoos on their feet foot i am thinking about getting one on the outside of my foot do many tattoo artists do this or allowed is it a state by state thing i am in idaho thanks tattooing on the foot is pretty common however there are a few things to think about usually the shop min on hands feet neck is higher simply for the fact that it's not an easy spot on the body to tattoo and most people don't sit as well you better be able to wear flip flops so some kind of shoe that's going to allow your tattoo to breath and heal for anywhere from weeks to a month or so feet take longer to heal i've heard a few different reasons on this but i know from experiance that it's true no matter the logic behind it some artists really don't like working on feet just like there are some people out there that are totally creeped out by them so are some artists so don't get your heart set on an artist until you find out how foot friendly they are best of luck to you Tattoo The Death Gate Cycle Paul Is Dead Aerial (dance move) Customs and etiquette of Japan Body piercing Theory of conduct Theodicy Milton H.
