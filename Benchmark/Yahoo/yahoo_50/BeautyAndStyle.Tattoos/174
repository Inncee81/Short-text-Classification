piercing cartilage these are the things i have peroxide alchohol cottonballs a thick needle earing stud potato paper towls sharpie my question is how do i mark and now where to put the earing and like if you have a link to a how to plz give it to me and going to a shop is not an option plz and thnx best answer gets points i think you should not use a needle just use an earing because it hurts less but it is recomended to use a needle sterilize your ear and equipment using an autoclave is the only way to have absolutely sterile materials you must know how to set up a sterile field to work in and be able to prevent cross contamination between sterile and non sterile items make sure to not use ice on your ear as it will only harden the surface and make the piercing process hurt more than neccessary take the needle and pop it through the first layer of skin tilt the needle at the angle you want the stud to be at and pop it the rest of the way through use a cotton ball or something else that will be able to stop the needle from going in your head but won't be a nuisance leave the needle in for a moment it should barely break the back surface of your ear farther is fine but not necessary place the jewelry into the hollow back of the needle and follow it through the hole enjoy it takes months to completely heal wash with anti bacterial soap and use sea salt soaks twice a day never use any kind of piercing gun or anything other than a piercing needle the reason for that is that any blunt force on your cartilage can easily break up the cartilage in your ear which will cause it to change or possibly lose its' shape Earring Tattoo Ear piercing instrument Knife Sterilization (microbiology) Agar plate Intravenous therapy Acupuncture Terminal ballistics Bacteria Menstrual cup Drill bit Welding Bone Opportunity rover Brewery Archery Barbell (piercing) Swimming Eye Cartilage Dairy Wound Sundial Equine conformation Pottery Manicure Sternum Ice core Scapula Wire Violin Shroud of Turin Upholstery Mattress Knitting Lip piercing Tire VHF omnidirectional range 1957 World Series Social rule Prince Albert piercing Naval mine Nuclear weapon design Blood (computer game) Occipital bone Naruto jutsu Thermal power station Autoclave Ear Final Fantasy magic Suture Glacier Acne Dialysis Sphenoid bone Iron Glass Mouse (computing) Tooth enamel Ammolite Ozone depletion Tofu Nine Inch Nails Table tennis Skateboarding trick Ultraviolet Sex toy Electrophysiology Water (molecule) Skin Hepatitis C Sea ice Hygiene Black hole Handloading Soap Play piercing Ozone hole Methamphetamine Laws of cricket Timpani Fast bowling Strap-on dildo Potato Comfrey Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary
