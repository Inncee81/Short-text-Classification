would you be annoyed if your friend got the exact same tattoo as you i've had my tattoo on my foot for years its one i designed myself although its quite simple it's really personal to me as it represents my grandparents who died within months of each other last month my friend had the exact same tattoo on her wrist am i right to be annoyed i know i can't do anything about it but its still annoyed me she knew what the design stood for we've known each other since we were five and she was a bit support after i'd lost my grandparents h ll yeah u have the right to be annoyed i d be down right p ssed off girl all of my tatt s are symbolic and that is something very personal i never get a tatt off the shelf because of this reason i m confused as to how the tatt shop kept your design that s just not cool i d be b tching at them big time they have no rights to your design of course your tatt is really personal to you people that design their own tatt is because it represents something very important in their life the majority of mine are for my dogs they are my kids they are all symbolic to each one if i saw my tatt on someone i d be headed for the tatt shop fortunately i don t have to worry about that because of the artist that did mine is no longer doing tatt s my next one is in memory of my father and i will walk out of there with my design i definitely think it was disrespectful of your friend to get the same tatt as yours she should of at least had the common courtesy to ask you first since she liked it so much she also should have respected your design and had changes made so it was not identical i m very sorry this has happened to you you paid tribute to your grandparents with your designed tatt is there anything that you can have added to it to make it your original i know it s not fair that you would have to make these changes but at this point it is the best way to keep it original be sure to get your design from the tatt shop this time i d do some checking around with other tatt shops to see what their policy is on keeping tatt s that are not designed by them i look at it as you have all copyrights to your design and the tatt shop owes you best of luck hon p s if i remember i'll ask my bf about the copyright laws his best friend's cousin did mine he also knows other artists that design tatt's and sell them to the shops Social rule The Fairly OddParents Tattoo Copyright law of the United Kingdom The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Infantilism Copyright Pitaten Hey Arnold!
