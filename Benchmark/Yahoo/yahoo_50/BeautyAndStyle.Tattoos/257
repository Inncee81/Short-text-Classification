does anyone know the meaning of ryan phillipe's new tribal tattoo i saw it in intouch weekly back in july it's very cool looking i haven't seen it and i doubt it means anything most people who get them just want something that looks cool or tough or whatever i seriously doubt he has any tribal ancestry in general i am rarely impressed with celebrity tattoos for some reason they insist on getting crappy work done you'd think that since they have the money they'd make the effort to be impressive oh well Tattoo Vanilla Ninja Irezumi Angelina Jolie Karankawa Comanche H.P.
