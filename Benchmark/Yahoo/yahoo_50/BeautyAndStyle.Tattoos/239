what is a short friendship bestfriend quote that would look cute as a tattoo or if you have any other suggestions of a tattoo i could get that would be for a friend i know alot of people get intials but i was looking for something a little different than that i could do if you have any ideas it would reallllllyy help thanks the best idea for a tattoo that a person is getting for anyone would be something that reminds you of that person instead of initials good job on not wanting that for example my name is star my birthname cool huh so my fiance instead of getting my name star tattooed on him he got one star on each shoulder that one's easy i know but he got it that way just in case we should ever break up which i highly doubt it's something that the normal person would just look at as two stars on his shoulders whereas thinking oh that poor boy got that girls name on him and they're not even together go with what reminds you of that person a quote with a hidden meaning is awesome does she like fairies get a fairy for example hopefully this is all helpful good luck with the search and congrats on the tattoo when you do get it Charmed Vanilla Ninja Tattoo Ranma __ characters Dragon Booster Sento Luck Irezumi Good Times EastEnders Good Charlotte Ed, Edd n Eddy One Piece minor characters Social rule The Fairly OddParents Philip J.
