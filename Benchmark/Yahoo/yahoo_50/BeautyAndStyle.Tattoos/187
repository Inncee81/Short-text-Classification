how much would a tiny tattoo of numbers ' ' cost my sister and her friends are looking to get the numbers ' ' tattooed somewhere very discreetly long story and were wondering how much it would cost roughly for characters no bigger than about cms tall also any cool ideas for where this tattoo could be located they want it to be fairly discreet but not hidden thanks everyone d the cost depends on the shop artist how long it takes colors everything there is no stock answer since every shop can be different and location that should be based on their bodies avoid hips and tummy wrists and arms are iffy personally i think that would be cool across the back of the neck and it could still be hidden a word to the wise don't try to go too small it will get blurry and depending on how they age could look really bad if they have to go bigger for the sake of it looking better don't completely say no to having to up the size call shops or go in and ask about how much that would cost which size would work and any other questions if they aren't old enough to get tattoos to start with they should wait until it's legal decide if they still want that and then look further into it tattoos are too personal to say what would be best for them since it's going to be on them not me hope it turns out well Tattoo Social rule Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) One Piece minor characters Hip hop rivalries Sento Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an CPU cache Tag Professional wrestling holds Irezumi Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Glen Jacobs Mark Calaway Jackass: The Movie God Emperor of Dune Kimi Finster Goodness and value theory Jennifer Lopez Vanilla Ninja Extreme Programming The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Tattoo You The Adventures of Pete & Pete MapleStory Buttocks Namie Amuro Comanche Dragon Booster The Shining (film) The Rock (entertainer) Ethics Gaia Online Characters of Naruto Kelly Osbourne $ale of the Century Memento (film) Professional wrestling throws Smallville (Season 4) CPU design Escape from New York Milton H.
