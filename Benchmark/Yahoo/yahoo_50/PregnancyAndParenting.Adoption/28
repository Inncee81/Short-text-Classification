why r woman against abortion n for givin them up for adoption a woman becomes too emotionally attached to the baby during her nine months of pregnancy as well as has had her maternal instincts kick in during the pregnancy as she has protected and cared for the baby inside her womb to ensure that it is born healthy and alive these feelings become stronger once the baby is born they don't go away and women instinctively know this is how it will be and that it would be extremely hard if not impossible to give the baby away and act as though those feelings aren't there in other words they will still long for the baby they have come to care about and long to take care of it in short women know their maternal instincts and love will kick in more and more during their pregnancy and they will not be able to give away a baby that is theirs i think this is also why women choose abortion over adoption because they know they have not yet become too emotionally attached and during their period of emotional distress find it easier to have a baby aborted than go through the pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption that's the primaty reason but there other issues to deal with as well i'm not sure about financial bec i think they can have the tab picked up by the adoption clinic or home or by the people adopting the baby if there are any and that may be only if they're lucky then there are social and physical issues such as going to work as morning sickness kicks in and probably the shame and sadness they feel in giving the baby up and having their peers at work know i don't think many people stop to think how the pregnant mom to be must feel about all this emphasis is placed primarily on the unborn childand in the case of abortion shaming an already shamed woman in adoption the people involved in the actual adoption process would care about the woman as well but what about all of her peers how are they going to react toward her during and after there's a huge gap missing in solutions between abortion and adoption and those are solutions which would enable the woman to keep the child raise it healthily and most of all be able to financially afford it i've though of two the first idea would be to have homes which would allow pregnant women housing during and after the pregnancy if they need it with strick rules enforced for conditions under which they could stay conditions that would involve ensuring she obtains skills to obtain and maintain means of employment in order to take care of the child through education or other means which would be offered throught the home other conditions would be that they attend x oamount of hours per day week etc of parenting classes and counseling which would help them mature emotionally and mentally to prevent another unwanted pregnancy other conditions which would include of course no drugs no alcohol inside or outside the clinic and no staying out overnight or of course having company over as well as being open to random checks and observations inside and outside the home to document her behavior and progress if i had a lot of money i would start a home like this and i bet adoption and abortion numbers would decrease if these homes became more prevalent and hopefully the cycle of premature and unwanted pregnancies through generations of now educated and emotionally mature and more stable moms raise these children and their children are taught and have a better example to follow the nd idea came about as i watch abortion protestors stand nearby clinics with a piece of poster board on a stick and basically wasting their time which could be put to better use who couldn't spend a few hours a week holding a stick and a sign up why don't they get an extra job or work extra hours for those same hours and donate toward financially helping raise the baby if a protestor holding a sign actually persuaded a woman from going through with the abortion do those same people offer any kind of emotional and financial help for the endurance of the baby's childhood through adulthood if needed or is the woman just on her own again i wonder how many women could be talked out of abortion on the doorstep if they were approached with a commitment and promise to be there financially to help raise the child a lot more than those just met by protestors i haven't gotten as far as how to ensure the commitment and promise are followed through on but this is all just wishful thinking so far Transsexuality Infantilism Childbirth Hillary Rodham Clinton Sex education Roe v.
