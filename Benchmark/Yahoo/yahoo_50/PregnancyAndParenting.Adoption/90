what to expect from a home visit we are starting the process for an international adoption part of this is a home visit with a social worker i am wondering what i can expect from this is it somewhat informal where they check out our home to make sure it is clean and safe or it is more in depth should we do some home improvement projects i e paint the bedroom clean up the landscaping etc if it helps we are going through all of god's children any information on the process would be helpful the information varies a little bit country to country and agency to agency but with over years in adoption work and having approved over families to adopt i can tell you what we looked for many of these requirements are set in stone in our state as they are with every state and then the agency approving you will also have their own requirements some may have christian only or no smoking reqirments for example but the basic requirements are as follows job and job history stable employment history salary decent stable salary reflected on your tax returns pay stubs and employment letters taxes good history of completing verifiable tax returns marriages usually look at number less than three is preferable and length of current marriage usually years divorces will need copies of the decrees and names of exes as well as explanation of reason for divorce children children will be interviewed even if live with you part time or if they are grown references must have personal and professional therapist rabbi teacher references who have known you both for years ideally medical letters from doc stating no communicable or catastrophic ilnesses diseases and state that you are mentally emotionally and physically stable mental stability abuse history from childhood on up history and how you have resolved or coped with it arrests if you have one why and when with details and resolution verified by criminal and child abuse background checks in all states where you have lived

just a house can be an apartment or house but needs to be organized warm and child friendly and safe cars do not have to be new but need to be safe and dependable with approved car seats friends neighbors appropriate not partiers and moochers family need to be enthusiastic about the adoption for the sake of the child counseling history of marriage counseling and resolution as well as mental health counseling and therapist's names and reports alcohol and drugs no drug use and alcohol in strict moderation and if have history of addictions must have proof of resolution lifestyle generally fit and appropriate for children such as not a clubber or partier no risky habits hobbies what you do with your spare time religion spirituality do not have to attend church unless the specific agency reqires it and some birthmothers want only a certian religion or practice or the absence of it motivation to adopt why and history of desire to adopt history with children caring for nieces nephews or friend's children or volunteer work documnted childhood everything from your birth on up such as family activites discipline parental roles discipline etc family of origin how close are you now and

general attitudes reflect how you may see child or birth parents attitudes about continuing contact with birthmother open semi open or closed most agencies will not work with families who want a closed adoption as this is not in the best interest of the child expectations of child are the expectations realistic or not such as must be bright and look like us argh health insurance must have
