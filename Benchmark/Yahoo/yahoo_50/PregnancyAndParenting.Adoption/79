foster care adoption and private adoption at the same time is this possible my husband and i are foster parents and we are planning on adopting through our foster care agency however we really want to adopt an infant as well we know our chances are slim of getting a baby through foster care that we would eventually be able to adopt so here is what i don't know are we able to work with more than one adoption agency one for foster care to adoption and a seperate agency that would be for the infant adoption we live in pennsylvania so if anyone is familiar with adoption regulations here that would help also do you think that being foster parents would hurt our chances of being selected by a birth family to adopt thier newborn it is not a state law it is an agency policy you have to contact the foster agency and ask and also the adoption agency and ask as far as hurting your chances for adoption it depends mostly on the attitude of the adoption agency and luck if the adoption agency and or social worker views this as either positive or neutral related to adopting then you are o k then it is up to birthmothers who do slightly prefer couples with no children but not all and whether they will understand the difference between adopting and fostering is debatable my experience is that most people do not understand the difference so check this out with your agency as well in your photo book put in maybe two photos of the baby you foster and mention it in your letter but don't dwell on it good luck Breastfeeding Infantilism Abortion debate Domestic violence Divorce Foster care Incest Legal research Childbirth Economy of the United States Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Child abuse Health insurance International adoption Conscription Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Infant baptism Premature birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Transactional analysis Hillary Rodham Clinton Trade union Midwifery Fathers' rights Marriage Fathers' rights movement in the UK Transsexuality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Laura Schlessinger Eugenics Social rule John Edwards Family Children of God Theory of conduct Hypoglycemia Magical thinking Polyamory The Giver Moral Politics Father Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China Crazy Horse Prenatal diagnosis Good Times Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Leadership Second language acquisition Food and Drug Administration Social democracy Constitution of Ireland Social Security (United States) Meme Religion and sexuality History of intersex surgery Ethics British nationality law Postpartum depression Newborn screening Charter school Cytomegalovirus Abortion in the United States Birth control Feral child Dinah Marler Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Childlove movement Publicly funded medicine Hearing impairment Japanese name Generation Y Pittsburgh Steelers European Union Friends Sant Thakar Singh Parenting Dissociative identity disorder Knots Landing Extreme Programming Public policy Surveillance Hate speech Single parent Free market Liberalism Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Flat tax Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Child Culture of the United States Politics of the United States History of British nationality law Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Child sexuality
