for those of you who are great people and are adopting children first of all i want to say you are a great person i myself am looking into adoption in the near future there are so many kids out there who do not have the privilege of having a loving family to raise them the way they are supposed to be you all will be able to make a hugs difference in the children s lives adoption is a great thing and is one of the most important decisions that one will make thanks again for your willingness to open up your hearts and home to kids who would otherwise have nothing it is so nice to see some positive statements on this board however i as most adoptive parents do not feel like a rescuer my child rescued me if i did not have my son i could have never experienced the joy of being a mother it is just an alternate way for us to have a family and while i do hope that some day my child appreciates us i would hope that any child adoptive or biological would appreciate his parents some day but i do thank you for bring the positive thoughts to this board Adoption One Tree Hill (TV series) Infantilism Transactional analysis Abortion debate Drowning Family About a Boy Happiness Love Laura Schlessinger Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Critic Karen Horney Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Polyamory Sigmund Freud John the Baptist Dead Like Me Ten Commandments The nature of God in Western theology Autism Princess Leia Care Bears Intelligent design movement Childfree Trinity The Giver Past teachings of Prem Rawat Justification (theology) Theory of conduct Friedrich Nietzsche Mystique (comics) Intelligence quotient Same-sex marriage Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Predestination Children of God Franz Boas Opus Dei Pledge of Allegiance Codename: Kids Next Door Church of Christ, Scientist Care-a-lot's Birthday Autism rights movement Eid ul-Fitr 2004 Republican National Convention Cindy Sheehan Drama Son Goku (Dragon Ball) The Pilgrim's Progress Characters of Smallville Fathers' rights Teach the Controversy Christian eschatology British nationality law Biff Tannen Jean-Luc Picard Haven (TNG episode) Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Our Gang Jean Grey Korean adoptee Days of our Lives Diver rescue Saint John Bosco Jon Secada Ex-gay Child custody Abortion in the United States The Jazz Singer Grief Fathers' rights movement in the UK Derek Parfit 2005 trial of Michael Jackson James Bulger Sexual revolution Child sexuality Fruits Basket Motivation Third Culture Kid Eastern Orthodox Church Gender role Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Religious Society of Friends Charter school Everybody Loves Raymond College Roomies from Hell!!!
