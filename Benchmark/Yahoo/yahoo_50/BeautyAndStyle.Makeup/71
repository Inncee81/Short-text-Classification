straight eyelashes curl with eyelash curler but when i put mascara on they go straight back to how they were my eyelashes are impossible hey curl when i use an eyelash curler for a long time of each eye but as soon as i put mascara on they go back to as straight as they were before they were curled i've read other questions like this and people suggest things like voluminous by loreale but i tried it and it did exactly the same help xx once you curl your lashes with the eyelash curler i find that if you take your pinky finger right after applying the mascara and lay it lightly under your lashes and gently push up just high enough to create a curl without touching your eyelash to you lid and holding it there for about seconds it allows the mascara to dry in that position leaving you with long beautifully curled lashes don't re curl the lashes with the curler after applying mascara this will cause the curler to stick to your lashes causing them to rip out which will cause them to thin out and you don't want that to happen let me know how it works d Curling Mascara Gesture Physical characteristics of the Buddha Knitting Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Cosmetics Haircut Randy Ferbey Professional wrestling match types Milton H.
