black vs brown mascara and eye liner i have always used black eye liner and black mascara and just recently heard that if you have light skin you should use brown is this true i'm white and have blonde hair should i be using brown mascaras and eye liners i sort of like the dramatic look the black mascara gives but the eye liner can be a bit heavy i don't wear lots of make up usually just eyeliner mascara and some shadow any advice suggestions thank you i would wear the brown i am very tan so the black sort of compliments me but as for you since your more white i would use brown my friend is like that and i made her trry it and thats all she uses its not too dark so it looks better then the heavy black good luck Cosmetics Dragon Booster Race of Jesus White (people) Hair color Black Melanin Human skin color Cheetah Horse Cat coat genetics The Ashlee Simpson Show The Rasmus Color theory Red hair Professional wrestling match types Tattoo Social rule Ganguro Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Black (people) Mascara Wu-Tang Clan affiliates Eye contact Physical attractiveness W.I.T.C.H.
