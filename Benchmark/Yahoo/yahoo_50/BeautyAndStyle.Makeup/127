what's the best way to sharpen a very soft eyeliner pencil i just bought some very soft eyeliner and it just crumbles whenever i try to sharpen it make sure your sharpener is just the right size for your eyeliner and that the blade is sharp it may be time for a new sharpener if the blade is dull or rough it would just tear up a soft liner another idea is just rubbing the eyeliner in between a tissue to sharpen the point this of course won't help when the actual eyeliner is flush with the rest of the pencil but may increase the life span if you try and keep the eyeliner point sharp Knife Drill bit Sharpening stone Cosmetics Woodworking Leaf Pencil sharpener Chainsaw Sword making Bowie knife Pencil Drawing Chisel Katana Grind King C.
