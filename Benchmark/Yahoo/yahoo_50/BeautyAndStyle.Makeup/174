wedding makeup i have just had a pre wedding make up trial and though it looked ok i didn't feel overly confident with it as i never wear the stuff my eyes were lined with black though i am blonde and fair people have said that it has to be pretty heavy for the photos do i go with the trial or do i demand to have a natural look this is your wedding and you have got to feel comfortable in your makeup if you have reservations about it then speak up the last thing you want is to look at your wedding photos ten years from now and regret the makeup it is possible to have a natural look while still wearing the correct makeup for photos a lot of that has to do with blending and choosing the correct products your makeup does not have to be caked on or seem heavy to be photo ready talk with your makeup artist about your concerns it is possible that a darker brown smudged closely to your lash line may be a simple fix your eyes will be defined but you won't have the harshness of black or a defined line you want a graduation of color and definition you can also take a few photos of the makeup after it is done to put your mind at ease as to how it will look definitely talk with your artist though and if after that you don't feel comfortable then look around for someone else good luck Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Blood on the Tracks The Emancipation of Mimi Pitaten EastEnders Dragon Booster Drawing Social rule Rum Marilyn Monroe The Contender (television series) Lauren Bacall Rich Mullins Jennifer Lopez Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sunglasses The Ashlee Simpson Show Ty Cobb Sampling (music) Characters in the Smurfs God Emperor of Dune Reservoir Dogs Black (people) The nature of God in Western theology Shit Hair color Blonde on Blonde TLC 1957 World Series Upholstery Stanton Macdonald-Wright Photography Cosmetics Martin Luther King, Jr. Milton H.
