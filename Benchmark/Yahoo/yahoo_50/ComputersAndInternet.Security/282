how do i report a person who is sending me mail about a persons will i recently recieved an email from a person who is says that he is a bank accountant and says that a person died and has left me some money because i share some sort of distance relationship as him he said that we share the same last name what struck me the most suspicious was that he never told me the persons name and whats more suspicous is that his mail was a yahoo account but my reply was to a gmail account im planning on seeing if he will give me the name plus the persons race because my display name is different from my real name and my real name is of a different origin even though i am of a completely different race and when he starts to dip out i have to report it some questions i was wondering is when you die does your money go to the next of kin if i do report it how do i know that i got a response i forgot one critcal question how do i report this to gmail and i think this is from the uk not nigeria mainly because of a supicious email that i found on the details which i used to find a girl from the uk on myspace please do not get suckered into this it is most definitely a scam if this was true then they would contant you through the mail usually certified to answer your questions usually if you die without a will to indicate your wishes the court steps in and distributes your property according to the laws of your state you might want to check out the laws that are in place in your state usually it will go to the spouse and if they are deceased to the children and so on if no heirs are found then the properties money homes land and so forth will be taken by the state you probably won't get a response there are millions of scams out there that are being reported responding to each individual scam would be too time consuming the best answer i can give you is to just take it as it is you did your part and hopefully they will do theirs sorry lol i just realized you needed a website woopsies here's one that you can look into but you can google it too look under consumer fraud reporting Advance fee fraud Gmail Internet fraud Google Stopping e-mail abuse Confidence trick Phishing Hotmail RuneScape cheats Plame affair Concurrent estate Bank fraud Webmail Opera (web browser) Neopets Spam (electronic) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act United States Postal Service Mail-order bride Domain Name System SCO-Linux controversies E-mail spam One Tree Hill (TV series) Make money fast 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax Email authentication Avenue Q Taxation in the United States Trust (Law) USA Mail fraud Internet troll Fraud Expert system Schabir Shaik Trial Divorce Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Administration Charles Ponzi Social Security (United States) Notary public Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Domestic violence Child support Polygamy Grief Credit card fraud Direct marketing Google Talk National Kidney Foundation Singapore Neighbours Civil unions in the United Kingdom MSN Messenger Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
