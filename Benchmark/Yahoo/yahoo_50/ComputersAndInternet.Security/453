what's debug more frequently recently i'll be going to a website and this box pops up that says 'a runtime error has occured do you wish to debug ' usually i put no and it keeps going on but when i press yes it comes to this screen with a bunch of computer stuff i've never heard or seen in my life and i don't know what to do help why microsoft decided to ask general users to debug web pages i'll never know but rest assured that you do not want to press yes to debug a web page or any other debug situation if you don't know what debugging is then you definitely don't need to debug it there's not point in opening the debugger anyway even if you could fix the issue there's no way to get that fix back into the web site anyway so always click 'no' to debug Debugging Software bug Blue screen of death Java programming language Opera (web browser) Integrated development environment WebObjects Debugger Windows 2000 Embedded system Macromedia Flash Exception handling Spyware AmigaOS Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Mozilla Firefox X Window System MDAC Forth programming language Core dump Virtual memory Magic number (programming) Brainfuck Apple Computer Mouse (computing) Video Graphics Array Domain Name System Compiler optimization DragonFly BSD PaX Windows XP Unicode Datatype Fortran Cross site scripting Pop-up ad Objective-C Website Web design PHP OpenBSD Visual C Plus Plus Mach kernel Visual Basic .NET JavaScript Internet Explorer Ajax (programming) Buffer overflow GameFAQs Prank flash Phishing Optimized Systems Software 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Hash table Development stage Runtime Screenshot Xcode Public-key cryptography Google Computer software GNU Debugger Purify GNU Compiler Collection Mozilla Application Suite HyperCard PHP-Nuke Thread (computer science) Computer and video game genres Mac OS X v10.4 Hello world program Pretty Good Privacy Smalltalk Programming tool Object-oriented programming Windows API Software testing Web application HTTP cookie Trusted computing Cache Windows Vista Garbage collection (computer science) HTML editor Emacs Hiberno-English OpenTV Search engine optimization Crash (computing) Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Assertion (computing) History of operating systems Computer virus ASP.NET Sun Microsystems Web 2.0 Neopets Proxy server
