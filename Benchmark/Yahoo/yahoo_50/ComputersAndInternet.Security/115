how do i set that security tag thing i had seen an ad on yahoo a couple months ago about a tag that you could put on the page that you log into this tag gave you the option to use either a picture or a saying with it i guess it was supposed to be a secure thing so that you could log into another computer without having to worryabout people logging into your account okay so i do not fully know what it is for but i want one does anyone even know what i am talking about they had the ad for it beside the login box a while back now i can not seem to find a link to do it any idea it is for you to put a personal pic or password that only you will recognize and then when you login to your yahoo account you will know it is safe if the pic you put there isn't shown then you are on a phissing site and not legit yahoo it doesn't stop another from logining into your account but if you use strong security then they cant any way hope this helps clear up your question Password 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Database management system Theory of conduct User (computing) GameFAQs Patricia Ford Neopets Internet fraud HTTP cookie RuneScape cheats Cross site scripting Steam (content delivery) The Inside Open Directory Project Two-factor authentication Danger Hiptop Surveillance Dictionary attack Wheel of Fortune Windows XP OpenBSD CPU cache Phishing Rootkit Passphrase Google Talk Coming of Age (TNG episode) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MSN Messenger Online shop Shibboleth GameFAQs message boards E-mail spam Gmail RSTS/E Jumpstart 3rd Grade Non-native pronunciations of English Jeff Gannon E-mail Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Common Unix Printing System Ecco the Dolphin Classified information Spyware Cryptographic hash function Secret sharing PIC microcontroller System/34 System/36 Double the Fist Telnet Halting problem Stopping e-mail abuse Debugging Bad Wolf Password (game) Files-11 Search engine optimization HTML element Control-Alt-Delete Professional wrestling slang The nature of God in Western theology Plame affair Karen Horney 11001001 (TNG episode) Hacker (computer game) Social rule Intrusion-detection system The Battle (TNG episode) Database Rlogin Philosophy of space and time Kasparov versus The World PHP One-time pad The Doctor Dances Google File Transfer Protocol Data retention Slashdot H2G2 Sport The Star Wars Holiday Special Google search Survivor (novel) Alcoholics Anonymous Computer security MapleStory Windows 2000 Utopia (online game) Prolog Amiga Power Identity document Everything2 Authentication Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baroque chess World War Three (Doctor Who)
