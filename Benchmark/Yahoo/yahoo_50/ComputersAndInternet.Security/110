my email has been hacked what do i do ive had this account for years msnlive is at the root im gets you hac i have been hacked through msnlive and now it's attached to my email and i would like to know how to report and have them removed i have also begun to get spam every day even though i have all my spamcontrol activated there is alot of reasons why this could have happened really the best thing for you to do is a virus scan or just reformat if you want to make totally sure to get rid of any type of trojans or keyloggers that are placed on your system i recommend avast it's a free anti virus scanner and very good don't install more then one anti virus on your computer at a time you should also keep your windows updated with the latest security patches i think your system is total compromised and should just be formatted but many will argue with me about this because they believe a simple spyware or virus scan will deal with it i doubt it since many trojans can be made and never enter in the av's database thus they are never detected you should try to log in your e mail account and change your password this will probably be some where in the e mail options you should only do this if your sure your system isn't compromised with trojans or some kind of keylogger or else it want matter if you change your password Computer virus Trojan horse (computing) Rootkit Windows XP Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail spam RuneScape cheats E-mail Steam (content delivery) Phishing Anti-virus software Gmail Password Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Password cracking Computer security Computer forensics GameFAQs Hacker (computer security) Surveillance Timeline of hacker history AOL Instant Messenger Sender Policy Framework Computer insecurity Virtual Network Computing Proxy server Cross site scripting 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines OpenBSD Microsoft Windows Outlook Express Trusted computing Spybot - Search & Destroy Internet fraud Anonymous remailer Danger Hiptop Comparison of web browsers Denial-of-service attack Cheating in Counter-Strike Windows 2000 Neopets Mydoom Control Panel (Windows) MapleStory Pretty Good Privacy Intrusion-detection system Email authentication Electronic voting Blue screen of death File system Domain Name System Viral marketing Mozilla Application Suite Common criticisms of Microsoft Buffer overflow Screensaver Ebook Virus Patch (computing) Port scanner Computer surveillance Opera (web browser) Cybercrime PunkBuster IPod Botnet Common Unix Printing System Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Internet security Advance fee fraud Partition (computing) Emacs ILOVEYOU Data retention Adware Captcha Enterprise content management Digital rights management Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Database management system Next-Generation Secure Computing Base Microsoft Btrieve Theory of conduct Plame affair Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Apple Open Collaboration Environment System/36 MDAC
