do you agree with me here's the situation been talking to someone over the net for awhile and have never met he told me that he searched my ip address and now has my address to my home keep in mind he is a cop and said he pulled this information from his database is that not an invasion of my privacy he is a great friend and i don't want this to become a huge arguement but it really bothers me that someone would go that far what do you think honest answers please internet for home use to have ip dynamics it means it changes from time time and even better you can do change it manually if you want so this guy is a liar first he had to ask to your isp which ip you re using unless you visit a site created by him where your ip is been registered second to know an ip no necessary identify your home address but company which provides the service the reasons to know where you live maybe have been provided by yourself be careful what you tell or describe to strangers ciao Domain Name System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Email authentication Internet service provider E-mail spam Public-key cryptography Spam (electronic) Data retention IP Multimedia Subsystem Internet privacy Lie Gmail Stopping e-mail abuse Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol IP address Anonymity Spam Prevention Early Warning System RuneScape cheats America Online PHP Plame affair HIPAA Friends Infantilism Web traffic Spyware Scientology beliefs and practices Usenet Network address translation Whois Windows XP Thread (computer science) GSM services Pretty Good Privacy Uniform Resource Locator Deep web Caller ID Avenue Q Web analytics Orkut FidoNet Theory of conduct British national identity card E-mail Mafia (game) DNSBL Dynamic Systems Development Method Advance fee fraud Legal research Sin City Social rule CPU design Grandview, U.S.A.
