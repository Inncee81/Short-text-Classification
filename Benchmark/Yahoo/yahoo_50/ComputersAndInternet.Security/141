ipsec and ssl question for ipsec and ssl the nodes running the protocol are assumed to be secure which additional security mechanisms do you need at these nodes to make this assumption true you have two major concerns to worry about the remote system is not owned by an unauthorized user and you implicitly trust the remote system user to not do anything stupid there are many things that are incorporated into concern to include them being malware free properly patched firewalled correctly and that they fail secure there are others but just these four will cause the most headaches as they also have subcategories to them malware free means no viruses trojans rootkits spyware keyloggers etc patching includes every single piece of software and hardware drivers being exploit free with heavy concentration on remote exploit free you can do this by including network access control nac into your solutions to ensure that anti virus definitions are up to date and that the trusted av software is running on the system firewalls are running on the hosts etc your biggest problem here is that nac is relatively new and vendors are just starting to catch up to nac enable their products the second concern deals with the authorized users at the other end this could be users within your corporation may be partners public access or a combination of these you have the most control of corporate users as you can provide them with the proper software training hardware etc to get them up and running and ensure that they don't have means to circumvent your configurations partners and non corporate users are hard to ensure that they are doing things properly and in cases where you connect your infrastructures together such as a corporate merger or partnership you have to not only trust the people but also their network in these cases you don't have control of what bad stuff that happens on their network yet you have to have some assurance they their bad stuff doesn't propagate to your network this is where a cio should be advising the ceo as to the risks involved with the connection and should be doing whatever he she can to limit the exposure they may choose to do a nac solution or require that systems be provided to the partner that are authenticated by the local system prior to being allowed to access it an example of a problem you might experience with an encrypted tunnel would be allowing the user to connect to both the internet and the tunnel at the same time while the user is browsing the internet and connected to your network an intelligent hacker could get into the users system and propagate the tunnel to get to protected network resources the prevention of this type of attack is to setup a closed vpn which allows the user to only be connected to the vpn or be disconnected from it so if they were to browse the internet while connected to the vpn they'd have to use the internet connection from the corporation through all of the proxies firewalls etc as they would from the home office this at least puts more restrictions and control over that remote user while they're outside the office wg Bluetooth MDAC Internet Secure Shell Proxy server IPsec USB flash drive Data retention Fritz-chip Windows Server 2003 Linux Steam (content delivery) E-mail spam Microsoft Skype Windows Vista Microsoft Windows Buffer overflow Ethernet Voice over IP IP Multimedia Subsystem Internet Relay Chat Kazaa Network address translation Freenet 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Copy protection Public-key cryptography History of Microsoft Windows Redundant array of independent disks IBM PC compatible Cryptography Common criticisms of Microsoft File Transfer Protocol Computer surveillance PlayStation 2 Cheating in Counter-Strike E-mail Wget Trojan horse (computing) Computer Modem Enterprise content management Floppy disk Denial-of-service attack Internet privacy IPv6 Grid computing Public key infrastructure Appliance Transmission Control Protocol Information Technology Infrastructure Library Global Positioning System Domain Name System FreeBSD Stopping e-mail abuse Personal firewall Intrusion-detection system Cisco Systems Free software Novell NetWare Surveillance Hard disk Common Unix Printing System Wardriving Extensible Authentication Protocol Internet censorship in mainland China Anti-virus software Phreaking Sender Policy Framework Modchip Phishing Architecture of Windows 2000 File system
