aim chatroom security i was recently in an aim chatroom just for the heck of it figured i'd see what was up well there was a guy in the chatroom whom apparently had some program downloaded to his computer and was able to control who was kicked out of the room and banned and who was immune to the codes so the first few letters of your sn would be involved to ban you and it'd look like sh ban and you'd get kicked out of the room for a few seconds and would have to wait to go back in well i have a short temper and imed the guy who was doing it and kicking me and i said something a tad bit mean and blocked him i'm worried though that maybe he had access to my ip with programs like that because it was through aol instant messenger can someone help please i was also wondering if anyone could tell me what the name of the program he was using is called too thank you sooo much i'm pretty worried about this yeah i remember back in the day me and a friend would kick and flood everyone out of the msn gaming zone i believe it's shut down now yes age of empires the best game ever anyways this dude who is doing it probably isn't skilled enough to do any real attacks if he got your ip address matter of fact i doubt he did since most of those chating programs are server side in the first place there would need to be some kind of connection straight from his computer to yours and not through like a proxy server i bet he is just using some other dudes program and doing it taking the credit for it i doubt he was able to reverse engineer or find the exploit himself i don't really do this junk anymore but these programs are actually called hacks cracks flooders booters etc a quick google search with using the hack program zip msn would probably find you some be careful though these things are usually loaded with trojans even if you have anti virus it may not have that trojan in it's database AOL Instant Messenger America Online MSN Messenger Cheating in Counter-Strike E-mail spam Microsoft Computer virus Spyware Instant messaging Spam (electronic) Steam (content delivery) GameFAQs Domain Name System Phishing Windows XP Timeline of hacker history Internet Relay Chat RuneScape cheats Computer security Gmail Hacker (computer security) Trojan horse (computing) Malware 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Google Password Chat room GunZ The Duel Hacker Firewall (networking) CPU cache Mach kernel Password cracking MAME File sharing Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs The Star Wars Holiday Special Port numbers Danger Hiptop Stopping e-mail abuse Web traffic Microsoft Windows Proxy server Denial-of-service attack Anonymous remailer Kim Possible Goatse.cx Computer insecurity E-mail Internet censorship in mainland China Web crawler Rootkit Internet fraud Quake III Arena Kyle Broflovski BZFlag Jumpstart 3rd Grade Skype Mac OS X RISC MMORPG Opera (web browser) ICQ Ragnarok Online Embedded system Volleyball Jabber Internet The Fairly OddParents StarCraft Secret Missions OpenDocument X Window System Internet Explorer Utopia (online game) Totally Spies!
