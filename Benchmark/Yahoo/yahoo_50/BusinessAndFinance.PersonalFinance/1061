my sister owes me some money and pays when ever she wants to she owes me several thousand dollars and has paid me like times each time was only like when i did a written agreement with her and we both signed it she said great i'd like to pay you back anyway so now i have to because of this so since then we have seen nothing i ask her each time i talk to her when she can pay me something anything at all and she keeps telling me the next time she sees me etc etc when i do see her it's down to where she doesn't have any cash on her i don't want her writing me checks because i have cashed checks from her before and they have bounced anyways i feel grouchy for always bringing it up to her but she hasn't made much of an effort to try to pay seriously then i find out she is planning trips with friends out of state and one to mexico she knows my husband and i are tight on money too and it would be nice to have her at least try to pay how did you convince a family member to pay you back many people would like to know the answer to this as well at least though you have something in writing from her depending on whether you care if you still have a relationship with your sister or not you might tell her flat out that unless she starts paying you monthly what she owes you you and her can work out how much per month you might see a lawyer and pursue legal action to force her to pay if you did go that route she'd end up having to pay your attorney's fees oh and if you do get your money don't lend to her again Plame affair Credit card Mensal__o scandal Poker jargon The Amazing Race Karl Rove Child support Wal-Mart Warren Buffett Tom DeLay Cheque Taxation in the United States U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Marilyn Monroe Marshall Plan Internet fraud Theory of conduct Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Enron Corporation Divorce National Kidney Foundation Singapore EastEnders Phoebe Halliwell Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Make money fast Paula Jones Schabir Shaik Trial Citigroup Trust (Law) USA Contract Flat tax Public Eye Knots Landing Sydney Bristow Hyperinflation Hillary Rodham Clinton Money creation W.
