would you do this for the financial benefits this is a serious question my hubby has been offered a high paying job which is hours drive away from where we and our families live and in an isolated community in the desert there are quite a lot of people living there and i would be able to make friends with the other stay home mums there the thing is i am getting cold feet about it i am not going to have time off from my daughter hubby and i wont be able to go to the movies anymore there is no cinema and the main local event is watching footy games and i can't stand football if we stay in our home his pay will be a year less and we will have to support our entire a month mortgage repayments whereas is we move we earn more money and have a renter in our house and we get subsidised rent for a week financially i know it's the right thing to do but i am scared of being so far from the city even though the contract is only years would you go there are no easy answers to your opportunity however can i suggest that you both think about what you will do after the year contract expires will you be in a financial position to do what you really want will there be other opportunities open to you which just won't appear if you don't move i know its corny but there is a saying you don't know what you don't know and the only way to find out is by doing something different the key is to have a longer term plan something you are both striving for which will get you through the tough times that way you can both stay the distance then move on to something better after the two years one final thought it may be a bit painful making as much money as you can as quickly as you can but it will make the rest of your life a lot easier in summary think long term be prepared for some short term pain to get the longer term gain but always ensure that you both share a common goal and are prepared to support each other through the tough times in achieving it FairTax Social rule Insurance EastEnders Student loan Contract Life insurance Leasing Chess strategy and tactics Leeds United F.C.
