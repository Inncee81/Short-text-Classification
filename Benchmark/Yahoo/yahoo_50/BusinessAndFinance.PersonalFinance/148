do i have the right investment approach over thirty years ago i became disabled in a bad car accident the insurance settlement came to a little over one million dollars which i have always invested in bonds which at that time still yielded almost i always have held them till maturity now a days i still buy bonds or rather bills i guess my question is is buying short term with low yields and buying long term when yields are high a sound investment approach i need the income from those bonds to live on please no quick bucks artists or sharks well you've taken a very conservative approach which to some extent is ok if this is your only source of income but today you aren't even keeping up with inflation with bonds or treasury bills you should talk to a financial analyst maybe call smith barney and sit down with a guy and show him you're entire financial picture you would probably be better off today putting some money in mutual funds which are very safe and at least take a chance on making some good interest Bond Citigroup Mutual fund Security (finance) Treasury security Yield curve Debt Gross domestic product Insurance Life insurance Deflation (economics) Arbitrage Government debt Bank Mortgage Supply-side economics Economy of Russia Hedge fund Financial markets Ponzi scheme Social Security debate (United States) Personal finance Institutional fund management Financial services Stock Keynesian economics Money supply Finance Primerica Financial Services Stock market Variable universal life insurance PE ratio Euro Microeconomics FairTax Eugene Fama Fixed income Gold as an investment U.S. public debt United Artists Capitalism Financial analyst Capital accumulation Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Bretton Woods system Annuity Municipal bond Interest Long-Term Capital Management Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economy of India 401(k) Taxation in the United States Health insurance Temasek Holdings Inflation United States dollar Income trust Michael Milken Short selling Arthur Laffer Repurchase agreement Corporate finance Gambling Federal Reserve Economy of the United States Sponsorship scandal Futures contract Economic history of the United States Deficit spending Free trade Money Warren Buffett Hyperinflation Risk Technical analysis Rational pricing Surplus value Poker jargon Married... with Children Toronto-Dominion Bank Money creation Investment History of the United States (1980-1988) Bank fraud Lehman Brothers RuneScape economy Bond duration Asian financial crisis Mergers and acquisitions Publicly funded medicine Zero coupon bond Canadian and American health care systems compared Paintball
