when financing a home remodel which do you recommend refinancing or a line of credit caveat i am only considering refinancing my second which is about of my total home loan the interest only varies by less then half a percent from the refi versus the line of credit i would have to know a little more about what you are looking to do with your future finances inclusive of this property and how exactly you have your home financed now in order to give you a precise assessment of what the appropriate move would be but generally speaking an equity line is nice and it's convenient but in the same respect it can become a burden just like a high balance credit card if you have a plan already in place to be able to pay that heloc home equity line of credit off in a short schedule of payments than go for the heloc if you do not then your best choice is to do a straight refinance you will get the money at a lower cost no matter how insignificant a difference in rate and you will kill two birds with one stone you see most everybody that gets a heloc ends up refinancing again with in the following year or two in an attempt to consolidate their debt in almost every case you end up saving a lot of money in a debt consolidation like that but you lose money by having to refinance a second time to close the heloc i always say do it right do it once Debt Primerica Financial Services Mortgage Refinancing Credit card Economy of Russia Debt consolidation Deflation (economics) Personal finance Bond Corporate finance Mortgage-backed security Financial services Government debt Monetary policy Security (finance) Microeconomics Interest Annuity Finance Bank Student loan Bretton Woods system Insurance Money Collateralized debt obligation Capital accumulation Predatory lending Social Security (United States) Economy of Pakistan United Kingdom corporation tax Tax Inflation Divorce FairTax Cost of capital Central bank Savings and loan association Futures contract Taxation in the United States Microcredit Capitalism Mutual fund Estoppel CPU cache Money supply High-yield debt Stock Education in the United States Islamic banking Warner Music Group Euro Investment bank Debt levels and flows Mergers and acquisitions Poker jargon Social Security debate (United States) Deficit 401(k) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Privatization Financial audit Real estate bubble Federal National Mortgage Association Arbitrage Economy of the United States Government National Mortgage Association Temasek Holdings Gold standard Hyperinflation History of the United States (1918-1945) Leveraged buyout Keynesian economics Modigliani-Miller theorem Affirmative action Municipal bond Appeal Donald Trump Yield curve Economy of Ghana Schabir Shaik Trial Social Credit Education in the People's Republic of China Economy of Chile Deficit spending Federal Reserve Progressive tax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 U.S. public debt Political subdivisions of New York State
