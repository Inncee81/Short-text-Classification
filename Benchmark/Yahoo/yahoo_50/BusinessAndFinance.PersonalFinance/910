does he like me or am i getting my hopes up i know this is in the wrong category but i wanted to get advice from a different demographic there's this guy i like and he gives off signals that he likes me back or is at least interested the thing is he's out of my league i'm cute not being cocky but this guy is fine so even while i love being around him and i love the attention deep down i wonder what if anything does he see in me i wonder if he's playing some big joke and isn't really into me at all he flirts a lot with me and i noticed that while he's friendly to everyone he doesn't flirt with every girl he makes me laugh all the time and compliments me teases me sometimes but not in a mean way and hits me so what do you think he definitly likes you however you need to get that negative thought out of your head just because u think hes waaay out of your league so what you never know he may think the same about you he finds you attractive and thats all that matters remmeber not evryone goes by hot looks there has to be something behind that hot face for someone to really like you and enjoy your company and it seems he really does like you like you if your not confident enough jsut leave it to him to make the st move but still flirt a little bit when u are around him good luck Social rule Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Professional wrestling slang Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kim Possible EastEnders Ed, Edd n Eddy Characters in the Smurfs Pitaten Kylie Minogue Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urusei Yatsura Ray Winstone Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Shaggy dog story Human sexual behavior Phoebe Halliwell It's Walky!
