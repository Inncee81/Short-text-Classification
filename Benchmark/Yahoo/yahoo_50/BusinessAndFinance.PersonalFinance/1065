utility bills does anyone have this problem of paying more than what was initially agreed to pay on utility bills and when u call an agent to solve why u r being charged more you end getting confused by their explanation for instance initially i was told that my charter monthly payment would be but now i am paying more than a month for my energy service i feel like i am being ripped off every month on their statement i get all these lists of payment bill details which confuses me and ends up with no argument when talking to an agent as for the cell service it always feels like the minutes run out so quikly that i am forced to buy more minutes to fulfill my needs all these utility companies are rip offs do u agree by the way i use charter communication txu energy and t mobile charter cable sounds like you had a special offer that expired and are now paying full price the bill should detail exactly what service you have sounds like you have digital cable and internet service you can downgrade to cheaper service slower internet and fewer channels you can save on your cell phone by getting a plan with more minutes and or learning more self discipline and not hang on the phone so much by the way i don't consider either of these utilities my definition of utilities are the gas electric water sewer and trash collection Virgin Mobile Telephone Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Microeconomics GSM services Short message service AT&T Enron Corporation Telephone numbering plan Bluetooth Credit card Voice over IP Toyota Prius Mortgage Telephone tapping Timeline of the Enron scandal Autonomous building ITV Plame affair United Kingdom corporation tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Computer Radio Solar power Mensal__o scandal BBC Surveillance Fuel cell Game programmer North American Numbering Plan Grid energy storage Nuclear power phase-out Federal Communications Commission Verizon Wireless Temasek Holdings America Online Filling station Monetary policy Laserdisc Hydrogen economy Opera (web browser) Manitoba Hydro Solar cell Capitalism Universal Serial Bus United Airlines Flight 93 Battery electric vehicle Electronic commerce Customer relationship management TiVo Stock Battery (electricity) Publicly funded medicine Internet 9-1-1 VeriSign Octopus card Eircom Privatization UK telephone numbering plan USA PATRIOT Act Technology Gmail Global System for Mobile Communications Skype Bond Cruising (maritime) Money Floppy disk General Packet Radio Service Annuity Electrophysiology Telephone exchange Karaoke Japanese mobile phone culture EasyGroup Monopoly (game) George W.
