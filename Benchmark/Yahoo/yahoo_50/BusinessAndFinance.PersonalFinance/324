can i buy stuff online with a atm debit card i'm years old i also like online shopping it is possible to purchase things on the net with such a card but you are therefor making it illegal for you to have one so i would suggest asking the owner of the card you would like to use before you do so it is much safer to use a regular credit card on line these cards are not directly linked to the money in ones bank account which is usually necessary to live off of this way if someone somehow gets the card number you can file a claim with the credit card company instead of having your life savings drained Credit card Debit card Bank Automatic teller machine EFTPOS Credit card fraud Electronic money Bank fraud Personal finance Internet fraud Surveillance Popular, Inc Money Financial services Loyalty program Online shop Octopus card Identity theft Smart card VISA (credit card) Interac Insurance Discover Card Sears Holdings Corporation Electronic commerce Stored-value card Wal-Mart Ulster Bank Monetary policy SmartRider Enron Corporation Neopets Money supply Scrip Bank of America ITunes Music Store Best Buy Citizens Financial Group Expressnet Online gambling Chip and PIN Windows XP Cheque SCO-Linux controversies Oyster card MetroCard Finance America Online Capital accumulation Credit union Legal tender United States Postal Service Gross domestic product Donald Trump Life insurance Steam (content delivery) Irish Life and Permanent Magnet Cruising (maritime) American Express BancNet Economy of Chile Nintendo Filling station Tesco Capitalism Identity document London Underground Beltway sniper attacks Animal Crossing Toronto-Dominion Bank EasyGroup Mergers and acquisitions MTR Commodore 64 Slot machine Bond Contract bridge Nationwide Building Society Equitable PCI Bank Blackjack Aldi Internet Minimum wage Student loan Second Life Argos (retailer) Two-factor authentication Retailer Gambling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Doomtown Wachovia Frequent flyer program Skype Derivative (finance) Orson Scott Card
