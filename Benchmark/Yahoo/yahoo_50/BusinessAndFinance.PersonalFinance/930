what is the best way to pay your credit cards to maximize your credit score is it better to pay off your credit card statement in full each month or should you leave a small balance each month like i've heard conflicting things for example paying each bill in full is better for your credit score versus leaving a dollar balance i've heard leaving a small balance is supposed to show that you know how to pay off a debt and help your credit score even more i don't know what to believe your thoughts as long as you make any minimum payment it reflects positively for your credit score because credit ratings take into account how many accounts in good standing you have this means your payment history is good no late payments no missed payments or payments less than the minimum payment required high balances reflect negatively on your credit score the more available credit you have credit limit outstanding the better the score even if you pay your balance in full every month your credit score will show a balance because there is a lag in between paying your card and reporting to the credit bureaus so if you pay in full it reduces your interest payments and also lowers your outstanding revolving balance both of these are good for you the only reason why some people mention that you should keep a small balance is because the credit lenders like that because they make interest off of you that way they can send you more offers for more useless credit in the hopes of generating more interest fees from you Credit card Student loan Credit score Mortgage Deflation (economics) Bank Debt Collateralized debt obligation Credit history Insurance Social Security (United States) Gold standard Government debt Money Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Short selling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Monetary policy Inflation United Kingdom corporation tax Debt consolidation Health insurance Interest Annuity Supply and demand Keynesian economics Mutual fund Government National Mortgage Association Finance Economy of Russia Legal tender Refinancing Estoppel Minimum wage Internet fraud Financial audit History of the United States (1918-1945) Schabir Shaik Trial Poker jargon Surveillance Baccarat Micropayment Copyleft Economy of Pakistan Citigroup Mortgage-backed security Unemployment Primerica Financial Services Law of value Craps Corporate finance Graduate school Food Stamp Program Municipal bond Balance of payments Arthur Laffer Octopus card Life insurance Betting (poker) Futures contract Economy of the United States Accounting methods 401(k) Personal finance Blackjack Predatory lending Fiat money Dividend Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Debit card Capitalism Arbitrage Grade (education) MMORPG Temasek Holdings Derivative (finance) Tax Salary cap Pension Plame affair Social Security debate (United States) Certificate of deposit Capital accumulation London Congestion Charge Euro Tertiary education fees in Australia Education in the United States Financial services Marshall Plan Value added tax Contract bridge Unemployment benefit Annual percentage rate Weimar Republic Athenian democracy
