what recourse do cosigners have when they have to pay the whole amount of the loan a couple of years ago my girlfriend's son decided he just had to buy a motorcycle he went out in search of a loan but because of his poor credit score and well known habits of not paying his bills no one would give him any money without a cosigner i begged her not to sign for him but she for some reason did it anyways well he's ended up with a free motorcycle now and she says there's nothing she can do the bike is just about paid off now and her son's using our bikes for spare parts when we're not around i think we need to sell this bike to at least get some of the money that was paid in can this be done legally he's only made one or two payments we live in indiana if state laws come into play presumably your girlfriend is a joint owner of the vehicle so she has some rights but if he also owns it she can't just sell it without his consent legally you'd probably need to sue him for full possession of the bike i can't imagine your girlfriend will consider taking her own kid to court so unless he willingly consents there's probably nothing you can do except to never let it happen again Mortgage Student loan Donald Trump American individualist anarchism Credit card Bond Money Concurrent estate Estoppel Insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Leasing Babylonian law Islamic banking Eminent domain Capitalism Property (ownership right) Annuity Divorce Life insurance BMW First-sale doctrine Appeal Consensual crime Corporation Capital accumulation United Kingdom corporation tax Contract Motorcycle GNU General Public License Child support Copyright Dividend Short selling Patent Deflation (economics) The Amazing Race Allodial title Copyleft Civil unions in the United Kingdom Bretton Woods system Tax Trademark Stock Intellectual property Government National Mortgage Association Assignment (law) Trust (Law) USA Taxation in the United States Same-sex marriage in the United States Legal aid SCO-Linux controversies Minimum wage Derivative (finance) Federal Reserve Gold standard Arguments for and against drug prohibition Anarchism and capitalism Legal tender Government of Maryland Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Jay Leno Bike lane debate Security (finance) Schwinn Bicycle Company Vehicular cycling Debt Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Slavery Prostitution in Germany Usury Auto insurance Driver's license Prostitution Amway Copyright law of the United Kingdom Marriage Leeds United F.C.
