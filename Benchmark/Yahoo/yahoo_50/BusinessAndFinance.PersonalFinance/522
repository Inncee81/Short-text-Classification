mortgage lending problem i don't fully understand the mortgage lending problem going on can someone explain it to me or send me a link explaining it bank and other lending was very loose especially since mortgages were being underwritten and packaged by wall street and big banks and sold as securities to investors these securities were very attractive because the yields for other fixed income investments were low investor money was chasing higher risk for marginally higher premiums in order to keep originating new mortgages to feed these securitizations mortgage lenders kept creating looser and looser structures hybrids negative amortization teaser adjustable rates interest only and lending to less creditworthy borrowers for the borrowers money was easy to come by as home values continued increasing everywhere justifying sometimes outrageous loans so home prices cooled people were left having to hold their homes and pay their mortgages but many couldn't afford them as asjustable rates were adjusting higher or people just overstepped their limits as defaults started rising from the mortgages originated in people started to realize that there was going to be a fallout investors in those mortgage backed securities were nervous and realizing that alot of those securities might be worth less than originally thought prices of the securities declined in the markets some funds went out of business then mortgage originators who were lending subprime were facing margin calls as fewer banks were lending to them to underwrite these loans which were no longer popular to the investors some of these companies went bankrupt now they are feeling it in the stock markets too so some debt laden borrowers are losing their homes some financial institutions have gone out of business and some investors are losing money and housing doesn't seem to be picking up again Federal National Mortgage Association Mutual fund Security (finance) Insurance Financial markets Mortgage-backed security Finance Bretton Woods system Deflation (economics) Investment bank Annuity Short selling Government National Mortgage Association Monetary policy Derivative (finance) Yield curve Life insurance Securitization Asian financial crisis Government debt Microeconomics Islamic banking Financial services Savings and loan association Capital accumulation Interest rate Stock Credit card Donald Trump Privatization Stock market FairTax Toronto-Dominion Bank Student loan Income trust Real estate bubble Microcredit Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation History of the United States (1918-1945) Gold standard Money Great Depression Hedge fund Margin (finance) Islamic economics Usury Supply-side economics Free trade Cost of capital Money supply Arbitrage Temasek Holdings Developing countries' debt Mergers and acquisitions Lehman Brothers Enron Corporation Berkshire Hathaway Federal Reserve Hyperinflation Central bank Fixed income Wall Street Crash of 1929 Lloyd's of London Economy of Pakistan Economic relations of Japan Michael Milken Primerica Financial Services Social Security debate (United States) Corporation Money market Gold as an investment Futures contract Wells Fargo Warren Buffett Capitalism Economy of Argentina Municipal bond Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Surplus value PE ratio Annual percentage rate Day trading Bank fraud History of post-Soviet Russia Hong Kong Monetary Authority Taxation in the United States
