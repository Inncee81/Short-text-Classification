has anyone heard of using your credit card to take out the money to invest on real estate has anyone tried this method for getting your money to invest in property someone from real estate investing institute suggested this to me but i had never heard of doing it this way would the interest rate be lower than if you go to a bank he said you could just do a transfer balance until you get your profit seems oversimplified and risky to me what do you think i would have to look at the details of the plan but initially this sounds like one of the dumbest things i have ever heard credit cards won't give you a high enough limit to buy real estate credit card interest isn't tax deductible credit card payments and interest rates are much higher than mortgages if you plan on borrowing from your credit card for a down payment on a mortgage don't most mortgage lenders don't like that basically this seems wrong at first glance unless the details somehow overcome all the negatives which i doubt don't do it Mortgage Insurance Debt Bond Bank Credit card Student loan Deflation (economics) Life insurance Federal National Mortgage Association Taxation in the United States Gross domestic product Donald Trump Annuity Mutual fund Government National Mortgage Association Bank fraud Keynesian economics Islamic banking Inflation Personal finance Microcredit Money Flat tax Predatory lending 401(k) FairTax United Kingdom corporation tax Citigroup Government debt Real estate Economy of Russia Microeconomics Mortgage-backed security Surplus value Dividend Primerica Financial Services Economy of India Argentine Currency Board Financial services Monopoly (game) Monetary policy Supply-side economics Short selling Income trust Economy of the United States Securitization Gold standard Economy of Pakistan Octopus card Reaganomics Tax Interest rate Free trade Capitalism Minimum wage Arthur Laffer Deficit spending Corporation Corporate finance History of the United States (1918-1945) Real estate developer Central bank Business cycle Temasek Holdings Social Security (United States) Public policy Ponzi scheme Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Rational pricing Financial markets Social Security debate (United States) Annual percentage rate Public transport Euro Federal Reserve Internet fraud Debt consolidation Islamic economics Warren Buffett Credit score Investment bank Refinancing Subsidy Great Depression Title insurance Health insurance
