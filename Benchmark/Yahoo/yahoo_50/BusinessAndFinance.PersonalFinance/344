can i use my stafford loan for my living expenses once my classes are payed for my classes have been paid for and now i am getting money back from my school is it a good idea to spend it on my home bills or put it back towards the loan yes but it's not a great idea remember that you do have to pay those back your best bet would be to repay the overages or put it in an interest yielding account until six months after graduation when you have to start paying them back another option would be to use the extra money to pay for the next semester thus negating your need for assistance for the next semester Student loan Bond Education in Germany Mortgage Money Credit card Graduate school Government debt Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Stock Savings and loan association Short selling Insurance 401(k) Marshall Plan Predatory lending Moe Berg Deflation (economics) Gross domestic product Microeconomics Betting (poker) Annuity Islamic banking Debt Tuition History of the Jews in England Economy of India Anarchism and capitalism History of the United States (1918-1945) Gold standard Education in Romania Mutual fund Professor United Kingdom corporation tax Derivative (finance) Security (finance) FairTax Economy of Russia Interest Savings and Loan crisis School of Salamanca Employee stock option U.S. public debt Hyperinflation Economy of Pakistan Tertiary education fees in Australia Great Depression Economy of Africa Microcredit Poker jargon Blackburn Rovers F.C.
