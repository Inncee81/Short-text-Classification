i have a department store credit card that i don't use any more should i cancel it to improve my credit score i have a credit card for mervyn's with a zero balance mervyn's doesn't have stores in my state anymore so i couldn't use it even if i wanted to my question is would it be better for my credit rating to just leave it alone with a zero balance or should i cancel it as long as the account doesn't have an annual fee i suggest you leave it alone you don't want to reduce your available credit limit and its also harmful to your credit by closing old accounts because it makes the length of time you have been using credit appear shorter Credit card Credit score Student loan Bank Password Surveillance Debit card Food Stamp Program Citigroup No Child Left Behind Act Octopus card Target Corporation Wal-Mart Arthur Laffer Virgin Mobile Monetary policy EFTPOS Interest Internet fraud Insurance Personal finance Minimum wage Textile manufacturing Theodicy Ultima Online Evan Mecham Mutual fund Mortgage Credit history America Online Charmed Hard disk Sears Holdings Corporation Futures contract Agricultural policy H-1B visa Law of value Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Taxation in the United States Contract bridge Annuity Credit union Life insurance Abortion debate Corporation Equine conformation Skype Bill Maher Extreme Programming Economy of Russia Mainframe computer Money supply Breastfeeding Identity theft Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Monetarism Betting (poker) Economy of Pakistan MAME Good Times Bon Jovi StarCraft: Uprising Money Diablo II: Lord of Destruction United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Salary cap Credit card fraud Alcohol fuel Consensus decision-making Kyoto Protocol Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Electrophysiology Radar Triathlon Gold standard History of Doctor Who Double-entry book-keeping The Amazing Race Refinancing Financial audit Fox News Automatic teller machine Wind power Whose Line Is It Anyway?
