question about ebay if i don't offer a return policy on ebay and just sell items around my house as is can i honestly get in trouble with ebay i have a crazy lady who wants to return the item but knew when she bought it for by the way that i didn't accept returns to be nice i told her if she shipped it back i'd award her her cents lol now she wants me to pay for her to ship it do i have to grant her anything i really don't care about my feedback because i am done selling stuff around the house i just wanted to use ebay to get rid of things that are collectible and honestly got wripped off big time so i'm done with it when i returned an item as it was faulty i was responsible for all the postage costs if she really kicks up a stink it might be worth just telling her to keep the item and refunding her cents to shut her up and get her off your back that way she gets it for free and doesn't have any cause to create problems for you United States Postal Service Live 8 Neopets Philatelic investment Humphrey Bogart Make money fast Shaggy dog story Auction Animal Crossing Taxation in the United States Theory of conduct Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Wal-Mart Extreme Programming Cable television Bulk vending Britney Spears The Apprentice 2 Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Topps RuneScape quests Enron Corporation Marilyn Monroe Advance fee fraud Microeconomics Electronic commerce One Piece minor characters MAME Charles Ponzi Jumpstart 3rd Grade EastEnders Paul Martin GunBound Wang Mang The nature of God in Western theology Warren Buffett Sharon Tate ROM image Satchel Paige Hyperinflation Oil-for-Food Programme Sears Holdings Corporation Virtual economy Knots Landing Postage stamps and postal history of the United States MapleStory The Star Wars Holiday Special Calvin and Hobbes One Tree Hill (TV series) MMORPG LiveJournal Little Britain Camp Lazlo Mozilla Firefox Karl Rove Quarashi Arbitrage Ocean's Twelve Common criticisms of Microsoft Postage stamp Internet fraud Joke FairTax Publicly funded medicine Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina The Apprentice 3 Public domain Poker jargon Major League Baseball television contracts Health insurance British House of Commons Online auction business model Fry's Electronics Kyle Broflovski Islamic banking Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Shit Shill Supply and demand Estoppel 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Hey Jude Life insurance Autograph Ron and Fez Common Agricultural Policy Dot-com Euro Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Public good EFTPOS Blockbuster Video Ethical consumerism Adoption Piccolo Junior Saga James T.
