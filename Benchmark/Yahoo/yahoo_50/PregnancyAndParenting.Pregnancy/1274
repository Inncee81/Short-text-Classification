is my pregnancy possibility high if i had sex on aug and my period was due aug day cycle but im usually a few days to a week late for my period does this make my chance of pregnancy high or low okay honey this is the deal if your periods are regular that is if you can be fairly sure when you are going to start then no you are not pregnant in other words the chance of your being pregnant is very low however if your periods are irregular and you have little or no idea when they are going to start then your guess is as good as mine i don't know how old you are if you are a teenager it is more likely that you could have gotten pregnant because teenagers ovulate irregularly if you are on older woman perhaps or then your hormone production is more stable and i would say that you have nothing to worry about you will ovulate half way before the last period that you had and the one that you are expecting if that time is regular and is the same all the time then you know when you ovulate you do not ovulate two days before your period is due i would say that you can relax your period will start all things being equal i would say that your chance of being pregnant is almost nonexistant feel free to write to me if you have any more questions love and blessings lady trinity Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Birth control Polycystic ovary syndrome Sexual abstinence Ovulation Estrus cycle Progesterone Ovarian cyst In vitro fertilisation EastEnders Puberty Miscarriage Human chorionic gonadotropin Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) History of sex Sex education Abortion debate Turner syndrome Niddah Teenage pregnancy Marriage Infertility Breastfeeding Oral sex Neighbours Twin Androgen insensitivity syndrome Child sexuality I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Tocopherol Abortion Doxepin The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Childbirth Poker jargon Knots Landing Sleep Prolactinoma Sexual revolution Woman Marilyn Monroe Jon Secada Days of our Lives Pelvic inflammatory disease Pedophilia Lucille Ball Estradiol Lunar phase Tide Multiple birth Little Britain Folic acid Immanuel Madonna (entertainer) Hey Jude Melanie Wilkes Sharon Tate Methotrexate Crossing Jordan Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Haloperidol Hebrew calendar Sexual orientation Ectopic pregnancy Phoebe Halliwell Brave New World Friends Guinea pig Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Coffee Transsexuality Freeters CPU cache Baldness treatments Big Brother UK series 6 Germaine Greer Urinary incontinence Ovary One Tree Hill (TV series) The Smoking Room Soap opera Kurt Cobain Emotions (album) Time Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Infantilism Theory of conduct Sexual reproduction Tears for Fears Gregory Goodwin Pincus Trinity The Isley Brothers
