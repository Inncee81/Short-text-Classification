confused my bbt temperature did not drop it actually went from to this morning now days early from my day cycle went bathroom and noticed dark blood no cramps just dark blood iam like clock work days and my tempature drops before period starts so i know when i start upset and confused now we used pre seed for the first time this month has anyone ever had this happen tothem and later found out that they were indeed pregnant so can i still have a period with my bbt level still hight confused is all thank you bbt pre seed and opk this month now blood is kinda alot mut not like a normal period it's kind of late for it to be implantation bleeding and implantation bleeding usually is not red blood or enough flow to require a pad tampon i know sometimes women won't have a temp drop and they'll start spotting or more but not like their normal flow then the next day have a temp drop and period starts you really won't be able to tell until tomorrow i guess seeing if your temp drops and if you continue to bleed i have heard of the rare instance of implantation bleeding taking awhile to bleed down but i don't really know how much we are talking about here it is pretty confusing the other thing that can happen is that you ovulated twice and conceived twins and one is miscarrying because it never started to grow vanishing twin syndrome since you are so close to your period take a test if you have one on hand i'm guessing since you chart that you know for sure that you did ovulate this month so you should know whether your period is coming or you are pregnant within a couple days good luck Fertility awareness Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Oral contraceptive Endometriosis Obstetrics Urinary incontinence Twin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception Jet engine Menstrual cup Stroke Ovulation Dialysis Ovarian cancer Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer The Inside Infertility Puberty Progesterone Endometrial cancer First aid Niddah Pregnancy test Social rule Childbirth Stomach cancer Conifer cones Von Willebrand disease Traumatic brain injury The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Blood pressure Coeliac disease Intravenous therapy Diabetic retinopathy Hearing impairment Rei Ayanami Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Good Morning, Vietnam Milton H.
