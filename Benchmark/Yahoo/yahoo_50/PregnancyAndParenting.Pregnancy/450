i forgot how exhausting the first few weeks of pregnancy are how can i get my energy up i feel tired and out of breath all day anything i can do to feel more awake and have energy to get things done i have kids months and years so sleeping is not an option thanks so much one simple way that may help is to get into bright light or sunlight right away this is a natural signal that jump starts your brain for the day and can help you feel more energetic try do spend a minute or two doing something brisk like sweeping whisking eggs or chasing and tickling your yr old to get a good wake up it sounds like a miserable way to have to get up but if it has good effects the rest of the day it might be worth it good luck and congratulations Sleep Dream Daylight saving time Lucid dreaming Apollo 8 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Out-of-body experience Aurora (astronomy) Clinical depression 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Contender (television series) Urinary incontinence Light Insomnia Sonic the Hedgehog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pregnancy The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Seiken Densetsu 3 USS Wahoo (SS-238) Sunlight Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Narcolepsy Childbirth Sun Jon Secada Drowning Mnemonic Social rule Cordelia Chase Marilyn Monroe USS Tunny (SS-282) Psoriasis Breastfeeding Polyphasic sleep Fertility awareness Gamma ray Ekadasi Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Laughter Kid Buu Saga The Velvet Underground Sleep apnea Capercaillie Ionosphere Cigarette Smoking Man Brian Close Epilepsy Chronic fatigue syndrome USS Yorktown (CV-10) Pok__mon Abilities Care Bears Obedience training Oh My Goddess!
