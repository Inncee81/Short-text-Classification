can i make a girl pregnant if i didnt cum in her i wore a spermicidal condom too what if precum gets out hello there the answer is no while pre ejaculate technically does contain sperm it does not contain a sufficient amount to cause pregnancy even without the condom you were fine with the condom you have nothing to worry about you should know that condoms when used correctly are an excellent form of birth control many couples go for years using condoms and never have a problem it is important to be consistant and careful but condoms do a good job of preventing pregnancy if you are in a monogamous relationship you may want to encourage your partner to also use birth control and then you are absolutely protected with all the forms of birth control that are available today there is no reason for anyone to have to resort to abstaining for the fear of pregnancy as so many would like you to believe blessings lady t Condom Birth control Safe sex Fertility awareness Sexual intercourse Oral sex Sexual abstinence Abortion debate Sex education Infertility Abortion Emergency contraception Human sexual behavior Masturbation Diaphragm (contraceptive) Pornographic movie Anal sex Nonoxynol-9 Abortion in the United States Pregnancy Monogamy Hillary Rodham Clinton AIDS Infantilism Spina bifida Herpes simplex virus Menstrual cycle Marriage History of sex Androgen insensitivity syndrome Menstrual cup Coitus interruptus Premature ejaculation Roe v.
