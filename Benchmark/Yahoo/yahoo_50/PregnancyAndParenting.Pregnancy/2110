why does this happen how come people that really want children and have been trying for months or even years don t seem to get pregnant as quickly as those people who aren t in relationships or are only very young or those who just aren t trying what so ever i don't know edb just the luck of the draw those who just want to have sex often end up pregnant and don't want the babies but they keep them anyway whereas those who have sex constantly don't get pregnant and would sell a limb just to have a child if you are in the latter group relax and stop thinking about it so much it will happen when it's meant to happen and then you will have a beautiful baby of your own to love and cherish good luck Humphrey Bogart Pregnancy Social rule Marriage Sharon Tate Marilyn Monroe Cliff Richard Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Teenage pregnancy Neighbours Charmed Luck Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Friends Madonna (entertainer) Something Positive Crossing Jordan Abortion debate Stewie Griffin AFI 100 Years series EastEnders About a Boy Triple J Hottest 100, 2003 Oasis (band) Smallville (Season 4) Cartman Joins NAMBLA Sex and the City Survivor (novel) Hollyoaks Transactional analysis Jon Secada Kodocha Jennifer Lopez The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Puberty Motion picture rating system Child sexuality Knots Landing Brandy (entertainer) Romulus and Remus Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Tommy Atkins Generation X Tom Jones (singer) Sex My Parents are Aliens Galactic Civilizations Cher (entertainer) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Full House Piper Halliwell Joe DiMaggio Percy Bysshe Shelley Ex-gay The Smoking Room Emotions (album) Platypus R.E.M.
