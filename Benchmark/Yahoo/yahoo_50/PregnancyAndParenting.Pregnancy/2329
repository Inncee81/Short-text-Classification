what are the necessities to have before baby comes home what are the things you have to have before the baby comes home new mom want to make sure i have everything this list was initially compiled fas a registry list for a friend but it lists all the things that you need for baby crib bassinet and or pack and play something to keep baby near you is a must for many moms but definately a pack and play to take other places or keep downstairs in a two story house we always have a bassinet a pnp won't fit in our bedroom either swing of some sort either a travel size that is easy to move around or a full size we have only had one swing and it was a travel size it worked great for us this time we are looking at the step fisher price swing that has a toddler rocker bouncey seat you can get away with one other the other but most babies take to one over the other we have always had a bouncy seat and our first two prefered them boppy pillow a must have they now have one that is more flexible for larger mommies and daddies this is great for nursing and bottle feeding also for the baby on the floor a breast pump if you are nursing manual for casual use i used an avent manual for all day pumping most mom's recommend a medela pump in style for full time pumping lanolin common brands are medela pure lan and lansinoh this is a lifesaver for sore dry cracked nipples i use it during pregnancy and it helps with some of the soreness but it is great while nursing breast pads i prefer the gerber or avent but you have to see what is right for you also cloth rewashable ones are great bottles if you have a pump make sure that they are compatable only get a few in each kind you never know what baby will take to a good diaper bag make sure you can get into it with one hand zippers are usually hard to get past with a baby in your hand a snapping one is best also a little zipper pouch in it is good for mommy things and try to make sure that there is one that is daddy friendly you want it to be decent size for all newborn necessities but you don't want it huge remember you will be lugging it around all the time a good stroller we went with an umbrella stroller with our first that was a lifesaver for us it is a breeze to open and close it fits easily in mall stores and other tight places it is super compact too but if you decide to go the big stroller route make sure it is compatible with your carseat also get it off the shef push it around the isle open it close it adjust the seats and seatbelts and pick it up you put it back on the shelf not hubby you have to be able to lift it most of the time if it is too complicated to use put it back you won't want it a baby carrier or sling i can't say enough about wearing your baby my hubby loves the baby bjorn type carriers i am hoping to get a ring sling myself it is a great hands free worry free way to go out when i was shopping with a newborn i didn't have to worry about turning my back on the baby to get something off the grocery store shelf also baby can sleep and feel you they are snuggled up just like they were in the womb it is amazing you can easily bundle them up in the winter and use a lighter weight in the summer for a cooler baby it helps soothe colic without killing your back too lol carseats there are two routes to go one is the infant carseat those are the ones you see mom's lugging their babies in they can be a great choice but babies especially larger infants tend to outgrow them fast you have three or four months with a large baby and about five or six with a smaller one many moms use these with their strollers the other option is a convertible carseat you can fit newborns easily into these as well a convertible carseat is what we used with our first two the were snug in them and safe if you use the infant you need both seats if you use the convertible you only need the one they say britax is the safest but it is way way way out of our price range to pay over for a carseat we use graco for our infant and one of the others for convertible they all have to pass national safety standards which one well do the same with them as you did with the strollers road test them research online then go make sure you can work the thing there are some that are way to complicated to figure out if you can't figure it out don't buy it crib set find one you like some mom's won't use bumpers we don't mind having them we take them out when baby starts to move too much and tries to climb on them crib sheets bassinet sheets pack n play sheets you need three or four sheets for each thing you bought make sure that the bassinet sheets and pack n play sheets work for the item you bought they are all different measurements lightweight blankets you will use these all the time even if you don't use them in the crib you will to toss over baby in his swing or bouncer to cover him on the way to the car to cover him during kangaroo care skin to skin contact and when others are holding him some sort of burp cloth either the so called cloth diapers by gerber my personal favorite or real burp cloths a baby bath tub we got one for ish it was a blue one and we have used it for all three of our children some people just wash baby in the kitchen sink and others in the bathroom sink that one is up to you just remember slippery when wet if you are a butterfingers like me opt for the tub lol some but few few few clothes and toys most people will opt for those anyway some won't even look at the registry and get clothes or toys but for your info onesies are a lifesaver i prefer infant gowns to footed sleepers but that is a personal thing you will use a lot of those mix and match outfits will save you time and make sure to get newborn and mths have at least a few of each on hand and when baby gets to the mth clothes go ahead and buy some you will be amazed but they will wake up one morning in a totally different size a diaper pail personally i just got a lidded kitchen trash can the diaper genie is worthless it is a pain and you go through bags like nobody's business a kitchen can with trashbags that are changed every day or everyother day work well if you have a poop that stinks bad use a walmart bag and pitch it in the outside can but bf poo doesn't stink most of the time diapers there are only two companies that use nb diapers in disposables at least that i know of pampers and huggies our boys leaked through huggies but others swear by them your baby you will have to wait and see have several on hand and just experiment each company will probably send you samples if you go to their website cloth diapers if you choose this route you will need ish diapers in newborn and small most people use either prefolds and covers with a snappi or fitteds and covers typically some of your stash will include pockets or all in ones for outings and sitters you will need a wet bag to put in your diaper pail a lined cloth bag to toss in the laundry with diapers and an extra one for while that one is in the wash as well as a small wet bag for the diaper bag these aren't your parents diapers they are awesome you will also need to make sure your detergent is okay for diapers for diaper rash cream boudreaux's butt paste is better than anything else we have found on store shelves but different babies respond to different things i hope that that helps don't go by the store's registry list find one online that isn't affiliated with a store the store or a company are usually just out to get you to buy all these products you will never use
