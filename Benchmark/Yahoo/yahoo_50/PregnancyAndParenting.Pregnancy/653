how soon after the baby drops do you deliver i have a question for all you women who have already had babies i am currently about weeks pregnant i've been having weird pains in my stomach that i think may be bh contractions i told my doctor about them so she checked me at my last visit on friday and she told me that the baby has dropped into my pelvis and my cervix is softening already i haven't started dialating yet though does anyone have any idea how soon i could expect to go into labor my doctor told me that the baby could be coming a little sooner than expected but she didn't really give me a very good indication of how soon is sooner is it like weeks sooner or days or what the doctor can't really give you any indication because babies are tricky little creatures who decide when to come of their own accord my daughter was born days early and i had terrible braxton hick all through the pregnancy my son had to be induced as he was getting rather large and i only got braxton hick in the last months of the pregnancy and my cervix had already dilated cm and i still needed intervention by the doctor to break my waters for my boy to decide he was coming make sure your bag is packed and if you have other children put your babysitter s on notice and just enjoy the ride most likely you will still have weeks to go not days i think you wont go to term but probably weeks or so good luck and try to get some sleep so you remember what it was after the baby has been born lol Childbirth Pregnancy Obstetrics Breech birth Abortion Premature birth EastEnders Cervix Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertility awareness Abortion debate Menstrual cycle In vitro fertilisation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Sharon Tate Ectopic pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gonorrhoea Knots Landing Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Milton H.
