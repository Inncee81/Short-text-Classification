would i have noticed a sign by now the last time me and my fiance had sex was months ago so that's how far i would be if i were pregnant i had thought i had a period after that but i don't really keep track because they are irregular anyway i've kind of been stressed so that could be delaying it i know i have not had one since the beginning of july so i still may be in the clear i haven't experienced any other signs like morning sickness or anything but then again i wouldn't know how far along those signs appear it seems like some other sign would be there if i'm almost months thanks for your answers i think you'd have noticed something by now like breast tenderness or nausea Pregnancy Puberty Obstetrics Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Breast cancer Ocean's Twelve Abortion debate EastEnders Stomach cancer Prolactinoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Black Comedy Ron and Fez Morning sickness Urinary incontinence Sharon Tate The Pet Sounds Sessions Survivor (novel) Oral contraceptive Decompression sickness New Morning Charles Darwin's illness Dog Time Out of Mind Oh My Goddess!
