pregnancy concerns should we be worried my wife is currently weeks pregnant let me just explain that she is prone to pre term labour children born pre term i have read conflicting reports about loss of pregnancy symptoms some say leaking breasts and loss of the nausea could be a sign not being pregnant anymore however other reports say the leaking breasts is perfectly normal since my wife has all of a sudden stopped feeling sick and believe me she has been bad up until now and she is leaking milk however baby is still moving having said that we lost a child through pre term labour and at that time baby was moving and was a live birth do you think we should be concerned after you past experiences i dont think anything anyone can say will stop you worrying i had a miscarriage last year and am currently weeks gone and stil checking for blood however the symptoms you describe can be normal the breasts can leak milk during pregnancy and literally overnight i realised i feel great whereas i had been tired felt sick and basically a moody cow before why dont you call the hospital or go along and they might be able to reassure you maybe with a scan listen to the heartbeat etc you dont have to worry alone or shouldn't do anyway id say go to the hospital and get checked out you have very valid reasons for extra tlc Pregnancy Obstetrics Miscarriage Childbirth Breastfeeding Premature birth Abortion Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stillbirth Cytomegalovirus Hypoglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breech birth Prolactinoma Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Haloperidol Menstrual cycle Morning sickness Abortion debate Spina bifida Folic acid Psoriasis Paroxetine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prenatal diagnosis Anxiety Sharon Tate Stroke Charmed Twin Singlish Panic attack Infantilism First aid Doxepin Charles Darwin's illness One Life to Live Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tobacco smoking Infant Pneumonia Fertility awareness Cephalic disorder Aspartame Domestic violence EastEnders Turner syndrome Oral contraceptive Multiple sclerosis Diabetic retinopathy Marilyn Monroe Diabetes mellitus In vitro fertilisation Anemia Graves-Basedow disease Chlorpromazine Hyperprolactinaemia Horus Alcoholism Friends Melanie Wilkes Knots Landing Abortion in the United States Hypertension Midwifery M__ni__re___s disease Growth hormone treatment Jam (TV series) Ebola Heartbeat (television) Kodocha Transsexuality Ovarian cancer Radiation therapy Cancer Endometriosis Caesarean section Milk Professional wrestling slang Food allergy Adoption Puberty Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lovely Bones Diarrhea Maprotiline Vitamin C Mammary gland Decompression sickness Jordan (model) Cirrhosis Aortic dissection Hearing impairment Sexual orientation Partial-birth abortion
