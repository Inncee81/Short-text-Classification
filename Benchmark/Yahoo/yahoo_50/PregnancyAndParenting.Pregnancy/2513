question about possible pregnancy my bf i were making out in our spa and we were pretty much pelvis to pelvis for probably no more than mins and he was erect what would be the possiblilty that i could get prego we had both our bathing suits on the water was hot and had lots of chemicals thanks in advance and i never had sex ed in school and i am a virgin it's pretty unlikely it's possible to get pregnant without penetration but it usually involves sperm directly on the vagina the combination of heat and chemicals in the spa would make it unlikely for sperm to survive for long Birth control Oral sex Sexual reproduction In vitro fertilisation Fertility awareness Sexual intercourse Menstrual cycle Pornographic movie Obstetrics Abortion debate Anal sex Pregnancy Orgasm Welding Swimming pool Endometriosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Puberty Sauna Hot spring Bathing Prostate cancer Cervical cancer Leamington Spa Condom Solar power Pelvis Strap-on dildo Ovarian cancer Swimming Vagina Infertility Group sex Oral contraceptive Female reproductive system (human) Hydrotherapy Sento Intersex surgery Tampon Dyspareunia Virgin Psoriasis Chemical reaction Premature birth Rape Urinary incontinence Spermatozoon Sexual selection Bath Coffee Energy development Hydrogen economy Krzeszowice Human sexual behavior Human Fertilisation Childbirth Gonorrhoea Acetic acid Urticaria Niddah Sex organ Sulfuric acid Leonardo da Vinci Uterus Miscarriage Old wives' tale Douche Ectopic pregnancy Swimsuit Hot tub Pornography Gas metal arc welding Perfume Breech birth Teenage pregnancy Sex education Inflation fetishism Fire fighting DNA Sexual differentiation Human sexuality Water Thermae Geyser Explosive material Railgun Spacecraft propulsion Marsupial Hydrogen Parthenogenesis Heat Vaginal lubrication Swyer syndrome Nitroglycerin Emergency contraception Premature ejaculation Wood pulp
