how far along do you have to be before they can tell if you're having multiples i seem to be getting awfully big awfully fast i'm only weeks along and have a bump when will the tell me if it's twins or triplets or something someone as early as weeks could get an idea if she is having multiples because the sacs will show up on the ultrasound but you can't see actual heartbeats until weeks or so some women many have sacs but it is common that only one will develop into a baby and don't forget the number of weeks you are along inlcudes the two weeks or so before you actually conceived that goes back to your last menstrual period so if your last period was weeks ago and you conceived weeks ago you are actually weeks pregnant last your bloating is probably more hormone related than multiples related some women are sensitive to hcg and may retain water more when they get pregnant the baby babies are only a tiny speck now and do not take up any room in there i would not worry too much about having multiples unless you are over or have taken fertility treatments if you are or under your chance is only of having more than one baby in there Pregnancy Miscarriage Twin Obstetrics Menstrual cycle Polycystic ovary syndrome Urinary incontinence Multiple birth In vitro fertilisation Childbirth Premature birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ovarian cyst Endometriosis Acne Breech birth Friends Cryptorchidism Pregnancy test Breastfeeding Infertility Amniotic sac Human chorionic gonadotropin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertility awareness Birth control Spina bifida Prostate cancer Oral contraceptive Breast cancer EastEnders Vanishing twin Prenatal diagnosis Mammalian embryogenesis Puberty Prolactinoma Artemis Gonorrhoea Neighbours Ovulation Human cloning Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Birth weight Fetal development Mario Sex assignment Abortion debate Knots Landing C__line Dion Hypothyroidism Germaine Greer Sharon Tate Ovarian cancer Origin belief Progesterone Gender role Ectopic pregnancy Endometrial cancer Menopause Coeliac disease Flowering plant Guinea pig Dysmenorrhea Cephalic disorder Hall & Oates Emergency contraception Anencephaly Diabetic retinopathy Adriana Iliescu Orgasm Amenorrhoea Abortion Bee Gees The 4400 Max Martin Marsupial Stroke Swyer syndrome Testicle Morning sickness Left-handed Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog Human skin color Transsexuality Pelvic inflammatory disease Radiation therapy Endocrinology Artificial insemination Breast B-47 Stratojet Elephant Postpartum depression Marriage Chemical abortion All Summer Long Menstrual cup Doxepin Embryo transfer Ashanti (singer) Street-Legal
