strong positive pregnancy i took a pregnancy test earlier today and barely had peed on the stick when the control line and a very dark positive line showed up i assume this would mean that i have a decent amount of hcg in my system could this mean that i am carrying twins just curious because my other two pregnancies never showed such a quick strong result this early on in the pregnancy i am weeks days i didn't test first thing in the morning i tested around pm the same thing happened to me and i didn't carry twins i used one of those digital tests and as soon as the urine hit it read positive it wasn't first morning urine and i was about weeks along i wondered if there was a correlation between that and really bad morning sickness Pregnancy Pregnancy test Obstetrics Human chorionic gonadotropin Drug test Menstrual cycle Twin Abortion debate Urinary incontinence Diabetes mellitus Vitamin C HIV test Fertility awareness Miscarriage Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Billboard Hot 100 Abortion Ben Johnson (athlete) Childbirth Debugging Biology and sexual orientation Urination 2000 Australian Grand Prix Urinalysis StarCraft: Uprising Time Out of Mind New Morning Cytomegalovirus Blood on the Tracks Bell's theorem History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Operation Market Garden Urine Cephalic disorder EastEnders Wheel of Fortune History of Test cricket (to 1883) Birth control Tunisia Campaign Big Bang IBM PC compatible West Indian cricket team Urinary system Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ravi Shastri Lupus erythematosus Gonorrhoea Prostate cancer Morning sickness Motivation The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Insulin Modem Blonde on Blonde Ayurveda Shaggy dog story Endometriosis Roswell UFO incident Major League Baseball television contracts Toilet humour Schapelle Corby Isotretinoin Invasion of the Waikato Poker jargon Thalidomide History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) West Indian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005 Jeopardy!
