what could this be please help i had a shooting pain when i was walking to my computer but now it went away i have had it before for hours i am in my th week and yesterday i lost my mucus plug and this afternoon more of a big blob of mucus was in my pad when i went to use the bathroom i feel a low abdominal cramping like feeling but it is more uncomfortable than painful can anyone tell me what is going on or what this could be rumors seem to abound when it comes to what it means to lose your mucus plug while there's hardly a pregnant woman out there who doesn't wonder when exactly she will go into labor the appearance of the mucus plug does not answer this question with any certainty that said loss of the mucus plug is often the first sign that labor is approaching before you make a mad dash to labor and delivery however remind yourself that many women do not go into labor for a week or two after this event in fact if you are full term which almost by definition means that you'll be welcoming your new baby within the next few weeks there is usually no need to even make an after hours call to your practitioner Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Stomach cancer Childbirth Premature birth Miscarriage Cervix Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Coeliac disease Friends Fertility awareness Goodness and value theory LSD Australian legislative election, 2004 Humphrey Bogart Babe Ruth Fecal incontinence Strap-on dildo Rei Ayanami Obstetrics Garfield Ron and Fez Eddie Guerrero Spark plug Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aesthetic Realism Night (book) Prostate cancer Ulcerative colitis Apollo 8 Software engineering Labor theory of value Ovulation Starbucks Ken Jennings Glen Jacobs Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Traumatic incident reduction Medical prescription Asthma Melanie Wilkes Match Game Scientology beliefs and practices Colorectal cancer Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Subud Urinary incontinence Tobacco Unemployment Abdominal pain Diving Professional wrestling holds Social rule BS 1363 Avenue Q Grief Martin Scorsese Wheel of Fortune Big Brother (USA TV series) Major League Baseball television contracts Jennifer Lopez Clinical depression Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Group A streptococcal infection Mad Money Kurt Cobain Irritable bowel syndrome Chemical abortion Atkins Nutritional Approach Poliomyelitis Mathematician Reaction to the assassination of John F.
