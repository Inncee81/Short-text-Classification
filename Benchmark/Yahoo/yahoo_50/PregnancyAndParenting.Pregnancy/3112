have you ever asked the hopsital for this or know of anyone who has before i deliver i would like a list telling me all of the costs for asprin pads meals epidural etc i am paying out of pocket and quite honestly if i can save even it will be worth it having a baby is expensive every penny counts i know you will ask why don't you have insurance the reason is my hubby is self employed and where we live insurance is the same cost as a house payment and we don't want any gov help we wouldn't qualify anyways fyi information gov help is not a pride issue i know that if anything goes wrong i have that to fall on however like i mentioned we would not qualify yearly income we pay cash for everything house is payed off we paid cash for out car i am just trying to be frugal i think gov help is used way too much when if one puts their mind to it they can do it themselves a payment plan through the hospital is always an option for us paganmom i don't think dollars a visit for those visits will be an issue and if it is we will cross that bridge when we get there i am appalled at the people who cut me down for trying do it the right way and save you on your taxes geesh i'd think you'd all be proud of a young couple trying to do it right all hospitals are required by law to give you an itemized list of your bill when requested so don't be afraid to ask also have you considered birthing at home with a certified midwife homebirth has been proven in low risk pregnancies to be just as safe as a hospital birth remember a low risk pregnancy though this will only cost you around dollars and most midwives will work out a payment plan with you homebirth isn't for everyone but it's something to look into if you are looking to cut cost without compromising safety if your pregnancy develops any risk factors though your midwife will refer you to a hospital where you should deliver if such an incidence occurs second to that are freestanding birth centers these are usually located near a hospital and again they take low risk pregnancies only but their costs are a lot less than a hospital birth and are just as safe good luck Life insurance Health insurance Insurance Midwifery Medicare (Canada) Publicly funded medicine Taxation in the United States Personal finance Annuity Social Security (United States) Flat tax Mortgage 401(k) Microeconomics Bond Caesarean section Obstetrics Risk management Gross domestic product Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Breech birth Internet fraud Abortion Hillary Rodham Clinton United States Postal Service Tax Inflation Unemployment benefit Social Security debate (United States) Wal-Mart Nuclear power In vitro fertilisation Birth weight Credit card Supply and demand Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Mergers and acquisitions Pregnancy Breastfeeding Birth control Health care in the United States EastEnders Variable universal life insurance Money Economy of Russia Dave Reichert National Health Service Prenatal diagnosis Arguments for and against drug prohibition Capital accumulation Advance fee fraud Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Mutual fund U.S. public debt Blackjack Corporate finance Arthur Laffer Freeters Adoption Domestic partnerships in California National Kidney Foundation Singapore Lottery Hyperinflation The Amazing Race Nuclear power phase-out Debt Progressive tax Theory of conduct Knots Landing National Insurance Pharmaceutical company Balanced Budget Amendment Multiple birth Poker jargon Income trust Health savings account Roe v.
