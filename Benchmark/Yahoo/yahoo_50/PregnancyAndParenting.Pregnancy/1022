sleeping positions during pregnancy i am weeks pregnant i know that you shouldn't lay on your stomach to sleep and eventually on your back either so i just want to know how long until i have to sleep only on my sides i know its recommended at all times and i am doing it however i was wondering if there was a rule about sleeping on your stomach as being ok up til a certain week that maybe i can still take advantage of and if the same went for the back i usually wake up and change positions if i catch myself sleeping on my stomach at night early in your pregnancy try to get into the habit of sleeping on your side lying on your side with your knees bent is likely to be the most comfortable position as your pregnancy progresses it also makes your heart's job easier because it keeps the baby's weight from applying pressure to the large vein called the inferior vena cava that carries blood back to the heart from your feet and legs some doctors specifically recommend that pregnant women sleep on the left side because your liver is on the right side of your abdomen lying on your left side helps keep the uterus off that large organ ask what your doctor recommends in most cases lying on either side should do the trick and help take some pressure off your back but don't drive yourself crazy worrying that you might roll over onto your back during the night shifting positions is a natural part of sleeping that you can't control most likely during the third trimester of your pregnancy your body won't shift into the back sleeping position anyway because it will be too uncomfortable if you do shift onto your back and the baby's weight presses on your inferior vena cava the discomfort will probably wake you up see what your doctor recommends about this he or she may suggest that you use a pillow to keep yourself propped up on one side try experimenting with pillows to discover a comfortable sleeping position some women find that it helps to place a pillow under their abdomen or between their legs also using a bunched up pillow or rolled up blanket at the small of your back may help to relieve some pressure in fact you'll find that there are many pregnancy pillows on the market if you're thinking about purchasing one talk with your doctor first about which one might work for you Inferior vena cava Mattress Breastfeeding Obstetrics Professional wrestling holds Liver Childbirth Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Breech birth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Friends Aerial (dance move) Abortion Miscarriage Fetus Psoriasis Intravenous therapy Atrial septal defect Recovery position Skateboarding trick EastEnders Professional wrestling throws Abortion debate Prostate cancer Spina bifida Heart The Shining (film) Coeliac disease Jam (TV series) Professional wrestling attacks Fertility awareness Casualty lifting Equine conformation Hypertension Vein Professional wrestling aerial techniques Diabetic retinopathy Oral contraceptive Strap-on dildo Autonomic nervous system Anal sex Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Renal cell carcinoma Chair Sudden infant death syndrome Pulmonary embolism History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Kurt Cobain Turner syndrome Social rule Androgen insensitivity syndrome Chest Menstrual cycle Deep vein thrombosis Sexual intercourse Stroke Folic acid Suplex Menstrual cup Sexual reproduction Cirrhosis Endometriosis Aorta Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Liver transplantation Varicocele Sleeping Murder Backstroke Suicide methods Ocean's Twelve Tocopherol Mixed martial arts Myocardial infarction Weight training Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Days of our Lives Masturbation Twin Cancer Intact dilation and extraction Insomnia Milton H.
