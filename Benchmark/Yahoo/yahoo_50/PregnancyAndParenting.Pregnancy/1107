having trouble breathing sleeping at night i am coming off of week and for the past couple of weeks i have to either sleep on my left side or sleep sitting up i cannot sleep on my left side for very long because through the course of the night i feel like i'm having a hard time breathing or rather i feel like i just can't get enough air so i roll over onto my back and prop all of my pillows behind me and sleep sitting up this isn't so bad but can be quite uncomfortable at times i was just at my doctor's office for my month prenatal visit and he listened to my lungs and said that everything sounded fine but if it progresses or worsens severely to head to the er in case it is something more it's just nerve racking because i'm losing sleep just trying to get comfortable my pillows consist of a snoogle pregnancy pillow two regular pillows behind my back a body pillow to prop the belly and a regular pillow to elevate the feet what can i do to alleviate this problem i also deal with this problem i just wish i had all the pillows you do one way i found that helps is to situate my pillows just how i want them then i kneel on the bed on my hands and knees i rock my back up like a cat and then down like a cow not too low just lower then level to the ground i do it about ten times then rest and take several deep breathes then i repeat the back exercise and the breathing until the baby drops forward into my belly then i lay on my left side with my pillows this will keep the baby away from your ribs which may be the cause of your breathlessness hope it helps good luck Professional wrestling holds Mattress Equine conformation Breech birth Professional wrestling throws Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling attacks Childbirth Casualty lifting Whitewater Suplex Insomnia Prostate cancer Duchenne muscular dystrophy Backstroke Shaggy dog story Chronic fatigue syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Powerbomb Dog training Obstetrics Stuttering Poker jargon Marching band Traumatic brain injury Sleep apnea Gastroesophageal reflux disease Piledriver (professional wrestling) Sudden infant death syndrome Social rule Psoriasis Sleep Pillow Backbreaker Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drowning First aid Pregnancy Whale Breaststroke Ron and Fez Tetrapod Prenatal diagnosis Decompression sickness Upholstery Pitaten Clinical depression Battle of Fort Donelson Exercise Breath of Fire III Swimming Whose Line Is It Anyway?
