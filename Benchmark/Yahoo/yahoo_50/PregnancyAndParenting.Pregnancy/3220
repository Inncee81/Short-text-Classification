question about dr appt i am weeks tomorrow i have a dr appt lately i have been having braxton hicks on a daily bases not so much to cause concern and i feel like my babys head is lower than usual almost as if he has dropped i of course am going to bring this up to my dr well he do an exam on me will dr's do exams if you request one if you request a exam i don't see why the doctor wouldn't preform one but he may just check things out externally he should be able to feel if the baby is getting into position for birth babies sometimes get into this position for quite awhile before the birth and i don't think it's anything to be too alarmed over it would be better to discuss this with your doctor to be on the safe side Prostate cancer Breech birth Stomach cancer Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sharon Tate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coming of Age (TNG episode) Humphrey Bogart Toni Braxton SAT Singlish Adoption Abortion debate Cancer of the larynx Lawyer Hurricane Katrina timeline AFI 100 Years series Remix Aerial (dance move) Pregnancy Jennifer Lopez Professional wrestling throws Jon Secada Cher (entertainer) Driver's license Friends Breastfeeding Obstetrics Teacher Theory of conduct Junior Certificate Prolactinoma Characters of Lost Subjunctive mood Charmed Knots Landing The Pet Sounds Sessions Graduate school Fecal incontinence Pet Sounds Intact dilation and extraction Neighbours Education in Germany Education in Romania Prenatal care The Austere Academy Infantilism Bombing of Dresden in World War II Urinary incontinence Time Out of Mind Professor Birth weight Procrastination Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Folic acid In vitro fertilisation Philosophical skepticism Prenatal diagnosis Epistemology Slow Train Coming Bar examination Grade (education) Optical fiber Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Identity theft Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Government of France Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Terri Schiavo The nature of God in Western theology Advanced Placement Program Jam (TV series) Ayyavazhi mythology Episiotomy Birth control Cabinet of the United Kingdom Britney Spears Rudolf Steiner Sex assignment Kyle Broflovski RX-79 Series Tom Jones (singer) Plame affair timeline CPU cache Les Aspin Coeliac disease Hikikomori Mixed martial arts Spice Girls Hall & Oates David Hicks PRINCE2 The Apprentice 2 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Conspiracy (TNG episode) Blade Runner Eugenics Frankie Laine
