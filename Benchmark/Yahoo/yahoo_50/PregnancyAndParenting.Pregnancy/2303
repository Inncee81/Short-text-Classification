a little survey about having a baby okay who in here has had a baby and not been financially ready was it worth it should i not wait just because of the money i mean when am i really gonna ever be ready ok yes i am aware of the struggles since as my name suggests i am a mom of two i am also married so as far as the concern of not being ready or what not we are ready in every sense except for money i love my children husband and life dearly and we both want more i am just so scared about our money situation i was not prepared for the other two and we are making it but you can't help but worry after all i am female and a mom and wife unless you are without food and shelter you can certainly afford another child in my opinion it is better to have children earlier rather than later and financial stability is a fleeting fantasy for the majority of american families what exactly is financial stability being without debt pah like that's going to happen any time soon right making year most college grads don't even make that much right out of college be frugal be money wise be smart about how you spend your time and money and you'll be fine there are plenty of ways of spending less on a new child shop thrift stores make your own food breastfeed trade in your gas guzzler for a more efficient vehicle drop your expensive hobbies for cheaper or free ones use hand me down toys get into mother's networks in town in order to trade clothes and toys and other things you may need for things you don't use anymore but someone else might if you're really tight on money apply for wic or medicaid at your local health department wic will help you get the nutritious food you need and medicaid will help you pay for your and your children's medical expenses get a midwife instead of an ob unless you really need one because of health problems during your pregnancy you will save money not only from using a nurse instead of a doctor but you are less likely to have unnecessary and expensive interventions during your birth you can even look into having a home birth which is sometimes covered by insurance companies is definitely cheaper than a hospital birth and is actually safer for you and baby than a hospital birth if you are low risk the biggest thing that needs readying is other family members if you and your husband want another child and your other children are older than one or two years you're definitely ready Breastfeeding Childbirth Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Economy of the United States Medicare (Canada) Wal-Mart Midwifery Hillary Rodham Clinton Infantilism Canadian and American health care systems compared Medicaid National Health Service Divorce Life insurance Personal finance Capitalism Money Folic acid Bulk vending Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Commodity markets Abortion debate Government debt Breech birth Freeters EastEnders Inflation Microeconomics Adoption Flat tax Sears Holdings Corporation Economy of the Republic of Ireland Medicine Economy of Russia Social Security (United States) Humphrey Bogart Free trade Roe v.
