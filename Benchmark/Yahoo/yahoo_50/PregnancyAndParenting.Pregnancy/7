would you rather deliver a baby before halloween or after just a silly question we're trying to plan when we want to have our next baby i know we can't plan the exact month we get pregnant but if we had the choice we are deciding either to get pregnant to be due either october or november and since i love halloween so much i don't want to miss out on the fun with my son who would be about by then i don't know if i'd rather have my baby early october and get healed in time to go out trick or treating or wait till november and try to go trick or treating with a big baby belly i know i could end up being early or late too or not even get pregnant at all for those months what do you think i hope you give birth after halloween cause you can dress your babies up in cute toddler baby haloween costumes anytime for the next few years but its very rare that u get to dress your pregnant belly up plan to deliver in november that way you can put on a great costume or paint your belly or something fun with your two year old a great activity to do before you give him a sibling i know u will be tired being or months pregnant and all but it will be worth it Halloween EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Pregnancy Sharon Tate New York's Village Halloween Parade Characters in the Smurfs Treehouse of Horror XII Jon Secada Friends Days of our Lives Treehouse of Horror IX Ron and Fez Spidey Super Stories Saturday Night Live Glen Jacobs Cliff Richard Ocean's Twelve Situation comedy Charmed Paul Is Dead Neighbours Daredevil Humphrey Bogart Alois Hitler Leo Wyatt My Family (television) Rosa Parks Pregnancy fetishism The Den (television) Great Teacher Onizuka Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Childbirth Hollywood Squares Prenatal diagnosis Percy Bysshe Shelley Journey (band) Poker jargon Apollo Namie Amuro Gwen Stefani Care Bears The McGuire Sisters Oasis (band) Costume Joker (comics) Rugrats Eid ul-Fitr Belly dance Tupac Shakur Mardi Gras Hall & Oates Page Falkenberg Carnival The Miracles Trick-or-treat Abortion debate Shaggy dog story KISS (band) Ayyavazhi mythology Santa Claus Piper Halliwell Kyle Broflovski Another World (TV series) Insane Clown Posse The Sims Amy Dumas Heracles Skateboarding trick The Beach Boys My Parents are Aliens FoxTrot Spice Girls Professional wrestling match types Rod Stewart Melanie Wilkes Phil Mitchell Futurama (TV series - season 5) Britney Spears Claire Littleton James T.
