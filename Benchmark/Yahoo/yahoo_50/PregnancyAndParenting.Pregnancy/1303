level three screening how many people were given terrifying results of the their level three screenings and the baby came out healthy this happened to my husband and me we were told that our baby would come out with down syndrome or cystic fibrosis and yet our baby is normal not only this they told us at the hospital that our baby failed his hearing test yet a yr later is as healthy as can be my co workers and i were having this conversation and one went the a very similar experience and the others knew of people who wetn through similar expereinces so if there are more people out there who got scared to death because they offered you abortion because they determined that your baby will have a birth defect if so shouldn't they stop doing the level three screening it caused me more stress and heartache during my pregnancy for nothing pretty common it seems the reason they do the test is to avoid being sued by parents who would have had the abortion if they knew the baby was going to be malformed or diseased problem is that the tests can be wrong i can't imagine the kind of parent who would have an abortion because of a faulty test but i know it happens and there are also people who sue because they weren't given the opportunity to terminate their baby er pregnancy beforehand this is a perfect example of parents needing to be smart consumers which is definitely not supported in the u s we're supposed to listen to doctors as if they were gods even if they are wrong and or may cause harm to us or our babies i do not believe that most tests done during pregnancy should be done unless there is reason to believe that a problem exists or such a problem exists in the family already i personally think it is horrible to selectively abort fetuses that might show signs of a problem and i definitely think that any signs of problems should be followed up with subsequent testing before resorting to termination of the pregnancy i think it's hideous to suggest abortions for non life threatening disorders how does a parent avoid this be a smart consumer choose your care provider carefully and learn about the various procedures before you are faced with them choose what you want to be done during your pregnancy birth and beyond don't just trust some doctor who cares more about her malpractice insurance claims and how to avoid them than about her patients find out your doctor's schedule of tests routine birth procedures cesarean rates and other birth philosophies before you go into the delivery room with them Abortion debate Prenatal diagnosis Childbirth Obstetrics Turner syndrome Abortion in the United States Cytomegalovirus Cephalic disorder Cystic fibrosis Diabetes mellitus Breastfeeding Health insurance Coeliac disease Down syndrome Prostate cancer Partial-birth abortion Pregnancy Dissociative identity disorder Congenital disorder Roe v.
