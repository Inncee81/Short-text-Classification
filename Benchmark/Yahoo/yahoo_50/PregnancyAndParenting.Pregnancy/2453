implications of posterior cervix will it make labor harder both a nurse and my ob mentioned this during regular checks and i never thought to ask what the implications would be now i am curious to see if anyone knows before my next appointment on tuesday i assume that this means that my cervix is facing my back but since it will be expanding to cm i can't see that it will make a difference during the delivery itself but if it means that i am in for big time back labor or high pain levels i would rather know now and be ready for it the cervix changes in consistency and position towards the end of pregnancy and during labour for most of the pregnancy the cervix lies towards the back of the vagina behind the baby's head this is called a 'posterior cervix' and is often hard to reach by the caregiver if they are performing a vaginal examination near the time of labour and or during prelabour and early labour the cervix starts to move towards the front of the baby's head this is known as either a 'central' or 'anterior cervix' depending on how far forward it has moved and can usually be easily felt by the caregiver if being examined the cervix also changes from being very firm and closed during pregnancy to being soft to touch and slightly open just before labour starts the position softness and openness of the cervix are usually assessed by the caregiver to determine what induction method will be used and or whether the induction is likely to succeed a more posterior firmer and closed cervix has a higher chance of not responding to the induction meaning the induction is not successful and a caesarean may be needed if this is the case the caregiver may utilise various methods to 'ripen the cervix' before inducing the labour taking into consideration that the 'ripening' methods may also produce unwanted side effects in some cases the methods used to ripen the cervix will also succeed in inducing the labour Childbirth Obstetrics Breech birth Fertility awareness Pregnancy Abortion Intact dilation and extraction Strap-on dildo Premature birth Miscarriage Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual intercourse Menstrual cycle Caesarean section Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Anatomical terms of location Menstrual cup Volleyball Intersex surgery Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Ectopic pregnancy Induction (birth) Labour economics Cervical cancer Electric motor Gonorrhoea Sexual reproduction Maxilla Mattress Colposcopy Placenta praevia Vagina Birth control Abortion debate Bayesian inference Palatine bone Fast bowling Condom Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infantilism Butterfly stroke Equine conformation Skateboarding trick Humerus Puberty Monopsony Autopsy Endometrial cancer Microeconomics Principal-agent problem Aerial (dance move) Car handling Breaststroke Oral sex Elbow-joint Poker jargon Mandible Cephalic disorder Explosive material Urinary incontinence Sphenoid bone Professional wrestling holds Birth weight Tofu Clinical depression Erogenous zone Scientific method Entropy Milton H.
