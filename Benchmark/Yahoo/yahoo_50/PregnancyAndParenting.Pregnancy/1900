anyone play music for their baby while pregnant hi all i'm weeks pregnant and recently started playing music putting speakers up to my belly for my baby has anyone done this and notice that music now soothes the baby once born or perhaps you've noticed another reaction to music once the baby was born just curious thanks i played music and danced when i was pregnant and sang a lot too i don't know if this is related but both of my toddlers love music now and both have a good ear for music although i think that might be more genetic i played the same tapes for them to fall asleep to as babies that i played while they were in the womb they love those tapes Diana Ross Abortion debate Breastfeeding Jennifer Lopez Britney Spears Prenatal diagnosis EastEnders Knots Landing The Sims 2 Kurt Cobain Mixtape Whitney Houston M__ori language Charmed Cher (entertainer) Stuttering Pregnancy Remix Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Miscarriage C__line Dion Ray Charles Hair (musical) Journey (band) The Beatles discography Empire Burlesque Neighbours Hall & Oates Achtung Baby Video game music Care Bears In vitro fertilisation The Inside Theatre The McGuire Sisters Rod Stewart T.A.T.u.
