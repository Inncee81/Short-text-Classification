what do men mean when they say they want their wives to remain barefoot and pregnant at home my husband said he wanted me to stay barefoot and pregnant at home a couple of weeks ago i laughed it off but thinking back i dont understand why some men say this should i have been offended by this remark is it sexist what does it mean and in which way do men mean to say it please tell me what you all think i also wondered that when i heard nicole kidman said she wanted to be barefoot and pregnant god i think some of your replies have been slightly ott attacking your poor husband i'm sure he didn't mean it in an offensive way some women are so anti men it's untrue wow chill out girls actually i think it sounds quite an endearing term personally like nurturing their offspring going back to the olden days when men did the work but there's nothing sexist and chauvinistic about that more protective and charming you know your hubby so why don't you ask him sure he meant it in a nice way Woman Joke Ocean's Twelve Gender-neutral language Sharon Tate Lucille Ball Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infidels Gender role Lauren Bacall Pregnancy Married... with Children EastEnders Characters of Lost Sexism Political correctness Humphrey Bogart Phoebe Halliwell God and gender One Tree Hill (TV series) Fiddler on the Roof Paul Is Dead Rosa Parks Nicole Kidman Anne Boleyn Domestic violence AFI 100 Years series The Shining (film) Knots Landing Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Friends Satan Marriage Days of our Lives The Inside Trapped in the Closet Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Alois Hitler Babe Ruth Haven (TNG episode) Social rule Rais massacre Singlish George Burns Oral sex Tom Cruise Misogyny Little Britain The Jazz Singer Slow Train Coming God Emperor of Dune Opus Dei Dawson's Creek Time Out of Mind Leo Wyatt Avenue Q Eddie Guerrero R.
