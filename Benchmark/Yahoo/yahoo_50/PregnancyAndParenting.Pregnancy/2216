help group b strep i have just been told i test positive for this the midwife said she can give me a leaflet on monday but it will probably scare me to death any ideas why that is what is group b strep and whaty are the implications for me and my baby im weeks group b strep is a bacterium that lives on people's bodies it is incredibly common this will not hurt you at all when they tell you that you are positive for this it means that it is living in your vagina the concern is that the baby will get this bacterium on the way out of your body babies who get this can develop some serious infections that cause them problems so when you go into labor they give you an iv and doses of antibiotic this is for the baby you pass the antibiotic to the baby so that the baby can resist the infection the antibiotic is given every four hours usually and they need to get two doses into you don't panic it will be okay if you were hoping to avoid an iv just tell them that you will get the antibiotic but that you don't want to be hooked up to fluid all the time they can saline lock the iv in between doses so you are not hooked to an iv pole all the time additionally you and the baby are safe from this except for right as the baby is coming out as long as they do not do a bunch of cervical checks on you after your water has broken if they want to check your cervix after your water has broken make sure it is really needed or decline it this will help to protect your baby from infection lots of people are gbs positive i am too it will be okay good luck Group A streptococcal infection Childbirth Gonorrhoea Premature birth Pneumonia Breech birth Anthrax Rheumatic fever Antibiotic resistance Bacteria Dialysis Cervical cancer Common cold Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Clostridium difficile Menstrual cup Breastfeeding Intact dilation and extraction Sexually-transmitted infection Cervix Abortion Cystic fibrosis Urinary incontinence Legionellosis Fertility awareness Tuberculosis Obstetrics Herpes simplex virus Virus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shrimp farm In vitro fertilisation First aid Lyme disease Menstrual cycle Birth control Intravenous therapy Malaria Infectious mononucleosis Foodborne illness Escherichia coli O157:H7 Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cancer Diseases of the honeybee Diarrhea Fancy rat Syphilis Penicillin Staphylococcus aureus Traumatic brain injury Chlorpromazine Medical prescription Streptococcus pneumoniae Gastroenteritis Helicobacter pylori Transmission (medicine) Cytomegalovirus Social rule Chronic fatigue syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Reiter's syndrome Diving Gastroparesis Jon Secada Safe sex Guinea pig Streptococcus Ciprofloxacin Folic acid Hip fracture Cystoscopy Aerial (dance move) Body piercing Phage Chlamydophila pneumoniae Plasmid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diabetes mellitus Multiple sclerosis Turner syndrome Bone marrow transplant Birth weight Immune system Human papillomavirus Epidural Acne Miscarriage Hyperthermia Motility H5N1 Pregnancy Comanche Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Dysentery Midwifery Extreme Programming Agar plate Chemotherapy
