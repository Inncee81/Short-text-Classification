really need an ansswer please scared july th july th date of last period july th sex condom broke around o'clock hours later took the plan b emergency contraceptive pill august nd began spotting i guessed a result of the pill for about days today august th my boyfriend and i had sex with a condom and in about minute he pulled out because there was bloood on the condom it was red and when i wiped pinkish it's scaring the crap out of me i don't have any more blood coming out but don't understand what happend please tell me what's going on i thought it might be my period but doesn't look like that i m all alone at the moment and have no way to get to the doctors so hoping someone could tell me what's going on i also took a pregnancy test today days before my missed period i know it's early but i just wanted a piece of mind btw when i had sex and the condom broke he ejaculated outside of me so the chances are so small is this normal no big deal happened to me a few times when i thought my period was over but apparantly it wasnt im guessing your particular situation is because your cycle is screwed up now after having taken emergency contraception it'll take a month or two to get back to normal cycles the cervix acts as a sponge so even when you think you're finished with your period the cervix can hold the blood in there this blood would eventually come out and would be pinkish because it would be mixed with other normal secretions if you're not having pain or stinking then you're fine it's normal becuase of the emerg contraceptive you're most likely not pregnant and you most likely will not have your period in days as you made your body have it early with the emerg contraceptive the first day you started after you took that contraceptive will be day you need to start counting from there Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Birth control Condom Oral contraceptive Sexual intercourse Pregnancy Menstrual cup Safe sex Emergency contraception Sexual abstinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral sex Abortion debate Gonorrhoea Miscarriage Sex education Childbirth Diaphragm (contraceptive) Obstetrics Endometriosis Pornographic movie Intrauterine device Masturbation Neighbours Jon Secada Sexual revolution EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Urinary incontinence Time Out of Mind Prolactinoma Social rule Genital wart Acne Prostate cancer Intact dilation and extraction Puberty Everwood Aliens of London Knots Landing Friends StarCraft: Uprising Orgasm Big Brother UK series 6 Proper Condom Use Abortion Alanis Morissette Cervical cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sleep Caffeine Psoriasis Rape Penis Game show Jam (TV series) Herpes simplex virus AIDS Androgen insensitivity syndrome Professional wrestling match types Twin Sex toy Human papillomavirus Premature ejaculation Cervix Human penis size Breech birth Sharon Tate Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sex and the City The Riordans Sexual dysfunction Diabetic retinopathy Triage Depo Provera Apollo 8 Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Tocopherol Old wives' tale Blood on the Tracks Julian day The Inside Target Corporation Ectopic pregnancy Extreme Programming The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Stroke Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Red Vs.
