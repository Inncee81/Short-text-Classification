miscarriage question now please don't think i'm some naive child but i do have a couple questions that i should probably know about two and a half weeks ago i found out that i was pregnant with my second child from the beginning things were a lot different in this pregnancy than with my first i was never sick with my first and i couldnt keep anything in me with this one about four or five days ago i started 'spotting' i looked it up and it said that a dark brown or rust like color was normal in some pregnancies so i didn't worry about it i chalked it up to just another difference between me two pregnancies well two days ago the brown started turning more and more red but it was sporatic and i didn't fuss over it then yesterday in the shower it was like a scene from carrie as if i was having my period and it's been like that since now i thought that i may have heard of women having their period while pregnant but i am not sure if i am correct now is this possible to have your period during pregnancy or is this something much more serious now if this is a miscarriage yes i am in denial looking for any other thing that it could be what would be next i mean obviously i have to go see a doctor but what is they do will they have to extract the baby or is that something that happens naturally during a miscarriage i'm sorry if i seem so stupid in this department i have just never had to deal with something like this sorry but another question they just keep popping up if it is a miscarriage how long before i can take another pregnancy test and it would tell me that i am not pregnant i think that's the only way that i would believe it i would be going to the doctor's office right away perhaps even an emergency department you may be having a miscarriage sorry to give bad news but there should be no bright red bleeding during pregnancy you cannot wait for these things to sort themselves out get medical attention right away and put your own mind at ease if not for anything else good luck to you Pregnancy Miscarriage Obstetrics Childbirth Abortion EastEnders Social rule Abortion debate Sharon Tate Folic acid Theory of conduct Menstrual cycle Time Out of Mind Abortion in the United States Intact dilation and extraction Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Neighbours Premature birth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Spina bifida Morning sickness Friends Fertility awareness Knots Landing The Inside Elvis and Me Coeliac disease Marilyn Monroe Big Brother UK series 6 In vitro fertilisation Melanie Wilkes Partial-birth abortion Humphrey Bogart Twin Blood on the Tracks Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Milton H.
