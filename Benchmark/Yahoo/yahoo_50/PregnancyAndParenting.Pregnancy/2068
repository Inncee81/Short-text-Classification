i'm so confused ok i went to the er b c i was having stomach pains the doc told me i was pregnant he said my urine test was positive but then he said my blood one was neg is there still a chance that i may be yes you can still be pregnant you may be just barely pregnant right now or unfortunately you may be pregnant but your levels are dropping already which means you could be having a miscarriage your doctor should have set you up for another apointment to see him in a week to re test if not take a home test again in three to five days and if it still says pregnant go back to the doctor or even a different doctor and have a blood test done again best wishes Pregnancy Obstetrics Miscarriage Pregnancy test Prostate cancer Cytomegalovirus Stomach cancer HIV test Fertility awareness The Venture Bros.
