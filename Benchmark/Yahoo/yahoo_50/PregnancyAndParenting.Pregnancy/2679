stressful day i have had an abnormally stressful day no need in going into details it's amazing how many details there are i was just wondering if any of you ladies have ever felt guilty about letting things get to you while pregnant i mean i know that it is bad for me and i am normally fairly stress free and try to keep my life that way but today wow i was a non stop stress magnet i guess i am just concerned about the baby as always do you think that one huge stressful day could cause harm to the fetus i feel like a jerk for letting things get to me remember that the chemical change in your body when stressed can affect the baby they even say that our personality determines what the childs will be while in the womb i was in a terrible work environment with my nd child and inquired about this with my ob and she said it's highly unlikely to affect the fetus especially if it's intermittent stress she also advised that i find ways to unwind or even nip it in the bud before it gets to a stressful situation it can be so difficult i know some days you wish you had a rock to crawl under i used to keep calming scents around me lavender especially or any scent that makes you happy i would just breathe it in and say a prayer to help me deal with whatever in the best way it always worked for me if i had to speak up about something at work i would do so then i'd make the moment light by saying girl my hormones are going crazy today they'd laugh but they got my point my year old boy now shows no symptoms of my stresses when i was pregnant with him he's a very happy playful and carefree little guy Abortion debate Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia Infantilism Pregnancy Autism Menstrual cycle Clinical depression Miscarriage Abortion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Obstetrics Theory of conduct Anne Boleyn Meditation Biology and sexual orientation Jon Secada Phoebe Buffay's songs Premature birth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cytomegalovirus Fetus The Venture Bros.
