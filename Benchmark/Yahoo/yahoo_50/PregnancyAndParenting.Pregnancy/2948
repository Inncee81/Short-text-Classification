weeks pregnant and an emotional wreck is anybody else feeling that emotional in the last month i know i'm not due for another week and a half but i'm so sick of being pregnant being in pain and in general an emotional roller coaster i just want people to leave me alone i can't sleep more than hours a day and i work so i can't take naps during the day i have these spurts of energy that seem more like emotional rides of tension than anything else i just want to take my baby home in my arms not carry her around in my stomach i want to feel normal again i was terrified of childbirth before and during the early part of my pregnancy but now i just wake up every morning and pray for it to be over am i alone in feeling this way i would have loved to take maternity leave but its only half pay from the time i give birth i don't have enough time saved due to doctors appts and other problems during the pregnancy sciatic exhaustion mental days haha i wish i could stay home hey there no you are not alone i was just going to write a similar post actually when i saw yours i am currently weeks and days pregnant and cannot wait for it to be over i dont get those women who say that they just loved being pregnant i can barely do anything without getting exhausted and feeling as if my body is going to fall apart with aches and pains i also have a nebby neighbor that feels she always has to tell me she thinks im having twins and she spread this rumor around my neighborhood too i actually had people ask me how they were doing she also has been saying that being pregnant is the easiest way to carry the baby shes been doing this for months now and i finally snapped at her and told her that if she says it again im going to kill her i also wake up every day wondering if today will be the day it just seems like every day is dragging out as slow as it possibly can then i start wondering if im going to end up going past my due date by a week or two which would really really be aweful at this point i cant sleep well at night and im exhausted during the day but bored at the same time last week i was about cm dilated and i have my next appt this thursday so they better give me some good news i think i will freak out if they say im still at cm i also get excruciating pain right above my pubic bone when the baby moves i guess its her head or something pushing and rubbing on my bone and it causes me to lose my breath cringe in pain and stop moving of course its accompanied by a low backache as well i just want to be able to exercise or take a walk around the neighborhood but i physically cant i think its just worse for me mentally because i am used to being a very physical and active person i used to be a dancer im also just impatient in general and like to be busy anyway while im still hoping that she comes asap im still terrified of what labor and delivery will be like Childbirth Pregnancy Obstetrics EastEnders Knots Landing Days of our Lives Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Urinary incontinence Abortion Breech birth The Amber Spyglass Friends Humphrey Bogart Premature birth Equine conformation The Contender (television series) Charmed Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Sin City Puberty Futurama (TV series - season 5) Aerial (dance move) Social rule Night (book) Intact dilation and extraction The Lovely Bones Abortion in the United States One Life to Live Fertility awareness Anxiety Chronic fatigue syndrome Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Rosa Parks Clinical depression Stomach cancer Stuttering Marilyn Monroe Jon Secada Professional wrestling holds Prostate cancer Shaggy dog story The Inside Milton H.
