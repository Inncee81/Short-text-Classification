best way to relax during pregnancy i am weeks pregnant and got into a slight arguement with my husband i thought that writing how i felt down in my journal would help but it didn't what is the best way to feel calm and stress free over something like that he never appologizes when it's his fault i am always the one to appologize i am nauseated right now because i am worried i'd talk to him but he is at work what can i do to relieve being upset until he gets home also i live with my mother in law who is a smoker i am allergic to it and have had the same headache for days how can i prevent other's second hand smoke from hurting me or my child there is nothing that will make u feel better until u actually want to u r upset n home alone so the thought keeps coming to ur head n u keep thinking over n over n get more upset which is not good for ur or the baby right now do something that u enjoy like watch movies listen to music read call a friend shop whatever keeps ur mind occupied n when ur husband comes home from work talk to him clearly n openly n resolve the matter its not good for ur health to stay upset during these days Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fancy Crane EastEnders Tobacco smoking Humphrey Bogart Jam (TV series) Pregnancy Kodocha Medical cannabis Clinical depression The Ashlee Simpson Show Melanie Wilkes Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Social rule Days of our Lives Cannabis (drug) Knots Landing Obstetrics Hollyoaks Milton H.
