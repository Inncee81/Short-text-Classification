epidural info i'm going into hospital later on today to be induced as my babys is days late and still not budging with my first dayght i was i serious pain when i was giving birth and i ripped quite bad i didn't have any pain relief i'm considering an epidural this time around as the baby is three weeks older that what my daughter was when i gave birth to her and i'm guessing this baby is going to be big as it's also a boy could you please give me some infomation on having an epidural like the effects good and bad points and how the procedure is done thanks an epidural it basically an injection into the small of your back using a curved hollow needle the needle goes between the vertebrae of your back and into the space outside the coverings that surround your spinal cord a fine tube is passed through the needle and then the needle is removed the tube is taped up your back and over your shoulder the anaesthetist injects a local anaesthetic similar to what you would have at the dentist into the tube to numb the lower part of your abdomen generally your legs and feet go numb as well you can't feel your contractions any longer sometimes the tube is attached to a small pump which allows you to control how much local anaesthetic you have or the pump may be primed to release a small dose of the anaesthetic every so many minutes it works in just the same way as a local anaesthetic works when the dentist numbs your mouth before extracting a tooth the anaesthetic deadens the nerves which are carrying pain signals from your womb and cervix theoretically you could have an epidural at any point in labour even in the second stage when you are pushing your baby out although a spinal anaesthetic would probably be offered in that situation most people however choose to have an epidural when the cervix is about five to six centimetres dilated and the contractions are getting pretty strong if you are as much as eight or nine centimetres dilated your midwife might say that it's too late for an epidural and advise you to manage without because your baby should be born soon what are the advantages of epidurals more than of women get complete pain relief your mind remains totally clear can help to control high blood pressure can put you back in control of your labour and restore your confidence epidurals are more sophisticated than they used to be and you might find that your legs and feet are not completely numb what are the disadvantages may find that you are numb down only one side of your body or that a small part of your tummy has not been anaesthetised may make you feel very shivery you have to stay in bed you need to have a drip in your arm this is because epidurals make some women's blood pressure drop which seriously affects the flow of oxygen to the baby the drip is a safety precaution so that in an emergency the volume of your blood can be quickly boosted to bring your blood pressure back to normal again you will probably have a catheter into your bladder an epidural means you can't tell when you need to empty your bladder so this has to be done automatically for you you might feel very out of control you have three tubes going into your body and you have to be told when to push if the anaesthetic hasn't worn off by the second stage of labour your midwife and doctor effectively manage your labour for you epidurals can increase the length of labour especially the pushing stage as you can't feel anything so struggle to push your baby's heartbeat will be monitored continuously using a transducer strapped to your abdomen or a smaller transducer clipped onto his scalp there's a greater chance of needing to have a forceps or ventouse delivery because epidurals often prevent the baby moving into the best position to be born if the epidural needle goes beyond the epidural space there will be a leakage of cerebro spinal fluid after the tube is taken out this fluid buffers your brain and even a very small leak will give you a terrific headache this is usually treated by taking a small amount of blood from your arm perhaps the day after your baby is born and injecting it into your back to seal the hole made by the epidural needle some women have problems passing urine after having an epidural you might not be able to have an epidural not every hospital in england and wales offers a hour epidural service rates
