last weeks of pregnancy worries ok ladies i am weeks pregnant i am starting to get a little bit worried about how everything is going to go this is my first baby and i'm not sure what to expect i mean i have read books talked to my doctor and he has even given me things to read so i know what to expect i guess what i'm looking for is some encouragment and reassuring stories i mean i'm so looking forward to having my new baby boy so just kinda nervous about how much this will hurt me and if everything will go okay so far my pregnancy has been very good not too much uncomfort and the doc says that everything is going really good so ladies and mothers help me to understand more of what is to come what to expect and how to tell when labor is close and when in true labor thanks in advance when the contraction's come a few minute's a part is when you should expect any minute the pain will be great there is no way around that but here's the secret dont allow your self to give into the pain dont go free control it use your mind and keep focussed when you get a wave of pain breath calm tightened up your grip on what ever it is your holding on to when the doctor say's dont push then dont when he say's push then do it make's sence right but when the pain hit's you just want it out and will do what you have to do it so that's why i tell you to remember that push when your suppose to and hold when your suppose to this is when it is time this may sound gross but this is the way it is it happen with all of my darling's when it's time for you to start pushing is when you feel like your about to go poop you get alot of pressure there in the anas it will feel just like your going to take a huge poop when that happen's it's time with the concentration thing if you need for other's to leave the room to help you concentrate through the contraction's then so be it they can reenter when your pushing open your leg's wide up and wide if you clench the harder it will be for the baby to sqeeze out well good luck mona Childbirth Jon Secada Professional wrestling holds Milton H.
