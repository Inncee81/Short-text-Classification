nutrition while pregnant i'm pregnant my prenatal pill has mg of calcium and i know i need to have milk yogurt etc throughout the day however its tough for me to get all mg recommended for pregnancy so i bought a separate calcium citrate supplement for the days i know i need an extra boost its only the calcium part there was another option that came with some vitamin d magnesium and something else it led me to believe that these others may help for optimum digestion so i'm wondering should i be ok with my pure calcium citrate since i'm not depending on it or should i get the other one i mentioned bc it really will help with digestion better be extra careful and get good information from reliable sources like http anythingandeverythingjasmine blogspot com peace Milk Folic acid Guinea pig Veganism Nutrition Vitamin D Soybean Osteoporosis Dietary fiber Tocopherol Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Breastfeeding Vitamin C Gastroesophageal reflux disease Omega-3 fatty acid Vegetarian nutrition Magnesium Fecal incontinence Obstetrics Garlic Food E number Hypomagnesemia Calcium Coeliac disease Psoriasis Vegetarianism Fertility awareness Infant formula Tofu Carnivorous plant Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bacteria Prenatal diagnosis Cheese Protein Lactobacillus acidophilus Pregnancy Sildenafil Pasteurization Cystic fibrosis Dietary supplement Soy milk Prenatal care Pharmacology Hard water Laxative Iron Kidney stone Lactose intolerance Prolactinoma Oily fish Domestic rabbit Dairy Tooth Egg (food) Twin Organic food Schizophrenia Chicken soup Edible salt Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Elephant Bodybuilding Calcium in biology Common bean Anorexia nervosa Coffee Water purification Premature birth Yoghurt Garnet Cauliflower HyperText Transfer Protocol Premature ventricular contraction Cytomegalovirus Abortion Breast milk Isotretinoin Midwifery Soy protein Food guide pyramid Long-term potentiation Citric acid Hypoparathyroidism Short bowel syndrome Protein-energy malnutrition Pet skunk Dietary mineral Hydrochloric acid Aluminium Spina bifida Cat Calcium hydroxide Oral contraceptive Insulin Calcium metabolism Hamster Sugar beet
