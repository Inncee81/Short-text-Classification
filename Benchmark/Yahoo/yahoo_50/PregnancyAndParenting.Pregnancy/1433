has anyone ever had a vbac my son's birth was not the picture perfect birth i had expected i went into labor naturally and while in the hospital i dilated to cm but i had to have an emergency c section because his heart rate kept dropping and i had been in labor a long time i was very frustrated scarred and sad i was wheeled into an operated room where i was cut open and i didn't even get to kiss my baby after he was delivered i still feel cheated i wanted to give birth the natural way is it possible i know it works if i gave birth vaginal then a c section with the last one hi you can have a virginal birth but there are risks associated with it i had a emergency c section years ago and i now have the choice to deliver by c section or natural i am choosing c section cause there is a possibility your scar from the c section can rupture and baby can die during delivery i think the stats are in or in but i probably would be the unlucky one that it happened to i couldnt cope with carrying a baby for months then for it to die and birth and know that i could have prevented it anyway that was my choice you can still deliver naturally if you feel comfortable with it i would speak to your doctor and get them to explain the benefits of both so you can make a proper decision i do understand you dont get to bond with baby straight away i got to kiss my baby and then i fell asleep cause my labour was hours so when i woke up i was with my hubby and baby Childbirth Miscarriage Pregnancy Partial-birth abortion Abortion debate Premature birth Humphrey Bogart Abortion Intact dilation and extraction Prostate cancer EastEnders Abortion in the United States Kodocha Androgen insensitivity syndrome Herpes simplex virus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Menstrual cup Shaggy dog story Gettysburg Address The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Days of our Lives Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Labour economics Urinary incontinence Fertility awareness Gonorrhoea Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Knots Landing Stroke Strap-on dildo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Charmed Hillary Rodham Clinton Airbus A380 Oral contraceptive Melanie Wilkes Time Out of Mind Birth control Characters in the Smurfs One Life to Live The Amber Spyglass Female genital cutting Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Left-handed Coeliac disease Neighbours History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Labor theory of value Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Ayyavazhi mythology Adoption Episiotomy Social Security (United States) Prisoner's dilemma Microeconomics Traumatic brain injury Characters of Lost Unemployment Circumcision The Empty Child In vitro fertilisation Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Intersex surgery Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Free will Turner syndrome Induction (birth) Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Milton H.
