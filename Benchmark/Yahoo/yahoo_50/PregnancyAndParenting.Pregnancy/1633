i broke up with my pregnant girlfriend when my girlfriend was months pregnant i dumped her i was fresh out of college and scared so i bailed i told her i would support her through the pregnancy but she refused two weeks later i started dating another girl my current gf and i guess that made her more mad its been two years since my son was born and she's still bitter and interfering with my relationship with him how do i convince her to get over it already i know i probably didn't handle situation the best but it's been almost two years i just want to see my son without problems and yes i do pay child support umm wow thats tough well first off i think its great that even after you broke up with her you made an attempt to support her during the pregnancy not many guys would do that i would ask her to lunch and then discuss it there explain to her that you were scared and that you love the child tell her that eventhough it didnt work out for the two of you a baby did come out of the relationship and its not the childs fault that things didnt work out with you guys so dont punish the child by not having a father figure around in his life try to make peace with her no matter how hard it is because a child not having both parents around really hurts them in the end good luck edit you people that are answering dont understand the question he's trying to have a relationship with his son just because his relationship didnt work out with his gf doesnt mean that he abandoned the child EastEnders Kodocha Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Everwood Atomic Kitten Pitaten Sharon Tate Days of our Lives Neighbours Abortion debate History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Hollyoaks Avenue Q Boston Public Recurring South Park characters Sex and the City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Saved by the Bell Transactional analysis Dead Like Me Teenage pregnancy Melanie Wilkes Theory of conduct Jennifer Lopez Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charmed The Critic The Smoking Room Glen Jacobs One Life to Live Justification (theology) Kate Vaiden Maison Ikkoku Theodicy Kyle Broflovski Moral Politics Ludwig Wittgenstein About a Boy Butters Stotch Vernon Schillinger Virgin Mary in Islam Mary Jane Watson Incarnations of Immortality Abortion Sex education Ron and Fez Extreme Programming Babe Carey George Costanza Plame affair Oh My Goddess!
