birth control anit biotics a friend of mine told me that if you take anitbiotics while on birth control it makes your birth control not work anymore is that true and if so does it make it as if you didn't take any pills or does it just make you a little bit more likely to get pregnant sorry if that was confusing im already weeks preg just curious to if that was true or not thanks for all your help yes it is true the antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of the birth control pill thereby increasing the chances of getting pregnant one should use an alternative method of birth control while on the antibiotic in order to prevent pregnancy any questions should be directed to the gyn or pharmacist hope this helps and good luck with your pregnancy Oral contraceptive Birth control Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Abortion debate Folic acid Acne Depo Provera Isotretinoin Pregnancy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Abortion Obstetrics Tocopherol Guinea pig Maprotiline EastEnders Sex education Premature birth Sexual abstinence Miscarriage Endometriosis Elvis and Me Gonorrhoea Hypertension Spina bifida Antibiotic resistance Abortion in the United States Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) In vitro fertilisation Knots Landing Ectopic pregnancy Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Urinary incontinence Medical prescription Twin Midwifery Childbirth Antibiotic Pneumonia Syphilis Turner syndrome Caffeine Morning sickness Sulfonylurea Safe sex Progesterone Prenatal diagnosis Clinical depression Rocky Mountain spotted fever Tooth enamel Antidepressant Neighbours Scarlet Witch Lucille Ball Thalidomide History of sex Sharon Tate Darth Vader Roe v.
