curious to know weeks pregnant i went to the er the other day bc i was in an auto accident i am wks preg the lap belt that went across my lower abdomen caused some achy crampy feeling no bleeding or leaking so we went to the er got checked out everything's fine i was curious though because when the resident set me up to monitor for contractions she said that if i did start with contractions that they wouldn't be able to do anything meaning that they would have to deliver the baby that wouldn't survive at the time i completely dismissed this as it was a worst case scenerio that i wouldn't let happen naive i know but you pregnant ladies would feel the same anyway i've read jenny mccarthy's book belly laughs where she said that she went into early labor at weeks with full blown contractions and they were able to give her something to stop the contractions why wouldn't they be able to stop my contractions did anyone go into early labor and they were able to stop your contractions lisa ahhh i think you're right and i interpreted it wrong i just haven't been able to stop thinking about what the resident said since leaving i misinterpreted props to you thanks i do not think that the resident ment to say that there would be nothing they can do about it he probably ment that they can not stop them from happening there is nothing to make sure that you wont have contractions but once they start there is meds to try to make them stop Pregnancy Friends Premature birth Childbirth Charmed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Montreal Screwjob Kodocha Miscarriage EastEnders Abortion Obstetrics Marilyn Monroe One Tree Hill (TV series) John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Major League Baseball television contracts Knots Landing Poker jargon Debugging Breech birth Three Stooges Jon Secada Urinary incontinence Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Good Times Rais massacre Plame affair Milton H.
