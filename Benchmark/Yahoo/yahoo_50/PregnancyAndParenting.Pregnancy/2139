please help hcg my hcg was approximately a day after i should have started my period i'm arguing with my ob gyn husband who thinks that's too low anyone had an hcg count that low without worries you'd think that being married to an ob gyn would make it easier but it doesn't i'm sure he just doesn't want my hopes up too high we've had a couple miscarriages any positive comments however would help a lot i have a little positive comment for you i tested days after my missed period and went to the doctor the next day for confirmation when she did an ultrasound she didn't see anything at all so she sent me down for bloodwork and a better ultrasound in radiology the radiologist didn't see anything either however when i got back to the exam room the doctor had my lab results back and my hcg level was in the 's she told me it was one of three things really early pregnancy miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy so i went back in two days for another blood test and my levels had gone up to i was indeed pregnant and only weeks along which is why they didn't see anything in the ultrasound so don't get discouraged that hcg level sounds about right for one day after your missed period wait and see what the next hcg level is good luck Miscarriage Pregnancy test Pregnancy Obstetrics Cryptorchidism Abortion Prostate cancer Prenatal diagnosis Medicine Menstrual cycle Ultrasound Radiology Prenatal care Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ectopic pregnancy HIV test Drug test Antiphospholipid syndrome Twin Friends Abortion debate Social rule Marilyn Monroe Medical ultrasonography Hypertension Hepatitis Big Brother UK series 6 EastEnders Prolactinoma Gonorrhoea The Inside Sharon Tate Stillbirth Theory of conduct Fertility awareness Time Out of Mind Morning sickness Urinary incontinence Breech birth Neighbours Blood on the Tracks Phoebe Halliwell Gynecologic hemorrhage Pitaten Polycystic ovary syndrome Folic acid Endometriosis Coeliac disease One Tree Hill (TV series) Mammography Stroke Chiropractic Vaginal bleeding Cytomegalovirus Knots Landing Habitual abortion Spina bifida Pelvic inflammatory disease Lucille Ball Sophie, Countess of Wessex Turner syndrome Humphrey Bogart Ovarian cancer Loudspeaker Chemical abortion Philosophical skepticism Coming of Age (TNG episode) Billboard Hot 100 Ben Johnson (athlete) Hydatidiform mole Cephalic disorder Real Love (song) Oral contraceptive Shaggy dog story Extreme Programming Maya calendar Graduate school Blonde on Blonde Insulin Uterine fibroids Deep vein thrombosis Pulmonary embolism Gravis Ultrasound Marriage Childbirth Haven (TNG episode) Abortion in the United States Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sami Brady Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lupus erythematosus Elvis and Me Gynaecology The Star Wars Holiday Special Taken Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist
