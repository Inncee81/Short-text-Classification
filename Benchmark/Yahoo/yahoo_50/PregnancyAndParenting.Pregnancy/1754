weeks pg question ok i had doc appt yesterday and they said i'm cm dialated is that good or not cuz ppl say at weeks they were are cm and i was just wondering its a girl it's not bad it's not good it's just well it's just a number i don't know why some doctors check certainly don't let it worry you either way many people try to use the information that is gathered from a vaginal exam to predict things like when labor will begin or if the baby will fit through the pelvis a vaginal exam simply cannot measure these things okay so there's not really a great reason to have a vaginal in exam done routinely for most women so are there any reasons not to have vaginal exams there sure are vaginal exams can increase the risks of infection even when done carefully and with sterile gloves etc it pushes the normal bacteria found in the vagina upwards towards the cervix there is also increased risk of rupturing the membranes some practitioners routinely do what is called stripping the membranes which simply separates the bag of waters from the cervix the thought behind this is that it will stimulate the production of prostaglandins to help labor begin and irritate the cervix causing it to contract this has not been shown to necessarily be effective and does have the aforementioned risks http pregnancy about com cs interventions a vaginalexam htm Childbirth Breech birth Abortion Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Vagina Cervix Miscarriage Strap-on dildo Cervical cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gynaecology Menstrual cup Prostate cancer Fisting Gonorrhoea Menstrual cycle Androgen insensitivity syndrome Condom Caesarean section Sexual intercourse Herpes simplex virus Intravenous therapy Oral sex Safe sex Medical analysis of circumcision Candidiasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertility awareness Cancer Intersex surgery Endometrial cancer Ectopic pregnancy Orgasm Female genital cutting Douche Oral contraceptive Ovarian cancer In vitro fertilisation Birth control AIDS Psoriasis Inflation Breastfeeding Wound healing phases Turner syndrome Body piercing Coeliac disease Weight training Endometriosis Sexual reproduction Deflation (economics) Epidural Insulin Birth weight HIV Traditional Chinese medicine Vaginal bleeding Child sexuality Sexual dysfunction Prolactinoma Human sexual response cycle Swimming Equine conformation Traumatic brain injury Hepatitis C Action potential Multiple sclerosis Fecal incontinence Epilepsy Tampon Infertility Dyspareunia Dialysis Colorectal cancer Nutrition Myocardial infarction Induction (birth) Economics Paracetamol Cytomegalovirus Coffee Personal lubricant Unemployment Omega-3 fatty acid Acetic acid Hypertension Female reproductive system (human) Misoprostol History of intersex surgery American and British English differences Lupus erythematosus
