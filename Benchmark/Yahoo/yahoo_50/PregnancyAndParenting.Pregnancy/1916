home birth i was wondering if i should have a home birth i really do not like the idea of having an audience when i have a baby i think it should really only be a private experience has anyone here had a home birth and was it better or worse than the hospital homebirths can be wonderful private and empowering experiences are you planning on an unassisted homebirth ot getting a midwife i am considering one myself after a disaster last time in the hospital a cold stupid uncaring doctor no privacy no respect they put a catheter in my without even telling me and a completley unnecessary 'emergency' c section there were doctors and nurses in and out the whole time it was miserable if the only reason you want a homebirth is to avoid an audience however and you still want all the medical benefits see if there is a birthing center or a midwife who will practice in the hospital where you live whatever you do do your research knowledge is power and not just asking people on yahoo what they think though it is a good way to get pointed in the right direction dont listen to the people saying homebirths arent safe as long as you do your research know the warning signs and have an emergency transportation plan your fine good luck and dont let anyone make your choices for you if you ever need anyone to talk to i'm here Midwifery Childbirth Breastfeeding Nurse Health insurance Prostate cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Medicine Medicare (Canada) Breech birth Nursing Psychiatric hospital Alternative medicine National Health Service Traditional Chinese medicine Caesarean section Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Obstetrics Triage Medical record Physical therapy Ariel (Firefly episode) God Emperor of Dune Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia Hospital Adoption Abortion debate Episiotomy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Socrates Mental Health Act 1983 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Intact dilation and extraction Medical prescription Social rule Abortion in the United States Publicly funded medicine Myocardial infarction Premature birth Infantilism Anthroposophy Physician Privacy EastEnders International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Emergency preparedness The Dalek Invasion of Earth Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hypnosis Roe v.
