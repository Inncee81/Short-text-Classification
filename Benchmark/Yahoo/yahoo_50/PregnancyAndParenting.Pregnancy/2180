question about epidural i am planning on getting an epidural and i was wondering if once it starts to wear off if you will feel pain or if you will just be sore from giving birth i have a really bad tolerence to pain im talking i cry when i stub a toe i just was wanting to know what to expect i hope i will be fine with just tyelonol im allergic to codin meds i had an epidural prior to finding out it was going to be an emergency c section epidurals are a god send it was my first child and i was all for the most natural as possible plus i have a high tolerance to pain but labor contractions are a pain like no other once i had it i was pain free the only bad thing is you're forced to lay on your back for about hours until all the feeling comes back into your legs and your uterus is contracting after the birth so that in itself brings on new pain however if having just experienced natural childbirth the uterus contractions should be a walk in the park i would think the only other nerve wracking aspect is you have to sit completely still while they insert the needle into your spine not a problem unless your in labor and contracting sitting still is not an option but by the time the epidural wears off the uterus contractions should be winding down good luck Childbirth Epidural Obstetrics Caesarean section Local anesthesia Urinary incontinence Sciatica Pregnancy Breech birth Miscarriage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic brain injury Muscle Abortion Birth control Breastfeeding Human Back pain Sexual reproduction Equine conformation Lumbar puncture The Amber Spyglass Professional wrestling holds Menstrual cup Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an In vitro fertilisation Simone Weil Goodness and value theory Diving Social rule Theodicy Fecal incontinence Stenberg v.
