d ultrasound i am thinking of having one done in a few weeks have any of you had one done i am curious as to if you thought it was a better experience than the regular d ones weeks pregnant due jan and sooo excited for baby it is absolutely worth it what a wonderful and amazing thing to see i had mine done at weeks normally they want you to wait until after weeks that way the baby has enough fat on its body and it will look closer to what the baby will look like at birth when i went for mine my little guy was putting on quite a show yawning hiding his face with his feet and even blinking the best part was i got to bring my whole family with me to the appointment so everyone got to enjoy seeing him for the first time Pregnancy Breech birth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rod Stewart EastEnders Obstetrics Childbirth Neighbours Prenatal diagnosis Friends W.
