all judgmental people please read i dont get why when someone asks how to check their cervix for dilation and effacement there are people who say you should never check your own cervix and that only a doctor should do it how does that make any sense since when is it harmful for a woman to touch her own body and ok for a total stranger do you people really think that we are more likely to harm ourselves we do have feeling up there if anything woman should be taught how to perform the exams on themselves because i believe they are less likely to hurt themselves this has to be true because when i checked my own it hurt a lot less than when my male doctor performed my exam yes i do agree that women have the right to information on how to examine themselves however that information should only come from a qualified individual like a nurse or doctor if you are not comfortable with a male gynecologist always look for a female one you have every right to prefer a female doctor examining you Medicine Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Physician Prostate cancer Intact dilation and extraction Vagina Nurse Stenberg v.
