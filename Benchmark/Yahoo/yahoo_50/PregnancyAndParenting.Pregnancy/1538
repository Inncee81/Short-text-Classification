real vs false weeks dialted to cm as of yesterday at ob visit late afternoon i started experiencing period like cramps back pain pains radiating into upper legs and slight abdominal tightening this has been going on and off all evening nothing regular but it doesn't go away when i walk or change position i haven't lost my mucous plug yet or at least i didn't lose it all at once and my water hasn't broken or isn't leaking i have been getting contractions since i was about weeks pregnant but nothing quite like this which makes me think this could be real labor i was induced with my first pregnancy at weeks so i don't know what it's like to go into labor naturally just curious if anyone has had similar sypmtoms that turned out to be false labor or if i should start packing my bag just in case ultrasound weeks ago baby was estimated over six pounds i have been measuring big with fundal height for most of the pregnancy lmp dating puts me at weeks but i had irregular cycles so i could be anywhere from to weeks probably closer with baby measurments although the first ultrasound wasn't until around weeks an u s done in the first trimester is much more reliable for dating but i didn't have one done in the first trimester my ob isn't worried about baby being pre term she has given the advice of when contractions are about minutes apart head for the hospital if she was worried about stopping labor at this stage she would have told me to come in a the first sign of labor i would have your bags packed anyway something is definitely happening whether it is real labour or not there is no point in going to hospital until these feelings are regular maybe time each one and see if the feelings get worse longer or closer between each one i had false labour many times with my last son i would get all the feelings you are having now they would even be regular and got worse and then all of a sudden stop it was really annoying actually after about the th day of this i didnt lay down i just kept on walking around to keep them going and that worked for me goodluck i dont think it will be too long though by the way i wouldnt worry about the mucus plug i never lost mine with any of my last pregnancies Childbirth Obstetrics Miscarriage Premature birth Abortion Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Breech birth Knots Landing Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Menstrual cycle Milton H.
