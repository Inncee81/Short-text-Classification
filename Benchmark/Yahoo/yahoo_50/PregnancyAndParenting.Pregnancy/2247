why does everything feels different after a c section i have had once years ago and again years ago much to my deep disappointment i was unable to have natural childbirth for a long time after the first one i was often uncomfortable with the scar because it was so painfully sensitive but at the same time since the nerves and muscles had all been cut for or inches it was almost numb such a strange feeling after the second one the sensitivity was not as pronounced but the numbness continued i have always assumed that it was because of the damage to the nerves i am happy to report that after years the scar is hardly ever annoying or painful good luck Fecal incontinence Female genital cutting Trigeminal neuralgia Carpal tunnel syndrome Epidural Repetitive strain injury Multiple sclerosis Pain Action potential Trigeminal nerve Diabetic neuropathy Orgasm Foreskin restoration Muscle Post-traumatic stress disorder Nerve agent Spina bifida Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Fibromyalgia Childbirth Penis enlargement Erectile dysfunction Equine conformation Self-harm Dualism (philosophy of mind) Sub-Zero Acupuncture Charles Darwin's illness Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Shaggy dog story Traumatic brain injury Scar Arm Intersex surgery Penis Capsaicin Erogenous zone Alexander Technique Goodness and value theory Thoracic outlet syndrome Healing Caesarean section Tetrodotoxin Scorpion Strap-on dildo Paresthesia Post Polio syndrome The Wall Menstrual cup Sciatica Brain Diabetic retinopathy Stroke Tocopherol Neuropathy Milton H.
