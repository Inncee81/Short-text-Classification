pressure when urinating pregnant please give advice i have been having a pressure painful sensation when urinating it is worse at the end to the point where i have to stop and start the flow i have mentioned it several times to my doctor and he checked me for yeast infection bv bladder infection and i don't have any of those he said it probably is just a symptom of the pregnancy and my uterus on my bladder but would it start this early i am just over weeks and this has been a problem for weeks now it is getting very annoying and uncomfortable has anyone else had this happen it is definately not a yeast infection they treated me for it just in case and i still have pressure for some people that pressure can start really early i'm sorry to tell you this but i had it the entire time i thought i was just being a baby about it but come to find out the pressure was due to the fact the baby was in breech position we didn't even know she was breech until my water broke a month early and they did an ultrasound hopefully yours won't be breech hopefully it's just the position she chose to be in in your uterus if the baby implants closer to your bladder it can create more pressure Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Childbirth Abortion Prostate cancer Miscarriage Endometriosis Spina bifida Menstrual cycle Breech birth Gonorrhoea Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Premature birth Coeliac disease Guinea pig Psoriasis Traumatic brain injury Ectopic pregnancy Breastfeeding Urinary tract infection Intact dilation and extraction In vitro fertilisation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prenatal diagnosis Diabetic retinopathy Penis Chlamydia Intersex surgery Urination Radiation therapy Endometrial cancer Kidney Cystoscopy Uterus Hip fracture Menstrual cup Fertility awareness Ovarian cancer Hypertension Multiple sclerosis Cytomegalovirus Candidiasis Medicine Cervical cancer Friends Turner syndrome Oral contraceptive Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Herpes simplex virus Birth weight Schistosomiasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Medical analysis of circumcision Prolactinoma Folic acid Cirrhosis Cerebral palsy Toxoplasmosis Doxepin Tobacco smoking Autoimmune diseases Abortion debate EastEnders Syringomyelia Shock Lupus erythematosus HIV test Breast cancer Diabetic neuropathy Caesarean section Knots Landing Diaper Placenta praevia Infertility Psychosis Genital wart Maprotiline Androgen insensitivity syndrome Kidney stone Female genital cutting Dialysis Hyperglycemia Insulin Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Brewery Fibromyalgia Sexual intercourse Theory of conduct Birth control Group A streptococcal infection Dehydration Leptospirosis Benign prostatic hyperplasia
