why are people like this and yes i want answers from people who act like this too just because a person gets the medicaid card or wic does not mean that they are sitting at home doing nothing in most cases it means that the person works but doesn't have insurance or is under the income guidelines and then why shouldn't they get the assistance guess what you would still have to pay the same amount of taxes whether or not they offered this a lot of people can't afford the expense of health care instead of harassing these people and being rude why aren't you out there trying to make our health care system better like that of canada's you realize that it is not just women with children or pregnant women that receive services what about all the older people out there that use aid and foodstamps are you rude to them too you should consider yourselves lucky to have a great job and health insurance not everyone has that luxury those of us who are educated and work hard and still can't make enough money get very upset when we see women with children buying junk food with their food stamps or going to the doctor for free i know this is not always the case but for those of us getting screwed over they're the situations that stick with us and make us upset i graduated from college in and have been working in my field since when i first got an internship i have always been employed until recently i did not have health insurance ever only recently did i move to a smaller town and start a job with benefits the truth is if i chose to be a single mother instead of going to college i would be receiving financial assistance but because i made all the right decisions i'm penalized for it i have no credit card debt and have never owed a car newer than years old so it's not like i'm wasting my money but when i applied for food stamps and medical assistance i was denied Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Medicare (Canada) Life insurance Unemployment Microeconomics Economy of the United States Social Security (United States) Health care in the United States Credit card Taxation in the United States Barbara Boxer Student loan Flat tax Personal finance Medicare (United States) Food Stamp Program Education in the United States Canadian and American health care systems compared Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Medicaid Social security Child support Health maintenance organization Education in Germany Centrelink National Insurance Government debt Theory of conduct Supply and demand Money Legal aspects of transsexualism Social rule Health savings account Contract Freeters FairTax Bond Poker jargon Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Wal-Mart Arguments for and against drug prohibition Mortgage Chinese University of Hong Kong Spam (electronic) United States Postal Service Education in the People's Republic of China Canada Health Act 401(k) Professor Warren Buffett Social welfare Breastfeeding Minimum wage Bill Bradley United Kingdom corporation tax Capitalism Mother Teresa Graduate school Health care in Canada $ale of the Century Roe v.
