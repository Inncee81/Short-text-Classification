extremely itchy stomach i am weeks now and i feel fine except within the last week or so i've developed a rash on my stomach and it itches non stop i know all about cholestasis and have asked my doctor she says it just sounds like an allergic reaction to something like my cocoa butter lotion which i've stopped using i tried taking mg of benedryl last night and that knocked me out for about an hour and then i was awake again scratching the only way i can fall asleep is to using wet towels on my stomach which eventually dry and then i'm awake again my stomach also has a sore feeling but i think that's just my skin from all the scratching i don't know what else i can do but this is driving me crazy please help has anyone else gone through this and what have you done to relieve the itching have you tried benedryl cream or any other antihistimine cream i can't believe the doctor didn't suggest something or give your something for it vitamin e oil might help as well and has the extra benefit of fighting stretch marks also soaking in a warm tub with oatmeal might help relieve the itch put about a cup of uncooked oatmeal in cheese cloth or a jcloth tie it shut then when it is all mushy in the tub rub it over the rash it should relieve the itch make sure the bath isn't too hot or it will dry out your skin even more remember this when your baby has chicken pox worked like a charm on mine i had that rash when i was pregnant too remember how itchy it was although i had it on my thighs mostly Eczema Stomach cancer Psoriasis Urticaria Scabies Fecal incontinence Chickenpox Allergy Tofu Conjunctivitis Cephalexin Massage Tattoo Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Yarrow Marilyn Monroe Manicure Cheese Itch Jewish cuisine Breastfeeding The Star Wars Holiday Special Cat Chicken Mattress Sulfasalazine Sauna Diaper Group A streptococcal infection Common cold Rash Textile manufacturing Coeliac disease Prostate cancer Chocolate Jam (TV series) Tocopherol Menstrual cup Shaggy dog story Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Shining (film) Breakfast Scar Spidey Super Stories Jackass: The Movie Doxepin Towel Aerial (dance move) Knots Landing Sunburn Menstrual cycle Trazodone Haggis Jock itch Herpes simplex virus Casting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Joke Comanche Social rule Otitis externa Acne Coffee Oatmeal Have I Got News For You Porridge Syphilis Treehouse of Horror IX Bedbug Mosquito Douglas Adams Paroxetine Hypothermia Flea Dandruff Peanut Sharon Tate YuYu Hakusho Drowning Genericized trademark Garlic Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Childbirth Pregnancy Ron and Fez Milk Chlorpromazine Smallpox Curry Cocoa Futurama (TV series - season 5) Boom Town (Doctor Who)
