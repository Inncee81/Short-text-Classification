pull out method basically day tomorrow are my most fertile days of the month my boyfriend i had sex today and yesterday we are prepared for a baby if that were to happen we just want to wait a couple months cuz we are gettin married in weeks today he said he would pull out well he did but then he was like i'm going back in he hadn't cum yet well this happened like times but everytime the tip of his penis was really wet when he went back inside of me how effective is the pull out method really i know we didn't do it right lol we want a baby soon anyways but i was just wonderin i went on this site online where you enter info it said that a single act of unprotected sex on the day we did it was a chance of pregnancy but we pulled out so i wasn't sure this question of pre ejac causing pregnancy is one that is up for debate many people medical professionals included think the only way sperm can get into pre ejac is if it was left in the urethra after a prior ejaculation this means if the man urinated a couple of times between ejaculations the urethra would be clear of sperm the main reason pulling out fails is probably because the male partner waits too long to do it i am not recommending pulling out as a form of birth control but by all accounts the less sperm you have near your eggs the less chance you are pregnant Birth control Sexual intercourse Oral sex Fertility awareness Infertility Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Penis Prostate cancer In vitro fertilisation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Male reproductive system (human) Safe sex Menstrual cycle Ejaculation Puberty Sexual reproduction Gonorrhoea Premature ejaculation Orgasm Abortion debate Masturbation Obstetrics Female ejaculation Oral contraceptive Intersexuality Knots Landing Pornographic movie Abortion Human sexual behavior Breastfeeding Miscarriage Jon Secada Pre-ejaculate Twin Hypospadias Medical analysis of circumcision Sterilization (surgical procedure) Jam (TV series) Coitus interruptus Semen Adoption Phimosis Childbirth Sex assignment Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Spina bifida AIDS Old wives' tale EastEnders History of sex Endometriosis Neighbours Douche Homosexuality and medical science Herpes simplex virus Foreskin Urination Spider Erection Elephant Sperm Whale Sex education Man 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Gay slang Parthenogenesis Human penis size Sex toy Boston Public Friends Group sex Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jennifer Lopez American lobster Prenatal diagnosis Cytomegalovirus Days of our Lives Sexual dysfunction Swimming Ben Johnson (athlete) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen Breech birth Testosterone Religion and sexuality Sharon Tate Intersex surgery Gender role Transgender Human sexuality Epididymis Intact dilation and extraction
