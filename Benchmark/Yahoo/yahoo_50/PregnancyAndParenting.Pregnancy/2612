i asked this question on here four days ago which would be a better option surgical abortion or the abortion pill does anyone know the physical and mental effects of each it got reported and deleted why would someone do that my best friend recently thought about either option and i wanted to be able to be informed about both so i could help her i just wanted some personal experience that was really mean umm no if i was a good friend i would support her unconditionally in making the best choice she can for her and her family no plan b is not the abortion pill plan b is simply a highter dose contraceptive pill i can't remember what the abortion pill is called it's only been out for about a year i think i have never known of anyone having an abortion by taking a pill with the surgical she will have to go into a clinic and they will draw blood take her into a room do an ultrasound take her into another and have her get undressed and into the gown and robe they give you have her lie on a bed in stirrups and they will give her a shot then he will use the thing like they do in a pap and give her another shot into her cervix this does not hurt then will use the suction thing during this she will feel like she is cramping similar to her menstral cycle then they will give her another shot in her arm to help close the cervix and all then have her in a room for a few minutes to make sure she is ok then she will have prescriptions to fill and take the meds her belly will be a little tender for a few days and she may feel like she is cramping a little i would imagine that the pill will abort the fetus first and try to let her pass it on her own but i am not sure i do not know how that works if so i dont think she could take being able to actually see the baby when it is out i would recommend the surgical and let the doc take care of her instead do not hold me to the info on the pill that is a pure guess but it is always better when you have a doc looking over you and making sure everything is normal and doing like it should i would imagine that the pill isnt all that safe either people will judge but they do not know the situation your friend is in so they are not informed enough to make an informed judgement just let them rant they are more against abortion than they are your friend just look over some of the comments there are many who do not regret the decision to abort bc of various reasons the person aborting knows what is best for them and the baby let her make her decision and stick by her without judgement like you have been doing there should be more friends like you god bless you and your friend now i understand what pill you are talking about this is the morning after pill also known as plan b right if so then all she has is hours from the date of unprotected sex to take this if she knows she is pregnant then it is too late for this as an option Abortion Emergency contraception Abortion debate Birth control Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Pregnancy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Miscarriage Intact dilation and extraction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Menstrual cycle Prenatal diagnosis Abortion in Canada Abortion in the United States Partial-birth abortion Jon Secada Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Migraine Prostate cancer Roe v.
