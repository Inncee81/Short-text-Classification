set up nursery when should i start setting up the nursery i'm weeks but am scared to set it up because i lost a baby at weeks what's the best time when did you set yours up i'm having a baby shower around weeks should i have everything else set up then congratulations this is a very exciting time for you i understand your anxiousness to getting everything done and ready for when your little bundle of joy arrives i was the same way personally i would wait until after you have the baby shower to set up your nursery i think this will work for a lot of reason it gives you the chance to see what gift you receive at th shower this will prevent you from buying something that someone else plans to give as a gift it will cut out the excessive trips to the store to return those duplicate gifts you may actually save money if you put everything well most everything you want on your baby register then people will know exactly want you want and need you may find that you will have to buy very little if anything i received my baby's crib and changing tabel this way even though these things are big items a group of people chipped in and bought them for me i was left with very little to buy by waiting a little longer it gives you time to shop around and get ideas of the theme and colors you want there is nothing worse than buying a bunch of stuff that you thought you loved to only see a month or so later that another theme or nursery idea that you absolutely love this happened to me but i do encourage you to shop around and look at the different thems and colors play around with paint colors until you find one that you really like and wont mind see for at least the next years but please don't handle the paint yourself this is very dangerous pregnant women should never at anytime handle paint or be exposed to the very strong fumes for i do advise you to paint the room and have everything unpacked washed and set up at least a month before you have the baby most doctors recommend this it gives the paint fumes time to go away so they dont' harm you or the baby and it also give the bedding and clothes time to air out i don't recommend using any fabric softner on your baby's clothes use something like dreft baby detergent only don't do any of the nursery set up yourself it yourself make sure to recruit lots of friends and relatives to help you however there is absolutely nothing wrong with shopping around and getting ideas on what you want and how you want it to look there are a few websites that allow you do a virtual set up of your baby's nursery the first one that comes to mind is www huggies com good luck and congratulations Humphrey Bogart Social rule EastEnders Theory of conduct Jon Secada Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Neopets Avenue Q Knots Landing Neighbours The Apprentice 2 Wheel of Fortune Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cliff Richard CPU cache Animal Crossing CPU design Little Britain Characters in the Smurfs Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Johnny Appleseed The Emancipation of Mimi Poker jargon About a Boy AFI 100 Years series The Death Gate Cycle Jennifer Lopez RuneScape quests Cruising (maritime) Sin City Infantilism Blood on the Tracks Customs and etiquette of Japan Milton H.
