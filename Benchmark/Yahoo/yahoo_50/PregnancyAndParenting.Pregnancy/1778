are that many people really that ignorant about pregnancy every day i see questions from women asking if they could be pregnant these woman have ussualy had unprotected sex and the man pulled out or they tried some other form of birth control don't these women realize that no form of birth control is if you have had sex at all then of course there is a chance that you are pregnant don't they teach this stuff in school anymore don't women learn these things before they have sex they obviously have internet access why aren't they looking this information up on medical web sites it worries me that these women and girls are having sex without being informed about birth control how many of you really don't know that borth control is not and that any sex can make you pregnant the thing is most of these girls and by most i mean the vast majority were given this information in school it doesn't matter what they were taught when a guy wants to have sex with her they get so damned flattered that they ignore what they've already heard and concentrate on what they want to hear i thought everyone knew that saran wrap and coke douches and withdrawal don't work but wouldn't you know yesterday there was some stupid guy here asking if his girlfriend could be pregnant if he was only in a little while and had wrapped it saran wrap first because they didn't have a condom sheesh i suppose interrupting their session to go out and buy a condom was out of the question and the girls who come here to split hairs and look for loopholes to see how far they can push the envelope with unprotected sex just slay me they're not mature enough to baby sit let alone have sex it's as if being taken advantage of sexually and risking your health physically is seen as some kind of privilege now Condom Safe sex Birth control Sex education Abortion debate Anal sex Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an AIDS Oral sex Sex and the City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Neighbours Avenue Q Infantilism Sexual intercourse Bondage (BDSM) Pornographic movie Herpes simplex virus Married... with Children Radio Yerevan Androgen insensitivity syndrome Milton H.
