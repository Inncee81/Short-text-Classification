this baby is ready quick questions please anwser not to give to much infromation but i was wondering what it means if i have some sharp pains in my rectal area also some pain on what feels like the bones back there i went to the doctors today and i was effaced and cm dilated and he said anyday now i should start real labor ive lost my mucus plug and all why am i having sharp 'pains in my butt' literally i know the babys moving down but is there anything else is rectal pain a sign of labor im also having what feels like braxton hicks and some period like cramping just very uncomfortable and alot of pressure im not sure if the pains im having in my lower stomach are from the internal exan this morning or if its the beinging of labor i also have sharp pains in my lower back you probably have two things going on with the rectal pains the first thing is that you probably have a common problem women often get by the third trimester hemorrhoids if you don't see any hemorrhoids on the outside of your anus then you could have internal ones that are colse to your anus on the inside i have those the second thing is that the baby is coming down putting pressure on your rectum therefore putting pressure on the hemorrhoids about the other pains you are probably going into real labor and what you think is braxton hicks false labor contractions are probably real labor contractions starting or getting ready to start real labor contractions start off feeling like period cramps but will get worse i believe you are in early labor and should get ready to go to the hospital you can labor some at home if you want but sould not wait any longer to go to the hospital if your contractions get minutes apart if you get so uncomfortable that you need some pain relief or if your water breaks good luck and congratulations Hemorrhoid Prostate cancer Pregnancy Fecal incontinence Anal sex Stomach cancer Strap-on dildo Colorectal cancer Breastfeeding Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Miscarriage Premature birth Jon Secada Breech birth Cervix Menstrual cup Anal masturbation Diving Rectum Japanese toilet Utilitarianism Carpal tunnel syndrome Enema Coeliac disease Toni Braxton Keynesian economics Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Intact dilation and extraction Equine conformation Goodness and value theory Anus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) First aid Gonorrhoea Diabetic retinopathy Social rule Constipation Decompression sickness Cramp Dialysis Milton H.
