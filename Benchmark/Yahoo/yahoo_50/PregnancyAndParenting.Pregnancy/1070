pregnancy without marriage i was just wondering what people on here thought about having kids but not deciding to get married right away i've noticed that whenever i ask a question i get a lot of crap from people who want to tell me that i need to go ahead and get married but i know i'm not the only one out there who has had kids when they arent married why do people on here seem to think that if you get pregnant you should just get married aren't there situations where that may not be the answer i'm not saying i will never marry my bf but maturity wise we arent really on par i find myself taking care of finances etc while my things are in order and he will just walk away from paying old debt i dont want to be responsible for what he owes we have child together and another on the way and i prefer to have my finances in order for their sake and we did separate briefly and i did take care of my son by myself so no i'm not worried about what happens if it doesnt work out because i will love my kids either way i just think it's crazy that people want to tell me to get married when so many people are getting divorced but then they make fun of the year old girls on here who are pregnant and getting married telling them to wait i have a month old and live with my boyfriend we are not married and honestly it is easier i would lose all of my financial aid for college if we got married also you should not base your love of someone on a piece of paper if you and your man are together and want to be together forever then wear a ring there are woman who don't want to give up their last name and that is their solution EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Friends Social rule Marriage Divorce Knots Landing Marilyn Monroe One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jennifer Lopez Avenue Q About a Boy Theory of conduct Ayyavazhi mythology Abortion debate Charmed Bond Series finale Sharon Tate The Shining (film) Kodocha One Life to Live Incarnations of Immortality Laura Schlessinger Married... with Children Paul Martin Phoebe Halliwell Infantilism Melanie Wilkes Lucille Ball RuneScape quests Polygamy Alois Hitler Socrates Shaggy dog story Pitaten Jon Secada Everwood Will & Grace Polyamory Hillary Rodham Clinton Adoption Miss Saigon The Inside Neighbours Hey Jude Unemployment Elvis and Me Anne Boleyn Charles Dickens The Lovely Bones Atomic Kitten Pregnancy Piccolo Junior Saga Sex and the City Saved by the Bell Jayne Mansfield Amy Dumas Fiddler on the Roof Breastfeeding Desi Arnaz Human sexual behavior One Piece minor characters Kate Vaiden Rod Stewart Phoebe Buffay's songs Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Apprentice 2 Le Malade imaginaire K' Birth control Ginger Rogers History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Craps Lorraine Baines McFly Civil unions in the United Kingdom Vegeta 1919 World Series Menstrual cycle Rais massacre The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Marriage of Figaro St. Elmo's Fire (film) Edward Gibbon Wakefield Code: Lyoko John the Baptist Liza of Lambeth AFI 100 Years series The Critic The Amber Spyglass Futurama (TV series - season 2) Boom Town (Doctor Who) Teachers (film) Luke and Laura Spencer Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Survivor (novel) Same-sex marriage in Canada Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
