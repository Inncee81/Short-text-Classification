ultrasound showed that i am weeks and days pregnant today from my last menstrual period i would be weeks days today i saw a heartbeat and the little bean oh how cute and i am so excited however i am slightly confused about which age is more accurate does this mean i conceived sooner or is the baby growing fast note lmp was june nd thanks for your input damn these answers are all over the place i guess there is no right answer trust me i will ask my doctor at the next appointment which isn't for until next month lol thanks for your opinions there is a huge difference in fetal size when comparing a week baby to an week baby as there is very little variability in the size of fetuses that is to say comparing one week to another week you would see almost no difference in size in the first trimester than there is later in pregnancy when fat deposits and bone growth can have great variance and one week baby might weigh lbs while another weighs lbs early ultrasounds are more accurate than later ones your dates might seem off because it is possible that you ovulated irregularly early or perhaps your period on june nd was not a true period did it seem different in any way lighter flow perhaps they might not change your dates just yet but they might do another scan in a few weeks to see if your dates are still on track talk to your doctor at your next appointment and they should explain how they will formally calculate your due date since it appears there is some discrepancy between lmp and fetal size Obstetrics Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Fetal development Puberty Breech birth Abortion Medical ultrasonography Androgen insensitivity syndrome Breastfeeding Birth weight Fetus Abortion debate Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Intact dilation and extraction Cephalic disorder Prenatal care Prenatal diagnosis Childbirth Gregorian calendar Abortion in the United States Fertility awareness Sexual differentiation Pound Human height Spina bifida Normal distribution Stomach cancer Progesterone Wood Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Endometriosis Emergency contraception In vitro fertilisation Margin of error Congenital disorder Ovulation Loudspeaker Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder Stenberg v.
