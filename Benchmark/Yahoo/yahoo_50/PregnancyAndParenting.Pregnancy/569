bleeding weeks after period my girlfriend started bleeding tonight and described it as it's like having her regular period again she is very good about taking her bc and has made no changes to it since she started taking it years ago she is not passing clots and has no abdominal pains she says she feels perfectly fine as i said she is on the pill and i have a vasectomy i have had all my checks done and they have all been clear yet i am still a little worried about this we both donate plasma twice a week which requires a lot of testing including for anemia and all your blood levels and such have to be within normal range to donate just a little fyi i thought i'd add what do you think it could be i can say that this is definitely not a pregnancy case some women may experience irregular periods in their life time and it could happen to even the ones who has never had a irregular period before so in my opinion this is what may be happening to her don't panic as long she has no pain and and the period is normal like the ones she have it will be fine you may want to get her checked out with a doctor just to be sure some bc pills causes that kind of thing too i am sure there is nothing wrong with her good luck Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obstetrics Endometriosis Miscarriage Endometrial cancer Oral contraceptive Pregnancy Folic acid Prostate cancer Fertility awareness Tocopherol Stomach cancer Psoriasis Dialysis Abortion debate Coeliac disease Childbirth EastEnders Theory of conduct Anxiety Polycystic ovary syndrome Urinary incontinence Hepatitis C Blood transfusion Von Willebrand disease Apollo 8 Hypertension Traumatic brain injury Spanish verbs HIV test Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Year of the Spider Ovarian cancer Birth control Ovarian cyst Social rule Diabetic retinopathy Hypoglycemia Abortion Diabetes mellitus Blood Cancer Breastfeeding Mesothelioma Poker jargon Vitamin C Ectopic pregnancy Milton H.
