religion pregnancy has me thinking of it differently i am not a very religious person i believe there is a higher power for everyone but i am not sure that it is god since i have been pregnant and i am only weeks i have been thinking alot about a baptism and finding a church i guess it isn't that i dont believe in god im just not sure do you think that i would be a hypocrit for attending church and having my baby baptized even if i am unsure about my religious views i just think oh geez what if i am wrong and damning my child if i don't do it again please no hateful replies spirituality is a journey that we all go on at different paces i admire you if you are strong in your faith but please don't criticize me for not having that same resilience i wish i just believed i am thinking about my child though my mom forced me to attend church until i was so i feel like i have a good background and i think i want to give that to my child so that he can make an educated decision about his own views thanks yep i was raised catholic funny how people knew that hi there well there's many reasons why you could be having these feelings for one it's normal for maternal instincts to kick in when you're pregnant and as a mom of course you always want to keep your child safe and protected another thing i'm thinking is perhaps god has given you this beautiful little miracle to bring you closer to him and help you find your way just a thought don't take offense to it in any case i think you should go with your feelings there's a reason why you're having them take your time and find a church that you feel comfortable with go to a few different ones as for baptism people believe different things about when that should take place if you're leaning towards doing it as an infant then go with it all you can do as a parent is the best you can do lay the foundation and as you said your child can figure out his her own path with the education you've provided i was raised catholic too so if you need someone to talk to i'm here good luck to you and congrats on your pregnancy and p s you were smart not to post this in the religion section those zealots would have been all over you lol yikes Baptism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Infant baptism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Roman Catholic Church Abortion debate Religion Church of Christ Religious conversion Pregnancy Baptist Ten Commandments A Course In Miracles Lutheranism Holy Spirit Childbirth Minister of religion Church of Christ, Scientist Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Atheism Justification (theology) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Original sin Catechism EastEnders The nature of God in Western theology Alcoholics Anonymous Opus Dei Catholicism Heaven Anti-Mormonism Seventh-day Adventist Church Soul Iglesia ni Cristo Religious pluralism Philosophical skepticism Sola fide Fundamentalism Mother Teresa Priesthood (Mormonism) Unitarian Universalism Salvation Friedrich Schleiermacher Messianic Judaism Eastern Orthodox Church Theodicy Laura Schlessinger Christian denomination Abrahamic religion Religion and abortion Theory of conduct Sexual abstinence Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Augustine of Hippo Edgardo Mortara Protestantism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Christianity and anti-Semitism Believers baptism Charles Darwin's views on religion David Hume Separation of church and state Charles Grandison Finney Abington School District v.
