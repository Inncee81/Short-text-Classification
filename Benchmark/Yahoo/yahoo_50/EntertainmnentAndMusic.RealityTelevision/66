jameka did jameka suddenly change or is it just me she started off by saying how religious she is then she starts calling dick's mom a itch i know everyone has faults but you are suppose to learn from your mistakes she was really showing her ss tonight i agree that dick tries to intimidate the rest of the people in the house but jameka should be smart enough to let him make an ss out of himself you can speak up for yourself without using profanity i don't care what dick may have said that was derogatory toward her she has no right to call his mother out of her name if she is upset with dick she should berate him not his mother very childish if you ask me jameka is a hypocrite she claims to be a good christian but she showed her true self on tonights show when she attacked dick's mom who she has never met and knows very little about she showed that she isn't a good christian at all she can claim she is a good christian all she wants but actions speak louder than words and her actions tonight against dick's mom were very unchristian The Shining (film) Wang Mang Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Laura Schlessinger Pok__mon Live!
