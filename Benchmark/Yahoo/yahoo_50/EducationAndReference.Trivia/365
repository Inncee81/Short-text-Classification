what did the emancipaton proclamaton actually do i'll give the best answer to the first person to give me the whole answer and i really do know it so don't try to fool me be shure to include the actual effects i e emotional and political the emancipation proclamation was passed by president lincoln president fo the united states during the civil war it stated that all slaves in states that were in rebellion were freed ie slaves in the conferate states because the confederate states were in rebellion the southern states they didn't listen to president lincoln this would be the the same as president bush telling europe to pay him taxes it wouldn't do anything in middle school children are taught that the emancipation proclamation freed the slaves when in fact it didn't free any slaves it did however have some concequences and it wasn't a pointless piece of paper lincoln knew what he was doing it changed the purpose of the war before the emancipation proclamation was passed the war was about getting the southern states to rejoin the union after the emancipation proclamation was passed the war became focused arounds the issue of slavery it allowed president lincoln to allow run away slaves to join the military and fight against the south before the emancipation proclamation was passed there were many run away slaves in the north lincoln couldn't send them back to the south because he knew they would be beaten and or killed he also couldn't keep them in the north because they were not legally free many african americans tried to enter the military to fight against the south during the civil war but lincoln could not allow them to fight because there was no law saying they were free after the emancipation proclamation was passed all african americans in the north were free and therefore lincoln could allow them to fight in the war Emancipation Proclamation American Civil War History of slavery in the United States United States Abraham Lincoln History of Maryland African American Underground Railroad History of the Southern United States Border states (Civil War) African American history Southern United States Delaware Lincoln Memorial Dred Scott v.
