game is the broncos with a total of if a wager is placed on the broncos with a point buy the player has a wager on the broncos points and must put up to win instead of the usual to win if the player for example requests a full point buy to move the pointspread down to he she would have to put up to win buying the pointspread down points to would cost to win and the full point buy down to would cost the bettor to win conversely the bettor may also buy points on the chiefs side and get the line at plus or points all the way up to plus points with the same increase in vigorish bettors may also buy points for football totals in this particular game bettors could buy an over wager with a maximum line move down to or an under wager with a maximum line move up to point buying to a maximum of
