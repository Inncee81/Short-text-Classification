i need to learn poker in a day im going to houston for a few days and my cousins are like poker finatics and ive always wanted to play them for money and stuff but i dont know squat about it so i need help what are the rules what are the combinations of cards like flush and stuff like that okay its going to be tough because poker takes years to master im assuming you guys are goiing to be playing texas holdem which is the most popular and common of all the poker games out there lets start with combinations from lowest to highest the lowest is called high card lets say you have a in texas holdem you start off with two cards that only you have the community cards there are cards that everyone gets to see and use are j in poker its all about best five card hand so your hand would be j ace the next combo is a pair thats say you have a again board is a j this time you have a j a a the next combo is two pair lets say you hold a this time you would have two pair if the community cards from the last example were the same you would also have two pair if you had j aj etc ace jack would be the highest two pair and would beat a or ace is always highest and two is always lowest in any combo the next combo is trips thats say you hold the flop first three community cards are you would have trips because you have three 's yea its coomon sense the next combo is the straight it is cards in consecutive order the next hand is called the flush it is of the same suit lets say you hold ac c community cards are c c d s c you would have a flush because you have a all clubs the next combo is the fullhouse it is of a kind and a pair lets say you hold the community cards are k you have sixes and two fives which fullhouse the next combo is four of a kind it means you have four of something the next rank is straight flush it is a straight with a flush lets say you have d d the community cards are d d djcks that would be a straight flush last is royal flush same thing as straight flush except it has to be akqj of all the same suit if you dont understand something go to this source http en wikipedia org wiki poker hands okay now lets discuss the basics of texas holdem you are dealt two cards in the begining this round is called preflop there are two forced bets that are happening preflop and they are called the small and big blind if you are not in the blinds you either fold call or raise if you fold you dont lose any money but your hand is discarded if you call you put in the amount the big blind cost if you raise then you put more money in the pot and anyone that wants to continue to the next round will have to call your raise or reraise your raise when you first start out you want to play big cards from aj ak aa kk qq jj kq once you get the feel of the game play lesser cards like j kj q and so forth however you never ever play cards like a as i mentioned poker is the best card hand lets say you have a and the community cards are a q you have top pair right well its not a good sitation at all as you might think lets say some bets on the flop they could easily have a all the way to ak and their card hand would be better than yours so only play hands even when you think you are better that both have at least the value of ten so dont play j just play j dont play a play a when you get really bett er you may but for now play tight remember these rules only apply when you are playing nine players including you play more hands the less people there are a becomes a very good hand against two oppenenets anyways this is all preflop stuff the next round is the flop the flop is the first of community cards you try to make a hand with these cards if you dont have anything just fold if someone bets if no one bets you can just check not betting but will get you to the next round remember if you check and someone bets you have to call that bet the next round is the turn only one card comes out if you didnt have anything on the flop you should't be here except if you have a draw there are two common draws the flush and teh straight if there are two cards on the flop with the same suit as yours you have aflush draw you still need one more card to complete taht flush a good straight draw is like when you hold the flop is a you can hit a or a to get your straight so its worht it pursuing this straight this straight is called an open ended straight a straight draw not to pursue is if you held and the flop comes out j first you are drawing to the end of the straight and if teh ten does come out someone could easily have qk another reason is you can only hit a ten while the orevuous example you had cards to hit of course you dont always pursue flushes and opened ended straights either you have to ge ta good price for your draw no matter what it is anways as i said one card comes on the turn if some one bets to you and you dont have at least top pair with a kicker higher than you should probaly fold also its always better to be the one betting not calling on the river the last card comes if you have a decent hand you want to value bet you put your oppenent on a hand if you beat the hand you put him on then bet a certain amount where you think he woill call if you cant beat any hands just check if you dont know the pot is good if you get reraised just fold here are more links if you dont understand or need more
