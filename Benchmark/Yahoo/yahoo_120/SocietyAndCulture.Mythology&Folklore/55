is it ok to get a distant attunement in reiki sorry that i'm repeating the question but i thought that i should put it in the m f section too so what's the difference i want to get an attunement and it's free any kind of info is good thanks kris yes a distant attunement will work although if the sender has personal knowledge of the person it will be more effective at the least i would expect them to have your picture make sure that this is someone who is certified most reiki practitioners will charge a nominal amount remember that you get what you pay for and if it's free well you know Reiki Hypnosis Pretty Good Privacy United States Postal Service Trust (Law) USA Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Black hole Tax New Age General relativity Theory of conduct Notary public Inflation Socrates Coercion Digital signature Philosophy of language Microeconomics Scientology beliefs and practices Value added tax Cheap talk Predestination Postage stamp Contract Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Determinism Philosophical skepticism Professor Traditional Chinese medicine SCO-Linux controversies Education in Japan Annuity Keynesian economics Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Domain Name System Nursing American individualist anarchism Copyleft Stereoscopy GNU General Public License Supply-side economics YuYu Hakusho Quackery Poker jargon Anonymous remailer Frank Herbert Free will Royal Assent Property (ownership right) Yusuke Urameshi Bayesian probability Theology Bhagavad Gita Leviathan (book) Eyeglass prescription General practitioner Malignant melanoma Animism Social rule Patent Insurance Hyperinflation Bond Economic rent Confucius Life insurance Psychotherapy Ludwig Wittgenstein Green Day Turing machine Labor theory of value Gamma ray burst Appeal Anarchism and capitalism Cognitive science Martial art Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Economic inequality Graphology Public domain Quantum mechanics RuneScape Medical prescription Ozone depletion Human nature Tag Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Supply and demand Fair use Summa Theologiae National Health Service Spam (electronic) Karma in Hinduism Kazuma Kuwabara Falun Gong Neutrino Categorical imperative
