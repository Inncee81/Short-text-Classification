have you ever seen an aurora borialis and if yes what was it like i recently read about one in a book witch child and it seemed really fascinating the northern lights are really neat to describe what they look like would be like trying to describe what a waterfall with multiple rainbows looks like to someone who has never seen one the best way to describe it would be for you to find a picture of it usually they are blue and green but sometimes their is multiple colors including red yellow and purple after finding a still shot of it picture the colors coming alive and sweeping around like a lightweight curtain dancing around an open window with a breeze imagine also that in each wisp there is a cascading waterfall creating ripples of color and shades of motion they are like plants underwater swaying back and forth with the current you are in awe at the majesty of it all and wonder why you would ever want to leave alaska Aurora (astronomy) Rainbow Color Rainbow Brite Lightsaber Light-emitting diode New York City Subway nomenclature Color theory Primary color Cascading Style Sheets Synaesthesia Color blindness Blue Billiards Kirby CityRail RGB color model Microsoft Paint The Legend of Zelda series enemies The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Rainbow flag Traffic light Los Angeles Kings Rainbow Islands Web colors Pixel Lighting Garnet Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Geology of the Grand Canyon area Fantasmic!
