i have this fear of looking in the mirror after flushing the toilet so i always look at my hands while washing them does anyone know where this fear may have come from is there any folklore that might explain this i don't know what i am afraid of my heart just starts racing i have heard of bloody mary but i thought the story went you turn off the lights spin in a circle times say i don't beleive in bloody mary times then look in the mirror and she is supposed to appear but that doesn't have anything to do with flushing the toilet i mean in a psychological perspective cause that is not how i was taught the story i think i fear that when i look my reflection will not be my own you are probably right kia thats the thing my heart doesn't race unless i try to look after flushing the toilet idk its pretty silly isn't it but i can't explain it it may have come from watching something that you were to young at that time to remember or you were told something that just sits on the back of your mind what ever it is look into your mirror and try to over come this abnormal fear ok Milton H.
