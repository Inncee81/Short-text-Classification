can't wait three weeks it's three weeks until the next race and i was just wondering what can we expect from f until then will there be more devepments regarding the whole spy scandal thing and maybe the whole pit lane incident that got so many people pissed at alonso what about the other teams i really can't wait three weeks until the next race at least it is only three weeks what are we going to do when the season is over during this time there is of course a ban on testing on track teams will continue development in the wind tunnel in simulators and with cfd computational fluid dynamics with an aim to arrive at turkey with an improved car the spy scandal may indeed be the main thing in the news but with ron dennis apparently going on vacation there may be a dearth of comments from mclaren there is of course the latest silly season rumour that alonso wants out of mclaren already so there is a good chance we'll see more stories about this i speculate that if it is true if he does indeed want out we'll get some good stories on where he has been seen and with whom i think the alonso story could prove to be the story of the three weeks actually unless of course someone catches lewis hamilton talking to another team despite his saying a few weeks ago he could spend his whole career at mclaren he's surely reconsidering that after hungary lots of off track excitement to come for sure rp Kimi R__ikk__nen Juan Pablo Montoya Formula One Fernando Alonso 2000 Australian Grand Prix Michael Schumacher Ron Dennis Ayrton Senna 24 Hours of Le Mans 2005 United States Grand Prix 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Adrian Newey 2005 Formula One season Jacky Ickx Chris Amon 2005 European Grand Prix Mercedes-Benz Bruce McLaren Gerhard Berger 2005 French Grand Prix The Amazing Race 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Jenson Button Renault F1 History of Formula One Andrea de Cesaris 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix Extreme Programming 2004 San Marino Grand Prix 2002 Formula One season Sex Pistols David Coulthard Social rule Spice Girls Ben Johnson (athlete) Giancarlo Fisichella Barry Bonds Scuderia Ferrari 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix WilliamsF1 Jackie Stewart Valentino Rossi Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sim racing Ivan Capelli I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Ricardo Zonta Damon Hill 2005 Canadian Grand Prix NASCAR Riccardo Patrese New York Giants Martin Brundle Futurama (TV series - season 2) 2004 Formula One season Jordan Grand Prix Terry Labonte Renault Ravi Shastri 2004 Monaco Grand Prix Norway national football team 2005 British Grand Prix Formula One regulations 2003 United States Grand Prix Computational fluid dynamics Top Gear September 2005 in sports Ernie Irvan Wind tunnel Indianapolis 500 British American Racing Plame affair Queen (band) Surtees Tobacco advertising Ron Weasley Tris Speaker 2006 Formula One season A1 Team New Zealand Jarno Trulli John Barnard 2005 Japanese Grand Prix Aston Villa F.C.
