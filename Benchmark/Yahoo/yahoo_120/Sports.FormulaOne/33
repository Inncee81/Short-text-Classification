lewis hamilton is he the biggest prick im really pissed off at how alonso was treated at the hands of lewis and his daddy on sunday at hungarian gp lewis should have never entered the pit he knew alonso was there lewis should have been penalised not alonso alonso has had nothing but problems with that smirky wee prick he has a face you want to hit good looking with a brick alonso waited to be told to go he left when he was told to lewis was told alonso was in the pit and to wait well lewis and alonso are both irritating at times in my opinion fame seems to be getting to lewis' head lately acting like he's the f king or something like that making lots of statements and starting to talk too much alonso on the other hand is complaining that there are double standards going on in mclaren this year since lewis' arrival that has taken the f world by storm alonso has been keeping really quiet unlike last year when he was leading the championship and couldn't keep his mouth shut for even one second it is not surprising that lewis and alonso both have some issues with one another it just proves that for a team to succeed they don't necessarily need the best drivers but they also need drivers with good attitude whose egos won't clash for example a few years back at mclaren some similar situation was going on the partnership of kimi raikkonen the ice man and juan pablo montoya the foul mouthed but great overtaker colombian everyone were excited about this because they were considered 'fire and ice' opposites and therefore people expected them to have a healthy competition and to be the fastest drivers on track wrong they both had some issues with each other just like how lewis and alonso have now at mclaren history repeats itself at mclaren once again Juan Pablo Montoya 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Team McLaren 2005 Formula One season 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Formula One 2005 Canadian Grand Prix Mercedes-Benz 2003 United States Grand Prix Michael Schumacher 2005 European Grand Prix 2004 San Marino Grand Prix 2005 French Grand Prix Ayrton Senna Indianapolis 500 Giancarlo Fisichella 24 Hours of Le Mans 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2005 Australian Grand Prix Renault F1 Shaggy dog story 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix 2004 Monaco Grand Prix Ben Johnson (athlete) Scuderia Ferrari 2005 Japanese Grand Prix WilliamsF1 July 2005 in sports 1957 World Series Tiago Monteiro Jacky Ickx 2005 United States Grand Prix Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Jackie Stewart Jenson Button 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix Poker jargon Jordan Grand Prix Nigel Mansell World Series September 2005 in sports Emerson Fittipaldi 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Future of Formula One Adrian Newey Drag racing Chris Amon Water polo 2005 Monaco Grand Prix Plame affair October 2004 in sports Piccolo Junior Saga John McEnroe Martin Brundle Professional wrestling throws Penske Racing United States Grand Prix 2005 Chinese Grand Prix New York Giants Detroit Tigers EastEnders Major League Baseball television contracts Roddy Piper 2005 World Series Cincinnati Bengals Formula 3000 Turkish Grand Prix Shawn Michaels Sin City Mika H__kkinen Theory of conduct Los Angeles Dodgers Jos Verstappen 2004 Formula One season Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Formula One racing Hulk Hogan April 2005 in sports Jarno Trulli Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Tris Speaker Friends 2006 Formula One season The Contender (television series) Jacques Villeneuve
