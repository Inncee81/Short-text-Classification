anywhere online harry potter and the deathly hallows by j k rowling chapter one the dark lord ascending the two men appeared out of nowhere a few yards apart in the narrow moonlit lane for a second they stood quite still wands directed at each other's chests then recognizing each other they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction news asked the taller of the two the best replied severus snape the lane was bordered on the left by wild low growing brambles on the right by a high neatly manicured hedge the men's long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched thought i might be late said yaxley his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight it was a little trickier than i expected but i hope he will be satisfied you sound confident that your reception will be good snape nodded but did not elaborate they turned right into a wide driveway that led off the lane the high hedge curved into them running off into the distance beyond the pair of imposing wrought iron gates barring the men s way neither of them broke step in silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through as though the dark metal was smoke the yew hedges muffled the sound of the men s footsteps there was a rustle somewhere to their right yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion s head but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure white peacock strutting majestically along the top of the hedge he always did himself well lucius peacocks yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort a handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive lights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing gravel crackled beneath their feet as snape and yaxley sped toward the front door which swung inward at their approach though nobody had visibly opened it the hallway was large dimly lit and sumptuously decorated with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor the eyes of the pale faced portraits on the wall followed snape and yaxley as they strode past the two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room hesitated for the space of a heartbeat then snape turned the bronze handle the drawing room was full of silent people sitting at a long and ornate table the room s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror snape and yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold as their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope and reflected in the mirror and in the bare polished surface of the table below none of the people seated underneath this singular sight were looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it he seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so yaxley snape said a high clear voice from the head of the table you are very nearly late the speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace so that it was difficult at first for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette as they drew nearer however his face shone through the gloom hairless snakelike with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical he was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow severus here said voldemort indicating the seat on his immediate right yaxley beside dolohov the two men took their allotted places most of the eyes around the table followed snape and it was to him that voldemort spoke first so my lord the order of the phoenix intends to move harry potter from his current place of safety on saturday next at nightfall the interest around the table sharpened palpably some stiffened others fidgeted all gazing at snape and voldemort saturday at nightfall repeated voldemort his red eyes fastened upon snape s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze snape however looked calmly back into voldemort s face and after a moment or two voldemort s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile good very good and this information comes from the source we discussed said snape my lord yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at voldemort and snape all faces turned to him my lord i have heard differently yaxley waited but voldemort did not speak so he went on dawlish the auror let slip that potter will not be moved until the thirtieth the night before the boy turns seventeen snape was smiling my source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail this must be it no doubt a confundus charm has been placed upon dawlish it would not be the first time he is known to be susceptible i assure you my lord dawlish seemed quite certain said yaxley if he has been confunded naturally he is certain said snape i assure you yaxley the auror office will play no further part in the protection of harry potter the order believes that we have infiltrated the ministry the order s got one thing right then eh said a squat man sitting a short distance from yaxley he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table voldemort did not laugh his gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead and he seemed to be lost in thought my lord yaxley went on dawlish believes an entire party of aurors will be used to transfer the boy voldemort held up a large white hand and yaxley subsided at once watching resentfully as voldemort turned back to snape where are they going to hide the boy next at the home of one of the order said snape the place according to the source has been given every protection that the order and ministry together could provide i think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there my lord unless of course the ministry has fallen before next saturday which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest well yaxley voldemort called down the table the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes will the ministry have fallen by next saturday Sybill Trelawney RuneScape quests
