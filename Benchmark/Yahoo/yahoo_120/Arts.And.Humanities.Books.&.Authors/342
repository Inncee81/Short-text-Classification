writing a book and dont know where to go with it i am writing a book for my first time in a while when i was a kid i took second place at a writing competition from kids who were at high school level i received awards and was glad that i got as far as i did my question now i think is really open ended i do take the time and pull off steven king styal of writing take time to look at other works and write down what i have fly into my thoughts but my question is now that i want to to work hard at a want to be big project what do you think i should write about what would interest the public if they were to read i would love to take time to have a brain storm of ideas like i did in high school and elementry school so any ideas would help i have a creative mind so i may just do a mash up of ideas tossed my way i don't think that you have to think on what the people wants to read writing a book is like expressing yourself and putting all your thoughts on its pages grasping a few readers at the beginning is quite a good jump start i mean i think not all writers became big time from their first novels written works right just a thought Endgame The Catcher in the Rye Science fiction Jack Kerouac Extreme Programming Chuck Palahniuk Consciousness W.
