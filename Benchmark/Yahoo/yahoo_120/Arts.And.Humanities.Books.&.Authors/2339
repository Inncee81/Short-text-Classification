harry potter and the deathly hollows readers opinions did anybody read it can u tell me how was it it was by far the best of the series some notes though make sure you've read through the last few books recently just to make sure you are up to date on anything that might jump out from a few books ago also if you get bored keep reading theres a few parts in the middle where i was kind of spacing out and having to re read paragraphs that may also be from the lack of sleep though but yes it was an extremely good book some didn't like the very ending but i think that it was amazing at first i hated it but if you think it over it really is a good ending if anywho who has read books or if anyone has even read book from the series they should read the last one hope you enjoy it also yes it can be predictable but couldn't we all tell who would live and who would die since the first book it just goes back to how some loved the ending and others hated the ending just whatever you do don't read ahead believe me it ruins everything if you read the last chapter first or skim through to see who dies just take it page at a time deaths are so sudden that you may just look forward page and see a sudden death Douglas Adams Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Shaggy dog story Speed reading Charmed Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Book of Isaiah Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Tanakh Slashdot subculture Goldstein's book A Series of Unfortunate Events Humphrey Bogart Garfield Negima StarCraft: Uprising Daylight saving time Trapped in the Closet The Lovely Bones Harry Potter: Book Seven Quotation mark The Catcher in the Rye The Foundation Series Make money fast Louis XV of France The Chronicles of Narnia Penda of Mercia Anne Rice The Amber Spyglass Major League Baseball television contracts Fan fiction Time travel Milton H.
