how to access the right brain to help with the flow of writing help please i used to write much more easily when i was in high school but since then i have not written as much i'm trying to get back into the swing of things but am having a hard time 'connecting with' switching on' my right brain in the old days it happened more quickly and i could almost feel it like flipping a switch however these days i seem to be mired in my left brain i blame it on all of those pesky day to day responsibilities like budgeting and such any suggestions on how to switch over it would be best if they were not time consuming i'm a new mom thank you i too stopped writing for awhile but i have to admit for me it was because i became lazy i tried relaxing and listening to different kinds of music before i started writing then i played soft music while i was writing neither helped taking a walk was a good antidote because i got my exercise in noticed details of my surroundings and mentally cataloged some for future use in a story and it energized me with a new baby how wonderful you can do double duty get your exercise and give the baby fresh air at the same time then a friend told me about a cd set she bought that she swears changed her writing habits it's called creative mind system by dr jeffrey thompson apparently he studied brain waves in thousands of people and came up with these cds it's used throughout the world by creative types but she said even major businesses use it i'd guess ad agencies or architects would benefit my friend said it was about see if your local bookstore can order it for you i'd bet if you went to writer's digest website you would find it there as well Human brain Out-of-body experience Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
