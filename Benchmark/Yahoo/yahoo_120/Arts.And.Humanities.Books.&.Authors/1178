the book quick question does winston get shot in the pub or does he get shot walking down a hall it is not clear where winston is actually shot because the ending is quite ambiguous at one point in the book o'brien tells winston that one day while walking down the corridor of the ministry of love when he will least suspect it he will get shot the actual place where it happens is left intentionally i believe open for debate the voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter but the shouting outside had died down a little the waiters were turning back to their work one of them approached with the gin bottle he was back in the ministry of love with everything forgiven his soul white as snow he was in the public dock confessing everything implicating everybody he was walking down the white tiled corridor with the feeling of walking in sunlight and an armed guard at his back the longhoped for bullet was entering his brain however i believe that winston was indeed shot at the ministry of love since the story clearly indicates that there were no public shootings going on for such criminals like smith instead what is revealed is that party members just kept disappearing whithout anybody knowing where or how by this ambiguity the author might suggest winston's deteriorated and hallucinatory state of mind deprived of reality and the images described seem to be adjusted as in a stream of consciousness Nineteen Eighty-Four Goldstein's book Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City EastEnders Scenes from a Memory Equilibrium (2002 film) American Psycho Consciousness The Death Gate Cycle Charles Peace Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Little Britain StarCraft Secret Missions Frontier in Space Darth Vader A Course In Miracles Conspiracy (TNG episode) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Aida (musical) Dead Like Me The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Amber Spyglass The Shining (film) Rose (Doctor Who) Rais massacre Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 The Matrix Out-of-body experience One (Voyager episode) Battles of Lexington and Concord John Berryman Breaker Morant Hey Jude Time Crisis 3 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Julia (1984) The End of the World (Doctor Who) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Big Brother UK series 6 Neo (The Matrix) The Usual Suspects Monkey Island Cyberspace I, the Jury Kodocha The Ark in Space We'll Always Have Paris (TNG episode) Escape from New York Dundas Square Alfie Moon The Invisibles K' Paranoia Agent Mineriad Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Urantia O'Brien (book character) Cylon (Battlestar Galactica) Columbine High School massacre The Dalek Invasion of Earth The Mysterious Planet Francis Crick Ray Winstone Mumia Abu-Jamal British National Party Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse The Unquiet Dead Zohar Te Kooti's War Provisional Irish Republican Army Pulp Fiction Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Reservoir Dogs Dalek (Doctor Who episode) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism About a Boy John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Parsifal G-Man (Half-Life) Drowning Characters in the Southern Victory series Christian views of Jesus Death Comes to Time Time Out of Mind Operation Market Garden RoboCop The Dark Knight Returns Tenshinhan Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Mind control The Contender (television series) Megatron Human
