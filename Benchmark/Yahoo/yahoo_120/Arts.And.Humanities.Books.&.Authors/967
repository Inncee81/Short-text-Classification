about harry potter book master of the elder wand uhm i have read and concluded from book and that harry is the master of the elder wand because harry got malfoy's wand in the house but what confuses me is that how did malfoy got the wand from dumbldor when in fact he just disarmed dumbldor's wand which remained to be with dumbldor til voldemort got it in his tomb how can this be possible that the wand harry got from malfoy was the elder wand thnx basing from what you guys told me am i right to conclude that it is not important that you have the exact wand elder wand in the sense that you should have 'defeated' it that you become the master and in the last duel of voldemort and harry who was the one using the elder wand omg am i confused lol well malfoy just disarmed dumbledore but he was still the master of the elder wand cause its not necessary to kill the person for you to be the true master of the elder wand you just have to take it by force and that's exactly what draco did so thats how he ended up with the elder wand even though he did even know it for himself lol so i guess when they buried dumbledore they buried his wand with him and thats how he had it when voldemort ripped open his tomb and thats how voldemort took it from dumbledore by force of course and thought that it was his until he thought again and remembered that snape was the one who killed dumbledore and therefore he killed snape off too so he can get the wand but he still didnt get the elder wand cause you see draco is the true master but harry took his wand from him at the malfoy manor and thats how harry ended up with the elder wand in the end and killed voldemort off ohh and by the way thats why voldemort's curse crucitus in the forest didnt hurt or harm harry at all when he used it the wand cause if you think about it harry is the true master of it the elder wand i mean thats why it didnt hurt harry cause remember the elder wand does not hurt her true master sorry if its confusing but i'm not that great in explaining so bare with me please lol hope that helped p s well thats what i think about this elder wand suitaution even though i'm not sure that i'm a right sorry hope it helped you understand anyway and your welcom lol Lord Voldemort Severus Snape Ron Weasley Albus Dumbledore Dates in Harry Potter Death Eater Hogwarts subjects Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Rubeus Hagrid Draco Malfoy Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Hogwarts Sirius Black Ginny Weasley Magical objects in Harry Potter Horace Slughorn Bellatrix Lestrange Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter: Book Seven Order of the Phoenix Narcissa Malfoy Diagon Alley Remus Lupin Lucius Malfoy James and Lily Potter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Unbreakable Vow Minor Ravenclaws Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Blood purity (Harry Potter) Cedric Diggory Regulus Black Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Hogwarts Houses Peter Pettigrew Horcrux Minor Hufflepuffs Rita Skeeter Neville Longbottom Legilimency Occlumency Harry Potter Dark Art House-elf Cho Chang Kreacher Dobby Fawkes Dumbledore's Army Fred and George Weasley Half-Blood Prince (character) Weasley family R.A.B.
