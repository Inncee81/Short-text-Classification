what qualities made you like the harry potter series and what would would you like to see in a similar book this was posted before but i still haven't got the spark i needed your other answers have been taken into account and are appreciated fully but i would still appreciate more i'm looking for some ideas and inspiration to start a series of books with a similar overall literary structure as the harry potter series ex centralized on three main characters an adventure quest toward a mutual goal that is not immediately realized by the main characters main characters are strangers but their relationship grows evolves strengthens through the predicaments and situations they are forced through i would like to know three things you believe would make the story enjoyable and gripping the setting time period i was thinking 's the antagonist just a rough example of who you would like our main characters to be fighting and anything else you would like to suggest i know this is a lot to ask but i would very much appreciate the help thanks in advance i know you probably won't like to hear this but i liked harry potter because it was well harry potter the setting in harry potter the setting was obviously england i liked the fact that even though i had never been there everything was so detailed because they were somewhat real places jk rowling wrote about the country she was born and raised in and it added a nice touch in being able to describe the surrounding scenes time period i also really enjoyed that harry potter was somewhat modern i mean i was never really one for books on the past or future i liked knowing that it was recent and made you believe it a bit more if it was talking about witches and wizards s of years ago you would shrug if off but since the book takes place now it makes you think what if there really are wiches and wizards for a few seconds antagonist voldermort was the ideal antagonist you can't ever get a better villan in my opinion the whole he who must not be named deal just made him almost define the word fear in the books what do people fear generally darkness death mystery ect voldermort was in a sence all those things which made him terrifying and it made us cheer harry on even more to defeat him i could understand following the general structure but unless you make it completely original thoughts you can't get the exact same reactions without copying the storyline my bet you can stick with a trio obviously without magical powers otherwise you'd have harry potter protesters outside you're door you would have realized this though and just try and think of a villian in a modern setting who holds characteristics that scare you death might be a hard one unless he owns the funeral home down the street that might be a little dull though another thing i loved was how linked the charracters seemed to be the more the story developed first it was just voldermort was defeated by harry then we found out that they both shared similarities there was the whole scare that maybe they were related closely but weren't we learned that they had brother wands harry could connect with voldermort's mind ect so adding sudden twists without the whole i'm you're father starwars moment would be a nice touch also Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Ron Weasley Magical objects in Harry Potter Magic (Harry Potter) Diagon Alley Hermione Granger Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Canon (fiction) Luna Lovegood Severus Snape Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter: Book Seven Ginny Weasley Minor Harry Potter Beasts Dates in Harry Potter The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Harry Potter in translation Wizard Lord Voldemort Blood purity (Harry Potter) The Chronicles of Narnia The Legend of Zelda series Fictional character Scenes from a Memory Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Sydney Riot of 1879 Daredevil Link (Legend of Zelda) Legacy of Kain Avenue Q James and Lily Potter Mickey Mouse Predestination paradox The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Ganon Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Mary Sue Hogwarts Milton H.
