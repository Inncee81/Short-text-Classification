harry potter question spoiler how doe harry survive voldemort's avada kedavra i understand that the horcrux had been killed but wouldnt harry've had to die in order for the horcrux to die and when i say survive i mean actually live after it was imposed upon him yes im aware that he 'died' so to speak and he was 'dead' when he spoke to dumbledore ok my take is this harry was the final horcrux which voldy didn't know since he didn't realize he had even made harry to be the eighth one so when he avada kedavara'ed him in the forest he merely destroyed the part of harry's soul that contained the final horcrux when harry and dumbledore are in king's cross harry sees the final piece of voldy's soul that small cringing writhing thing that probably looked alot liket the voldy we saw in goblet of fire from before the cauldron birth after talking to dumbledore harry is allowed to return to his body where both horcrux and connection to voldemort have been destroyed harry's decision to give himself up to voldy in the forest makes him a sacrifice he has enough love in him to die for all the people in hogwarts which of course gives all those people protection the likes of which lilly had provided to baby harry with her sacrifice if you'll notice harry points this out to voldy reminding him of how his spells were not working quite right on his opponents at hogwarts i mean the greates wizard of all time set against a bunch of school kids in the final confrontation harry also reveals his final realization that he had disarmed draco making him true master of the elder wand this meant that at that time even though voldy had physical possession of the elder wand harry's wand won from draco was the more powerful of the two so no more secret horcrux connection no safe refuge for voldy's last soul piece harry's sacrifice offers protection for all of hogwarts inhabitants harry true master of elder wand therefore when the expelliarmus and the avada kedavara were applied at the same time the stronger of the two spells was harry's signature move the expelliarmus i hope this helps Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Ginny Weasley Magic (Harry Potter) Severus Snape Rubeus Hagrid Hogwarts subjects Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Diagon Alley Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Sirius Black Sybill Trelawney Rita Skeeter Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter Minor Hufflepuffs Tom Riddle's diary Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Lucius Malfoy Dark Art Order of the Phoenix Wizarding world Professor Quirrell Hermione Granger Weasley family Minor Harry Potter Beasts Cedric Diggory Draco Malfoy Peter Pettigrew R.A.B.
