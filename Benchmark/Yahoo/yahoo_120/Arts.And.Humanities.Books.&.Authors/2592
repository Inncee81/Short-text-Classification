eclipse spoilers has anyone read eclipse by stephenie meyer yet were u disapointed like i was a little or what i am a edward fan and what she did with jacob makes me sick to my stomach everytime i think about it tell me what you think i totally agree with everyone so far i was in tears when bella was kissing jacob i mean come on you were engaged and cheating on your fiance i felt so bad for edward i was definetly looking forward to seeing her a vampire too boo hoo i even stared a slogan of vote bella swan vampire ' but that didnt come true so i had to change it to ' she better leave jacob alone in the next book or i will be very angry i have heard enough of him he better keep running and never come back how can he think that bella wants him over the gorgeous edward bella is just confused and feels bad for jacob because he is just a loser and no one else likes him i really had to express myself sorry lol i agree i can't believe she was crying becuase she 'loved' jacob and had to leave him to be with edward her one and only true love and when she kissed jacob what was that about gross and i felt really bad for edward because he was 'ok' with it and we let her leave him so she could be with jacob and i would have been ok if edward did get a little upset with her for kissing him but he didn't and i felt that there was way too much jacob in this book i mean there wasn't enough of edward do you know what i mean and i bet everyone was waiting for her to turn into a vampire in this book but know we have to wait a whole year and a half for her to finally be with edward for good p s these are the best books on earth i don't think i could ever live without them they truly changed my life i can't describe how much these books mean to me the are too grand for words sorry 'bout that but these books are simply amazing go team edward Time Out of Mind Knots Landing Friends Babe Ruth The Cure The Ashlee Simpson Show EastEnders Shaggy dog story Sydney Riot of 1879 Poker jargon Ranma __ characters Kodocha 50 Cent Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Survivor: Palau Extras (sitcom) Lou Gehrig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Crying of Lot 49 Book of Isaiah Episodes of Lost (Season 1) YuYu Hakusho The Contender (television series) Pitaten Stone Cold Steve Austin Leonard Cohen Marilyn Monroe Professional wrestling slang The Catcher in the Rye One Life to Live Night (book) Ocean's Twelve Jennifer Lopez Mary Jane Watson Ron and Fez Milton H.
