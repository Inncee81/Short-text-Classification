do u like harry potter do u like harry potter if yes y i love harry potter especially the books because until the last book came out there were lots of mysteries to be solved the books are about witchcraft and fantasy but it's also about regular teens going through regular stuff like heartbreaks and crushes and even though there are some serious matters j k rowling puts some humor into the book also the characters are so believable and once you read seven books about them it's like you know them and they are real and you learn to love them Harry Potter Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone J.
