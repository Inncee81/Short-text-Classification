ok what books do u suggest i read yearold going into highschool doesnt read that much but really wants to read a lot more often now omg wow thank you all i really was expecting only like ppl to answer cuz i donno i usually dont get many answers to my questions if you're going into high school you should mostly ignore children's literature and young adult fiction they are very simple and i believe them to be more for middle schoolers plus you wont read anything like them in high school english classes in ninth grade these were the books that i had to read for school the lord of the flies by william golding of mice and men by john steinbeck the old man and the sea by ernest hemingway romeo and juliet by william shakespeare and great expectations by charles dickens also while i am quite the reader i will suggest a few of the books that i read in or before th grade and enjoyed by george orwell the grapes of wrath by john steinbeck the adventures of huckleberry finn by mark twain the cather in the rye by jd salinger i would like to note this as the book that was one of the favorites of my entire high school freshmen english class it is a classic book about young adults and last but not least cat's cradle by kurt vonnegut as someone who is approaching his sophomore year of high school and is a huge bookworm i believe that my suggestions will be very helpful to you especially if you want to read alot like you mentioned in your question also they will help prepare you for the many much more difficult books you may have to read in high school and college such as herman melville's moby dick william faulkner's the sound and the fury and the works of shakespeare all of which i have read and can attest to the difficultty i really hope this helps Literature of the United States John Steinbeck Adventures of Huckleberry Finn The Old Man and the Sea History of modern literature William Shakespeare Kurt Vonnegut Mark Twain George Orwell St. John's College, U.
