the story i'm writing is going to be about words when i'm done how many pages in a book would that be or better yet what are some books that are about words so i can compare i have searched on barnes and noble's website as well as amazon but i couldn't find any statistics on books on how many words they are of course i didn't really expect to because most people are more interested in how many pages and chapters there are in a book words should roughly translate to about typed pages depending on spacing this is a great number to strive for but you should concentrate more on telling your story rather than how big the book will be each publisher uses varying fonts sizes spacing with their texts so there is no way to know exactly how thick the book will be if published good luck Amazon.com Killian documents Bible Typeface Culture of Lithuania Creation according to Genesis Gospel of Mark Barnes & Noble Fighting Fantasy Game Books Nicomachean Ethics Ebook Quotation mark Literature Book of Kells House of Leaves Unicode Portable Document Format Tao Te Ching Chinese character Book of Mormon Milton H.
