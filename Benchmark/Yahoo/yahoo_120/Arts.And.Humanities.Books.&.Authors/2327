writing a detective novel but have writer's block why would a wife hate her husband enough to kill him the wife is unmasked as the murderer in the last scene the victim her estranged husband they have two adult children was a druggie and violent alcoholic she lures him to a quiet spot and bashes him to death with a cricket bat belonging to someone she wants to frame so the killing is definitely premeditated he can't have been blackmailing her for drug money as he was already blackmailing his brother the chief suspect and i don't want too much blackmail in it and i don't want it to be anything that casts her in a sympathetic light because she is not a nice person either so what could be the reason from their past that would make her want to kill him all of a sudden she could have done it years before after all if anyone comes up with an idea i could use i promise not only points but i'll dedicate the book to you if it's ever published of course thanks very much in advance sirenlore i love the kids drugs idea watch this space lol wow these are some great ideas you should all be famous novelists hey persiphone shouldn't that be spelt persephone thanks for the hints all the clues point to someone else having been the killer then the wife is unmasked at the last minute it's called a plot twist i aim to go back and write in ambiguous clues that could point to either the obvious killer or the wife agatha christie made an industry out of writing this way so i don't see why i shouldn't no final scene with the detective gathering everyone in the library though too cheesy a he either threatened the kids even though they are adults a mothers love knows no bounds b he got one of the kids addicted to drugs c he's been stealing her hard earned stolen money lol Days of our Lives Knots Landing EastEnders Dial M for Murder Agatha Christie Sin City One Life to Live The O.C.
