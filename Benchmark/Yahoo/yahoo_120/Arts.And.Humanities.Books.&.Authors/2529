i am writing a story and need a little help i give best answer okay so i have been writing a story for about a year it's just for fun and i have over pages at this point of the story the six main characters three boys three girls same age in high school that are good friends and in the school's drama club together fly to one of the characters grandparent's house for a summer retreat up north where it isn't quite as hot i'm not sure why but i have been having trouble deciding what the house should be like that they are going to be staying at i felt it would be more interesting to go to extremes such as a mansion or a small like two room cottage a mansion would be fun to write about but then again i felt a small cozy home would be a good place in the story to develope the character's romance with each other it's cheesy but each of the three boys has a crush on one of the three girls and visa versa so do you have any ideas on what the house should be like or any ideas on what the teens could do during the stay do you know anything about farms it would be good if you would put your characters in a big farmhouse and have them do farm work for their stay with the grandparents there is always the possibility of the characters going into the barn for a little romance whatcha think One Tree Hill (TV series) Fancy Crane Carl Barks The O.C.
