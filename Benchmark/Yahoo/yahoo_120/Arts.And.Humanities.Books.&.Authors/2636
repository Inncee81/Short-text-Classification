logic of harry potter and the time turner i've read all the books and without doubt the most confusing aspect of the series is the time turner there are so many loop holes that they create in the series when harry is being attacked by the dementors and sees who he thinks is his father casting the patronus this means that the future has already been made it is actually harry casting the patronus and he is doing this before he goes back in time this means that even before he finds out about hermione's watch he will inevitably go back in time and save himself am i missing something here or does jk rowling purposely mean to be very vague about the details of the time turners because they create so many loopholes in the story so she just gives very basic information i mean if you think about it if she were to explain them more in depth would she be putting her hand to deep into the concepts of science physics time travel einstein's relativity also do you agree with what i wrote in the first paragraph thanks also when harry goes back in time and is waiting for his dad to appear to do his patronus and save harry from the dementors what would have happened if harry hadnt realized that it was he who had to set the patronus thus letting the dementors kiss him or was it his fate that he had to do it or is this just too much speculating time travel invariably results in a paradox which is in part why it is physically impossible time travel would make time finite but at the same time infinite by creating a loop a person going back in time would mean that the time they existed in woudl stop while they were gone ergo all time would lead up to a point where it ends because of one perosns action and loop back to the poin the person went to his actions there fore would be responsible for creating the circumstances which require him to travel to the past anything you do in the past changes the course of time basically if someone went back in time they would have already had to have gone back in time thus creating a loop both beginning and ending at the point in which they depart their on natural time wow it's hard to explain that without confusing yourself let alone others basically time travel impossible because it would create a tiem loop paradox destroying the very nature of time Time travel Predestination paradox Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Free will Black hole Faster-than-light Physical paradox Paradox Infinity Dementor Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Patronus Charm Luminiferous aether A Course In Miracles Quantum mechanics Grandfather paradox Cosmological argument Harry Potter: Book Seven Big Bang Bob and George Philosophy of mathematics Ron Weasley Physics Legacy of Kain Speed of light EPR paradox Father's Day (Doctor Who) General relativity Philosophy of language Manifold The Subtle Knife Falsifiability Magic (Harry Potter) Causality CPU cache Entropy Urantia Harry Potter fandom Zeno's paradoxes Bell's theorem Philosophy of science John Titor Futurama (TV series - season 5) Incarnations of Immortality Yoga Sutras of Patanjali G__del's incompleteness theorem Dynamical system String theory Lord Voldemort Fermi paradox Time Cho Chang Harry Potter Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Artificial consciousness Harry Potter (character) Canon (fiction) English grammar The Time Machine Day of the Daleks Redundant array of independent disks Halting problem The Amber Spyglass Spanish verbs Kain (Legacy of Kain) Spacetime Ultimate fate of the universe CPU design Theodicy Mary Sue G-Man (Half-Life) Friedrich Schleiermacher S__ren Kierkegaard Severus Snape Albus Dumbledore Blood purity (Harry Potter) Multiverse Bulgarian language Linked list Supernatural Logic Sirius Black J.
