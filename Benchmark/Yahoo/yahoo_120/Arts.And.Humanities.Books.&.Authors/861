have you read arianna huffington's book on becoming fearless if so was it good i've read bits and pieces of it i'm not much for self help books i find mostly the only person they help is the author it seems certain concepts in the self help field are in favor then out of favor then someone resurrects them later on with a new slant she does have a nice writing style so if you are into the concept of self help books then you might like it i have read some great self help books written in the form of fiction and i prefer that i loved the princess who believed in fairy tales by marcia grad and the knight in rusty armor by robert fisher there are many others too written in kind of allegorical style i find that more entertaining pax c Fairy tale Literature Children's literature A Course In Miracles C.
