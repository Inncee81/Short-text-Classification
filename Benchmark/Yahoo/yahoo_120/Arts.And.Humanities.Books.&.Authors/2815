should i buy the newest edition version of the book when i searched for the school book on amazon ebay etc i noticed that the newest edition of the book is much more expensive than the previous edition should i buy the newest edition of the book thanks if you're talking about school books in general go ahead and call your instructor professor what he she thinks is necessary sometimes it takes a few years for a company to make a new edition of textbooks and a few pages are off in older editions it really depends on your professor and the class you don't want to be the schmutz with the messed up book it will just complicate everything find out as much possible about your class even ask other previous student if they had a problem with having older books it's good to be prepared Graduate school Amazon.com Textbook Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban GED Diablo II: Lord of Destruction William James Publishing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Yearbook Theory of conduct Professor Marshall McLuhan Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Education in the People's Republic of China Differences between editions of Dungeons & Dragons Hogwarts subjects The Hobbit Book Perl Web traffic Social rule Electronic commerce Economics Microeconomics Lawyer Quarashi Yu-Gi-Oh!
