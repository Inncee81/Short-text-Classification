anyone else hate the questions like my story or rate it plz i ahve done it once beofre i aint gonna lie and i learned my lesson in fact i was wondering if there was a way to delete it but i actually find it funny when people dont like it srry bout grammer and spelling in hurry kind of they might steal the idea also they should let close peeps read 'em gee thanks man i don't hate it however i often warn people that it is not advisable to do it posting a story online automatically eliminates it from being published by practically any publisher in america read submission guidelines publishers do not want material previously posted online period the internet is a playground for plagiarists anything posted online can and will be copied if it has any merit whatsoever bad authors need not worry their work is safe but decent material is stolen every day it a publisher has to worry about tracing a work back to the original owner and proving ownership they will take a pass it just isn't worth it to them to pay lawyers for that kind of work it can be a terrible mess to untangle many sites inexperienced authors post on even have fine print giving them the rights to any and all material posted on their site by posting there you give your work away it is true that your work is your intellectual property and that you own the rights to it the second you write it however those rights are only as good as the lawyers you pay to defend them honestly it usually is not worth it to defend those rights it is too expensive to have a lawyer to defend your rights even if you could track down the person online who stole your work the answer is simple smart authors post nothing online anymore not even on their own websites i closed mine down long ago i had a bad experience when i lost a great story to a plagiarist i posted it on the site of a friend as a favor to him about months later another friend sent me an e mail saying you have to read this great story i did it was my story with someone else's name on it it was hardly worth it for me to pay an internet security specialist to find the guy and a lawyer to sue him i let the story go and closed down my site deleting everything i had posted anywhere i give this information here repeatedly others do too and yet novice writers continue to post material here and at other fiction sites it is very foolish to do it makes your work worth absolutely nothing to you as a source of any kind of income best advice find an unbiased teacher writers group or mentor and show it to them don't post online pax c Plagiarism Plame affair Public domain Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Fan fiction Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Copyright Fair use SCO-Linux controversies Social rule Appeal Scientology versus The Internet Journalism ethics and standards Independent Media Center Surveillance Property (ownership right) Ethics Legal research John Lott Password Slashdot subculture Shaggy dog story Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Canon (fiction) Education Lawyer Internet troll Fair Game (Scientology) Paul W.
