do you think i should put a page of the chapter book i'm writting up here to see if people like it i also would like to know if its a good idea this book im trying to get publish so i would like to hear form people like harry potter fans and any one else intrest on books sure put it up here and make sure you tell people it's copyrighted then just watch how fast somebody can steal it also kiss any chances of ever getting it published good bye because publishers do not purchase work previously posted on the internet it is too easily plagiarized and publishers just don't want to botyher hirign lawyers to track back the chain of ownership to you and make sure the work is clean and not sent to any of the other hundreds of publishers in america and more abroad under another name and as for the so called poor man's copyright i can send myself an unsealed envelope and get it stamped at the post office with today's date then when you post here i can just slip a copy into my stamped but unsealed envelope and just like that i will have proof i owned the piece before you did or i will set the date on my computer back about months and burn a copy of your story showing i owned it before you did do you see where i am going here it is so easy to steal work that it just isn't funny anymore i have actually done it for classes to demonstrate and people are amazed at how easily they can be ripped off think pdf files cannot be copied and are therefore safe i can teach you how to copy them too there is no safe way to post online i say that here every day any copyright is only as good as the lawyer you pay to defend it and unless you are willing to pay significant amounts of money to track down someone who is in another state or even another country and sue them your copyrights are useless what you want to do is join a real life face to face writers group many bookstores and libraries have them or you want to find a mentor a teacher librarian or someone who can help you with your work someone you know where they live and you trust and you just aren't going to find that online it is very unfortunate but the internet is the last place you want to post your work many of the writer sites that allow you to post work have small print giving the site the rights to the story if you post there you lose it and you will never ever get it published because there will be no way you can prove ownership i realize that novice writers get excited about showing off their work there was a time when i did it too but no more anything i write is for sale and i do everything i know how to do in order to protect my work mostly that means not posting it anyplace on the internet pax c United States Postal Service SCO-Linux controversies Public domain Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Copyright Surveillance Fair use Monopoly (game) SCO v.
