can anyone tell me how to get a book published reasonable i have written a really good book and would like to get it published so far the few contacts i have had are asking for large amounts of money isn't there a way that is reasonable who do i need to contact if your book is fiction and it's good you shouldn't have to pay a dime to get your book published if you just want to see your words in print then by all means use a self publisher but if you want to get paid go the traditional route easier said than done but if you believe in yourself and never give up you'll go places first edit your book join a writers group join a critique group in your genre when your work is as good as it can be then start querying editors and or agents you don't need an agent to get published but it's strongly suggested some editors will accept un agented writers but most prefer an agent never pay an agent to represent you and never pay to get your book edited by someone the agents suggests it's a scam yes there are editors out there who are legit and will edit your work for a price but they're not necessary and in my opinion a waste of money you can find plenty of help for free go to their websites and read their guidelines follow them if you can get a copy of writer's market and go to preditors and editors website they have a ton of info on editors and agents http www anotherealm com prededitors you don't need a good cover in fact you probably won't even have much of a say in what your cover will look like that's the publishers problem let your writing speak for itself be professional have faith in yourself and never give up good luck Plame affair Advance fee fraud Oxford English Dictionary Theory of conduct Inflation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Screenplay Internet fraud World Wide Web Economics Contract Capitalism The Amazing Race Peer review XML Social rule Craps Money Crime fiction Microeconomics Web crawler Charles Fort Academic publishing Insurance Style guide Screenwriting Theodicy Open access Publication of Darwin's theory Anarchism and capitalism GNU Free Documentation License History of the English Bible John Lott United States dollar Condon Committee Self-publishing OpenOffice.org MMORPG Deconstruction Free trade Genre fiction Poker jargon HTML Harlan Ellison Capital accumulation Children's literature Biblical canon Intelligent design Newspaper Copy editing Law of value American comic book Richard Stallman Public relations Warez PNG Domain Name System Health insurance Junkie (novel) Galactic Civilizations Laura Ingalls Wilder The Economist Fair use Productive and unproductive labour The Standard Singlish Cult Journalist African American literature Ann Coulter Common Agricultural Policy Democracy Surveillance Alcoholics Anonymous Open Directory Project Legal research Make money fast Publishers Weekly Public good Literature FairTax Sports betting German spelling reform of 1996 Hyperinflation Stock A Course In Miracles Merit Gold standard Crossword A Tale of a Tub Yearbook Ethical consumerism Anarchist economics Public domain John Maynard Keynes
