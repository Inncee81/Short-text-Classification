in the scarlet letter what is the reason given for dimmesdale's ability to touch the soul of others is it because he feels far more sinful than those in his audience i'm not sure but chapters might help well they didn't for me but maybe for you so would this be the reason but this very burden it was that gave him sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind so that his heart vibrated in unison with theirs and received their pain into itself and sent its own throb of pain through a thousand other hearts in gushes of sad persuasive eloquence chapter the interior of a heart while thus suffering under bodily disease and gnawed and tortured by some black trouble of the soul and given over to the machinations of his deadliest enemy the reverend mr dimmesdale had achieved a brilliant popularity in his sacred office he won it indeed in great part by his sorrows his intellectual gifts his moral perceptions his power of experiencing and communicating emotion were kept in a state of preternatural activity by the prick and anguish of his daily life his fame though still on its upward slope already overshadowed the soberer reputations of his fellow clergymen eminent as several of them were there are scholars among them who had spent more years in acquiring abstruse lore connected with the divine profession than mr dimmesdale had lived and who might well therefore be more profoundly versed in such solid and valuable attainments than their youthful brother there were men too of a sturdier texture of mind than his and endowed with a far greater share of shrewd hard iron or granite understanding which duly mingled with a fair proportion of doctrinal ingredient constitutes a highly respectable efficacious and unamiable variety of the clerical species there were others again true saintly fathers whose faculties had been elaborated by weary toil among their books and by patient thought and etherealised moreover by spiritual communications with the better world into which their purity of life had almost introduced these holy personages with their garments of mortality still clinging to them all that they lacked was the gift that descended upon the chosen disciples at pentecost in tongues of flame symbolising it would seem not the power of speech in foreign and unknown languages but that of addressing the whole human brotherhood in the heart's native language these fathers otherwise so apostolic lacked heaven's last and rarest attestation of their office the tongue of flame they would have vainly sought had they ever dreamed of seeking to express the highest truths through the humblest medium of familiar words and images their voices came down afar and indistinctly from the upper heights where they habitually dwelt not improbably it was to this latter class of men that mr dimmesdale by many of his traits of character naturally belonged to the high mountain peaks of faith and sanctity he would have climbed had not the tendency been thwarted by the burden whatever it might be of crime or anguish beneath which it was his doom to totter it kept him down on a level with the lowest him the man of ethereal attributes whose voice the angels might else have listened to and answered but this very burden it was that gave him sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind so that his heart vibrated in unison with theirs and received their pain into itself and sent its own throb of pain through a thousand other hearts in gushes of sad persuasive eloquence oftenest persuasive but sometimes terrible the people knew not the power that moved them thus they deemed the young clergyman a miracle of holiness they fancied him the mouth piece of heaven's messages of wisdom and rebuke and love in their eyes the very ground on which he trod was sanctified the virgins of his church grew pale around him victims of a passion so imbued with religious sentiment that they imagined it to be all religion and brought it openly in their white bosoms as their most acceptable sacrifice before the altar the aged members of his flock beholding mr dimmesdale's frame so feeble while they were themselves so rugged in their infirmity believed that he would go heavenward before them and enjoined it upon their children that their old bones should be buried close to their young pastor's holy grave and all this time perchance when poor mr dimmesdale was thinking of his grave he questioned with himself whether the grass would ever grow on it because an accursed thing must there be buried pax c Human Sabbath John Wesley Sin
