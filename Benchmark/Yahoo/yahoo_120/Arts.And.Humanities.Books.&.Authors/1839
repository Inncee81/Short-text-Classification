publishing a book hi all i'm about finished with a book i've been writing and am wanting to try to get it published i've never published anything before though so i know it will be an uphill battle my first question though is about protecting my work i'm worried if i start sending it out to different places that the idea will get stolen and it'll get written up by someone else how does one protect their story when they want to start sending it to publishers should it somehow be copyrighted is it even possible to get a story copyrighted when it hasn't even been published yet can an unpublished nobody get an agent or should i just go it alone is self publishing recommended for a first time author or should i just try to be persistent with publishing co 's if someone self publishes a book how does it work legally and financially do the author and self publishing co have to share any sales or is it all the authors thanks your work won't get stolen it just doesn't happen if you send it to an agent and the agent likes it he she will sign you up which is much easier than stealing your idea and then finding someone to write it and no offense but truly original ideas are extremely rare anyway as for an agent you almost definitely need one most major publishers will not talk to you without one self publishing is a dead end it's too easy to self publish which means anyone regardless of talent can do it therefore no one will take you serious and the books almost never sell you start by querying literary agents this is done with a one page letter describing yourself and your book sometimes the agent will request you include the first few pages or chapters but that is an individual preference there are several websites out there that will help you find an agent my favorite is querytracker net at http www querytracker net it is free and has a list of literary agents and also tools to help you keep track of who you already queried and who you haven't plus more they do a good job of keeping the crooks off their lists but it is still a good idea to double check at http www sfwa org beware twentyworst html there are a lot of crooks out there never pay anyone to read or publish your book a real agent will never ask for money except as a percentage of your royalties keep in mind that finding an agent and getting published is not an easy process some people have to query hundreds of agents before they find one who will accept them sadly some never get accepted but be persistent and keep trying you should also visit http www absolutewrite com forums one of the largest forums for writers they can be very helpful good luck Publishing Copyright World Wide Web HyperText Transfer Protocol Domain Name System BitTorrent HTTP cookie Web crawler Wget Cross site scripting Intellectual property HTML Extreme Programming Open access Plame affair XML Uniform Resource Locator Fan fiction Copyright law of the United Kingdom Science fiction Microeconomics Common Unix Printing System Vanity press Survivor (novel) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Spyware Publication of Darwin's theory A Course In Miracles Theory of conduct Fair use Ebook Mozilla Firefox Copyleft Chuck Palahniuk Ajax (programming) Literature Copyright infringement of software Advance fee fraud Academic publishing Gnutella PHP Carl Barks Neopets User agent Spam (electronic) Screenwriting Information Technology Infrastructure Library United States Copyright Act of 1976 Francis Crick Tax Wikipedia Garth Brooks Website Amiga Power Ocean's Twelve Slashdot subculture Book E-mail Mutual fund Freenet Capitalism Alcoholics Anonymous Deprogramming 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Phishing Software engineering Autograph Whois Surveillance Quotation mark E-mail spam Captain Britain Mach kernel Internet Relay Chat Laura Ingalls Wilder Leeds United F.C.
