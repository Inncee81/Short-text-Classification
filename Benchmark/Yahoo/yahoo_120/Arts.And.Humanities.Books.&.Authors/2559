i need some ideas for my book i have no ideas for a book but i want to write a book what should i do i owe you lots when you have a good answer start with something you relate to or know about you'll find it hard to write about something that you don't know much about next decide which genre you want to do i like horror and detective stories because of the suspense which draws you in so think up reasons why you want this type of story on a scrap of paper write up simple sentences summarising what's going on in each of these parts of the story beginning build up problem resolution and ending one of the hardest things people find is making up names if possible relate your names to your story if it's a dark horror tale maybe names like danica willow and damon will go well make the title up at the end because you may change things as you go along only include chapters if it is long enough before you start make sure you know every part of your story well is it clear what you are going to do include all the little detail you need so that the readers understand what is going on good luck Extreme Programming Horror fiction A Series of Unfortunate Events DC Comics Theory of conduct Mathematics Socrates The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age) Science fiction magazine Legal research Genre fiction American comic book Chuck Palahniuk Manga Philosophy of language Canon (fiction) Don Rosa Eagle (comic) Little Shop of Horrors GED The nature of God in Western theology Strange Tales Transformation problem Gospel of Mark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Ethics Discordianism Horror film Norse saga Steve Ditko Anne Rice Bernard Williams Arianne Ontological argument Creation according to Genesis Ra (board game) Book of Esther Necronomicon Computer and video game genres Tao Te Ching The Brothers Karamazov Logic Arthur C.
