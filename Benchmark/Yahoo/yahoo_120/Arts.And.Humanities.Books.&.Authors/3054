i'm and am trying to write a short story can you pls read the intro and tell what u think of it so far and tell me what i can do to fix it up and make it better i've been trying to write a novel but it didn't work well for me so i decided to start writing short stories first to get practice so here it is the message running all he could remember was running running at a fast pace trying to escape nothingness that s all that was there nothingness his heart s pulse jumped from ninety to hundred twenty to two hundred within seconds the never ending feeling of dread pity and loneliness followed him throughout the wayward world he was in there was nothing he could do but run no matter how he went about it the feelings would always follow him taking the form of a blank empty form chasing him down the blackened streets nobody was there to help him he was left by himself wandering in his mind hoping everything will just stop in place he kept cursing out loud hoping someone would hear his obscene and desperate cry but the only one to answer his plea was his own echoes that bounced around the empty space before him but then after the echoes stopped the urge to run stopped he stood in place gazing at his surroundings his heart beat slowed down slowly then what he thought everlasting feelings we gone his confusion cleared and then he was suddenly aware it was all a dream his surroundings had begun to dissipate and fade into a new surrounding his room ok look i'm going to be brutally honest here because well everyone else gave you the fluffy answers i'm a writer too and though i'm often mortally offended upon hearing them the opinions that help the most are the ones that tell you what you did wrong not what you did right now i'm going to say that it was an above average standard for a piece by a fourteen year old most don't have the vocabulary you've displayed or the general fluency so this was a good piece now to tell you the bad stuff this piece was pretentious i felt like you were just trying so hard the strain between each sentance was almost unbearable it hung on something i couldn't even see the point to it was a dream that was very typical in amatuer lit and it was generally pretty generic not opening up any interesting alleyways to run with for your character it dragged along like reading thomas hardy for the first time and lets face it you don't have the repute of thomas hardy so there's not much that going to make a reader stay with you if all they're getting is this ok so now that the painful part is over i will say a few things i hope can help you that i learnt when i was studying the short story at university last year basically when it comes to a short story you have a point to get to right i mean you don't have four hundred pages to finally get around to it also the short story is not a very popular form any more in english both of these things mean that if you're not going to do something really different interesting or profound then don't bother writing a short story is hard almost harder than a book because you have to be economic with your language so don't be fooled by the low word count to start with think about what your story means and what you're trying to say or show with it now when you're writing keep that constantly in mind don't include anything useless no matter how pretty or clever it sounds and trust me i come up with a lot of pretty sounding bullshit that it just breaks my heart to delete so i know just start writing and go right through to the end all in one sitting now you can go back through and fix it take out everything irrellevant or repetitive take out anything that seems incompatible with the style or intention you had now you're ready to put more in re write your beginning even if you like the first beginning you had re writing it after the end makes it the strongest point of the piece since you're now in the zone of that idea this is so important because people will not give you a chance if you have a weak fluffy begining to a short story it has to be unique and solid it needs to be distinctly you now look at the ending and maybe go through strengthening up weak parts and now any general editing in the middle that you feel is needed now you've written a short story i have absolutely no doubt that you could write an awesome short story however if people keep stepping around you because of your age then you're the one missing out the most important thing i've learnt is that writing is nothing like acting in the acting world younger people are forgiven for unpolished talent and revered for performances that are below the standard of their adult counterparts in writing you are only judged on your skill you have to be competing with the best because no one will cut you any breaks just because you're young it's more of a belief that young people who aren't good enough shouldn't be doing it now if you want specific advice and you don't hate me yet haha on this piece send me the full thing and i will write you up a criticism that points out the best parts to show you where you go right and the weaker parts to show you what can be fixed i've seen this excert out of context so what i've been saying here might be overly harsh i'm just going with what i've got here i hope i was more helpful than hurtful r wilson yahoo com
