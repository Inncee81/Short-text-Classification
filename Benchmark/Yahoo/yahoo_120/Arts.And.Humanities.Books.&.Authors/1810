enlarge see also enlargement charm enlargement charm similar to an engorgement charm engorgio this causes an object to swell in size the weasley twins put an enlargement charm on a copy of the

revives someone especially someone who has had stupefy cast on them entrail expelling curse invented by urquhart rackharrow effect unknown but presumably involves expelling entrails entrancing enchantment entrances the person the spell is cast upon episkey from the greek episkeyi meaning repair a healing spell tonks used to it repair harry's nose when it was broken by malfoy on the hogwarts express it may also work on bones and may therefore have been the spell lockhart was attempting to cast when he accidentally removed all the bones from harry's arm evanesco latin for to vanish this

phrase expecto patronum means i expect a guardian the patronus charm is highly advanced magic beyond ordinary wizarding level it is used to ward off both dementors and lethifolds and probably works

expelliarmus latin for to expel a weapon this spell is used to disarm an opponent although a simple spell it causes the victim's wand to fly out of his or her hand depriving its victim of his or her primary weapon and means of defense when used by many people on a single target in tandem the spell is powerful enough to knock the target off of his or her feet as was demonstrated on severus snape

flagrantia is latin for burning makes the spell caster able to draw lines of fire with their wand flame freezing charm charm used by medieval witches to remove the effects of the fire when they were burned at the stake it is a good idea at this point to scream a bit and pretend to be burning flying charm different to wingardium leviosa which merely makes objects float in the air the flying charm allows them to be maneuvered by the user and turns them into genuinely controllable flying items the flying charm is used on broomsticks as confirmed by draco malfoy when he was criticising ron's broom in why would anyone put a flying charm on a mouldy old log like that being the words he chose and also presumably flying carpets it is clear that flying charms can be cast only on objects rather than animals or people as it is well known that no spell yet exists that allows a wizard to fly unaided freezing charm used by hermione to immobilise cornish pixies in professor lockhart's first defence against the dark arts lesson following lockhart's pathetic attempt to deal with them himself freezing charms are also effective in disabling muggle burglar alarms fur charm when ginny was

jump out at her from behind statues far from cheering her up however it merely caused her to have nightmares furnunculus makes the victim's body break out in boils when used in conjunction with the jelly legs jinx it causes tentacles to sprout all over the victim's face gripping charm allows a person to grip an object more effectively this was invented in and is primarily used in quidditch to

increase in size the precise differences between these three enchantments are unknown harry got confused during his charms owl and cast a growth charm on a rat he was meant to be turning orange it had grown to the size of a badger before he could stop it hair growth jinx a spell cast on alicia spinnet by miles bletchley before the gryffindor vs slytherin quidditch match in it caused her eyebrows to grow so fast they obscured her vision hair loss curse makes the victim lose their hair covered by professor vindictus viridian in his book on curses and counter curses hair thickening charm causes hair to thicken during the build up to the gryffindor vs slytherin quidditch match in alicia spinnet was hit from behind by a curse from miles bletchley that caused her eyebrows to grow so fast they

of magic such as occlumency either way it is used to block or deflect magic cast as you hives hex causes the victims face to erupt in hives hives are raised lumps on the skin usually caused by an allergic reaction homorphus charm from homo meaning man and morphus meaning transform used to force a werewolf to revert to human form lockhart claimed to have used this against the wagga wagga werewolf he didn't of course but it is likely that it is a real spell horcrux creation spell after committing the act of murder the horcrux creation spell is used to encase the torn portion of the killer's soul into an object or creature this is exceptionally advanced and evil magic and even horace slughorn did not know any details at all of this spell when the young tom riddle asked him about it horn tongue hex turns the tongue to horn harry found this hex in a book when he was trying to work out how to defeat a dragon in the first task of the triwizard tournament he decided not to use it as it would just give the dragon an extra weapon horton keitch braking charm patented by basil horton and randolph keitch this charm aids broomsticks in slowing down in a controlled manner it is used on broomsticks made by the comet company hot air charm causes hot air to stream out of the end of the caster's wand this is similar to relashio but in the case of the hot air charm no sparks are released a complicated wand movement is required to cast this spell but no incantation hermione used it to dry her robes in winter and also to create a path through the snow hover charm makes an item hover in the air famously used by dobby on aunt petunia s pudding hurling hex professor flitwick thought that harry's new firebolt broomstick a gift from sirius black might be jinxed with this hex it is likely that it causes the rider to be thrown off the broomstick immobulus immobilise means to prevent moving stops an object moving the name of this spell comes from the films rather than the books but is included here as it is very likely to be the clever freezing charm used by hermione to immobilise cornish pixies in professor lockhart's first defence against the dark arts lesson see also freezing charm impedimenta impedimentum is latin for a hindrance use to stop or slow down a person or creature as opposed to an object imperio from the latin impero meaning to give orders rule hold sway or imperium meaning power to command rule control the imperius curse this is used to control the actions of another person leaving that person at the mercy of the spell caster the experience of being under the curse is described as a fantastic sense of release until the victim starts to fight back the curse can be fought and its hold broken but many witches and wizards are unable to do so because of its very dangerous implications the imperius curse is one of the three unforgivable curses use of this curse against another human being is punishable by a life sentence in azkaban imperturbable charm impeturbable means not able to be disturbed creates a barrier which sounds objects and people cannot cross impervius impervious means incapable of being affected used to make an object resistant to water incantation free magic whilst the vast majority of spells have a notional verbal component any spell can in fact be cast without speaking by a sufficiently talented wizard it appears that it is the power of the mind and the body which causes the spell to take effect and the incantation is merely a vehicle used to help create the necessary mental and physical conditions for the magic to be successful the more advanced the magic the more difficult it is to cast without its verbal component and even voldemort can be found using the incantation for spells such as avada kedavra non verbal magic is taught in the sixth year and above at hogwarts incarcerous incarcerate means to shut in summons ropes which then bind the victim incendio incendo is latin for set fire to creates fire intruder charm the wizarding equivalent of a burglar alarm it makes an audible signal when the area covered by the charm is entered by somebody or something invisibility spell fred and george weasley used this spell to good effect in their range of headless hats hermione was particularly impressed that they d managed to make the range of invisibility go beyond the charmed object this spell is different to evanesco in that evanesco actually causes the item to cease to exist rather than simply making it invisible inanimatus conjurus from the latin inanimus meaning inanimate and the word conjurus a derivative of conjure a spell mentioned in passing as homework in harry s fifth year the effect is unknown but presumably involves conjuring inanimate objects professor mcgonagall said at another point that conjuring spells were newt level magic and so this is probably a simplified version instant scalping hex removes the hair from the victim instantly harry consulted the book basic hexes for the busy and vexed in preparation for the triwizard tournament and found this spell but discarded it due to the fact that dragons have no hair thats a i i couldn't fit anymore because of the word limit
