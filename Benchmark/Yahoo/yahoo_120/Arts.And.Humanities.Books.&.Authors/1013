wouldnt dumbledore be most powerful wizard book spoiler dont answer if u havent read he had the elder wand and lord voldermort was scared of him and i gurantee dumbledore could kill lord v but he would have to kill harry to do that cuz harry was also a horocux so overall dumbledore was the most powerful am i right dumbledore was powerful but because he never used the elder wand for evil the wand never really had its full effect as legend had told he did not kill voldy because the prophecy wouldn't have been complete if he did harry had to kill voldemort the only way to get rid of the horcrux in harry was to have voldy destroy it because he was the only one willing to kill harry without a second thought Lord Voldemort Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Horcrux Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Death Eater Magical objects in Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix Severus Snape Ron Weasley R.A.B.
