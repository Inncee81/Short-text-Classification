how do you like this little piece i wrote titled compilations of time mark carefully lie on the hospital bed knowing that i am at his side writing his journal of life as he called it he has had a series of operations this being the last with the hopes of curing his fatal disease none of them panned out and now fully aware of his foreboding death wanted to share himself by immortalizing some of his passing words again his tearing eyes opened as he started to whisper in our travels through life we must retain our loyalty and trust with the people that we know and love for it is all that we have to cherish on the voyage to each of our own destinies mark faded off again at the final stoke of my pen so many perspectives at so many different times the finished product should be say the least quite profound once again mark stirred but this time he did not wake up instead rolled to his side with a slight smile on his face by stan a k a captain mozar beautiful words with feeling there are only a few grammatical changes to be made if you were to publish it i don't feel that i should be the one sounds like a great beginning for a book hope you continue and finish the journal you could use flashbacks to further enlighten the reader on mark's life that led up to your beginning add more descriptions his appearance previously and now surroundings etc you go guy Church of Christ, Scientist Shaggy dog story Love and Theft Scenes from a Memory Anne Rice Obi-Wan Kenobi Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Phaedo Out-of-body experience Social rule A Day in the Life Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) All My Children Fitz Hugh Ludlow Alex Ferguson The Cure Days of our Lives Marvel Comics John Wesley The Human Stain Jack Kirby Four Quartets Norway national football team Professional wrestling throws The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends Sin City Peter Pan Milton H.
