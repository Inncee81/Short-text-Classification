who can explain the play salome by oscar wilde to me actually there's a little more to the story in the bible herod's wife is upset because john the baptist is preaching against herod and i believe also against his wife she knows her husband is enamored of her daughter salome's dancing implication seems to be that there may be some incestuous feelings on his part and will give his step daughter anything she wants if she'll dance for him so she instructs her daughter to ask for the head of john the baptist on a charger a metal platter which she does and herod has the prophet beheaded to he assumes please salome in the biblical story salome is innocent of any particular interest in john the baptist she just does what her mother tells her in wilde's play however he gives salome a somewhat decadent interest in the prophet who resists her charms if she can't get his attention in life she'll have him beheaded and kiss his severed head after death wilde liked to epater les bourgeoises i e shock the middle classes and salome is one of the more blatant examples of that tendency in his work Salom__ John the Baptist Salome (opera) Salom__ (play) Herod the Great Dance of the seven veils Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mary, the mother of Jesus Herod Antipas Jesus New Testament view on Jesus' life Historicity of Jesus Chronology of Jesus Joseph of Arimathea Biblical Magi Aretas IV Philopatris Tiberius Christmas Prophets of Islam Salome Alexandra Incest Cultural and historical background of Jesus History of Christianity Prophet Oscar Wilde Gospel of Thomas Christianity and anti-Semitism Dispensationalism Saint James the Great Anne Boleyn Sarah David Caligula History of modern literature Christian views of Jesus Matthew 2 Yoko Ono Pharisees Gospel of James Caravaggio Baptism Succ__s de scandale Gospel of Mark Miss Saigon Christian views of women Muhammad Calendar of saints Decapitation Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Jerusalem Homosexuality and Christianity Charmed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Christianity Lot (Biblical) Mary Magdalene Biblical canon Resurrection of Jesus Michael Cacoyannis Apocrypha Zacharias Cyrus S.
