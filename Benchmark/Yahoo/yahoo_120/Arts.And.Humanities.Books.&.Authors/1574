harry potter hermione granger or tom riddle who was the brightest at hogwarts this is about their stay at hogwarts not adulthood who was the more powerful student yr old granger or yr old riddle both new about horcruxes mortal tom riddle well riddle already knew how to control his powers at such a young age he knew of his special abilities but since you are talking about the time at hogwarts i would have to say that voldemort was a pretty smart person he knew of horcruxes which hermione doesn't know of without harry telling her of it also he thought of the perfect place for the entrance to the chamber of secrets noone knew where it was located and it was so hard to find also riddle already knew how to perform the illegal curses during his time at hogwarts like the time when he killed his uncle he also knew memory modifying charms i'd say he's a smart and powerful wizard and if dumbledore is the only one he ever feared then that means he's only second to dumbledore this leads to the fact that he is powerful and noone can stop him but dumblefore because dumbledore is the most powerful and intelligent sorcerer in the world dumbledore is smarter than hermione therefor telling us that voldemort is more smart and since he doesn't fear anyone else rather than dumbledore then that means noone else can stop him get my drift good question Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Horace Slughorn Hogwarts Ginny Weasley Magic (Harry Potter) Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter: Book Seven Death Eater Tom Riddle Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Horcrux Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Rubeus Hagrid Severus Snape Minor Hufflepuffs Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Battle of Hogwarts Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Hogwarts Houses Blood purity (Harry Potter) Dumbledore's Army Diagon Alley Sybill Trelawney Minor Ravenclaws Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books R.A.B.
