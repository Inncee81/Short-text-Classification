after reading harry potter book i still have questions that i would like to be answered when voldemort tried to kill harry in the forest in chapter why didn't harry died why did he go to the king's cross why did he meet only dumbledore there who is that child in king's cross why didn t harry call kreacher when he needed help since he was his master and he must always respond to harry's requests thanks for the answers and about not reading the book carefully i asked because i wanted to be sure i understood correctly about question i did know that he wasn t in a real station that was pretty obvious but i wanted to understand why he didn t go straight to heaven and about kreacher even before dobby's death harry got into a lot of trouble and he could have asked for kreacher's help and i believe kreacher was clever enough to disapparate without bringing anybody with him but anyway the elder wand knew that harry was it's true master see in half blood prince draco disarmed dumbledore making him the true master when harry took draco's wand that was by force so whoever holds draco's wand is the true master when voldemort cast the killing curse it realized the wand was the one who disarmed it and would not go against it's master therefore backfiring on voldemort and killing him harry went to king's cross because it was symbolism for limbo between life and death harry could take a train on to the afterlife or go back to being alive elisabeth in the chapter of kings cross are they behind the veil or in some world between the real world and the veil j k rowling you can make up your own mind on this but i think that harry entered a kind of limbo between life and death because dumbledore knew that harry wanted to meet him and had some questions for him the child was a piece of voldemort it was the writing child in goblet of fire that wormtail through into the pot it was what voldemort really it it was writhing because he knew a lot of his soul had been ripped apart and destroyed already who knows everything worked out in the end o k for harry here is where i found that quote about king's cross it has information about what happened after the battle their love lives and careers but not everything http mugglenet com app news full story read from the bottom up Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Albus Dumbledore Ron Weasley Magic (Harry Potter) R.A.B.
