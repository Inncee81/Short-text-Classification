did anyone else read eclipse yet i loved it i read it in like hours haha i skipped to the epilouge part i couldn't resist peaking at the ending and was reading the part that was supposed to be jacob and i thought bella turned into a werewolf i was mad i do hope bella becomes a vampire do you i also hope jacob finds his werewolf soulmate other half soon so he can stop being so sad i hope bella becomes one after a few years of college i think vampires are bit like werewolves in that when they're created as young adults they look more mature that's why edward went to graduate school a few times not just because he was mature but he looked it too i know she doesn't want to wait but you have to admit edward is very much older in mind so it won't matter too much about age even though i hope bella becomes one later i think she's going to become a vamp by the end of breaking dawn fourth and last book i think they'll be another conflict involving the volturi because notice how they came after the battle in eclipse they were waiting to see if the cullens died or not the volturi feel threatened by the family because they're so powerful and wouldn't mind if the cullens died though the volturi would like them to join their ranks in italy too i want jacob to imprint too i was holding my breath when bella asked him if he did yet it would have been very dramatic if he imprinted on her lol i was really torn that bella could have experienced humanity get married have kids grow older etc and holy crow i hope he doesn't stay in wolf form forever that'd be so sad when i read that part though i was thinking he was going to ruin bella's wedding by dragging her out by her wedding dress with his teeth haha my weird imagination haha sorry i wrote a lot i'm on a eclipse high Piccolo Junior Saga Undead (Discworld) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jon Secada Knots Landing Vampire Time Out of Mind The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pitaten Sersi Diablo II: Lord of Destruction The Wotch Werewolf Avenue Q Death Comes to Time Charmed EastEnders Angel Sanctuary Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story The Contender (television series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Wolf's Rain K' Miss Saigon Phoebe Halliwell W.I.T.C.H.
