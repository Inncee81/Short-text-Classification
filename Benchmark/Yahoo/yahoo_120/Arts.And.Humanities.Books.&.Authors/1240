how do you read a play i have to read the crucible by arthur miller this summer and i started but just cant get myself to read it i read plenty of books but never a play aside from shakespeare in english class how do you suggest i go about reading a play should i read the lines aloud should i read the stage directions and extras in it your help is appreciated i found it helps if you read a bit of background on the play first maybe read a bit about the characters and the setting then when you do read the play read it like a movie running through your head let the lines take on the voice of the person and try to read it slowly sometimes no matter what i just can't read one sometimes i read it and it seems like i'm there watching it i always though read it with music playing very softly something to distract my mind from the words alone good luck whatever you try The Crucible Tragedy Girls Aloud The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Actor Arthur Miller Royal Assent Milton H.
