aha more about harry potter and the deathly hallows in the epilogue years after the birth of teddy tonks it said that teddy was caught kissing on the train to hogwarts but he was so why is he traveling to the school the last year he would have to attend would be when he was years old how is it that he's going to hogwarts it wasn't mentioned that he was a teacher of any kind in the school and it'd be pretty strange to start school years after everyone unless they repaired the school but it wouldn't have taken skilled wizards and witches teaching there so long to make everything right again and isn't the girl he kissed younger than him because fleur and bill were married around the time tonks and lupin had teddy unless they were expecting a baby before the wedding but that would have been mentioned previously also and if he were a teacher kissing a student wouldn't be the best thing to do i said this exact thing word for word earlier to some one else who said the same thing i've check out a few sites on errors in the books before and here is a site that has a few http www mugglenet com books mistakes a possible explanation is that he was not there to attend hogwarts to explain it i will have to take a section from the book our teddy teddy lupin snogging our voctoire out cousin and i asked teddy what he was doing you interrupted them said ginny you are so like ron and he said he'd come to see her off and then he tole me to go away he's snogging her james added as though worried he had not made himself clear so really he had only come to see her off not planning to go to hogwarts Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hermione Granger Blood purity (Harry Potter) Magical objects in Harry Potter Remus Lupin Hogwarts subjects Minor Ravenclaws Sirius Black Wizarding world Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Battle of Hogwarts Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter: Book Seven Magic (Harry Potter) Nymphadora Tonks Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Rubeus Hagrid Draco Malfoy Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Weasley family Fleur Delacour Luna Lovegood Hogwarts Houses Minor Harry Potter Beasts Lord Voldemort Death Eater Kodocha Half-Blood Prince (character) Bill Weasley Minor Slytherins Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) EastEnders Hogwarts Express Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Viktor Krum Friends Horace Slughorn House-elf Order of the Phoenix Molly Weasley J.
