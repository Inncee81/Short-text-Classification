was there much flap about the ending of the dark tower series i didn't know about y a then but i laughed when i read the end i think the laugh was on me i just wondered because it too was a seven book series that was years in the writing without spoiling people let me say that there have only been a few books that i have thrown across the room after the final page and this was one of them i was kinda teed off at mr king for the strange and unsatisfying feeling that i had when roland's fate was revealed maybe it was just me maybe other people smarter people thought the ending was fitting but i for one thought that such an excellent and involved and absorbing series would have had a bit more something to it in the end far as i know no one's been to upset about it they prolly just laugh it off as a mr king twisty and let it go Spidey Super Stories Piccolo Junior Saga Monty Python Milton H.
