i just read harry potter and i need mooooooreee i just read it and it was awesome i'm so upset there will be no more books it'll take a while to get over so have any of you finished what are ur thoughts of the book and series well i feel the same way jk rowling has decided to write a harry potter encyclopedia which is giving details and backgrounds to characters and such i frequently surf hp sites like mugglenet the leaky cauldron and harry potter also i hope that they do the last two movies because it will still be looked for since so many hp fans have no more books to wait for and many fans are desperate for more harry potter i find other books hard to compare to hp ive started reading some that are fantasy like but none compares quite yet in my local bookstore there is actually a small section dedicated to hp fans who are looking for something similar ive decided that i should get back to my own book writing to help cope with the time Harry Potter J.
