having trouble putting story into words i'm writing a story that i have developed in my head over the past few years the problem is that i'm having trouble putting the story down on paper does anyone have some techniques and or ideas to help me out what i usually do is jot down chronologically all the major events that i know are gonna happen flashbacks changes in character emotions realizations conflicts resolutions all the big stuff next to each item in the list i jot down what i want the reader to feel when they read that particular section that's the most important part remember your job as a writer is to convey a certain feeling or emotion the best writers are the ones who can stir a reader into complicated emotions it also helps to know your characters inside and out i'm sure you've already nailed this so i won't go into much detail but it is important that you really get into their heads make sure you know exactly how a character is feeling at any given moment in your story it helps to jot this down on the story outline that i was talking about also know the relationships between characters know how they feel towards each other at any given moment writing a good novel is tough mostly because you're taking all these fictional characters and trying to make them real what you need to do is know each character as well as you know yourself as for the structure each story demands a different structure but they all have one common thread conflict make sure your character encounters conflict early on in the story then deliberate on how they go about solving that conflict this is very crucial the way a person solves conflict says everything about their character that's about it there's more but my mom needs the computer Screenwriting Internet troll Narrative Storytelling Sigmund Freud Narrator Scientology beliefs and practices Deconstruction Mathematics Classical music era Reset button technique Literature Frank Herbert Compiler optimization Fight Club Short story Blankets (graphic novel) Lisp programming language Scrooge McDuck Traumatic incident reduction Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Science fiction Robert A.
