i want to but the xbox but i want to know if it is worth my money i want to know that if i were to buy one that i would have fun with it the main reason i want it is because of halo but i want to know if that is enough reason to invest in it i use this for all questions like this so it may not suit your question perfectly but this is all my opinion so the doens't have too many games that appeal to me that are exclusives dead rising i didn't really care for halo never a big fan seemed like an average shooter game to me mass effect seems kinda cool but it's not a game that makes me wanna run out and buy for my brothers gears of war is the only game i really liked but it was kinda short and to me doesn't really have much replay value and the hardest mode was pretty cool all the multiplatform games are really the only games that i look forward to on that system ps has the exclusives that appeal to me such as lair killzone ffxiii and versus mgs white knight story warhawk kingdom hearts iii gow iii and heavenly sword are a couple the multiplatfrom games are cool assassins creed call to duty army of two kane lynch dmc the last remnants and a few others are cool and i will get those for my ps plus it can play all my other ps games so i can finish playing those as those games come out all this is completely my opinion so this only appeals to people with similiar taste in games and genres so to answer your question the is better right now since it has a good sized amount of available games while the ps only a has a few but the future games to come out will be much better for sony since the games that are coming soon are the big dogs for that console as for graphics most multiplatform games tend to look better on the and it's kinda obvious since the has been out longer than the ps so companies are familiar with that system so for sony to get games that look better lair than the majority of other games now is pretty good plus it's a more advanced system with blu ray discs that hold more data the online community i don't really care for so xbox live and home don't really matter to me if you do like that then you get free internet with sony the ps remote will be getting the rumble feature back also Halo: Combat Evolved PlayStation 3 Xbox Computer and video games First-person shooter PlayStation 2 Halo 2 Counter-Strike Xbox 360 Computer role-playing game Sega Halo (video game series) Nintendo GameCube Sega Dreamcast Poker jargon Video game music Killzone Video game controversy Machinima Final Fantasy XI Microsoft Rare (video game company) Dead or Alive (video game) Xbox Live Gradius Computer and video game genres History of computer and video games The Sims TurboGrafx 16 Game controller Grand Theft Auto III Guilty Gear Console wars Action Replay History of video games (Sixth generation era) Team Fortress Classic Theory of conduct Sega Saturn Quake III Arena Legacy of Kain MAME Console game Resident Evil Modchip Game programming Massively multiplayer online game Resident Evil (video game) Floppy disk Metal Gear Solid: Integral Double Dragon Sony Computer Entertainment Karaoke Baldur's Gate series Bungie Studios Max Payne Platform game Game engine Jack Thompson Game Critics Awards GoldenEye 007 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Metal Gear Solid Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Super Robot Wars Square Enix Need for Speed Pinball Wipeout (game) America's Army The Legend of Zelda series Thunder Force Golden Age of Arcade Games Grand Theft Auto: Vice City The Sims 2 Metal Gear Final Fantasy IX Super Nintendo Entertainment System Ninja Gaiden Chrono Trigger Bish__jo game Nintendo 64 Nine Inch Nails Timeline of computing 1990-forward Copy protection Ren and Stimpy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Amstrad CPC
