found a website that pepole sell for cheap theres this website call craigs list com and pplz sell there items and stuff that they dont want for like example this guy was selling his xbox like with conrollers and games included should i trust that webiste everybody on there is selling there stuff that they they want answer my question when u go visit the web site craigslists have been around for a long time and im going to say they are safer to buy from then say ebay the reason is because these people listing products are local you take them the cash they had you the merchandise if you are smart about it theres a very slim chance the people can sell you a defected item if you are going to buy the wii go over to the guys house and plug it in to make sure that everything works now craigslist on non local items unless you know someone in the area that can make a trip out there for you i wouldnt bother buying anything because its probably far less secure then ebay Craigslist Neopets Amazon.com Web traffic Live 8 Internet fraud Arbitrage Electronic commerce MAME RuneScape cheats Bulk vending ROM image GunBound Google Maps Retailer Wheel of Fortune Homestar Runner Matrix scheme Monopoly (game) $ale of the Century Xbox 360 PE ratio The Long Tail Phishing Fry's Electronics Online auction business model Mutual fund MapleStory Network effect Attack of the Show!
