what is a realistic time i can expect my xbox back from repair just recently sent my console in for repairs last week and the call center told me to expect my system back in weeks is this realistic considering the number of repairs that must be coming in since they announced the warranty extension month from the date of sending it oh yeah if you have been affected by the ring of death or sumthing they will change the console but i feel that they will give a console which has been sent to them by another customer and yours might go to his so both of you get defective ones again this seems quite possible cos there no way u will find out and the serial number changes too Nintendo Revolution Xbox 360 Xbox Computer role-playing game Warranty Video game console Game programming Nintendo Entertainment System PowerPC Doom 3 Sega Dreamcast First-person shooter Dead or Alive (video game) PlayStation 3 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Xbox Live Colony in Space The Five Doctors The Daleks' Master Plan StarCraft: Ghost Counter-Strike EastEnders PlayStation 2 Leasehold estate Console wars Nintendo Star Wars: Galaxies Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Modchip Microsoft Advance Wars: Dual Strike Trigonometric function History of video games (Sixth generation era) Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Nintendo DS Universal Serial Bus Game programmer Hurricane Katrina timeline NVIDIA BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Sega Hurricane Rita Console game John Sheridan (Babylon 5) TARDIS Trish Stratus ATI Technologies Kurt Angle History of video games (Seventh generation era) Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Doctor Who (Enemy Within) The Sims 2 Need for Speed Halo 2 Rare (video game company) Bond Particle in a box DragonFly BSD Stone Cold Steve Austin The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Ron Weasley Sega Saturn Airbus A380 Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) She Loves You Complex number Game controller Sonic the Hedgehog Console emulator Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 game) King of Fighters Lonely Among Us (TNG episode) Manitoba Hydro Usher (entertainer) Game Boy Advance Digital circuit The Empty Child Nintendo GameCube Sony Computer Entertainment Final Fantasy Electronic Arts Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Rampart (arcade game) Home computer Pyramids of Mars 3D projection Inferno (Doctor Who) Billboard Hot 100 Loss leader Super Nintendo Entertainment System Hall & Oates Light gun Product liability Hurricane Katrina effects by region Pregnancy Computer and video games The Masque of Mandragora Mercury Atlas 6
