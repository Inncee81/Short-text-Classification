am i the only person disappointed in the simpsons movie i've watched every single episode since day seasons were excellent the newest ones are rather drab although they'll still make you chuckle i saw the movie on opening day i thought it was childish and stupid most of the jokes were just toddlerish slapstick comedy wheres the political satire and hilarity present in the early seasons whats so funny about spiderpig marge's expression that's it if you respond saying what do u expect simpsons is childish ur clearly an idiot because u havent noticed the hidden truly funny satire within each and every episode i honestly did not wanna c bart's private parts the disney thing was unoriginal as it has been done in an episode at itchy scratchy land the pig is just some stupid figure to distract homer that's it homer has become annoyingly stupid at this point a lot of u are gonna say i have no sense of humor you stupid ignorant kids dont realize the philosophy and sophisticated humor in the simpsons i am disgusted ok there was like one political satire joke about us invading iraq or something see i dont remember i usually remember quotes thats how forgetable it was a dome wtf u know the town was already moved like miles cuz homer destroyed it in a realy old episode i really have to say that i agree there were a few points that i laughed but it was not near as good as the older episodes i was looking forward to the movie but once i saw it i wasnt impressed it left me sitting there staring at the screen thinking 'that was it all this hype all these years of watching it on tv and that is the best they could do ' so disappointing The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror IX Treehouse of Horror V Itchy & Scratchy & Marge SpongeBob SquarePants Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show Family Guy Another Simpsons Clip Show Homer Simpson Jumping the shark Itchy & Scratchy Land Beavis and Butt-head The Ashlee Simpson Show Meta-reference Fraudcast News A Star is Torn Late Night with Conan O'Brien Peter Griffin Running gag South Park Comedy The Father, The Son, and The Holy Guest Star Mommie Beerest Krusty the Clown Humour Lisa Simpson The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular Lisa's First Word Flanders family I Am Furious Yellow Treehouse of Horror III Treehouse of Horror II Dilbert Treehouse of Horror IV Krusty Gets Busted Stupidity Have I Got News For You One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish Treehouse of Horror VIII Minstrel show Weekend at Burnsie's The Tracey Ullman Show shorts The Regina Monologues Sleeping with the Enemy (Simpsons episode) Jeopardy! in culture Co-Dependent's Day Simpson Tide New Kids on the Blecch Homer Goes to College The Star Wars Holiday Special Teen Girl Squad Shaggy dog story The Cartridge Family Simple Simpson Blackadder Van Houten family Futurama John Swartzwelder Clown One-time characters from The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror XI Homer's Enemy Deep Space Homer Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington The Shining (film) Dead Putting Society Social rule Moe Szyslak 'Tis The Fifteenth Season Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
