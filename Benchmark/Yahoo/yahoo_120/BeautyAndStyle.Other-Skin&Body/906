when i wash my face i get sort of shiny i use an oil free cleanser and after i finish washing my face im sort of shiny i dont like it i try covering it up with makeup but i seriously shine especially my forehead and nose what can i do to reduce shine in my face but i need this cleanser its the only one that works for my acne since you use an oil free cleanser your skin is probably tightening up forming a shiny surface it's not oil it's tight skin my recommendation is to find a milder cleanser or use a bit less of this one the other thing you can do is to follow up w a slightly moisturizing toner and pat your face dry afterwards Cleanser Acne Rosacea Cosmetics Fecal incontinence Scabies Psoriasis Eczema Skin Soap Leather Tattoo Jute Shampoo Tanning Hemp Diving Dandruff Wok Scar Screw Tofu Textile manufacturing Cephalic disorder Moisturizer Bart chalkboard gags Spark plug Yarrow Explosive material Vinegar Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pottery Plastic Paint Androgen insensitivity syndrome Head Minor Harry Potter Beasts Face Drill bit Massage Antiseptic Smoke-screen Keloid Water Shaving Body piercing Sebaceous gland Wound Smegma Upholstery Manicure Color Urinary incontinence Hydraulic machinery Thermal power station Urticaria Rubber and PVC fetishism Apollo Command/Service Module Diving suit Sand casting Heinkel He 100 Bacteria Sulfuric acid Desert Olive oil Limonene Blood (computer game) Professional wrestling holds Fast bowling Hair conditioner Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Glycerin Vegeta Iron Mattress Mooney M20 Jock itch Dune Physical attractiveness Tire Shoe polish Carbon dioxide Dry cleaning Acrylic paint Common cold Wood Car washing techniques Mylar Rainbow Brite Carnivorous plant Cheese Tobacco Professional wrestling slang Humidity Oil well Straw-bale construction Group A streptococcal infection Horse Coffee
