neosporin on skin hi all i had these whiteheads on my nose that i extracted and caused some bleeding the next day the area turned dark brown like it was scarring i peeled off that skin area leaving my skin raw and stinging i decided to use neosporin ointment i know it started working when the redness and rawness were going away but i noticed that the skin growing back was still dark and kind of tough like really thick skin it wasn't normal soft skin at all is this normal when using neosporin is my nose permanently scarred or will neosporin eventually lighten that area with use thanks for any advice it's the normal healing process my bf does that all the time and ends up with a stain that remains on his nose for a couple of weeks but eventually that thick dark skin you're talking about will drop as well you might still see a pinkish spot on your nose just leave it alone and it will vanish and your regular skin will show up again sooner or later Scar Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Acne Mango Tattoo Wound healing phases Radiation therapy Characters in the Smurfs Leon White Leather NWo Aloe Malignant melanoma Human skin color Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Essential oil Sperm Whale Dragon Booster Ulcer Puberty Fancy rat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tuberculosis Weezer Group A streptococcal infection Stomach cancer Piccolo Junior Saga Penis enlargement Gonorrhoea Sunburn Skin graft Smallpox Dehydration The Subtle Knife Birthmark Penis Eczema Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Mystique (comics) Tarantula Body piercing Cheetah Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Four Horsemen (professional wrestling) Tocopherol Ammolite Menstrual cycle Jackie Chan Adventures Anchor Tofu Ric Flair The Empty Child Scarification The Ashlee Simpson Show Terminal ballistics Upholstery Allergy Cosmetics Extraterrestrial skies Static Shock Pneumonia Callus Dandruff Shawn Michaels Waxing First aid Vampire Melanin Spice Girls Meriones unguiculatus Iditarod Paul Levesque Cephalic disorder Rosacea Cleveland Browns Fecal incontinence Potato Greg Valentine Banana Mattress Glen Jacobs Cocoa Cartilage Mummy Wood Tuberous sclerosis Apple Syphilis Tobacco Blonde on Blonde Ozone depletion Snooker The Inside WWE RAW Cancer Kodocha Date Palm W.I.T.C.H.
