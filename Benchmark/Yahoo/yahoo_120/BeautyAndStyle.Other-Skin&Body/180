shampoo's shower gels why is it that no matter what colour the shampoo shower gel is pink green blue when it lathers its always white let us see how soap lathers what makes soap lather soap molecules are long chains of atoms that have two main parts a polar head that is attracted to water molecules and repelled by oil and a hydrocarbon tail that is repelled by water and attracted to oil the hydrophobic water fearing tails of the soap molecules naturally try to get out of a watery solution and collect at any available surface when that surface is air the soap molecules arrange themselves in an orderly layer with the hydrophilic water loving heads in the water and their oil loving tails in the air shaking a soap and water solution introduces pockets of air that when big enough appear as bubbles a thin film of soap molecules coats each pocket creating a bubble when the shaking stops the bubbles float to the surface more soap and more stirring allow the formation of smaller bubbles foam or lather is just a conglomerate of these tiny soap bubbles although many people associate lather with the cleaning properties of soap it is actually an incidental property resulting from the way the soap molecules are drawn to dirt and oil since neither the polar head that is attracted to water molecules and repelled by oil and the hydrocarbon tail that is repelled by water and attracted to oil are coloured the lather is white the chemicals added for colouring the soap do not play any active part in the lathering process Soap bubble Alkane Water (molecule) Soap Liquid crystal Cell (biology) Origin of life Shampoo Water Plastic Lipid Glycerin Brewery Micelle Explosive material Carbon Biochemistry Haloalkane Hard water Carbon dioxide Ice core Polyelectrolyte Sulfuric acid Amino acid Corrosion Fire extinguisher Sewage treatment Hydrogen chloride Corona discharge Sento Ammonia Hydrogen Ozone depletion Vacuum Cracking (chemistry) Ozone layer Acetic acid Motor oil Solvent Textile manufacturing Chemistry Glass Hydrochloric acid Alternative biochemistry Paint Helium Ozone hole Abiogenic petroleum origin Copper extraction Pottery Color Magnet Citric acid Staining (biology) Temperature Ecology Fire fighting Shaving Phospholipid Natural gas Diamond Bong Molecular biology Renewable energy Aromatic hydrocarbon Cloud Mattress Molecule Action potential Tocopherol Formic acid Ethylene Cheese Phase (matter) Oil refinery Naval mine Nuclear magnetic resonance Biological membrane Carrageenan Thermal power station Organic chemistry Polyethylene terephthalate Motility Polychlorinated biphenyl Sulfur DNA Colloid Cell membrane Hydrogen peroxide Nanotechnology Cast iron
