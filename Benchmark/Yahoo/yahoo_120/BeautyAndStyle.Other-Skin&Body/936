any advice going to tanning salon hi i recently went to it and got red not sunburn tho bc its back to normal after a day weird but anyway when iu go back what should i do i used www hollywoodtans com the ht booth is wat i used well first of all you do know the risks of tanning right the people at the most risk for skin cancer are those who have pale skin freckles and a family history of skin cancer regular or prolonged exposure to uv rays can also cause premature aging of the skin sunspots and wrinkles if you still think it's worth it you need to develop a base tan first so go for a low amount of time until you get tan enough to where you can get as dark as you want depending on the power of the booth and how light skinned you are to begin with i would say don't go the maximum amount the first few times i have been tanning a lot and even though i tan in a bed which isn't as strong as the booths when i first started i made sure to go no more than minutes which is about halfway to the maximum time you can go you can gradually go more often and up the amount of time you go but try not to go too frequently or you could pay the consequences and another tip make sure you wear tanning goggles the uv rays can also cause eye damage like cataracts and you want your eyes to be protected good luck Ultraviolet Sunburn Sunscreen Melanin Human skin color Sunlight Tocopherol Malignant melanoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Cancer Physical attractiveness Ionizing radiation Welding Ozone depletion Puberty Sun tanning Leather Paintball Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ozone hole Swimming Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Decompression sickness Albinism Incandescent light bulb Solar variation Mobile phone radiation and health Light pollution Cephalic disorder Fluoroscopy Skin cancer Cryptorchidism Diving Stereoscopy Ozone layer Thimerosal Dragon Booster Intravenous therapy Human adaptation to space Herpes simplex virus Sleep Nuclear power Vitamin D Black Poker jargon Cheetah Sun Breastfeeding Ra (board game) Tobacco smoking Polycystic ovary syndrome Red hair Sunglasses Poison Hypoglycemia Birthmark Arc welding Betting (poker) Childbirth Elephant Redneck Smoke-screen Tropical cyclone Actinic keratosis Doxepin Electroshock gun E85 Chlorpromazine Scar Tattoo Uranium DNA repair RuneScape Colorectal cancer Weight training Laser safety Insurance Leopard Radiation poisoning Winning Streak Eczema Jaundice Rosacea Battle of Long Tan Cat Equine conformation Combine (Half-Life 2) Condom AIDS Fecal incontinence Armored Core 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate RuneScape skills Theory of conduct
