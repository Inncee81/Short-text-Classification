what products would you reccomend for combination oily skin my skin is a bit more on the oily side but only in the t zone area like after i wash my face or get out of the shower it goes from slightly shiny to shiny um regularly shiny i guess you can say in about minutes i use proactive cleanser toner and moisturizer every night and a gentle face wash or sometimes dove moisturizing body soap in the morning i really hate my skin looking like this because it gets real oily if i don't check on it every couple of hours also my pores are big especially in the nose area how can i make them go away my face is pretty clear except for a couple pimples every now and then i just turned so i'm not really sure if i'm ready to use foundation or powder on my face yet oh and some home made remedies would be nice too thanks so much try no to use the dove soap it tends to dry out the skin when you dry out the skin the pores try to compensate for the lost moisture and they produce more oil then you have more shine use a cream cleanser decleor and caudelie make a great cream cleanser i think clinique has a gentle cleanser too smashbox makes a great mattifier that helps take the shine away by just patting a bit on the oily areas stila makes a great tinted moisturizer for a little bit of coverage instead of a foundation Cleanser Psoriasis Fecal incontinence Soap Acne Cosmetics Shaving Eczema Dry cleaning Tattoo Dandruff Skin Sento Dialysis Tofu Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Dairy Glycerin Rice Textile manufacturing Massage Hemp Jute Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Shampoo Wood Smoke-screen Scabies EastEnders Urinary incontinence Urticaria Soap opera Instant coffee Vinegar Diaper Weather lore First aid Wok Aloe Antiseptic Straw-bale construction Diving suit Diving Pepper spray Futurama (TV series - season 5) Manicure Bart chalkboard gags Michael Jackson Social rule Est__e Lauder Inc.
