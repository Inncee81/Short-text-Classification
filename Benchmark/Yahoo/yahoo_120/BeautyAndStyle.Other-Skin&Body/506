could you use bubble bath in the shower ok so theres this store i love called lush they have these things called bubble bars they look like bath bombs but they arent when you put them in ur bath they bubble up and they smell awesome i recently went to my one lush store and won a bubble bar called sunny side it is gorjuss it is very very sparkly and gold it looks like a sparkly gold nugget and smells like citrus it says on lush's website tht you could cut it up into little pieces to use multiple times unfortunatly i dont take baths much at all but i love the smell and look of this so could i cut up a small piece of this and rub it all over my body in the shower after i wash myself just for the scent and the sparkles i dont see why it would do any harm kendall xoxoxoxoxoxooxox i suppose you could try it something interesting might happen but why don't you just have a bath and see how it's meant to work first btw i love lush too Social rule Sento Swimming pool Towel Bathing The Pilgrim's Progress Sauna Niddah Ayyavazhi mythology Teen Girl Squad Textile manufacturing Changeroom Little Britain Skunk Phoebe Buffay's songs Menstrual cycle Perfume Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 Aztec Japanese toilet RuneScape quests Goldfinger Sonic the Hedgehog Miami, Florida Hyperthermia Sin City Dymaxion house Champagne (beverage) Animal communication Gold as an investment Craps Bong Bubble memory Cosmo Kramer PE ratio Happy Tree Friends Faye Wong Flower RuneScape locations Jennifer Lopez Oral sex Supply-side economics Hashish Olfaction Swimsuit Clothing Okashina Okashi Ex-gay RuneScape Mini-Games Scarification Felis sapiens Shaggy dog story Hamster Sushi Naruto jutsu Cheese Gaia Online Customs and etiquette of Japan Decompression sickness Glass Justification (theology) Sulfur Fountain Casting Blythe Cat Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Milton H.
