should i cover my acne scars with make up or let them be i have a lot of acne scars on both sides of my cheeks i've been dealing with acne for about years now and now by some miracle it's starting to settle down the only problem is that these old scars don't seem to fade i've been using mederma but i'm not seeing improvements it feels like everyone's looking at my scars when they talk to me should i cover up my acne scars with make up or just leave them alone i have a set of special make up made with teatree oil that's supposed to give a clean cover without blocking pores or making acnes worse but it looks somewhat weird since some of my acne scars left indentations in my skin t t how do i get rid of these lasering away scars really work best answer will be rewarded before committing to any specific method of treatment for your scarring make sure you do a lot of research first every treatment option has pros and cons and every treatment option will improve the appearance of some people s scars while worsening the appearance of others these treatments can also be very expensive which means you need to be very selective about your dermatologist sometimes they re in it for their patients other times they re in it for the money here are some tips to help you pick the right skin doc for you when initially selecting a dermatologist visit several different ones contrast what the different doctors tell you and follow it up with a little research of your own to determine which one is really the best for you beware of doctors that pressure you to commit on the first visit and push new and expensive procedures on you search for the doctors name with quotes in a search engine like google and see what you find if you re not comfortable with any of them move on and keep looking get each doctor to tell you very specifically what course of treatments they would prescribe for your scarring and then get them to explain to you in plain english exactly why they are prescribing that particular course if you think you may forget write it down or bring along a voice recorder follow up their advice with your own research and if you receive opposing treatment plans bring them up to other dermatologists and see how well they respond insist on seeing before and after pictures of their previous patients how many of the people in the before pictures have scarring that resembles yours can you contact any of these people how long have they been practicing dermatologists what treatments do they have experience prescribing and performing there is certainly no shortage of creams and balms that claim to cure everything from impotence to scarring but do they work creams containing cocoa butter and vitamin e help keep your skin soft elastic and healthy regular use of such creams may help scars diminish naturally over time i would recommend combining this with an overall healthy lifestyle apply a x solution of medical grade hydrofluoric acid or a product which contains it to the scarred area twice daily for one to two weeks do this only under the supervision of your dermatologist because this can damage your skin best of luck babe and remember don't try to cure his is cheap stuff from stores i doubt any of them work so save up some cash or whatever you need to do and go visit a good dermatologist so he can help you with that Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eczema Dermatology Cancer Homeopathy Baldness treatments Radiation therapy Malignant melanoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Pneumonia Urinary incontinence A Course In Miracles Rosacea Chocolate Stuttering Breastfeeding Expert system Multiple sclerosis Skin Tocopherol Migraine Isotretinoin Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cirrhosis Transsexuality Theory of conduct Bipolar disorder Microeconomics Herpes simplex virus Medical analysis of circumcision Lupus erythematosus Autism Scientology beliefs and practices Insomnia Nutrition Quackery Antidepressant Tuberculosis Milk Smallpox Physical therapy Church of Christ, Scientist Gastroesophageal reflux disease Fibromyalgia Osteoarthritis Dialysis Psychiatric hospital Clinical depression Dairy Retinol Medical prescription Ultraviolet Graduate school Chlorpromazine Diabetes mellitus Milton H.
