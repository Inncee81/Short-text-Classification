multi vitamin pills for acne please help i have multi vitamin pills by natures made is it good for helping acne or bad please help me vitamin a and e generally help the skin but overdoing it can be bad for you make sure if you use supplements that you avoid eating too many foods containing beta carotene like orange fruits and veggies you'll turn orange and likely have problems related to overdosing on beta carotene if you really want to up your vitamins it's better to get them from whole foods carrot sticks make a transportable snack or side and cantaloupe is in season any of the squashes would also help winter squashes have to be cooked but summer squashes like yellow and zucchini can be eaten raw or cooked why don't you ask your doctor about taking beta carotene supplements they are really what you need along with eating foods cooked in olive oil or other high omega oils but beta carotene can be dangerous which is why you need to ask your doctor there are plenty of soaps as well that promise clearer skin generally fragrance free soaps that moisturize like lever and dove are better for your skin than harsh deodorant soaps like irish spring there are also creams or astringents that are made specifically for acne if you want a topical medication if you have trouble with the oxy products whose active ingredient benzoyl peroxide is an allergen for some you can use stridex pads which use salicylic acid if that even irritates your skin you might have to abandon topicals vitamins can help your skin as long as you're taking the right ones below is a site which talks about vitamins for acne the reason i mention the topicals and the soap is sometimes a three pronged attack works better than using only one or two methods it helped me to not eat greasy food i cooked a lot and realized by cooking ground beef or other greasy foods i would end up with grease on my face so if you do cook make sure you are washing your face after cooking anything that spatters it also helped me to reduce my sugar intake everyone is different so even if the vitamins don't work or any other method i've mentioned there is always something out there different good luck i had trouble with acne as a teen and was allergic to everything whatever you do try to avoid antibiotic treatment for your acne i developed an allergy to sulfa drugs and tetracycline because they were used to treat my acne they really aren't necessary if you can find out what's behind your acne problem and fixing it instead of just focusing on the symptom if you have a lot of painful large acne cysts i'd recommend seeing a dermatologist they are usually brought on by hormonal changes and the doctor can give you stronger topicals and recommend specific vitamins if you're trying to be as natural as possible in your treatments Tocopherol Fecal incontinence Vitamin D Veganism Food Eczema Vitamin Folic acid Vitamin C Milk Prostate cancer Insulin Allergy Nutrition Guinea pig Scar Rosacea Common cold Omega-3 fatty acid Cancer Atherosclerosis Dietary fiber Pharmacology Osteoarthritis Stomach cancer Vegetarianism Asthma Raw food diet Crohn's disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Soap Breastfeeding Shampoo Mouth ulcer First aid Garlic Hay fever Rice Hamster Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tattoo Carrot Dandruff Hydrogen peroxide Alzheimer's disease Diarrhea Hypoglycemia Chocolate Migraine Aloe Sewage treatment Coffee Anorexia nervosa Baldness treatments Herpes simplex virus Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Soybean Dieting Dermatology Rooibos Squash (fruit) Peanut Medicine Colorectal cancer Potato Fibromyalgia Aspirin Tooth enamel Gastroesophageal reflux disease Essential oil Breakfast Multiple sclerosis Ice cream Soy milk Golden rice Tooth Cannabis (drug) Foodborne illness Protein Olive oil Clinical depression Ultraviolet Perfume
