cartilage piercing i am in months and my mother agreed that if i still want one when i am i can get my cartilage pierced i was thinking of getting a regular helix piercing in my right ear and when that heals up a midhelix on my left ear maybe of them one after the othr i was wondering if this would hurt a lot and if it would be possible for me to get a freezing spray or something to lessen the pain it is possible to use a freezing spray if your worried about the pain but some people say that it can slow down the healing process i prefer not to use it its only for a few short seconds that you will feel it being pierced thats all the freezing spray can reduce then it will be sore for a couple of weeks if that the freezing spray cannot stop that however its not an unbearable feeling as long as you look after the piercing and keep it clean you have plenty of time to research into it and find information on aftercare good luck Body piercing Earring Breastfeeding Myxobolus cerebralis Social rule Cartilage Tattoo Equine conformation Ear Piercing migration Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Ear piercing instrument Traumatic brain injury Paget's disease of bone Mouth ulcer Piccolo Junior Saga Nose piercing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Contender (television series) Team Fortress Classic Blood (computer game) Tongue piercing Dobermann Swimming Milton H.
