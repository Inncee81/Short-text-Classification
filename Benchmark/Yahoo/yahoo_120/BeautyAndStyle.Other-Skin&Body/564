oily skin problem it is so annoying that i have oily skin no one in my family has this problem except me i wash my face every day twice in the morning and at night with warm water after i wash my face i put my acne medication that my doctor told me to use and then i put cream on my face my face turns oily like every hour and when it does i use an oil wipe to take it off it is annoying especially when i'm at school or when i have to go somewhere because i always have to go to the bathroom every chance i get to take off the oil what can i do to not have an oily face i eat healthy and i drink lots of water everyday the face wash i use is called oil free acne wash by neutrogena and the cream i use is called complete all day moisture cream spf normal by olay i have no acne on my face i know that the face wash is not causing the problem because i have tried other face wash products and my face still turns oily after an hour or so i went a day without putting the cream and still oil neutrogena sucks i have oily skin to and i use this stuff i get from sephora called boscia combination skin wash it has made all the difference and it's all natural with no harsh chemicals they also have these little papers that blot oil off your face the problem with most face washes for oily skin is that they try to dry your face up with alchohol or harsh chemicals then your face fights back by producing more oil so i would suggest using natural botanical products that work with your skin not against it i like bare naturals boscia and arbonne Acne Eczema Fecal incontinence Dairy Water Urinary incontinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ice cream Puberty Oily fish Scabies Jute Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Moisturizer Scar Smoke-screen Chocolate Town gas Hamster Menstrual cup Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.
