should i get my tongue pierced well i'm years old female and have other piercings lobes lip monroe nostril conch the tongue piercing is supposed to be the least painful piercing but i know the pain is different for everyone and it's not something i'm overly concerned about as i have a fairly high pain tolerance i have no allergies and have had no complications with any of my piercings before the only thing i am a little concerned about is that my tongue isn't really a normal pink colour it's more whitish i have good brushing habits so i don't see how it could be a problem as far as if you should get it or not thats a personal decision but mine didnt hurt when they did it at all and im affraid of needles lol it does swell and hurt a little for a couple of days after its done but remember you have to be your own person if you want to do it go for it dont let anyone judge you because of it its a personal preferance if they dont like it or understand it its there tough luck good luck Body piercing Earring Oral sex Nipple piercing Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Body modification Breastfeeding Diving Tongue piercing Marilyn Monroe Ear piercing instrument Tattoo Knife Penis Nose piercing Kim Possible Patrick Star Goodness and value theory Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Obstetrics Spider Arguments for and against drug prohibition Alcoholics Anonymous Social rule Allergy Hangul Utilitarianism Procrastination Phimosis Trumpet Intravenous therapy Vampire Franklin Pierce First aid Equine conformation Boom Crash Opera Value system Traumatic brain injury Indian English Political correctness Nine Inch Nails Vowel The nature of God in Western theology Ethics Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theodicy Anderson Cooper Atomic Kitten Transactional analysis Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Pneumonia Controversies in autism Pachypodium key to species Havanese Ronnie Earle Cultural relativism Twelve Swords of Power Physical attractiveness Ownership Cocaine Naruto jutsu Corrosion J__y__ kanji Stuttering Piccolo Junior Saga Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Intersex surgery Luck Halitosis Timon and Pumbaa Kawasaki disease Milton H.
