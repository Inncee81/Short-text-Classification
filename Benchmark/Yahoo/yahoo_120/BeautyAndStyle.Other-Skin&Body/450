sunburn and proactiv i was out on the lake today and forgot to put on sunscreen stupid i kno but my face isnt that bad but its still burnt and i was wondering if i could use my proactiv still will it burn or make it worse thanks in advance i was outside all day in a soccer tounament and i got a sun burn on my face aswell i used proactive to wash my face and yes it does sting a little bit but its not a really bad sting i have sensitive skin so i think that you should be alright to use it aswell just dont scrub as hard because i noticed that does irritate it if you do try and it feels too uncomfortable you should probably not use it untill your sunburn gets less sensitive if this is so try a substitute cleanser thats more gentle hope i helped Psoriasis Sunscreen Sunburn Rosacea Fecal incontinence Cleanser Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Social rule Aloe Milton H.
