playboy bunny tattoo i am unsure as to why people would find a tattoo of the playboy bunny offensive i feel that by getting that tattoo in a area like your back or belly you are showing that you are in touch with your sexuality and comfortable with the way you look i just wanted to get some people's opinions thanks alright well first of all i like your attitude about it i feel that people who warn others against getting certain tattoos or whatever done because they'll regret it later in life should just shut it i believe that if you want to do something to your body then do it you don't want to get old and look back on life and regret not living and doing the things that you wanted with that being said i'm going to be completely honest with you i think the playboy bunny is such a cliche symbol it doesn't really hold a lot of meaning anymore i think tattoos should be more personal and have a lot of meaning but don't listen to my opinion just do what you want to your body and screw what others say Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist One Tree Hill (TV series) Sexual revolution Sexual orientation Playboy (magazine) Joke Homophobia Tattoo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anderson Cooper Sluggy Freelance Self-harm Theory of conduct Britney Spears The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Social rule Anya Jenkins Earth Girl Arjuna Irezumi Clothing Straight edge Shaggy dog story Marilyn Monroe Friends Criminal tattoo Kender Past teachings of Prem Rawat Stewie Griffin Sexually-transmitted infection Current teachings of Prem Rawat Pip (South Park episode) Highway 61 Revisited Gay Capital punishment Treehouse of Horror XV Cliff Richard Body piercing Earring The Death Gate Cycle Patricia Ford Honey and Clover Rick Santorum Human sexual behavior Super Mario 128 Karen McDougal Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Jon Secada Laws of Singapore Characters in the Smurfs Pamela Anderson Transactional analysis Ed Wood, Jr. Goatse.cx Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Ron and Fez Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ty Cobb One Piece minor characters Big Brother UK series 6 Sharon Tate Brian Griffin Amy Dumas Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Real Love (song) Time Out of Mind EastEnders Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Weezer Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Gesture Smallville (Season 4) Yoko Ono Strap-on dildo Lie Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Ion Davidov Laura Schlessinger Lonely Among Us (TNG episode) Wonderland (McFly album) Motion picture rating system True Crime: Streets of LA Year of the Spider Herbert Garrison Rape A Hard Day's Night (song) Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Abortion debate Repentance Polyamory Transsexuality Sex and the City Coming of Age (TNG episode) Love Maison Ikkoku Batman Elijah Wood I Want to Hold Your Hand Ouroboros Liam Gallagher
