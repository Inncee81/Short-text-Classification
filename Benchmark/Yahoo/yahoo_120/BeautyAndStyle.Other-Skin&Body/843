i just got my cartilage pierced today and i was wondering i cleaned for the first time when i got home and took a shower the guy said to spin it its a ring and i did but it didnt spin easily and hurt a lot is that normal did it not spin well because it was the first time i did it after i got it pierced any advice for how to take care of it thanks it is pretty normal for that to happen i mean you just got a piece of metal shoved through your ear it is bound to hurt for a couple of days i got mine done a few months ago and i used some salt water to soften up build up around the ear it makes it hurt a little less and makes the healing process faster you can also use some neosporin or other first aid cream like that it also helps it to heal faster and i also use bactine but i would wait a few weeks because it is pretty rough and has alcohol in it but it does make it hurt less Earring Body piercing Social rule Nine Inch Nails Breastfeeding Violin Earwax Textile manufacturing Psoriasis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Swimming Brewery Temporal bone Manicure Cliff Richard Nose piercing Sonic X Dog Tattoo First aid Fast bowling Futurama (TV series - season 5) Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Age of Mythology RuneScape skills Kim Possible Hydrogen Janet Jackson Traumatic brain injury Terran (StarCraft) Hard water Leon White YuYu Hakusho Ayyavazhi mythology Theory of conduct Casting 2000 Australian Grand Prix Osteoarthritis Archery Ice cream Occipital bone Paget's disease of bone Sauna Equine conformation Wound Knife Jon Secada Second Battle of the Atlantic Franklin Pierce Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ear Shot of Love Myxobolus cerebralis Link (Legend of Zelda) Team Fortress Classic InuYasha (character) Otitis externa Certified Nursing Assistant Sewage treatment The Family from One End Street Naruto jutsu The Inside Time Out of Mind Gramophone record Bob and George Corrosion Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Drill bit Diving Slayers Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Hamster Diamond Lip piercing Bathing Smallville (Season 4) Negima Hemp Empire Burlesque Pitaten Bone fracture Mandible Skin Characters of Naruto Smoking pipe Lathe USS Yorktown (CV-10) Mississippi John Hurt The Apprentice 2 Sternum Horse Tongue piercing EastEnders Fiberglass Niddah Cartilage Fecal incontinence Fiddler on the Roof Wolverine (comics)
