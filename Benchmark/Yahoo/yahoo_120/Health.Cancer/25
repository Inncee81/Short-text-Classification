tony snow several questions concerning his cancer did white house press secretary tony snow have all of his colon removed years ago and does he have a colostomy during an interview yesterday w brian williams he looked very sick has the cancer spread to his liver what's his prognosis my prayers are with him and his family at this time if he had his colon removed he probably has a colostomy he recently found that his cancer had metastasized after being 'no evidence' of disease for two years this is not uncommon for a cancer patient 'no evidence of disease' does not mean it is not still there it just means that no one can see it and the imaging tools we have cannot pick up microscopic cancer cells so the cancer can 're occur' but actually the cancer never left it was just too small to see no one knows what the prognosis is for each individual fighting this type of cancer even if it has spread to the liver the secondary source can be removed and prognosis good much really depends on the size of the tumors if they are small than surgery or a process called radio frequency ablation is a possible means to remove them tumors attached to the outside of the liver are easier to treat than ones located inside the liver my son has had successful surgery to remove tumors on the outside of the liver and caked onto the diaphragm hundreds about the size of quarters so i know it is possible to do i also know people who have had rfa to ablate their liver tumors which worked well too tony snow is a brave individual to continue working while under treatment for such a brutal disease i have great admiration for snow and elizabeth edwards and for anyone living with cancer and that's what it is living with cancer hopefully he will be able to stablize the disease and stop any tumor progression if he can find the right combination of medication he can control the disease and live with it much like elizabeth edwards will be doing this does not mean it is cured it means the disease is controlled in the same way that diabetes can be controlled but not cured Lung cancer Colorectal cancer Malignant melanoma Brain tumor Breast cancer Esophageal cancer Hepatocellular carcinoma Oncology Soft tissue sarcoma Renal cell carcinoma Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Leukemia Pneumonia Multiple sclerosis Folic acid Radiation therapy Bone marrow transplant Testicular cancer Thyroid cancer Stem cell Osteosarcoma Chemotherapy Cirrhosis Endometrial cancer Acromegaly Diabetes mellitus Liver Crohn's disease Gastrointestinal stromal tumor Epilepsy AIDS Prolactinoma Hypoglycemia Hirschsprung's disease Carcinogenesis Psoriasis Atherosclerosis Multiple myeloma Cancer of the larynx Schistosomiasis Radiosurgery Ulcerative colitis Organ transplant Helicobacter pylori Mesothelioma Penile cancer Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Krukenberg tumor Gene therapy Acne Gynecomastia Fecal incontinence Familial adenomatous polyposis Alzheimer's disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Growth hormone Aortic dissection Lupus erythematosus Endometriosis Wilms' tumor Intersex surgery Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Inflammatory bowel disease Insulin Homeopathy Atrial fibrillation Diarrhea Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Cervical cancer Medical analysis of circumcision Chlorpromazine Vitamin D Abortion Hypertension Tuberculosis Prognosis IgA nephropathy Interferon Growth hormone treatment Malaria Traumatic brain injury Cholesterol Osteoarthritis Duesberg hypothesis Hepatitis C Pancreatic cancer Virus Vitamin C
