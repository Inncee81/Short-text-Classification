too many myspace bulletins has anyone out there deleted friends becaus ethey post too many bulletins i have a few some friends who post way too much they post bulletins about every little thing and things that no one even cares about why do they do this you are definitely not alone i've recently had to delete around 'friends' who were spamming my bulletin board with all manner of crap i have no idea why they do it they are out of control extroverts perhaps i would suggest that if you know them well enough to raise it you could send a private message to them asking them to limit bulletins to major news only they probably have no idea that it is irritating and really believe that people want to know all that stuff about them after all myspace is about sharing your life with your online friends some people just get a bit overzealous failing that i'd have to say that unfortunately the only way to stop it is to delete them as a friend Internet forum MySpace Newsgroup Neopets Spam (electronic) Internet troll Blog Social software Computer virus E-mail spam Everything2 Bulletin board system Usenet 2channel Cultural Revolution Anonymous remailer Gmail Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail News Corporation Prodigy (ISP) Modem Facebook (website) Advertising Meow Wars ITV The Smashing Pumpkins Public domain Short message service Mergers and acquisitions Ex-gay Newsgroup spam GameFAQs message boards Star Trek: Enterprise YaBB Newgrounds Infantilism Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Carnegie Mellon University Socrates Virtual community Cross site scripting Steam (content delivery) Viral marketing LiveJournal MDAC General Mayhem Kasparov versus The World Altruism Architecture of Windows 2000 Independent Media Center Scientology versus The Internet Little Britain Open Directory Project Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Internet fraud Boards of Canada The Best Page in the Universe FidoNet Religious Society of Friends Care Bears Instant messaging AOL Instant Messenger Computer security Democracy IGN Psychoanalysis Surveillance MetaFilter Slashdot Dave Matthews Band Imageboard B3ta God Emperor of Dune Hollyoaks Online service provider Spam Prevention Early Warning System MSN Messenger Advance fee fraud First post Brian Lenihan Forum moderator Society and Star Trek Rupert Murdoch MoveOn National Kidney Foundation Singapore BBC News America Online Space opera in Scientology doctrine Objectivist philosophy Democratic Underground Project FUBELT Something Awful Forums Polyamory Tiberius Mail Public-key cryptography Avenue Q
