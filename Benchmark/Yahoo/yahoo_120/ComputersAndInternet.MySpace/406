myspace pics i noticed on a few peoples myspace pages where their interests are sometimes they have pictures up like for example for their favorite movies they have a picture of a movie like just say it was the matrix a picture of the matrix how do you put pitcures in your interests i want to do that my friend all you need to do is go to www photobucket com and look up what you want to put on your page this site has thousands of images you can use once you choose what pictures you want to use left click the html tab this will copy the code for that specific image now go back to edit profile and you should see several boxes interests books movies etc right click the box you want the image to appear in and choose paste don't forget to click on the save changes or all your work will be for nothing the box about me is for your layout only don't put anything else in there because it will make it harder for you to change it when you want to a helpful hint when you paste an image in the boxes follow the code with three dots this makes it so much easier to figure out where one image ends and another starts MySpace Opera (web browser) Macromedia Flash Cascading Style Sheets Mouse (computing) Patricia Ford JPEG HTML Digital photography Screenshot PostScript Prank flash Web traffic Opportunity rover HTTP cookie Hello world program Yearbook International Phonetic Alphabet ASCII art Photography GameFAQs Facebook (website) Editor HTML element Paul W.
