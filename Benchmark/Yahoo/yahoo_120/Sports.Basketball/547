the top two western conference powerhouses there can only be two teams at the top right now so out of the spurs mavs and suns lakers rockets jazz who gets to be number and number note not trynna hate but the suns have not been to the finals so my opinion is the mavs and spurs although the mavs have hurt themselves by losing to an th seed but i think since they have beaten the spurs they should be number two the the spurs the jazz and lakers have not been in the finals for a long time so i'm not sure if that counts what is y'all opinion the spurs are definitely number although many may say that they style of play isnt excited who needs excitedness when they have won championships in seasons although from the trend they will not repeat as champions this up coming season they should be in line to win there final championship for this decade the following season as tim duncan and the others would something to prove to the world that they are still good at what they do best playing fundamental basketball to bad that big rob wont be aroung to win his th championship then my second choice is a harder one since there are two other elite teams in the west namely the suns and the mavericks however although i like the mavs i will lean towards choicing the suns as the second power house in the west although some may say that mavs plays better defense that the suns and also the suns havent reach the nba finals which the mavs did two seasons ago and have really improved as a unite since then my choice of the suns has nothing to do with the fact that the mavs were knocked out of playoffs in the first round by a number seed however if they had return as far as the western conference finals it would have been an automatic choice of them been the nd best team in the western conference however this is the reason why i have choosen the suns as the nd best team in the west they have three all star players in nash the best true point guards in the league just added of kidd mainly because of kidd age and also ahead of baron davis as injuries after injuries has affected davis from showing how great he would have actually been secondly stoudemire is a beast in west and he suites the suns offensive style and third their is aka matrix or shawn marion who honestly am not a big big fan of but this guy is a gem although some may say its the suns style of play why he is so efficient and effective i would disagree with that this all star player of course by his consistency is capable of putting up good numbers with whatever team he plays with cause he play hard and enjoys crashing the boards the supporting cast of barbosa bell diaw jumaine jones jalen rose marcus banks and the recent acquire grant hill the suns just edge out a mavs side which includes all star nowitizki and cast such as josh howard and devin harris who will be a good player down the road plus jason terry who has proven himself as a good scorer jerry stackhouse greg buckner erik dampier desagana diop devean george and recently acquired eddie jones a fact that we all have to look at is chris webber although his all star performance is behind him if the mavs can land a big fish like him from the pistons that should increase their chances of hoisting the david obrien trophy come next year june however this is why we all watch the game cause its unpredictable and full of excitement also as a true fans of the sport we all enjoy pretending to be owners now and then and see what trade or who player can put our favourite team to the next level and win it all Water polo Yao Ming Steve Nash Tim Duncan 1986 NBA Draft Baseball Glossary of American football January 2005 in sports New York Knicks Badminton Toronto Raptors Robert Horry Ben Wallace Chick Hearn Table tennis American football New York Giants Indiana Pacers Michael Jordan Utah Jazz Professional wrestling attacks Tennis Ultimate (sport) Poker jargon Houston Rockets Professional wrestling slang 2004 NBA Finals Fast bowling Billiards Cincinnati Bengals Eight ball New Jersey Nets December 2004 in sports Aerial (dance move) Softball Snooker American football strategy Slam Dunk Contest Ice hockey November 2004 in sports Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Mixed martial arts Canadian football Orlando Magic Super Bowl XXV Tag Three-point field goal National Football League Lore Dream Team Julius Erving Babe Ruth Super Bowl XXVII Los Angeles Clippers Paintball Football (soccer) Free throw Blood (computer game) BASEketball Tris Speaker World Series Racquetball GunZ The Duel Field hockey Rugby union Cleveland Browns David Robinson (basketball player) Internal ballistics Super Bowl XXXIV Beer Pong Team Fortress Classic Tenshinhan Wayne Simien Pete Sampras Martial art Super Bowl X The Malice at The Palace San Francisco 49ers
