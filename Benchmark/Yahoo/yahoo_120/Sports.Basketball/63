is jo really worth players hes a true pf foward and all but the pacers are asking way too much for him lamar puts up those kinds of numbers infact lamar has more assist and rebounds than jo so i really dont think oneal is worth that much lakers were when they were healthy all they need is a defensive presence like ron artest don't you agree nope but since the pacers have the player the lakers want or the only player that might apiece kobe then the pacers have the leverage in this trade personally i would hate to see lamer go and you're right dude is averaging the same rebounds maybe less points but way more assists that j o but i think the reason why j o might be worth players is that he is a proven allstar year after year but still though i've heard that bird might want the whole entire laker frontline bynum lamar and walton for j o and maybe another player i would honestly do this only if it includes granger which is highly unlikely for the pacers i just wish they do something soon because the offseason for the lakers is really boring me plus kobe will be on jimmy kimmel on wednesday or thursday so tune in my laker compadre that is if you are a laker fan Indiana Pacers Los Angeles Clippers Kobe Bryant New York Knicks Chicago Bulls NBA Finals Larry Bird San Antonio Spurs Detroit Pistons Yao Ming Steve Nash Los Angeles Lakers 2005 NBA Finals New Mexico Lobo Basketball 2004 NBA Finals Orlando Magic Toronto Raptors Rasheed Wallace Ron Artest Michael Jordan Shaquille O'Neal Rick Carlisle Wilt Chamberlain Gary Payton (basketball) Reggie Miller Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Ben Wallace Karl Malone The Malice at The Palace Boston Celtics November 2004 in sports Minnesota Timberwolves The NBA on ABC January 2005 in sports 1986 NBA Draft New Jersey Nets Scottie Pippen Phil Jackson Lakers-Celtics rivalry Miami Dolphins Vince Carter Miami Heat Chris Webber Dream Team Dikembe Mutombo Dwyane Wade Robert Horry Julius Erving St. Louis Rams Utah Jazz LeBron James Pat Riley Dale Davis Jerry Krause Kenyon Martin Dennis Rodman December 2004 in sports Houston Rockets Phoenix Suns Magic Johnson Hollywood Squares Jermaine O'Neal American Motors Slam Dunk Contest June 2004 in sports New York Giants National Football League Michael Cooper Jalen Rose Jeff Foster NBA Draft David Robinson (basketball player) National Basketball Association Baltimore Ravens Continental Basketball Association Dirk Nowitzki Chicago White Sox Mike Breen Chick Hearn Three-point field goal Lamar Hunt Andrew Bogut English cricket team Leeds United F.C.
