do the jordan s lack quality cause i heard the leather cracks and the bottom turns yellow is it true it's not necessarily a quality issue for the yellowing the clear ice bottoms always yellow there are other shoes other than jordans that feature this clear sole and it just yellows it is a fact of life you can prolong it from staying out of the sun or keeping the shoe out of moist places the patent leather will crease as with just about any other shoe material it probably looks worse because of the appearance of the patent basically if you are going to do strenous activity in a pair of these it will wear like any other shoe but i hope you buy an authentic pair because there are a lot of fake xi's out there Charlotte Bobcats Emeka Okafor New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Los Angeles Clippers January 2005 in sports New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Toronto Raptors The Malice at The Palace Phoenix Suns December 2004 in sports Steve Nash Playoff Chicago Bulls Dream Team NBA Rookie of the Year Award International League National Basketball Association June 2004 in sports Cleveland Browns New Jersey Nets Charles Barkley Pittsburgh Steelers Shaquille O'Neal Yao Ming National Football League Atlanta Hawks Ben Wallace NBA Finals Miami Dolphins NBA Draft Women's National Basketball Association 1986 NBA Draft The NBA on ABC Charlotte Sting Michael Jordan Chris Webber Toronto Blue Jays 2005 NBA Playoffs Detroit Pistons Norway national football team Major League Baseball television contracts Memphis Grizzlies Baltimore Ravens Charlotte Bobcats Arena November 2004 in sports San Antonio Spurs Rasheed Wallace Boston Red Sox NBA Live series Golden State Warriors Continental Basketball Association Houston Rockets Sammy Sosa Denver Nuggets July 2004 in sports World Series February 2005 in sports 2003-04 NHL season Jason Chandler Williams Utah Jazz 2004 NBA Finals New York Giants Buffalo Bills 2005 NBA Finals San Jose Sharks Emanuel Gin__bili Philadelphia 76ers Dikembe Mutombo New York Jets John Calipari Minnesota Timberwolves Kobe Bryant Playoff format 1957 World Series The Weakest Link Minor league baseball Donovan McNabb National Hockey League All-Star Game Dallas Cowboys NASCAR 2005 World Series Syracuse University Orange EA Sports ESPN David Robinson (basketball player) Los Angeles Dodgers Portland Trail Blazers Rex Chapman Larry Bird Seattle Mariners Detroit Red Wings Wayne Gretzky Madden NFL St. Louis Cardinals Oakland Raiders Washington Wizards Chicago White Sox
