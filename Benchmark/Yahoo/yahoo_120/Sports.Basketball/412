if i keep my shaq jersey until how much will it be worth miami heat i used to work for a collectibles shop and honestly it has a lot less to do with how long you keep an item as it has to do with how popular the sport is and how famous that player is at the time in addition to that it's a matter of finding someone who will pay what you're asking just because shaq was famous at one time doesn't mean anyone will really know who he is in with baseball there are certain players who will always be famous because of their records with basketball it's a lot more a matter of who pays attention to the sport and how big of a fan they are of that specific team if you hang on to the jersey for that long watch the news of the sport for articles on his team also try to collect memorabilia to go along with it like trading cards with him wearing it signed photos etc that will make it a far more valuable collection of items down the road after that as i said it's a matter of finding the right person who knows enough about the game and shaq to want to make the purchase Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant Steve Nash Los Angeles Clippers Slam Dunk Contest Los Angeles Lakers Vince Carter Volleyball Basketball LeBron James Boston Bruins New Jersey Nets New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Shaquille O'Neal Toronto Raptors Karl Malone Syracuse University Orange NBA Finals Phoenix Suns Batting average Orlando Magic 2004 NBA Finals College basketball New York Knicks National Football League Baseball statistics Baseball Shooting guard Cincinnati Bengals Australian cricket team Paul Levesque Toronto Argonauts Water polo Indiana Pacers Dream Team Hulk Hogan St. Louis Cardinals Phil Jackson Gary Payton (basketball) Portland Trail Blazers Minnesota Vikings November 2004 in sports Larry Bird New York Giants Mark Calaway Ontario general election, 1985 National Football League Lore December 2004 in sports San Francisco 49ers Memphis Grizzlies Montreal Canadiens Bobby Knight Hank Aaron English cricket team StarrCade Robert Horry Tracy McGrady Allen Iverson Shawn Michaels Houston Rockets Super Bowl XXVI Tennis January 2005 in sports Carmelo Anthony Chicago Bulls Tayshaun Prince Rugby union positions Katelyn Faber Bear Bryant Houston Astros Super Bowl XVII Julius Erving Cleveland Browns Paul Wight 2005 NBA Finals Philadelphia 76ers Buffalo Sabres Toronto Maple Leafs Hartford Whalers Eight ball Los Angeles Kings Ontario general election, 1990 Phil Esposito New Mexico Lobo Basketball Kobe Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl I Babe Ruth Football (soccer) Denver Nuggets July 2004 in sports Billiards Super Bowl XXV Royal Rumble ESPN25 Ninety-eighth United States Congress Ninety-ninth United States Congress
