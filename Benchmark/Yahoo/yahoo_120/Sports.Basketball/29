stand pat or make moves although the issue is filled with controversy jo's recent media storm has caught a lot of attention of those in la to some its proof that the fo brass doesnt have the balls to make big moves happen anymore and to others it was a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel that give hope back into possible championship contention now i know the fo has been pretty incompetent when it comes to building around kobe but next season is just as intriguing as this season because kwame's retarded contract is off the books with his ridiculous contract gone it give the organization a substantial amount of money to sign a decent free agent jo will opt of his contract after this season and seeing as how much he loves la i think he would take a pay cut to sign with the lake show and be a fine replacement for kwame that way we keep lo andrew bynum and as far as im concerned javaris crittenton so what do we do fans and haters gut the team to bring jo now or stand pat well trading for him is only going to make the lakers lose the small amount of talent they have and while jermaine o'neal is a good play he is not equal to the other o'neal shaq obviously as far as a presence and teams really fearing him waiting and hoping he will opt out and sign with the lakers isn't a sure thing either though it's really a toss up i think it's go for the sure thing or take a chance Shaquille O'Neal Kobe Bryant Los Angeles Clippers Los Angeles Lakers NBA Finals Steve Nash New York Knicks Indiana Pacers New York Giants Wheel of Fortune Katelyn Faber National Football League Poker jargon New Jersey Nets Oakland Athletics Orlando Magic English cricket team Super Bowl XXXVI Houston Rockets San Antonio Spurs American Football League Detroit Tigers Salary cap Buffalo Bills Major League Baseball television contracts St. Louis Rams 2005 World Series Bowl Championship Series Minor league baseball Tris Speaker New England Patriots Pat Riley Philadelphia 76ers Utah Jazz Pittsburgh Steelers Boston Red Sox Gary Payton (basketball) Newcastle United F.C.
