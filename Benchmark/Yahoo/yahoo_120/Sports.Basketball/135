if the celtics schould trade any one for aa center who would it be and who woulld they get the celtics need a center i heard they got pollard but hes shit who do we need they also need a point guard until rajon rondo proves he can be a true distributor however boston gave up about every decent talent west szczerbiak jefferson gerald green telfair gomes ratliff and th pick jeff green they had on that roster they also gave up current th pick and future draft picks first rounders so not only is their roster talent depth paper thin right now but they've also gave away some of their future st round bargaining chips the only tradeable pieces they still have left is rondo tony allen and maybe their nd round pick glen davis if they can find a suitor other than that there really isn't anyone else worth trading for but if they get rid of all those guys for a center or a point guard then they will have absolute zero bench productivity and that's not a good idea to have going into a minimum games playoff period the best that boston can hope for right now is that glen big baby davis and kenrick perkins will be enough to anchor the middle while rondo and allen holds down the fort at point guard but that's kind of a stretch New York Knicks Toronto Raptors Los Angeles Clippers Indiana Pacers Chicago Bulls Orlando Magic Pittsburgh Steelers Utah Jazz Houston Rockets New York Giants New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets New England Patriots Los Angeles Kings Boston Celtics Washington Redskins Boston Bruins New Jersey Nets Carolina Panthers Atlanta Falcons 1986 NBA Draft Steve Nash New York Yankees Minnesota Timberwolves NBA Finals Jacksonville Jaguars New York Jets Philadelphia 76ers Boston Red Sox Buffalo Bills Montreal Canadiens Texas Rangers (baseball) Oakland Raiders Cincinnati Reds Oakland Athletics Washington Capitals Phoenix Suns San Antonio Spurs Portland Trail Blazers St. Louis Rams National Basketball Association Super Bowl XXVII Toronto Blue Jays Poker jargon American Football League Dallas Cowboys Houston Astros Florida Marlins Atlanta Braves 2004 NBA Finals January 2005 in sports National Football League Kansas City Chiefs Pittsburgh Penguins Ra (board game) San Francisco 49ers Los Angeles Lakers Detroit Red Wings Jeff Foster Tampa Bay Buccaneers NBA Draft Detroit Lions Salary cap Yao Ming Toronto Argonauts Philadelphia Flyers Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl I Dream Team Michael Jordan San Francisco Giants Atlanta Hawks Minnesota Vikings Cleveland Indians Super Bowl IX Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Detroit Tigers Super Bowl XXVI Pro Football Hall of Fame Golden State Warriors Jokerit Seattle Mariners Cleveland Cavaliers New Orleans Saints Kobe Bryant Babe Ruth's Called Shot Brett Favre Minor league baseball Larry Bird December 2004 in sports Chicago White Sox Mario Lemieux Screw Cincinnati Bengals 2004-05 NHL lockout Chicago Blackhawks New York Islanders Wayne Gretzky Super Bowl XVII
