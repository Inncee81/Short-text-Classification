how can i lose fat but not muscle i am dramatically overweight but my fat like only above healthy is so close to good that i would like to not lose any of that the moment i start exersising i stop losing any work outs and or diets that you highly recomend my current thing i walk a lot it is not uncommon for me to walk miles on a casual spur of the moment walk but i don't run or anything i eat very healthy whole foods or at least i try to i get a good amount of sleep i do not drink as much water as i should i weigh just over lbs actually flip above and below that quite often i'm ' and i'm please no sarcastic answers i am creative enough to think of saying go running myself or fad diets but i'm sure i won't avoid those for strong and silent it is hard to believe i agree but i had a doctor estimate it i have been tested for a thyroid problem several times i guess i have a thick neck so my doctor always likes to check quayman's answer is pretty good i'd just add the following your bmi http www bbc co uk health healthy living your weight bmiimperial index shtml is which puts you marginally into the obese category the thinking is to be between three years ago my bmi was the same as yours and i started at a gym the weight actually went up at first as i tended to eat more as my exercise level increased eventually i started watching what i ate i won't give 'fad' diets the time of day fancy a snack eat an apple you seem to know about healthy eating so all i'd add is that you should watch the overall calorie content and opt for slow release carbohydrate to feed your exercise regime eg oaty breakfast pasta wholegrain bread try to avoid foods with high saturated fat level aim to lose only a couple of pounds a week and weigh yourself once a week at most i wouldn't concern myself with the muscle fat issue as the only type of exercise that will help you lose weight is cardiovascular weights will build up muscle improve tone but i don't think you should worry about that until your weight is lower my first gym routine had me on the treadmill for minutes alternating walking and running mins kmh mins kmh etc i used to hate it as it was so hard and i thought i was going to die because it was hard i kept at it and ended up actually enjoying it one year later my bmi was and i ran a half marathon in h m i do a lot more weights these days and my bmi is currently muscle weighs more than fat apparently but my last half marathon time was h m so i'm not concerned you might find that cycling suits you and that would be just as good best thing is to get into a gym and talk to an instructor and try out all these sorts of things one last piece of advice invest in a heart rate monitor the best fitness accessory there is after an ipod sorry for the waffle hope it helps though good luck Weight training Anorexia nervosa Body mass index Super Size Me Exercise Hypoglycemia Bodybuilding Nutrition Breastfeeding Adjustable gastric band Binge eating disorder Marathon (sport) Prostate cancer Insulin Vegetarianism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Coronary heart disease Hamster Physical attractiveness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Little Britain Tocopherol Cardiovascular disease Healthy eating Folic acid South Beach diet Diabetes mellitus Coeliac disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Equine conformation Fecal incontinence Garfield Hypercholesterolemia Food guide pyramid Bread Human height Sleep apnea Osteoarthritis Stomach cancer Social rule Dietary fiber Hamburger Omega-3 fatty acid The Contender (television series) Hypertension Cancer Milton H.
