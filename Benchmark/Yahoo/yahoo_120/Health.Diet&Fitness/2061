weight loss hi i am tall and weigh lb morning weight i was inapril i am going slow as i am not dieting meaning i am not starving my prob is that now i have reached a plateau earlier i burned cal in min everyday on an elliptical recently i have changed my routine to min lcal on tread mill and min cal on elliptical my question is that its been a week an di see no change in the weight i am anxious that will my routine change show results or i shud do something else somebody pls suggest how to get rid of the plateau stage my goal is lbs thanks when you hit a plateau the temptation is to either throw up your hands and give up or over do to get off the plateau you are evidently going to a gym with machines that calculate your calories burned did you calculate for your new weight the bummer about calories is that the less you weigh less you burn per minute per activity now you are burning more calories and wonder why no results on the scale some times the scale can be very fickle you may be suffering from what i call august syndrome during the warm hot muggy summer months i tend to retain water my feet swell just a little but that is enough to keep the scale up there my advice is to stick with your new program for a few more weeks you are wise to keep your food intake level it may take you longer to take off the weight however once it is off the more likely you are to maintain that ideal weight i speak from experience unless you are bored with the machines if so it might be time to try some swimming dancing or another activity that you enjoy Dieting Obesity Atkins Nutritional Approach Weight training Breastfeeding Calorie restriction Anorexia nervosa Pound Dialysis Calorie Jet engine Low-carbohydrate diet Clinical depression Weight Watchers Baseball Mass Apollo 8 Scramjet Space Shuttle program Garfield Coeliac disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Dance Dance Revolution Protein-energy malnutrition Acne Nutrition Folic acid Sleep Osteoarthritis Bodybuilding Swimming Saturn V Spacecraft propulsion Diarrhea Dietary fiber Tocopherol Tire Milk Solar power Hypoglycemia Energy Prostate cancer Carburetor Albatross Weight Carbon dioxide Explosive material Horsepower Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Carpal tunnel syndrome Fasting Standard enthalpy change of fusion Little Britain Autism Tattoo Traumatic brain injury Scuba set Guinea pig Super Size Me Pregnancy M16 (rifle) Robert Falcon Scott Motorcycle Fire fighting Sea level rise Heinkel He 112 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Life extension Adjustable gastric band Obstetrics Peter Singer Puberty Great Pyramid of Giza DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Tofu Global warming and agriculture Aspartame Tank classification Scientology beliefs and practices Shrimp farm M60 machine gun Childbirth Deforestation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Insulin resistance Tea Fusion power Hypertension Radio controlled airplane Orders of magnitude (energy) Gout Species Collapse of the World Trade Center Urinary incontinence Year Biosphere 2
