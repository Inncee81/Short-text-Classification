am i anorexic i have always weighed alot more than other people but everyone says that i dont look anything like what i weigh im ' i always ate a little over ordinary before now now i eat less than half of that and dont get hungry anymore i like food but i hate eating ive lost pounds in like a little over a week i need to know whats going on with me please dont be mean i cant help it besides ive worried about my weight for like years thanks to you people who were nice about it and helped i understand more i am an ex anorexia patient usually recovery is really hard because its a condition that settles in your psychology and your body that puts you in a vicious circle since your brain controls your body it controls your perception of reality and how you look at things such as food in this case because of your age it's normal for you to have physical insecurities instead of eating less to make your body fit the image in your head try taking more positive actions such as working out or reading about fitness and healthy eating that way you would know the best way to nurture your body and the reach the goals that you have talk to a close friend about it and ask her to watch your eating habits if they are too abnormal like if all you eat is a granola bar and diet coke all day and you don't feel hungry yet still think a scoop of ice cream will make you fat then consider seeking pro help because it becomes a habit really fast and its hard to get rid of you don't sound anorexic to me because as i said anorexia patients have a different psychology and attitude they dint think and believe that there's anything wrong with them except for pounds that they think they oughta lose sorry if it was too long got caught up i guess take care Dieting Eating disorder Binge eating disorder Obesity Atkins Nutritional Approach Super Size Me Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Prostate cancer Social psychology Hypoglycemia Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Insulin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fasting Little Britain Bulimia nervosa Terri Schiavo Stuttering Chronic fatigue syndrome Psychosis Homer Simpson Traumatic brain injury Transactional analysis Clinical depression Social rule Cancer Diabetes mellitus Psychoanalysis Addiction Infantilism Coeliac disease Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Theory of conduct Transsexuality Ron and Fez Cheese Out-of-body experience Fancy rat Milton H.
