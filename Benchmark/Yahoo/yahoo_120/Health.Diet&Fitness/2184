my workout i wouldnt really say its a workout but i was wondering if this sounds good to you guys i do about mins on my treadmill once im done that i do another mins on the aerofit even though it might be a garbage machine i then do sets of crunches sets of situps and side leg raises i also do another sets of x lbs bench press which brings me to another question in your opinion would it be better to more reps of a smaller weight or less reps of a bigger weight thanks seems reasonable on sets more reps less weight for functional strength and endurance less reps more weight for bulk and show Weight training Euphemism Equine conformation Dialysis Professional wrestling throws Chair Appeal Repetition Debate The Ashlee Simpson Show Pound Blue Whale Bench press Matroid Mass Royal Marines Bodybuilding Space elevator Weightlifting Monopsony Skateboarding trick Normal distribution United States House of Representatives Lisp programming language Number sign Engine Chess (musical) Ronnie Earle Marbury v.
