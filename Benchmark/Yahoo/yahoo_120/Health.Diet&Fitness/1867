training i've just started running after years of slobbing around it feels as tought im going to collapse every time i run and i feel it very hard to breath properly i train for hour with small breaks in between is there any other exercises i can try to get my breathing under control i want to train outdoors and not in the gym aswell thank you getting the rhythm is the thing i've been running for longer than i care to admit but since i was just a little forrest gump anyway it is a passion your own style of breathing will come along but i can sort of tell you mine i suck in two quick breaths in a row with two strides then blow out one long breath with the next two repeat repeat rinse get the beat in your head and use your mind's music to keep the flow steady i don't use headphones because it can throw off your rhythm with the changing of the songs some people can do it but i take running very seriously and my track record can prove it not bragging about anything but for me it is a sport that i enjoy more than anything else except for you know when your breathing becomes smooth and perfect so will your strokes and in a short period of time running will be like flying it becomes easy and not a lot of clumsy work hope it helps works for me now run forrest run nad Diving Equine conformation Aikido First aid Music genre Paragliding Marching band Swimming Time Out of Mind Jazz Exercise Tai Chi Chuan The Book of Five Rings Triathlon New York Giants Sprint (race) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Frogman Weight training Fast bowling Billboard Hot 100 Forrest Gump Cross-country skiing Scuba set Backstroke House music Music Butterfly stroke Breaststroke Slow Train Coming Stuttering Rhythm and blues Nathan Bedford Forrest Collective Soul Blood (computer game) Fecal incontinence Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Genesis (band) Gabber music New York Jets Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Beatmatching Horse gait Cincinnati Bengals Sport rowing Ice hockey Aquemini Pump It Up Carolina Panthers Cleveland Browns Ben Johnson (athlete) Massage 1957 World Series Strap-on dildo Athletics 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sin City Social rule AFI 100 Years series Carburetor Trumpet Dog training Spice Girls Halitosis Liquid breathing In The Groove (game) Drag racing Year of the Spider Sampling (music) Time signature Urinary incontinence Mixed martial arts Super Bowl XXV Drum and bass Aerial (dance move) Asthma The Emancipation of Mimi USS Forrestal (CVA-59) Front crawl Highway 61 Revisited 24 Hours of Le Mans The Isley Brothers Hyperthermia Textile manufacturing Dance Dance Revolution Sauna Decompression sickness The Who Pittsburgh Steelers Volleyball Theory of conduct Popular music Parachuting Jethro Tull (band) Traumatic brain injury Sandy Koufax Weezer Blonde on Blonde GunZ The Duel
