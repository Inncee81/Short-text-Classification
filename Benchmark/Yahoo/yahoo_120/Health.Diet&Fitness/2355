man boobs or moobs how do i get rid of my man boobs without surgery what types of exercises and how often joe it won't be too hard to do as long as you want to and are willing to stick to the program you need they come from a combination of two things too much weight and too little exercise so you know what you need to do as to the exercises start with the humble pushup the pushup is cheap you only need a floor and most of us have one of those already and easy to do lie prone on the floor put your hands under your shoulders push yourself up keeping your back straight let yourself down almost to the floor again and repeat until you can't do any more rest for a few minutes and then repeat this exercise works the pectoral muscles the deltoids shoulders and the triceps and to a limited extent the latissimus dorsi those wings on the back it's a great exercise and can be done anytime anywhere there isn't too much dog hair on the floor another exercise that is just as cheap is the dip go to your kitchen and turn your back to the refrigerator this by itself is a very good exercise find an inside corner of your counter put one hand on either side of that corner and push yourself up so that your feet are off the floor bend your knees and let yourself down to where your elbows make a degree bend you don't need and really don't want to go any further than that it can put too much stress on your tendons and you could get tendonitis if you do this too vigorously too soon push yourself back up repeat until you can't do any more when you get to the point you can do of these you're doing well these will work the latissimus dorsi the triceps the deltoids and the pectorals in that order now from here on you're going to need weights so go to a sports authority or one of those second hand sports equipment places and pick up some dumbells one pound pair and one pound pair they'll cost about cents a pound at least they do around here these are called butterflies do you have a hefty coffee table one made of x s and plywood or you can get a cheap workout bench for not much pick up the pound dumbells no sense in hurting yourself first time out wait until the second time at least lie down on the coffee table or bench on your back raise the dumbells over your head keep a firm grip on them at this point cause if you drop them you might as well run for congress it'll be all you'll be good for keeping your arms basically straight you don't have to keep them perfectly straight it'll be quite a strain on your shoulder tendons and ligaments lower them out to either side to the level of your chest raise them back up to over your head and repeat until you can't do any more rest a few minutes and then repeat after you can do of these each time go to the pound weights if you do these after doing the pushups you probably won't need any heavier weights than these but eventually you might want to get some when you start to do the curls which you really should to work your biceps you will want to go to pounders one day while you're at it take those butterfly weights stand up bend over to about a degree angle let the weights hang below your chest and then keeping your arms straight raise the weights up and out to either side on the level of your shoulders these are called reverse butterflies and will work your upper back the trapezius muscles and will provide a nice complement to the pectoral work you'll be doing it'll make your upper body more conditioned just wait until someone you hug say you have back muscles and you'll see that it's worth it don't forget to do the crunches too you'll want the abs to go with the pecs and get your bmi down to about if you can that will go a long way to making you look the way you'd like and can good luck Backstroke Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling aerial techniques Arm Swingout Horizontal bar Breaststroke Bench press Knife Elbow-joint Peripheral nervous system Suplex Clean and jerk Fast bowling Glossary of climbing terms Skateboarding trick Boxing Swimming Deadlift Wing Chun Carpal tunnel syndrome Volleyball Tetrapod Chair Press up Front crawl Powerbomb Archery Tai Chi Chuan Repetitive strain injury Casualty lifting Glossary of ballet terms Contredanse Sailing Powerlifting Deltoid muscle Calisthenics Parade (military) Glossary of partner dance terms Softball Obedience training Lindy Basic Figure skating Salute Mattress Table tennis Poker jargon Massage Car handling Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breast Muscle Wind turbine Sport rowing Internal ballistics Fencing New York Giants Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Radius (bone) Dog training Pittsburgh Steelers Obesity M16 (rifle) Tibia Piccolo Junior Saga Spanking Bruce Lee Muay Thai Dog agility Double bass Aikido Wood Ulna Anchor Snooker Naval mine Devil sticks Customs and etiquette of Japan Professional wrestling match types Gesture Mixed martial arts Strap-on dildo Triathlon Human position Curling
