is it beter to have the majority of your daily calories durring the day or for dinner is it ok to have less than calories durring the day and then have a big dinner different people have different ideas about what type of diet and how many calories as well as when they should eat i have probably tryed over different diets in my lifetime and what i found that works best for me is to have or small meals throughout the day and break up the calories rather equally for example if i have my first meal at am then my next snack a piece of fruit handful of dryed fruit or nuts a piece of cheese and a couple of crackers of a yogurt a glass of juice a few pretzles or a rice cake with some nut butter etc is at a m then my next meal would be at noon then i would eat a small meal again at p m pm and last meal would be at p m just divide your calories fairly equally throughout the day then your blood sugar will stay fairly stable and you won't suffere from hypoglycemia or have other side affects such as headaches lack of energy etc if you would rather have a more tradiitonal meal plan where you have meals and one snack before bed then your noon time meal would probably have more calories to get you through the rest of the day make sure you drink plenty of water and get enough protein carbs for energy and don't forget you still need some fats healthy ones like olive oil are reccomended by most nutritonists get plenty of water and fresh air while you exercise and dont go on any starvation diets because all they do is put your body on a starvation mode where it will shut down an start burning muscle because it will hold on to the bodies's fat because it needs it a a reserve figure out how much weight you want to lose an by doing some calculations you can come up with how much weight you whold lose to get to your desired weight the calcualtion is based on how many calories it takes to maintain a certain weight and to lose weight you eat less calories then is needed to maintain that weight good luck Atkins Nutritional Approach Hypoglycemia Breakfast Veganism Food Fasting Milk Cuisine of Denmark Low-carbohydrate diet Healthy eating Vegetarianism Insulin Nutrition Anorexia nervosa Bodybuilding Obesity Jewish cuisine Hamster Cuisine of the Philippines Weight training Calorie French cuisine Fecal incontinence Meal Ice cream Super Size Me Hyperglycemia Dietary fiber Calorie restriction Tofu Bread Tea (meal) Peanut Tooth Food guide pyramid German cuisine Snack food South Beach diet Glycogen storage disease type I Omega-3 fatty acid Alcoholic beverage Potassium Diabetes mellitus Adjustable gastric band Energy Coffee Cheese Bengali cuisine Little Britain Raw food diet Cuisine of Brazil Breastfeeding Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Malaysia Dairy Yoghurt Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hamburger Aspartame Stomach cancer Kosher foods Cake Japanese cuisine Rum Pancake Roman eating and drinking Vegetarian cuisine Equine conformation Dim sum Tlingit Folic acid Tea Peruvian cuisine Fancy rat Protein-energy malnutrition Korean cuisine Tocopherol Glucose Weight loss Insulin resistance Chocolate Orders of magnitude (energy) Slim Fast Fugu Vitamin C Glycemic index Thermoregulation Egg (food) Cuisine of Africa Pig (zodiac) Olive oil MRE Crohn's disease
