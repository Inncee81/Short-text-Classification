what kind of exercises will most effectively help lose weight how long of cardio each time how many times per week i want to know the ideal fat burning exercise program there's no set prescription for exercise the way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you take in if you eat calories but you burn throughout the day that extra calories will be taken from your stores of fat rather than from the food you've just eaten if you eat more than you burn you'll gain weight i suggest finding some form of exercise that you really enjoy whether it's running walking swimming lifting weights or biking or taking an aerobics class or practicing yoga do something that you'll have fun doing it's better to look forward to your exercise time each day than to feel like it's a chore i also suggest thinking about way you can burn extra calories when you're not exercising remember that any movement burns calories you can sit in your favorite spot at night watching tv or reading a book and kick your legs or lift one leg at a time it's hardly exercise you can do it absentmindedly and you won't break a sweat but it still requires energy calories to do and thus will burn off some extra calories while you are relaxing choosing foods is also important you want to watch your calorie intake of course eating protein fuels your muscles for exercise and helps them build up fresh fruits and vegetables live food will help give you some extra energy while also providing nutrients and few calories i will post a bunch of links below of resources that might help you i lost about lbs and kept it off for several years in this way so it definitely does work good luck ps i can't stress enough that this should be a pleasure not punishment i see these replies that say push yourself harder push your body to the limit or beyond etc find your own pace find what works for you it doesn't have to be running which in the long run will damage your knees and other joints but any exercise you have fun doing it is important to enjoy the form s of exercise you choose and the foods you eat because for any weight loss plan to be effective it must be a way of life as long as you continue to have a healthy balance of calorie intake output you'll lose the extra weight then maintain your ideal weight if you feel like you're punishing yourself rather than enjoying what you're doing you'll never be able to stick to it and keep the weight off you can do it Weight training Bodybuilding Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Low-carbohydrate diet Swimming Exercise Breastfeeding Veganism Nutrition Equine conformation Urinary incontinence Fasting Calorie restriction Calorie Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Osteoarthritis Aerial (dance move) Dietary fiber Healthy eating Super Size Me Milk Bicycle Insulin Carburetor Tocopherol Folic acid Vegetarianism Fancy rat Hypoglycemia Weight loss Professional wrestling holds Hamster Guinea pig Life extension Fecal incontinence Creatine Protein-energy malnutrition Raw food diet Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer Adjustable gastric band Triathlon Tofu Omega-3 fatty acid Motorcycle Vitamin C Aikido Protein Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Energy Clinical depression Diving Hypertension Food guide pyramid Muscle Weight Watchers Stomach cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Explosive material Egg (food) Aerobic exercise Japanese tea ceremony Breaststroke Backstroke Jet engine Water Carpal tunnel syndrome Little Britain The Amazing Race Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diarrhea STS-62 Professional wrestling throws Glucose Aspartame Potassium Piccolo Junior Saga South Beach diet Sugar substitute Professional wrestling slang Kasparov versus The World Coronary heart disease Diabetes mellitus Running Fire fighting Soil life Oh My Goddess!
