what are some good excersizes to work on my lower abs i have a tweaked lower back and i've been told and confirmed that the cause is weak lower ab muscles i do regular ab work outs but they don't seem to be getting the right area also i have a excersize ball thanks for the suggestions the best exercise to work the lower abs uses an exercise ball resting your upper body on your forearms and your feet on the ball bring your knees to your chest and extend your legs out fully for one rep do three sets of reps to start and five sets of reps after the first few weeks this will work out not only your lower abs but also your core muscles which is also key in developing a strong torso once you feel stable with this exercise try the advanced version which is performed with your toes as the only contact with the ball good luck sir Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling attacks Swingout Volleyball Parade (military) Tetrapod Anatomical terms of location Swimming Breaststroke Doom enemies Squat (exercise) Horizontal bar Professional wrestling aerial techniques Wing Chun Deadlift Fencing New York Giants Skateboarding trick Fast bowling Chair Mixed martial arts Marching band Elbow-joint Diving Tai Chi Chuan Tennis 1957 World Series Breech birth Backstroke Humerus Radius (bone) Clean and jerk Human anatomy Brian Close Exercise Puberty Fecal incontinence Front crawl Absolute magnitude Calisthenics Glossary of partner dance terms Muay Thai Muscle Baseball Fascial compartment Prostate cancer Jazz dance moves Eryops Duchenne muscular dystrophy Galactic Civilizations Basketball Tango (dance) Trumpet Atherosclerosis 1986 World Series Field hockey Arm Backbreaker Piccolo Junior Saga Urinary incontinence Foot Massage Stretching Ulna Glossary of American football Terminal ballistics Boxing Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Batting (cricket) Vegeta Carpal tunnel syndrome Bench press Internal oblique Tibia Abdomen Glossary of climbing terms Thermoregulation Pole vault Stuttering First aid Personal foul Cephalic disorder Show hunter Tap dance Press up Bicycle Four square 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Laws of cricket Piccolo (Dragon Ball) The Shining (film) United States House of Representatives Proprioception Human height
