will i lose weight faster because of my height im ' and im excersising to lose weight but im just wondering since im tall for my age will my height give me an advantage to lose weight faster hi no it won't make you lose weight any faster but it may be easier for you to lose pds for example than someone who is only feet if you both weigh the same amount the reason is not because of your height but because of what is known as the bmi body mass index the body mass index is a much better indicator of what you should weigh i was tall for my age when i was and i was dieting from the time i was or i wasn't fat looking back now but when you are a young girl it is easy to be influenced by media and the fashion industry at my lowest weight i was down to pds and i still thought i needed to lose weight though i really was a skeleton this was an example of anorexic nervosa but when you are a young girl you dont allways do what is best for you the best way to lose weight is to eat a healthy diet low fat non processed foods cutting down on sugar fats and empty calories candy soda cookies cakes chips etc some fats are needed for the human body to function but choose healthy oils llike olive oil nut oils etc choose healthy meal plans with protein choices like lean meats chicken without skin fish is excellent beans legumes tofu if you are vegetarian fresh fruit and vegetables and lots of fresh watr exercise in moderaton take brisk walks instead of driving to and from the mall or ride a bike to friends homes there are tons of diet books out there and you can find all the information you need on the internet as well all teen girls seem to think they need to be on a diet and if you are eating lots of junk food fast food then you may need to adjust your diet but it doesn't mean that you are overweight it is better when you are young to not diet but choose your food you eat carefully and exercise is an excellent way to controll your appetite and exercise will help with firming up and toning muscle also lifting small weights will build muscle and muscle weighs more than fat you may weigh the same but will fit into smaller clothes because fat is what takes up more room and is unattractive check on the internet site listed to see what your bmi is and if it says that you are indeed overweight then adjust your diet but work with a nutritonist or your mom or another adult to help you with meal planning lots of times a simple adjustment to your diet will help you lose pounds that have not been comming off don't be swayed by fad diets and shows on t v about models those are unrealistic examples of what the real women and girls out there look like it is much healthier to be a plus size that is healthy than a size who is anorexic and sick anorexia as well as bulimia is not just a medical condition but it is a disease and if caught early can save you a world of pain if you learn to accept your body type and work with it and dress accordingly you will be much happier than trying to acheive something that may be unrealistic for example a girl that is big boned and stands feet inches your height is very unlikely to ever weigh pds unless you are grossly overweight just keep up with your exercise that is great that you have decided to exercise keep up with the exercises yo are already doing and you will be in good shape before you know it remember to learn to love your body and not get hung up on statistics and numbers that insurance groups put on the old weight height charts a much better indicator of if you are overweight or not and just how fit you are is the pinch an inch test if you can pinch more than an inch on your stomach hip area or on the lower arms then exercising witll tighten up loose flab and you will look much better in your clothes as well look up the sites listed below and good luck with your exercise program Insulin Physical attractiveness Tofu Food Adjustable gastric band Super Size Me Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Healthy eating Bodybuilding Milk Hamster Breastfeeding Coronary heart disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dietary fiber Stomach cancer Hamburger Cheese Jewish cuisine Omega-3 fatty acid Vitamin C Peanut Weight loss Body image Raw food diet Urinary incontinence Growth hormone treatment Diabetes mellitus Domestic rabbit Chocolate Little Britain McDonald's Cancer Vegetarian nutrition Vegetarian cuisine Trans fat Cuisine of the Southern United States Japanese cuisine Anchor Brassiere Hypoglycemia Dialysis Cuisine of Denmark Kashrut Domesticated turkey Fasting Fugu Bicycle Cuisine of Malaysia Growth hormone deficiency Tyrannosaurus rex Japanese tea ceremony Dog South Beach diet Corset Exercise Breakfast Aerial (dance move) Pro-ana Crohn's disease Folic acid Hyperglycemia Sperm Whale Gastroparesis Cuisine of Brazil Junk food Babe Ruth Cat Tooth French cuisine Swimming Osteoarthritis Recumbent bicycle Extreme Programming
