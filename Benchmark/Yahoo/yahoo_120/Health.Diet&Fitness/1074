why are so many people against mcdonald's tell me what you think i don't really get this i go at mcdonald's perhaps once a month enjoy it and i never gain weight by eating a hamburger still i have a slim figure i know some people who keep telling me that mcdonalds is unhealthy and those same people eat atleast chocolate bars per day of course if you spend there every day no good will come out of it my point is people act as if there were no obese people before mcdonald's and that mcd is the source of all fatening food yeah gimme a break so what about mars snickers chips and the list goes on and on i've never seen the 'super size me' where can i get it i agree to a point mcdonalds is bad for you but anything is okay in moderation mcdonalds probably gets the brunt of it because they are a huge national chain with many more restaurants and a much larger advertising budget than the other fast food joints in super size me he does eat mcdonalds for meals a day averaging about calories per day and much of that is in fat calories plus he can only walk up to steps per day so a high calorie and fat consumption combined with the lack of exercise contributed to his drastic health decline and weight gain the movie is worth watching but it won't stop me from eatting at a fast food joint now and then but i do stop and think before i head to that drive through as for the candy bars i think it comes down to advertising mcdonalds advertised heavily to kids they were the first to introduce the happy meal concept for fast food they also have cartoon characters and play lands the candy companies do advertise to kids but not to the extent that mcdonalds did i do think that good things have happened because of the bad light that was put onto mcdonalds watch their ads now see that most of the kids are moving and exercising in some way not just eating mcdonalds food also there are now healthier options apples instead of fries and milk of juice instead of soda McDonald's Fast food Hamburger Obesity Dieting Milk Burger King Atkins Nutritional Approach Breakfast Happy Meal In-N-Out Burger Junk food Food Fast-food restaurant Hardee's Anorexia nervosa Chocolate Ronald McDonald Fish and chips Healthy eating Soft drink Low-carbohydrate diet Nutrition Fasting Cuisine of Denmark Little Britain French fries Japanese cuisine Egg (food) Bodybuilding Morgan Spurlock Ice cream Binge eating disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Hamster Beavis and Butt-head Garfield Fecal incontinence Veganism South Beach diet Weight loss Trans fat Diabetes mellitus Weight training Food and Drug Administration Breastfeeding Homer Simpson Cuisine of the Southern United States Insulin MyPyramid Calorie Kit Kat Gastric bypass surgery Equine conformation Vegetarianism Wall Street Conker's Bad Fur Day Ramen Spidey Super Stories British cuisine Saimin A&W Restaurants German cuisine MRE Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hypoglycemia Billboard (advertising) Mars Bar Street food Tooth DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution The Apprentice 2 Hyperglycemia Restaurant Word of Wisdom Neopets Weight Watchers Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Margarine Slim Fast Delicatessen Fancy rat Tobacco advertising Deep-fried Mars bar Coffeehouse Jewish cuisine Tea Health insurance Peanut French cuisine Inca Kola Dietary fiber Christmas
