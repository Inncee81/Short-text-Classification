weight watchers and personal attention hello everyone i am strongly considering joining weight watchers due to hearing lots of great things about it but i wanted to know from anyone who has gone to weight watchers if they give you personal attention and really work with you on a individual basis i am in dire need of loosing atleast lbs and am worried that if i join i'll just be paying for a weightloss internet program i really need someone who is knowlegable and has been there to work with me based on my needs do the ww leaders do this at each location i ask because i went to a ww last week min before a meeting for registration and there were atleast women in a small room weighing themselves out in the open then going into a room for the meeting if i join i want to know that i'll be getting personal attention thanks for any information or expieriences i am doing weight watchers and they answer any questions you want if you do the one where you go in i think that going in is better makes you want to loose more because you know you have to weigh in if you stay for the meetings they answer any questions and you learn new recipes and tips and such so i think you should join its good and working good for me i've lost a lot of weight in just three weeks oh and they only really sit down with you personally if you really ask other than that they won't just sit down with everyone but you could ask if you really need it and for the whole people in one meeting i think thats all in where you go you could try going to a different meeting i've been to two different meeting places and one had like people in it and the other had like also so they vary in the places and times Weight Watchers Social rule Dieting Muslim ibn Aqeel Extreme Programming Consensus decision-making Atkins Nutritional Approach The Contender (television series) Pound SAT Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Elvis and Me Goodness and value theory Fifteen to One U.S. Electoral College Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Indian nationality law Hearing impairment Dialysis Piccolo Junior Saga Canadian House of Commons U.S. presidential election, 2004 Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Plame affair Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Canadian Senate Shaggy dog story ACORN Hiberno-English Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an D'ni caverns Sexual orientation Family Feud Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Big Brother UK series 6 Weight Avenue Q The Red Green Show Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Milton H.
