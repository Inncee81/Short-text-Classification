how tall will i be i know that this is just a guess but how tall will i be height ' age weight lb mom height ' dad height ' i went to my mom's work and everyone was like wow you should model do you think that i will be tall enough and skinny enough when i'm older thanks the real question is do you parents families tend to be as tall as you want to be your dads hight should help your growth but you should grow more to your mothers hight than his i don't know how tall you should be for modeling so you have to determine it for yourself as for your weight you don't weigh that much for a year old but you should be able to stay skinny as long as you chose to by exercising and eating well unless you have a problem with weight in the family not just your parents but also their siblings and parents which would make you gain weight faster and require more on your part to stay skinny it could be the other way around and you wouldn't have to do much at all to stay skinny it sounds like you shouldn't have a problem with your weight if all the people at your mom's work say you should model and mean it you should consider it no matter what your height and weight is you look good enough to do it in their opinion so if you feel that you can do it you should Human height Terri Schiavo Anorexia nervosa Equine conformation Cindy Sheehan Calvin and Hobbes Car handling Theory of conduct Intelligence quotient Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) The Marshall Mathers LP Obesity Fathers' rights Adoption Weight training The Adventures of Pete & Pete Theodicy Birth weight Messerschmitt Me 163 Wealth Kurt Cobain Robert Pershing Wadlow Social rule Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Recurring South Park characters My Life as a Teenage Robot The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Skinny Puppy Singlish The Fairly OddParents Password Atkins Nutritional Approach Linux The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Shaggy dog story Fast bowling Adjustable gastric band David Hume Humphrey Bogart Laura Schlessinger Megan Griffin Inflation Mr. and Mrs. Turner Mixed-breed dog Nature versus nurture Piccolo Junior Saga Abortion debate Binge eating disorder Cartman Joins NAMBLA The Amazing Race Tire Father Gliding Guinea pig Gender role Saved by the Bell Transactional analysis Garfield Economic inequality Springfield Elementary School Barack Obama Fathers' rights movement in the UK Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Biology and sexual orientation Van Houten family Breastfeeding Exogenous growth model Criticism of libertarianism Kodocha Sonic the Hedgehog John Lott Roe v.
