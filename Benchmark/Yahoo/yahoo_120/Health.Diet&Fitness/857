nike for the ipod nano what does it tell you is it worth the i've heard it tells you how many calories you've burned distance speed and time does it tell you anything else e x jogging tips encouraging words thanks a lot the nike is great but make sure when you get it you calibrate it to your pace and then it is very accurate i love it oh and the nike wont be accurate if you dont have the shoes cause my friend tried that and it didnt work but for me it works perfect it is only too not i think its a great deal you get a membership on nikeplus com too which is great cause it tracks your workouts and everything i love it so so much Nike, Inc.
