what healthy foods will get me enough calories my diet plan for the day is small meals but its still only calories i need more im guessing because this afternoon im going to be burning at least working out really hard i dont want to add fat my plan is only about grams of fat a day the only fruit available is peaches and i already had one and id like to save them for tomorrow any suggestions if you are intensely working out calories your body needs whole grains in order to give your body fuel try whole grains and protein that are complex and will take your body longer to break down fruits and vegetables contain a lot of water and your body can break them down pretty easier you may have to increase your fat intake slightly because grams of fat is not that much and your body may start storing all of the fat you take in and inhibit weight loss play around with your diet and see what keeps you full satisfied and allows you to work out good luck Dieting Low-carbohydrate diet Atkins Nutritional Approach Dietary fiber Bodybuilding Calorie Breastfeeding Veganism Fasting Obesity Tocopherol Vegetarianism Omega-3 fatty acid Food guide pyramid Folic acid Healthy eating South Beach diet Calorie restriction Protein Fat Hypoglycemia Vitamin C Nutrition Super Size Me Trans fat Alcoholic beverage Hamster Organic food Coronary heart disease Anorexia nervosa Cheese Food preservation Weight training Zone diet Protein-energy malnutrition Insulin Weight loss Olive oil Guinea pig Weight Watchers Slim Fast Aspartame Raw food diet Glycemic index Antioxidant Fecal incontinence Orders of magnitude (energy) Coeliac disease Prostate cancer Handloading Paleolithic diet Soy protein Cereal Body type (exercise) Fancy rat Glucose Tofu Glycogen storage disease type I Carburetor MyPyramid Potassium Diabetes mellitus Bread Watermelon Chocolate Pound Sugar substitute Junk food Explosive material Food Domesticated turkey Jewish cuisine Anemia Vitamin Little Britain Cholesterol 613 mitzvot Standard enthalpy change of fusion In-N-Out Burger Magnesium Brewery Tooth Robert Falcon Scott Pig (zodiac) Hyperglycemia Soft drink Stomach cancer Cuisine of the Southern United States Gelatin Ice cream MRE Ferret Fruitarianism
