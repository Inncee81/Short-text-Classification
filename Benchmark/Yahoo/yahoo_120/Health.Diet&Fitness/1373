what mental tricks do you use to get through a workout i know with the logical part of my brain that i can do it but ten minutes in it seems way too hard and an hour of working out seems impossible what do you do to keep yourself going i try not to pay attention to the time i'll throw a towel over the timer most of the time i will watch tv while i work out and that helps pass the time or i'll listen to music once i get past minutes i feel like i can make it through my whole workout if you find a form of exercise that you enjoy time passes alot faster or i'll invite a friend to workout with me start slow steadily build speed and the length of your workout over time you can do it i used to dread working out but i have learned to enjoy it plus don't forget all of the benefits of working out other than just the obvious you gain energy sleep better at night your heart lungs and brain all benefit the list goes on Weight training Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Clinical depression Triathlon Electrophysiology Humphrey Bogart Exercise Bodybuilding Tai Chi Chuan Oasis (band) Urinary incontinence W.I.T.C.H.
