working out working out muscle groups day vs i used to work out one muscle group a day say back monday chest tuesday and so on i got fantastic results i changed it up recently and did muscle groups a day if i did back lats and triceps on the same day it felt odd or any muscles groups if i started out with a lat pull down then did glose grip bench for my triceps by the time i went back to the next back workout i lost the pump and i felt weak do most people when working muscles day go ahead and work one muscle group till all the sets are done then move on till the next muscle group or do they do each muscle group back and forth till both muscle groups have been worked at the desired amount of sets and reps any additional advice is welcomed thanks for the help i have tried many different versions i always get the bets results when each workout is dedicated to one muscle group if your gonna try muscle groups work muscles that work together if your doing back then do your biceps too this way your biceps are getting a good warm up from your back training it is best to finish back then go onto biceps since your back is a larger muscle it needs more effert and energy also for sets i was doing lower reps for years recently i starter going higher around ive been getting far better muscle growth from the higher reps hope this helps Mr. Olympia Elbow-joint Arm Triathlon Bodybuilding Equine conformation Wing Chun Bruce Lee History of Test cricket (to 1883) Exercise Diving Breaststroke Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Urinary incontinence Physical attractiveness Peripheral nervous system Muscle Scapula Andr__s Galarraga Stretching Breastfeeding Action potential Bicycle Soleus muscle Repetitive strain injury Marathon (sport) Sauna Deadlift Prostate cancer Pumping Iron Dumbbell Post Polio syndrome Dodge Charger Internal oblique Internal ballistics David Bautista Amy Dumas Artificial limb Puberty Diesel engine Myocardial infarction 2002 Tour de France Swingout Front crawl Backstroke Dieting Major League Baseball television contracts United States House of Representatives Terminal ballistics Pete Rose Stuttering Growth hormone treatment Shawn Michaels President of the United States Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Pok__mon Trading Card Game Clinical depression Swimming Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sarcomere Powerlifting Sydney Riot of 1879 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Norway national football team Seabiscuit Carpal tunnel syndrome Gregorian calendar Lung Indianapolis 500 Myopia Urination Motor oil Bates Method Tris Speaker Radius (bone) Flat feet New York Jets Drag racing Glossary of climbing terms Lung cancer Stopping power Carburetor Dialysis Cardiac arrhythmia Trumpet Babe Ruth Craps Paleoclimatology Proprioception Hand International cricket in 2005 NWo Growth hormone deficiency Anchor
