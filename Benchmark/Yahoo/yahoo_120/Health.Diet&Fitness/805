workout question how many sets should i do on my back workouts i usually aim for is that too little or too much i tried doing sets for my back and i never get a sore the next day only a little and people told me that if you're not sore the next day then you didn't workout enough is that true all my workouts are intense and are completed in minutes i follow a strict bulking diet reps for back are in the range and how about the chest how many sets should i do for that i usually aim for on this one too likewise if i only do about sets i only feel a little tiny sore in my chest the next day reps for chest are please help me i'm really confused on how many sets i should be doing for these bodyparts thanks onset muscle soreness is not always a good thing our bodies will undergo the processes of inflammation repair and remodeling in response to the stress by our workout a certain degree of muscle soreness or pain may be experienced after a workout muscle soreness that occurs directly after a workout is known as acute muscle soreness muscle soreness that appears hours later after exercise is known as delayed onset muscle soreness or post exercise muscle soreness acute soreness is due to reduction of blood flow to the muscle and an accumulation of metabolic by products like hydrogen ions or lactic acid which by the way is not good for you seems to me that if your friends muscle soreness is intense or lasts more than hours later they are over training most likely they experience decrease in workout performance increased number of infections elevated heart rate and blood lactate levels during exercise loss of body weight chronic fatigue and psychological staleness as for your sets training loads that high can actually lead to excessive training which will lead to over training and failure to see any beneficial muscle gains as to know how many sets or reps to do consider the following large muscle groups take longer to recover more slowly than smaller muscle groups fast twitch muscle fibers recover more slowly than slow twitch muscle fibers recovery from fast movements takes longer than does recovery from slow movements heavy weights require more recovery time than lighter weights more reps sets and frequency require longer recovery times than do fewer reps sets and frequency what are u looking for more mass to tone up lose weight i can't tell you how many reps to do without knowing this info the average beginning trainee knows that high reps reps or more at to of rm is best for muscular endurance ad is not conducive to gaining muscular mass the lighter weights used in high reps work are not enough to innervate the higher threshold motor units in a muscle when heavier weights lower reps are used in resistance training more muscle fibers are recruited the more muscle fiber recruited for an exercise the greater the extent of remodeling in the entire muscle here is a key for you endurance training or more reps at sets hypertrophy training reps at sets strength is at fewer reps at sets power training is reps at sets that's the only tip i can give you without knowing how long you've been training what kind of workout your doing what your goals are etc the best thing i can recommend is to tell you to spend the on a trainer tell him or her what you want to do before your appointment so they know what to prepare for and tell them that you have a strong weak knoweldge of machine and free weights in your gym good luck and i hope this helps Chronic fatigue syndrome Skeletal muscle Cocaine Anorexia nervosa Psoriasis Clinical depression Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Action potential Hypoglycemia Childbirth Puberty Insulin Cancer Dialysis Breastfeeding Folic acid Acute respiratory distress syndrome Asthma Massage Epilepsy Diabetic neuropathy Post Polio syndrome Prostate cancer Creatine Aortic dissection Group A streptococcal infection Marathon (sport) Methamphetamine Growth hormone treatment Tocopherol Radiation therapy Sleep Pneumonia Overtraining Fecal incontinence Space elevator Glycogen storage disease type I Swimming Aspartame Osteoporosis Stuttering Internal ballistics Poliomyelitis Lactic acid Coeliac disease Nutrition Hypertension Jet engine Milton H.
