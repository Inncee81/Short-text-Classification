diet tricks hello people i was just wondering does anyone know how much weight you would lose if you ate like chewing gum and water and lettuce for like two weeks does anyone know thanks depends on how tall you are and how much you weigh i'm on day three of a seven day fast right now and i am losing lbs a day with exercise which is all water weight this will level off after a few days but i still expect by days and to be losing about lbs a day after that i ease back into a healthier died i chew gum and drink water and tea but that's it you shouldn't exercise rigourously when you restrict calories however it's a great idea to restrict calories for a short period of time two weeks is just enough because since you will be taking in little or no carbs your body will go into ketosis and after two to three days when your body has consumed its glucose stores your body will start using its own fat for energy thus the weight you lose after some period of time is less water and more real fat this is of course a bad idea if you have diabetes good luck to you in your endeavor and stay strong Dieting Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Breastfeeding Fasting Calorie restriction Hyperglycemia Insulin Obesity Super Size Me Weight training South Beach diet Weight loss Bodybuilding Exercise Tooth Milk Nutrition Calorie Alcoholic beverage Healthy eating Adjustable gastric band Hamster Glucose Diabetic ketoacidosis Ketoacidosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Protein-energy malnutrition Sugar substitute Urinary incontinence Insulin resistance Equine conformation Marathon (sport) Food Chewing gum Fancy rat Veganism Guinea pig Weight Watchers Dialysis Caffeine Energy Chocolate Swimming Egg (food) Zone diet McDonald's Hamburger Weight Glucose tolerance test Mojave people Carburetor Fat Raw food diet Carbohydrate Social rule Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Omega-3 fatty acid Ketone bodies Binge eating disorder Sugar Tea Glycogen storage disease type I Glycemic index Ferret Ton Hypertension Adipose tissue Trans fat Birth weight Ecology Tocopherol In-N-Out Burger Vegetarianism Water Muscle Kosher foods Pound Tofu Fecal incontinence Coconut crab Vitamin C Word of Wisdom Diabetes insipidus Polyols Junk food Nicotine Food guide pyramid Domestic rabbit Fast food Human height King Piccolo Saga Life extension
