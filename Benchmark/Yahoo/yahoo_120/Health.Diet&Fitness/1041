i have a friend who i think is anorexic she never eats during school dinner times and looks under weight she told me she hasn't gained any weight in the last four years but has actually lost it i find this troubling as she is only like me i have told her many times to eat more and the negative effects of not eating but i don't know what else to do does any one have any tips she is lucky to have such a nice friend who is worried about her i would suggest that you do not tell her to eat more or comment on her weight or the amount she does doesn't eat because that will just stress her out even more and she doesn't need the extra stress she is already stressed with her illness remember that anorexia is an illness not just a silly girl who wants to lose a few pounds i recommend that you just have a casual talk to her say that you are always here for her to talk to and thats nothing she will say will make you like her any less if you are very worried about her weightloss and she looks very ill then i would have a chat to the school nurse if you have a nurse at your school or maybe a teacher whatever you do don't force her to talk about it if she doesn't want to the day will come when she will accept that she has a problem and will get help until then then all you can do is be there for her good luck Anorexia nervosa Social rule Little Britain Kodocha Dieting Friends Clinical depression Pro-ana Theory of conduct Guinea pig Humphrey Bogart Extras (sitcom) Binge eating disorder Singlish Shit Shaggy dog story Eating disorder Reiki Avenue Q FoxTrot Atkins Nutritional Approach Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Good Morning, Vietnam Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Lovely Bones One Piece minor characters Stomach cancer Fecal incontinence Recess (TV series) Teachers (film) Urinary incontinence Weight loss Schizophrenia The Fairly OddParents The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Breastfeeding Raw food diet Garfield Horseshoe Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Prostate cancer Coeliac disease The nature of God in Western theology Code: Lyoko Postpartum depression Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Teen Girl Squad Tip Super Size Me Tocopherol Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Amazing Race Girl (Destiny's Child song) Spidey Super Stories Kasparov versus The World Reservoir Dogs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Haven (TNG episode) Sharon Tate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Earth Girl Arjuna Undergrads Kylie Minogue Kenny McCormick Oh My Goddess!
