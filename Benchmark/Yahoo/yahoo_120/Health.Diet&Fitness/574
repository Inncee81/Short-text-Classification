how much weight have you lost since january how did you do it if you haven't lost what do you think the problem is i've lost pounds since january losing weight has always been difficult for me i don't have a high metabolism and i work hard to stay out of the overweight bmi range thus losing weight is difficult for me but i did lose pounds most of it in june july by upping my daily workout to min of cardio exercize days a week and cutting out sweets almost entirely my experience has been that if you are having problems losing weight it is because there is something in your daily routine that is undoing everything else you do that is healthy for me it was a combination of needing just a little more activity and cutting out sweets almost entirely one cookie a day might not sound like a lot but sometimes it's that one cookie that is preventing you from losing the weight all you need is resolve and dicipline to accomplish your dieting goals and believe you can do it just keep at it it's like anything else in life even if you have failed times if you just buckle down and take on the dicipline and work harder you will eventually succeed and success is sweeter than cookies or brownies Dieting Weight training Obesity Bodybuilding Atkins Nutritional Approach Body mass index Binge eating disorder Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Adjustable gastric band Chocolate Exercise Super Size Me Equine conformation Sugar Anorexia nervosa Boxing training The Ashlee Simpson Show Folic acid Clinical depression Diabetes mellitus Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Contender (television series) Breastfeeding Billboard Hot 100 Weight loss Mountaineering USS Yorktown (CV-10) Extreme Programming Dialysis Mixed martial arts Aspartame Dance Dance Revolution Cookie Monster Sugar substitute Terri Schiavo HTTP cookie The Beatles discography Cancer Hamster Battle of Kursk Girl Scout cookies Cookie Physical examination Hypoglycemia Tai Chi Chuan Hydrogen economy Split Enz General Dynamics F-111 Hypertension Pig (zodiac) Naval mine Urinary incontinence Oat Hashish IBM PC compatible Vitamin C Domestic rabbit Hikikomori Bayesian inference Weight Watchers Surveillance Atari 8-bit family Space Shuttle program Bread Chlorpromazine New Coke Coeliac disease Stroke Chronic fatigue syndrome Boyz II Men Mercury Atlas 6 Blonde on Blonde Insulin Tooth Thermoregulation Arado Ar 80 Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Anchor Garfield M60 machine gun Mass Hyperglycemia Colorectal cancer Babe Ruth Social rule Explosive material Healthy eating Nutrition Stomach cancer Canadian federal election, 1993 Sant Thakar Singh Goodness and value theory Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Skateboarding trick Human skin color Ferret
