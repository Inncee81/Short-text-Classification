is this bad i was starving to the point that i had trouble going to sleep i was so busy today that i just had a few grapes and tiny bites from leftover cheesecake as my dinner it's almost midnight and i never eat past pm but i was sooo hungry that i was getting a bit dizzy so i went to the kitchen and toasted a single slice of whole grain wheat bread calories each and ate that real slowly with a bottle of water i am really particular about weight gain i am currently dieting eating very healthy but will this cause me to gain weight i know midnight snacking is the worst possible thing to do right like i said i was very busy today so that's why i ate only the grapes and cheesecake i always eat healthy meals a day packed with fruits and veggies plus i exercise too no way am i starving myself if you do not eat and you start to lose weight its because your body is starting to feed upon itself instead of getting some grapes and cheesecake eat some apples and banannas loosing weight is a great thing and i am proud of you for making that choice but seriously what good is dieting if you are not excersicing and starving im not trying to be mean at all im just saying to think ahead start packing a lunch with fruits and vegetables in it if it gets busy snack on the food Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark German cuisine Bread Snack food Atkins Nutritional Approach Low-carbohydrate diet Alcoholic beverage Food Obesity Japanese cuisine Super Size Me Healthy eating Tomato South Beach diet Hamburger Roman eating and drinking Korean cuisine Vegetarianism Adjustable gastric band Kosher foods Hamster Anorexia nervosa Tea (meal) Wine Omega-3 fatty acid Fruit Meal Cha chaan teng Cuisine of the Southern United States Chicken Kit Kat Bengali cuisine Veganism Lunch One Piece minor characters Vegetarian cuisine Dietary fiber Serbian cuisine Pizza Swedish cuisine 613 mitzvot Milk Binge eating disorder Food preservation Domesticated turkey Miso Food storage Gatorade Food guide pyramid Cuisine of Austria Tea Sandwich Cuisine of Brazil Weight loss Folic acid Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Fasting Cat Raw food diet Bodybuilding Cuisine of Malaysia French cuisine Toast Passover McDonald's Sukkot Tooth Organic food Pig (zodiac) Chinese cuisine Rice pudding Garfield Tofu Porridge Coeliac disease Peruvian cuisine Ramen Watermelon Great Famine of 1315-1317 Breastfeeding Street food Muffin Saimin In-N-Out Burger Dim sum Kitchen Fancy rat Fanta Fugu Agriculture Comanche
