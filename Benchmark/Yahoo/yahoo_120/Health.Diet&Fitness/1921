when weight plateaus at ideal weight does that mean more efforts are futile i've been dieting since february and lost approximately pounds consistantly per week until around june i'm down to around which at ' puts me at a normal bmi my goal weight was to be around or at the very least under however i've been unable to lose anything for over a month i even began thinking my scale was just broken i stepped up my workouts but didn't really cut any more calories since i've been eating between daily anyways still nothing is this my body's way of telling me to just be happy and stop or are there any tips out there from people who have gone though the same thing i feel like most of the posts out there on plateaus are from people who are still needing to lose a significant amount so looking for advice on those last few pounds thanks your body could be telling you a lot of things first off unless you get the o k from a dr you shouldn't eat less than calories a day your body needs that amount to just function breathe digest food and keep your body processes going you may have stopped losing weight because your body has moved into survival mode and has to save all of the calories just to function the best thing to do is eat a few hundred more calories and maybe step up your cardio if you keep cutting your calories you will lose muscle and it will be harder to lose weight as for ideal weight there is a theory that everyone has an ideal weight but if you continue to exercise you will still lose but it will take longer Dieting Obesity Weight training Anorexia nervosa Bodybuilding Super Size Me Calorie Breastfeeding Weight loss Insulin Milk Equine conformation Gastric bypass surgery Healthy eating Binge eating disorder Energy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Life extension Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Guinea pig Clinical depression South Beach diet Low-carbohydrate diet Dietary fiber Fasting Glycogen storage disease type I Space Shuttle program Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hyperglycemia Exercise Egg (food) Tocopherol Little Britain Knife Vitamin C Pound Domestic rabbit Calorie restriction Dialysis Cat Omega-3 fatty acid Weight Watchers Diving Aspartame The Contender (television series) Social rule Mixed martial arts Stomach cancer Stuttering Garfield Handloading Piccolo Junior Saga Muscle Fugu Urinary incontinence Weight Cancer Body mass index Elephant Human height Bread Shaggy dog story Body type (exercise) Puberty Anxiety Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Malnutrition Dehydration Jet engine Chronic fatigue syndrome Mass Theory of conduct Diabetes mellitus Cystic fibrosis Sabbath Gravity Money Marathon (sport) The Ashlee Simpson Show Blood (computer game) Alcoholic beverage Explosive material The Apprentice 2 Raw food diet Enzyme Law of value Chocolate Botulism Folic acid Hypoglycemia Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Ton Breath Coeliac disease Glucocorticoid
