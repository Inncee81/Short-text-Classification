feeling fat and i didn't each much it's probably because i'm staying at home all day what happened is the tv woke me up am when parents are eating bfast i was hungry too so i ate one slice of whole grain bread small cup of skim milk and medium banana i ended up falling asleep this is probably what's making me feel bloated sleep after eating and woke up at am then just had lunch at noon which consisted of slices of whole grain bread small cup of skim milk and one of those calorie dannon light yogurt and i added fresh strawberries grapes and honeydew melon to that now i feel sooo fat that i'm thinking of just having a banana for dinner i usually eat more than this but i don't know why i feel bloated also i'm kind of depressed because i've seem to hit a plateau at lbs and i'm trying to lost more lbs sigh is there something i did wrong today that's making me feel this way is it true that you gain weight if you sleep right after you eat i dont think so i think the problem would probably be the food you ate certain food makes you feel fuller than others and so when you eat the same amount of food but with something that makes you full longer you tend to feel fatter sleeping isnt a big problem my relatives always do that too and they're all thin if you feel fat still try going out and walkin for a bit or something Milk Breakfast Bread Dairy Hamburger Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Pizza Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Denmark Garfield German cuisine Hamster Fecal incontinence Anorexia nervosa Jewish cuisine Food Roman eating and drinking Breastfeeding McDonald's Cuisine of the Southern United States Yoghurt Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rice pudding 613 mitzvot Cuisine of the Philippines Hypoglycemia Obesity Kit Kat Bengali cuisine Sleep Chocolate Cuisine of Brazil Food guide pyramid Cuisine of Singapore Knife Cha chaan teng Japanese cuisine Little Britain Alcoholic beverage Potato chips Tea (meal) Korean cuisine Binge eating disorder Adjustable gastric band In-N-Out Burger Internal ballistics Dream Singlish Veganism Omega-3 fatty acid Insulin Kosher foods French cuisine Cuisine of Turkey Bodybuilding Hansel und Gretel Cat Dim sum Super Size Me Food preservation Sauerkraut Coffee Guinea pig Pancake Pound Dairy product Organic food Meal Cheese Blood (computer game) Magnesium Bacon Low-carbohydrate diet Champagne (beverage) Shaggy dog story Coeliac disease Lunch Hot dog Soul food Wine French fries Pig (zodiac) Peruvian cuisine Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Healthy eating Swedish cuisine D__ner kebab South Beach diet Russian cuisine Cantonese cuisine Nutrition Soft drink
