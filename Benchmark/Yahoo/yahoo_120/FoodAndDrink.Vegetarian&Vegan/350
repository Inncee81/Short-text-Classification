how many of you vegans and veggies are in a relationship with a meat eater i am vegan and my boyfriend is a full on meat eater we have had to deal with a lot of issues how do you deal with the differences in eating styles do you have meat in the house for the meat eater or do they only eat meat when you eat at restaurants are the meat eaters willing to try your vegetarian meals what kinds of compromises have you had to make if any i think it can definitely be hard as i am a vegan too and my boyfriend eats meat i became vegan after we were already together so it is especially difficult for him to deal with this change he loves meat and does not want to give it up and i don't expect him to the only bad thing is that he misses going out to eat with me i don't really like to eat out anymore because every restaurant only makes gross meat meals he does try some of the food that i make at home though he likes it mostly as long as the meal consists of more than just a salad good luck with your situation Hamburger Vegetarianism Vegetarian cuisine French cuisine Kashrut Egg (food) Korean cuisine Pizza McDonald's Food Sausage Dieting Cuisine of Brazil American Chinese cuisine In-N-Out Burger MRE Animal rights Lisa the Vegetarian Raw food diet Tofu German cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Hot pot Hot dog Burger King Cuisine of Ethiopia Dim sum Fish and chips Meat analogue Kosher foods Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Meal Fasting Animal Liberation Front British cuisine 613 mitzvot Meat Sandwich Delicatessen Japanese tea ceremony Pancake Curry Wall Street Eucharist Punk ideology Cha chaan teng Chili con carne Bread Cuisine of the Southern United States Japanese cuisine Jewish cuisine Barbecue Roman eating and drinking Restaurant Taboo food and drink Cheese Hard-line Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
