how do i grill tofu i have some friends coming over and one of them is a vegetarian she said that she would love some tofu so i bought it and now i have a problem because i don't know how to properly grill it what spices marinates go best with tofu how long do i grill it thanks i got this one let me tell you you're gonna love it i serve it to everyone at my house even the non veggie people and they all love it first thing is this open the tofu package and drain out the water put a dish towel on the counter and set the tofu on the towel put another dish towel on top of the tofu then place two heavy books on the top of that so the excess water gets squeezed out of the tofu trust me let it sit that way for a while at least a half hour after you're done with that slice the tofu into nice thick slabs maybe thick put it into a pan and pour italian dressing all over it turn the pieces around so they're all covered in the dressing let that marinate for at least a half hour i marinate veggies in this as well it's delicious grill as usual just like anything else it does stick to the grill though so have a spatula ready to scrape it off it is soooo yummy when we do it i always grill extra to have on hand in the fridge and i can't keep my hands off of it til it's all gone o i hope you try this and i hope you love it as much as we do Tofu Hamburger Japanese cuisine Sushi Pizza Bread Cuisine of Singapore Seitan In-N-Out Burger Sento Korean cuisine Hot dog Bacon Textile manufacturing Cuisine of the Philippines Nabemono Cuisine of Malaysia Japanese tea ceremony Soy milk Diving suit Breakfast Vegetarian cuisine Recipe Sandwich Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Brazil Dim sum Jewish cuisine Kebab Cantonese cuisine Dairy Cuisine of Laos German cuisine Sauna Customs and etiquette of Japan Poker jargon Professional wrestling holds Chinese cuisine Tennis Ramen Upholstery Menstrual cup Satay Lisa the Vegetarian Dialysis Mayonnaise Cuisine of Thailand Ranma __ characters Coffee M16 (rifle) Egg (food) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Udon Muslim ibn Aqeel EastEnders D__ner kebab Initial D Idli Laksa Dundas Square Oceanic trench Veganism Pea soup Rice pudding Soba Peruvian cuisine Resident Evil 2 Wound Cuisine of the Southern United States Taiwanese cuisine Softball Little Britain Campfire Rum Mango Natural Selection (computer game) Douglas Adams Humphrey Bogart Menstrual cycle Shanghai cuisine Missy Elliott Century egg Comanche The Inside Fountain Knife Current teachings of Prem Rawat Full English breakfast The Amber Spyglass Kitchen Tilapia Grilled cheese sandwich Cha chaan teng Paul Is Dead
