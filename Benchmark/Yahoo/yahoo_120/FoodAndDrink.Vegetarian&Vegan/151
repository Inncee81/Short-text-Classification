organic facial scrubs my aunt was telling me that now that my acne is clearing up i need a facial scrub i don't want to use those scrubs that have the nasty chamicals in them and i don't want them to be tested on animals i was wondering if there was a scrub like that a vegan facial scrub or a scrub that i can make with types of foods like bananas or something please help i saw the one comment about using sea salt before you possibly attempt such i would like to remind you that salt can be and is used to remove tattoo's when there is no laser present using it to scrub on your face is something that i would strongly suggest that you not do my suggestion is to just use a good quality soap my suggestion would be dr bronner's it is not tested on animals no chemicals and is totally natural it is also organic free trade which means they deal with farmers directly and know the source and there is no middle man and profit goes directly to the farmer if you really feel the need to have some sort of mask or something to get the feeling that you face is really clean my suggestion would to keep totally natural and just add something like oatmeal or cornmeal to the liquid dr bronner's soap and put the paste on your face the oat cornmeal will soak up any extra oils to keep you from having problems leave it on your face for a bit then just gently wash it off if you want to go with something already made up you can always go to any of the online sites to purchase what your looking for if you don't have a health store in your area that has such items such as amazon william Tattoo Acne Tofu Soap Dairy Sento Fecal incontinence Kosher foods Manicure Organic food Psoriasis Surveillance Milton H.
