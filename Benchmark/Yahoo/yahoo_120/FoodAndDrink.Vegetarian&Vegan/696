i want to become a vegetarian but i am a teen and need my parents help i mean i need help on buying the food and learning how to cook it i am a fairly good cook but i will still need tons of their help how can i go about doing this i mean how should i persuade them to help me also if you are a vegetarian how should i find good easy recipes i do not know how to cook all vegetable meals very well any suggestions i also feel pretty much weighed down by everything i know nothing about all of this and i have done researched but i still feel like i do not know how to completely do it well for starters i would say that fresh salads should accompany every dinner meal you could put yourself in charge of this there are tons of salad recipes but most important use your imagination cut up some bell peppers carrots cucumber add in some croutons slices of cheese etc throw in some tomatoes or spice things up with some jalepeno peppers there are also some great rice salads out there with veggies this could be an important first step into working your vegetarian lifestyle in with your parents they cannot deny the tastiness and healthiness of the salads you should seek out a school nurse family doctor or dietician who could give you a menu of foods that will help ensure you get all of your nutrients this way you'll be directly speaking with an expert with all of the answers they can explain how healthy this is for you to your parents and your parents will likely accept a professional's opinion they will be able to give you a list of good easy recipes that can get you started as well the reason i recommended the salad is because it's simply an excellent beginning eventually you can get zuchini and squash and grill them or steam them in the microwave ask for a veggie steamer for your birthday or suggest it to your parents i am sure that your parents will love the idea of steaming veggies in a more easy way this will give you steamed corn broccoli squash etc to perfection there are tons of tasty things you can do with potatoes as well pick out some spices that sound good lemon and pepper lemon and herb garlic and herb are some suggestions cut the potatoes into strips or have your parents to it and mix up a teaspoon of cider vinegar with a tablespoon of canola oil then sprinkle the potatoes with it let them soak for a few minutes then sprinkle some herbs and some fresh parsley on them and grill them i use the george foreman grill and i highly suggest that if you dont have this to suggest it to your other family as a gift for your parents at christmas time here's a recipe for excellent corn on the cob soak the cobs still in the husks in some warm water with a dash of salt for one hour after the hour unhusk the corn get a cutting board cut up some fresh parsley scoop out a lot of butter tablespoons or so mix a small handful of parlsey into the butter mass add garlic salt it's a spice to taste it usually takes a lot of garlic salt take a test taste of the mass it should not taste too buttery but have a slight garlic salty taste to it add more parsley or garlic to taste rub the butter mixture onto each cob lavishly then wrap up each individual corn on the cob in foil preheat the oven to degrees place these wrapped cobs into a baking dish of some kind and then place them into the oven bake for minutes after minutes the corn is ready to be served keep them wrapped for people and it will keep the savory taste of parsley and the garlic salt in the corn this is excellent and will be a huge hit anyway good luck to you Bagel Ketchup Sandwich Russian cuisine Soul food Cheese Cuisine of Malaysia Roman eating and drinking Gumbo Ramen Cuisine of the Southern United States Dumpling Cuisine of Turkey Cuisine of Laos Cuisine of Singapore Kebab In-N-Out Burger Rice pudding Potato Veganism Bacon Garlic McDonald's Vinegar Cuisine of Africa Pancake Food Dim sum Tamale Cuisine of Cambodia Kelantan Cuisine of Vietnam Coffee British cuisine Chowder Rice Cha chaan teng Cuisine of Thailand Nabemono Risotto Maize Yoghurt Organic food Sushi Polish cuisine Oregano Pickling Black pepper Tomato Kraft Dinner Roast beef Asado Pasta Cuisine of Argentina Kosher foods American Chinese cuisine Potato salad Ice cream Hamster Soy milk Food preservation Omega-3 fatty acid
