vegetarians does tis bug you i drives me crazy when i tell ppl i dont eat meat then they go into this whole thing about how i should b c god put the animals here us eat but nowhere in the bible does it say you have to eat meat it gets on my nerves so bad i would understand if you lived in a poor country and had no other choice but meat but there are other ways to get protein other than meat anyway i dont eat meat b c of my own reasons and ppl should not b c i want to go against god i am a christian i just think ppl should not say that every time the herar i dont eat meat well the bible also says not to wear more than one kind of fabric at once but i'm sure those same people who are preaching the bible are wearing more than one kind of fabric the bible also says that plants existed before there was a sun to drive their photosynthetic process also the bible is not the only religious text in the world most religions pick and choose what to believe from their texts in any one religion there is a wide range of interpretations i mean you'd think there'd be one specific belief set in stone but no that's not how it is so i think any belief has just as much chance of being right or wrong as the million of other beliefs in the world that's why i personally don't take part in any specific religion and find it silly to bring religion into every single little thing from politics right down to what we eat now if you want to delve into the other interpretation of the bible everything in the garden of eden was vegetarian they were told not to eat from the tree of life and they did and that was a sin not an apple please i eat apples every day anyway the bible also states that one day the lion will once again lay down with the lamb it's kind of sad to not take into consideration that just maybe god put us all here to evolve and learn and grow humans and non humans that we all have a soul but circumstancially were born into differnt bodies quoting jesus from the essene gospels of peace 'thou shalt not kill ' for life is given to all by god and that which god has given let not man take away for i tell you truly from one mother proceeds all that lives upon the earth therefore he who kills kills his brother and from him will the earthly mother turn away and will pluck from him her quickening breasts and he will be shunned by her angels and satan will have his dwelling in his body and the flesh of slain beasts in his body will become his own tomb for i tell you truly he who kills kills himself and whoso eats the flesh of slain beasts eats of the body of death for in his blood every drop of their blood turns to poison in his breath their breath to stink in his flesh their flesh to boils in his bones their bones to chalk in his bowels their bowels t o decay in his eyes their eyes to scales in his ears their ears to waxy issue and their death will become his death kill not neither eat the flesh of your innocent prey lest you become the slaves of satan for that is the path of sufferings and it leads unto death but do the will of god that his angels may serve you on the way of life obey therefore the words of god 'behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is breath of life i give every green herb for meat Ten Commandments Soul 613 mitzvot Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Resurrection of Jesus Genesis Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Satan Book of Isaiah Jehovah's Witnesses A Course In Miracles Trinity Kashrut Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Angel Christianity and anti-Semitism Aztec Baptism Christian views of Jesus Mortification of the flesh Unclean animals Buddhism End times Christianity Christian anarchism Abrahamic religion Sola fide Hell Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Grimke Sisters Origin belief Simone Weil Church of Christ Mary, the mother of Jesus God Jesus Meaning of life Isa Holy Spirit John Howard Yoder Judaism Evil Day-Age Creationism Mormonism and Judaism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Salvation Blood (computer game) Immortality Sacrifice Prophet Paradise Lost Religious perspectives on Jesus Capital punishment Gospel of Barnabas God and gender Devil Chicken Sabbath Heaven Urantia Kosher foods Alan Campbell (pastor) Virgin Mary in Islam Religion and abortion The Amber Spyglass Antichrist Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Noahide Laws Paul of Tarsus Philo Idolatry Fasting Joseph of Arimathea Human nature Book of Mormon Book of Revelation Animism Eucharist Creationism Fundamentalism Korban Curse and mark of Cain
