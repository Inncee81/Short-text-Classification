wannabe vegetarian hey there i wanna be a vegetarian i feel i face oposition in my fam my mum chucks a mental if anyone in our house wants to do as much as use the microwave or toaster when she is cooking a meal it's pretty unbelievable i haven't told my fam about wanting to go veg yet because i feel they would be unsupportive i'm quite serious about not eating meat anymore even if i was granted the elusive use of the microwave and toaster for me to use it wouldn't be enough to sustain me on a vegetarian diet in the long term i wouldn't even be allowed to chop up vegetables let alone cook them in a tasty way when i was in grade i went veg and after a while my mum started slipping small pieces of meat into my food and packing my lunch with say a beef samwhich trying to force me to go back to eating meat please help any ideas okay i definitely think you should talk with your mom about being too controlling it sounds like your old enough to make some of your own decisions and she needs to respect that whenever i became vegetarian my mom supported me but the rest of my family and friends didn't they would tell me i was going to die or get really sick or i was weird it hurt because to me vegetarianism isn't a huge deal it's just a meal preference or a way of showing how you feel about something you do need to tell your family even though they might not support you they'll get over it show them some information about the health benefits of being vegetarian and explain that it's something you are serious about and you want them to support you or at least not undermine your efforts i think with time they'll come around be prepared for lots of why questions tell your heart and stick to your guns don't let anybody tell you its stupid good luck veggie power Vegetarianism Hamburger Veganism MRE Food Treehouse of Horror V Tofu Cuisine of Denmark Little Britain Barbecue Theory of conduct Bengali cuisine Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Hot dog Lisa the Vegetarian McDonald's Kodocha Korean cuisine Kitchen Meal Vegetarian cuisine Garfield Sandwich Kashrut Vegetarianism and religion The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story EastEnders About a Boy Dim sum Yum cha Vegetarian nutrition French cuisine Animal rights Chinese cuisine Sausage Cuisine of Brazil Ramen Meat Loaf Breakfast Buddhism Bento Japanese cuisine Spice Girls Cuisine of Ethiopia Futurama (TV series - season 4) Omega-3 fatty acid Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Raw food diet French fries Social rule In-N-Out Burger Egg (food) The dozens The Marshall Mathers LP Recurring South Park characters "Weird Al" Yankovic Piccolo Junior Saga Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Japanese tea ceremony Bart Sells His Soul Yoda Rent (musical) Haggis Time Out of Mind American Chinese cuisine Calvin and Hobbes Fasting Foodborne illness Paul McCartney Meat analogue Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kenny McCormick Cuisine of Africa Beef noodle soup Chopsticks Jewish cuisine Burger Ron and Fez The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Chicken soup RuneScape quests Knife Pizza German cuisine Australian words Married... with Children Prostate cancer Coronary heart disease The Two Doctors Cheese Blood on the Tracks Pok__mon Live!
