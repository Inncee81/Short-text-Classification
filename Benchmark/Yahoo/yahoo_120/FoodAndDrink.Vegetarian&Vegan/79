using organic apple cider vinegar as a salad dressing studies say u shouldnt eat fruits veg gether i was just wondering if it would still b ok because apple cider is very alkaline but i know apples have a lot of sugar which is one of the reasons veggies and fruits dont digest well together thanks no don't mix fruit with anything they should be eaten alone i do believe that apple cider is not alkaline but the opposite acidic all vinegar is acidic once fermented as such the apple goes from alkaline to acidic i've never thought of it too much as i don't use vinegar often but i would guess that it's not a good combination i make vinegar and oil dressing once in a while but notice no ill effect as it's on rare occasions i would guess that it would cause gas if use often good question you'd have to look at how an acid like vinegar apple cider has other acids than white vinegar which just has one acid reacts with an oil then how they both react together in your gut something like lemon juice mixed with olive oil would solidify the oil in your gut i'd expect something similar to happen with vinegar Vinegar Apple Fish and chips Acetic acid Cider Beer Fermentation Mayonnaise Breakfast Wine Cuisine of Denmark Jewish cuisine Apple pie German cuisine Peruvian cuisine Salad Olive oil Yoghurt Citric acid Mango French cuisine Sulfuric acid Ammonia Fanta Pickling Balsamic vinegar Hot sauce Cheese Dandruff Sushi Lemon Omega-3 fatty acid Cuisine of the Philippines Culinary mustard Hydrochloric acid Mead Japanese cuisine Tooth Food science Hypoglycemia Hair conditioner Rum Veganism Country wine Sauerkraut Soy protein Botulism Barbecue Sugar Nutrition Soil pH Tomato Diarrhea Cuisine of Austria Ester Cuisine of Africa Enzyme Alkane Russian cuisine Olive Carboxylic acid Aspartame Carbon dioxide Bread Tofu Malus Brandy Food Champagne (beverage) Tooth enamel Cuisine of Argentina Green Sauce Hydrogen sulfide Jam Date Palm Fish sauce Acid rain Hydrogen Raw food diet Egg (food) Invisible ink Sugarcane Toffee Butyric acid Cashew Crohn's disease Chile pepper Oily fish Biochemistry Milk Hydrogen peroxide Chutney Sewage treatment Water (molecule)
