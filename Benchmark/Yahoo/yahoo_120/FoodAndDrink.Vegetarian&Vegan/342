am i a vegetarian ok so for the most part i eat veggies fruits nuts and whole organic foods but there is the very rare time like once a month that i have no choice but to eat a fish or chicken because my family is anti raw anti vegetarian and anti vegan i do not have dairy products or egg products unless forced to by my parents am i a vegetarian or vegan i just want to make it clear my family punishes me if i don't eat to their satisfation i do not eat meat purposely i come from a portuguese family where meat fish and dairy are their main food groups i have explained numerous times to them in a respectable manner with facts to back me up but they are in complete denial and are stuborn you are not a vegetarian i would say you are working toward being a vegetarian though vegetarians eat no animals vegans eat no animals or animal products i am sorry your parents are forcing you to eat meat that can be very hard for someone who is working toward her beliefs i am not sure how old you are but sometimes kids get more freedoms when they can get jobs especially if you can buy your own fake meats and other foods that might make your parents satisfied you also have the option of refusing the meat and getting grounded you can also leave information around the house that shows the nutritional benefits of the lifestyle you want to pursue not that i am all for giving parents a hard time but maybe they would get over the forcing you to eat meat otherwise you may have to wait until you are to be a vegetarian but until then don't give up on trying Veganism Hamburger Vegetarian cuisine Meat analogue Kashrut Raw food diet Dieting Vegetarian nutrition Food guide pyramid Food Vegetarianism and religion Kosher foods Egg (food) Animal rights Tofu Meat Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Chinese cuisine Japanese cuisine Buddhist cuisine Sausage 613 mitzvot People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Pizza Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler McDonald's Cuisine of Brazil Korean cuisine Environmental vegetarianism Coronary heart disease Factory farming Fruitarianism MyPyramid Soybean Peter Singer Omega-3 fatty acid Bengali cuisine MRE Nutrition Whaling Roman eating and drinking Chicken Burger Dairy Protein Jewish cuisine Burger King Unclean animals Cyanocobalamin German cuisine Paleolithic diet Cat food British cuisine Livestock Cuisine of Malaysia Soup Agriculture Cuisine of Denmark Fecal incontinence Organic food Eating Breakfast Christian Vegetarian Association Snack food Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Buddhism Gelatin Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Africa Quorn Kebab Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ethical consumerism Domestic rabbit Punk ideology Cake Organic farming Cuisine of the Philippines Fasting Fish and chips Chicken soup Kangaroo Cat Food preservation Dim sum Straight edge Nut (fruit) Acorn Pork Food storage Tlingit
