i am having a problem with cravings and being vegan i know that animals are tortured and murdered for the meat eaters' pleasure and i know that there are hundreds if not thousands of chemicals in meat and dairy but i am getting cravings for meat and dairy again i have only been vegan for weeks am i just going to have to watch a peta video everytime i start to crave a mcdonald's snack wrap i know it sounds like i'm being a smart alec but i'm not i have really been struggling the last couple of days and i was wondering if any of you had had this problem thank you soo much for your help huuugs i have been a vegan for about months and i can honestly say that i have not given into any cravings it's more than likely that i have unknowingly eaten some nonvegan and perhaps nonvegetarian foods but i've made every attempt to avoid those the first thing i would suggest is to watch supersize me it's a documentary on fast food that will really gross you out there are very few fast food joints i will go to and when i do it's not often at all secondly f the above movie doesn't convince you to stop eating fast food i highly suggest is to watch earthlings if you haven't already it is adocumentary narrated by joaquin phoenix that explains how much humans rely on animals for food entertainment science and clothing it totally changed my life because it pretty much convinced me to convert to veganism i wasn't vegetarian before i was a full on omnivore once you understand how much of an impact your diet has on the world it's hard not to change thirdly like others have said there are tons of alternatives to meat and dairy if you have a whole foods or outpost near you that will be much easier for you i depend heavily on the meat alternatives boca obviously makes boca burgers but if you're used to eating real hamburgers make sure you have lettuce tomato and other condiments that way they test better and of course get the extra veggies boca also makes chicken nuggets which are really good morningstar makes what i think are called meal starters they have ground beef steak strips and chicken strips i use the ground beef in tons of recipes gardenburger also makes vegetarian and vegan burgers make sure to look at the box veggie crumbles ground beef and my favorite bbq riblets oh they're so yummy tofu is also a great addition to a vegan diet if you haven't started eating that it's cheap about a block high in protein and low in fat as are all veggie protein substitutes it tastes bland by itself but will take on the flavor of whatever marinade or sauce you use i definitely suggest the firm or extra firm varieties dairy substitutes are pretty easy at least for me to come by i've successfully found vegan ice cream soy decadent makes peanut butter zig zag which is to die for cream cheese sour cream tofutti brand and mayo nayonaise and veganaise they do make vegan cheese too but i only use it on homemade pizza so as you can see tons of alternatives to meat and dairy finally becoming a vegan is a huge change i've been given a hard time about it but i think my family and friends are finally beginning to understand how important this is to me just remember that a vegan diet is a diet of compassion good luck to you Sandwich Burger In-N-Out Burger People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Egg (food) Korean cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Fish and chips Dairy Milk Chili con carne Peruvian cuisine French cuisine Breakfast French fries Dieting D__ner kebab Animal rights Kashrut Bengali cuisine Fast-food restaurant British cuisine Curry Ramen Burger King Cuisine of Malaysia German cuisine Soul food Ice cream Cajun cuisine Bread Soy milk Snack food Chocolate Livestock Soy protein Pancake Raw food diet Cuisine of the Southern United States Jewish cuisine Domesticated turkey Butter Cat Chicken Buddhist cuisine Cantonese cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Cuisine of Argentina Seitan Organic food Cha chaan teng Sausage Cuisine of Africa Vegetarian nutrition Garfield Mayonnaise Taiwanese cuisine Peanut butter Cuisine of Singapore Peter Singer Kebab Fecal incontinence Fancy rat Horse meat A&W Restaurants Environmental vegetarianism Bagel Dim sum Soup Margarine Crohn's disease Factory farming Cuisine of Norway Kosher foods Chicken soup FoxTrot Coronary heart disease Oreo Street food Cuisine of Thailand
