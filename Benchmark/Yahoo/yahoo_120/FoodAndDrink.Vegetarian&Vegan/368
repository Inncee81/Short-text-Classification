help frozen romain lettuce is it still good to eat for some reason my refrigerator is freezing half my foods on the top shelf but the other parts of the refrigerator is fine i know i need to turn down my refrigerator now what i need to know is my lettuce still good to eat will it still be good when it defrosts too let it sit on a less cold shelf for a while to defrost then rinse it under cold water the water should help to revive it it won't be as good as if it was never frozen though depending on how long it was frozen for it might be pretty gross but give the thawing rinsing a try it shouldn't hurt you any to eat it btw just might not be very good at all oh and also concerning your fridge some have really bad circulation try getting a thermometer they have ones in the cooking aisle and putting it on the different shelves to check the actual temp you probably do need to adjust it but be careful that you don't put it too high at my old apartment the fridge and freezer only had one adjustment and if we made the fridge less cold the freezer would not be cold enough to actually freeze the food very unsafe Refrigerator Tofu Ice cream Domesticated turkey Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sento Philip J.
