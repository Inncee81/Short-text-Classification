i'm a vegetarian almost vegan and i don't get enough protein veggies vegans what's your fave protein ok to everyone who has accused me of implied that i am perpetuating the myth i didn't post this question to have any particular reaction from you i was only looking for some ideas i thought someone would come up with something that i had overlooked for those who asked i did a nutritional analysis with my nutritionist and she suggested that i up my protein intake a bit not a ton just a bit so please relax i didn't mean to upset you i'm coming to this question of yours late relatively speaking so don't think i'm beating up on you with this answer g you say a nutritionist said you needed more protein but they didn't have any suggestions that's a major part of what their supposed to do g how did they come to this highly unusual diagnosis that you were short on protein are they up on the latest knowledge about protein needs the latest advice based on decades of studying human protein needs is to have protein consist at most of your calories in other words on a calorie diet you would want no more than calories of any protein i e less than grams the reason i bring all that up is that the scientists wanted the recommendation to be but raised it after 'protein' industry pressure nutritionists that aren't keeping up with the research are still advising clients to consume much larger amounts than the body uses i suspect yours falls into this category now on to the good stuff that you can't possibly think is me picking on you vbg my favorite source of protein is the humble potato it's exactly the right percentage of protein calories and over a century of research shows that it contains all the protein people need next on my list is soy and other beans grains esp corn maize and leafy vegetables did you know that a standard serving of something as icky and useless as iceberg lettuce has about a gram of usable protein other greens like spinach mustard turmip etc have as much as grams per serving and they're all low calorie proteins g you might want to follow this link and use their pantry section to compute your daily values and get ideas on foods you might like to add or remove from your diet http www nutritiondata com Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Omega-3 fatty acid Milk Dietary fiber Soybean Vegetarian nutrition Food Tofu Calorie Healthy eating Vitamin C Folic acid Nutrition Guinea pig Breastfeeding Low-carbohydrate diet Tocopherol Cheese Egg (food) Hypoglycemia Raw food diet Coronary heart disease Agriculture Organic food Peruvian cuisine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obesity Maize Coeliac disease In-N-Out Burger Gelatin Soy milk Biodiesel Prostate cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Paleolithic diet Alcoholic beverage Trans fat Origin of life Hamster Hamburger Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Famine McDonald's MyPyramid Energy Bodybuilding Plame affair Iron Alcohol fuel Genetically modified food Alzheimer's disease Francis Crick Coffee Little Britain Life extension Soy protein Cyanocobalamin Bengali cuisine Aztec Rice Theory of conduct Fancy rat Glycemic index Herpes simplex virus Chocolate Cuisine of Brazil Natt__ Potato Brain South Beach diet Crohn's disease Aspartame Psychology HIV test Domesticated turkey Insulin Cat Ferret Nutrient Ramen Pet skunk The Skeptical Environmentalist Anorexia nervosa Brewery Barbecue Standard enthalpy change of fusion
