question for spankers and non spankers my four year old daughter talking back i have a four year old daughter she's mostly a great kid but can have a pretty smart mouth on her lately i've had a lot of trouble with her attitude she's just saying no a lot unwilling to do things when she's asked etc i've used spankings in the past but they're just not effective and i really don't want to spank her anymore because it doesn't do any good anyway so if you spank how else would you handle this situation and if you don't spank what do you find works we only use spanking for very serious stuff to be honest we've usually tried other methods before we use spanking if we get to spanking that usually finishes it then again nothing about our family is very pc our spankings are no joke we use the more traditional way of spanking pants down over the lap so i'd suggest you try one of these spankings if your at the end of the rope personally i think if you don't make a spanking a real spanking like i described above they just flat out don't work if this is not a method you think you'd want to use then maybe try long time outs half an hour or just pick a consequence and stay with it be consistent on the very rare occasion we get to spanking and it doesn't work we simply just do another one that i think has only happened once or maybe twice with all of our daughters i usually never do a second spanking but on those occasions i've never done a third sorry my methods aren't very new age but we stick with what works good luck Spanking Theory of conduct Social rule Erotic spanking Buttocks Beavis and Butt-head Textile manufacturing Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hazing Shaggy dog story Shit Pitaten Paddle (spanking) Corporal punishment Poker jargon L.O.C.K.D.O.W.N.
