how different is it having children than i've always heard people say that after kids it's all the same how true could that possibly be i already have a car that will fit a th child i'm not concerned financially heck after two it was all the same for me you have to make dinner just add a few more of the same ingredients so it's just about the same you have to shop for clothing just pick up one or two more outfits thankfully much can be handed down so that is just about the same you are already changing diapers so one more doesn't matter what is an extra minutes i babysit two children and they just sort of fall into line with the rest of my kids i look a bit funny walking around with two extra toddlers i guess because i get a lot of comments but to me it doesn't seem like that big of deal because there is not much difference from to shrug i think it's all in how you look at it if you think you will struggle then you will if you think of it as no big deal and just go about your day then it's no big deal Kimberly-Clark Corporation Diaper Kimi Finster Social rule The Apprentice 2 Wheel of Fortune Late Night with Conan O'Brien Invader Zim Theory of conduct Jackass: The Movie Rich Mullins The Sims 2 Textile manufacturing Electrophysiology Garfield Sheepshead Little Britain Aerial (dance move) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Infantilism The Fairly OddParents Joke Our Gang Winning Streak Recurring South Park characters Teachers (film) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Trailer Park Boys EastEnders Time Out of Mind Infant baptism About a Boy Philosophical skepticism Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 President (game) SpongeBob SquarePants Vegeta 2000 Australian Grand Prix Baldrick Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garth Brooks The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Extreme Programming The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Escape from New York Calvin and Hobbes Card Sharks Fecal incontinence Spot the Dog Hey Jude Teletubbies Whose Line Is It Anyway?
