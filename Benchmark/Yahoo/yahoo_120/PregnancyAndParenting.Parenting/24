back school question does fathers who pay child support are also responsible to buy clothes or uniforms good brand shoes back pack school supplies my hubby's ex told him that he has to buy all this things i mentioned so the kid yrs can take them home this weekend he is going back home after months in an airplaine but i know that child support is to pay the kids needs hubby send per month i receive chilld support for my daugther but i have never ask for extras besides i don t even use her monye unless it is really necessary most of the money is in her savings account for college or who knows it can be need it in the future i work full time so as my hubby we hace other kids thank god we do good kids have what they need a little more but i don't think this is a must at least i will not ask my daugthers father for more i receive the same amount per month is this a must or no any advices thanks in advance if you are able to put the support you receive for your daughter then it sounds as if you are a fairly well off family that is good because you know your kids are getting what they need for school and they will be able to go to college etc etc so even though your stepson lives elsewhere it sounds as though you could afford a little extra to make sure he has what he needs for school as well don't get me wrong but i am the full time parent of my son and he goes to visit dad over the summer as well and i have a minimal income right now so if my ex can afford the school supplies i won't complain however it is not a requirement unless it was part of the court ruling which is possible because when my current hubby got his divorce that judge had him paying for everything have your hubby look over the divorce papers to make sure and then decide as a family if helping with the extra costs of back to school is more a benefit to your stepson or to his mother and i say don't send cash but you could shop online and have it shipped directly to your stepsons home because that is probably a lot cheaper than sending extra items on the airplane Child support Divorce About a Boy Life insurance Credit card FairTax Laura Schlessinger Money Social Security (United States) Friends Sears Holdings Corporation Fathers' rights Student loan Internet fraud Flat tax Wal-Mart Personal finance Theory of conduct The Amazing Race Craps United Kingdom corporation tax Babylonian law Episodes of Lost (Season 1) MapleStory Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Microeconomics Saved by the Bell Annuity Doug Humphrey Bogart 1957 World Series Neighbours Gross domestic product Neopets Daylight saving time Monetary policy Health insurance Back to the Future Fathers' rights movement in the UK Appeal SCO-Linux controversies Politics of Canada Betting (poker) CPU cache Bond Poker jargon School choice RuneScape economy Boy Scouts of America The Apprentice 2 Ethical consumerism British monarchy The Catcher in the Rye GSM services Shaggy dog story Mortgage 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sweatshop Public transport Boston and Lowell Railroad The Family from One End Street Social rule Education in the People's Republic of China 613 mitzvot Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Productive and unproductive labour Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Mary Astor Tesco Wedding Crashers Santa Claus Stock Animal Crossing Kyoto Protocol $ale of the Century Commodity Hyperinflation Crew Exploration Vehicle Good Times Customs and etiquette of Japan Surveillance Commodity markets Externality Unemployment Education in Germany Hybrid vehicle Charles Ponzi Final Fantasy XI Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Anarchism and capitalism Miss Saigon Luke Skywalker Status of religious freedom in Malaysia The Legend of Zelda series characters Economics
