parents regarding a couple questions yesterday on spanking i noticed an enormous amount of people who were promoting spankings as the only method of discipline they went so far as to say that if you don't spank you are raising criminals my question to those with similar opinions if you are so firmly convinced that you are right why do you lower yourselves to making unfounded statements that are untrue nick and ask a poe you make great points supermom lol i wish i could live in such a simplistic view of the world over the last few generations spankings have been more used by a number of people on the whole and the downfall of society is attributed to family breakups drugs alcohol abuse domestic violence etc brought about by whom the parents of old who loved a good 'ol spanking i think it is ridiculous that people think spanking should be the only form of discipline different things work for different families my son has never been spanked he behaves just fine he has consequences for his actions it just isn't physical punishment i think for a child to grow to become a criminal has alot more to do with the family structure then the form of disciple used does it really matter what form of discipline you choose if you don't pay attention to your child i know a few parents who only spank or discipline their children when the child is doing something that annoys them when their child slaps another child they seem not to care there isn't even a that was nice nice given to the child no form of disciple works if it is done inconstantly in some countries such as sweden spanking is illegal they have a very low crime rate compared to ours they also have a low child abuse rate Spanking Corporal punishment Divorce James Dobson Domestic violence Child abuse Punishment Plame affair Arguments for and against drug prohibition Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Microeconomics Economic inequality BDSM Religion Drug abuse Fathers' rights Human sexual behavior Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Motion picture rating system Murder Theodicy Serial killer Illegal drug trade Infantilism Incest Karen Horney Children of God Drug addiction Dogville Cultural relativism Polyamory Education Unemployment Abortion debate Hazing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gross domestic product Consensual crime Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Crime EastEnders Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Appeal Rape Publicly funded medicine Alcoholics Anonymous Inflation Slander and libel Moral Politics Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Philosophical skepticism Transsexuality Summa Theologiae Free trade Narcissism Video game controversy Knots Landing Tariff Economics Erotic spanking Polygamy Psychiatric hospital Law of value 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Flat tax Caning Causality Trafficking in human beings Humphrey Bogart Tax Drug test Left-handed Public policy Franz Boas Yoga Sutras of Patanjali American Psycho Generation Y Software engineering Zoophilia International law Child sexual abuse The nature of God in Western theology School discipline Abortion in the United States Intelligent design movement Ageplay Human sexuality Black market Paddle (spanking) Tom DeLay Gender role Internet troll
