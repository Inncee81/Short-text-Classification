what do you guys think about this i found it very hurtful and upsetting a couple days ago i announced at a family get together not a special occasion just a monthly ritual that i had been approved to foster to adopt and i would have a child within a month that would be my first child the same night my cousin announded she was pregnant with her third the comments i got were you're very lucky to be given a child and i hope you take the responsibility seriously my cousin got congratulations and well done now i know this is bitchy but she had sex i went through months of grilling interviews classes etc sorry i'm not usually like that i'm just so upset none of my family could understand why i walked out did i over react hi yes i know many pregnant women struggle also i really didn't mean to undermine how special and important pregnancy is as i said earlier i'm not normally one to make a remark like that and i did congratulate my cousin and i honestly am happy for her sorry if i hurt anyone's feelings by that remark p i was just sad because everyone else got so many good comments with their first children and they're not all great parents ofcourse i would've gotten upset this is your first child your child rather you carried it or not it is sooo special anyone can lie in a bed and make a baby but to go through the process it takes today to get a child and succeed is a remarkable thing and you should be commended on going through this to help a child in need of a mommy and while this may be an exciting time for your cousin as well shame on her for announcing her pregnancy right after you announce your big news she sould've waited until a different occasion so you could've got all the attention she's already got that attention for two others why steal your spotlight but take my advice and do not let it ruin the happiest moment in your life when i got pregnant with my son and was so thrilled to tell my mother in law b c she has no grandchildren and also wanted them so badly and this would be her first i thought she'd be thrilled and i told her on mothers day last year and she goes oh really in a very disappointed way and i say whats wrong aren't you happy and she said it would've been better if robbie and crystal would've been the ones giving me a grandchild which is my husbands brother and wife i was depressed for a long time and then i realized that i was missing a beautiful thing being pregnant with my baby over what someone thinks i wasn't having a baby for her so i shouldn't give a damn what she thinks and you shouldn't either girl i completely understand you though and i think you should tell all your girlfriends and you should have a baby shower even if its not a baby you're adopting let them know the age and gender of the child and they buy gifts accordingly that will give you the party you deserve and help you realize how happy you should be just roll your eyes about the scene at that occasion and feel sorry for your family b c they are missing out on this this is a great thing you're doing and even though your family didn't tell you well done congratulations and i'm very excited for you EastEnders Shaggy dog story Sharon Tate Knots Landing Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Kodocha Pregnancy Humphrey Bogart History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Cliff Richard Eddie Guerrero Theory of conduct Days of our Lives About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Miss Saigon Marilyn Monroe Abortion debate Married... with Children Alois Hitler The Catcher in the Rye Neighbours Laura Schlessinger Adoption Sex and the City Jam (TV series) Charmed The Inside Fancy Crane Babe Ruth Little Britain Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jon Secada The Smoking Room Marriage Haven (TNG episode) Elvis Presley Milton H.
