will a seven year old remember for life or will they forget my mom and i had huge conflicts as did my brother and i i set some major bounderies with my family and it did not go well i was trying to sort it out and handled things the best that i could unfortanetely my daughter was in the middle she saw me cry heard me talk bad about my family to my friends she heard me say things to my mom that i wish she hadn't heard finally i ended the whole situation by moving away since then my family is doing so well espcieally my daughter being away from my mom's negative influence has really increased my daughters confidence tremendously i hardly see my family anymore and most likely will not go to family holidays as i want us to have a good christmas will my daughter remember the conflict in detail will she remember that we once were close to grandma when she was tiny or will she just grow up seeing how i am handling things now and just think that i have never been close to my family will she remember the mean things said when she is older i will explain things if she remember and even has questions seven year olds do have the capacity to remember things for the rest of their life but they will only remember it if they think it was really significant i would just not mention it to them again and if they bring it up just play it down and say that it was nothing to worry over this may help them to put it out of their mind if they get a bit older and start to ask questions you may want to be open and honest about things that way they will really appreciate your honesty and may help them to feel as though they can be open and honest going the other way in the future Avenue Q Social rule Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Infantilism Pok__mon Live!
