parents hmmm why do you let your child do this i have seen quite a few teens on here talking about having sex or have had it or cyber online or watch porn etc where are their parents at hmmm our children will never be allowed to do these things ever or not in our house i feel the same way but kids do things we know nothing about some times they do it in other people homes my daughter is going on this weekend and i will never say she won't do something but i have a very open relationship with her and she comes to me about everything the other day she asked me how old was i when i had my first kiss i almost fell out because i thought omg she had her first kiss but i told her i was going on and she said there is a girl in her class who kisses a boy all the time and she told me mom she is trash i am so happy to see that me being open and honest with her that she sees it's not okay to follow others i already had the sex talk with her and she knows it's a beautiful thing but it will kill you she asked why would people want to do something that will kill them i told her alot of things will kill you sex driving rock climbing swimming and so on but with all those things you have to be careful i just pray that she continues to trust me with all her questions but i will never say never because my husband and i completely thought my step daughter who lives with her mohter was doing so good with straight a's in school but she got pregnant at and her baby is weeks older than my month old we thought she was smart enough but we as adults make mistakes so if we don't comunicate with our children they will make them as well and we as parents have to protect them because they can end up dead from one mistake aids About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye Friends EastEnders Futurama (TV series - season 5) Laura Schlessinger Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lovely Bones Infantilism Humphrey Bogart Polyamory Miss Saigon The Amber Spyglass Theory of conduct Boston Public Great Teacher Onizuka Abortion debate Child sexuality Marilyn Monroe Jam (TV series) Sharon Tate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hollyoaks Little Britain Jean Grey Phoebe Halliwell Charmed The Pilgrim's Progress Scouting The Shining (film) Care Bears Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Baby Blues George Costanza Child pornography Yoko Ono Grandview, U.S.A.
