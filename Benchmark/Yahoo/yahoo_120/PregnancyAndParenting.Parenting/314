would you scold someone else's kid or does it bother you when other people scold and or discipline your child or children i ask cause it really pisses me off and i just wanted to know if maybe i am exaggerating i am always on top of my kids let me tell you maybe i should have explained more so people won't jump to conclusions basically if i am scolding my children i don't need anyone's help especially if you've already screwed up your own kids people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones yes i am a little touchy about this topic but i can't help it they came out of me and i am a damn good mother i don't think anyone else should be butting in where they're not wanted or needed if you are in the process of scolding your own children and someone butts in with their two cents worth you are perfectly right to be angry about that they have no business doing so however once your kids are in school and or joining various groups it is perfectly acceptable for an adult in charge of their well being to scold them as the mother of two i have been a cub scout leader and a h leader i can tell you there have been times when i had to scold some of the kids it's generally no big deal but occasionally the offense was fairly serious and i felt compelled to tell the parents what the child did and how i handled it i do not remember a time when the parents were indignant over this if they were i would probably have told them that perhaps another group would be better for their child The Marshall Mathers LP Humphrey Bogart Scouting Theory of conduct About a Boy Recurring South Park characters Narcissism Zhao Yun Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) Aerial (dance move) Damn Yankees Pitaten Rent (musical) Chess (musical) Ken Ichijouji Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist True Crime: Streets of LA Shaggy dog story Codename: Kids Next Door One Piece minor characters South Park Babe Ruth Trailer Park Boys Code: Lyoko Eric Bischoff The Fairly OddParents Calvin and Hobbes Billy the Kid Electrophysiology The Jeffersons (South Park) Economics Criticism of libertarianism Spanking Make money fast Lance Armstrong God Emperor of Dune Professional wrestling attacks Boy Scouts of America Grief Recess (TV series) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Social rule Shawn Michaels Kender E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
