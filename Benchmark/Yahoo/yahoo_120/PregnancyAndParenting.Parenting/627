would you let your year old son watch the latest harry potter movie my year old daughter a harry potter freak has been dying to see it and so we're going on friday with my hubby and older daughter my only question is do you think it would be appropriate to bring my year old son along or should we let him stay home with a babysitter i am personally a harry potter freak as you put it and my children have seen the first couple of movies and really liked them but after seeing this last movie i refused to let either of mine ages see it there's just too much violence for either one of them the raters of the movies were dead on with putting it as a pg it shouldn't be viewed by anyone younger so to answer your question no don't take your year old and if i were you i would reconsider the year old as well believe me i love the books and movies and if i felt it was appropriate i would let mine see it but it's not it's just too scary for the little folks also if you haven't read the books you should the books become much more sophisticated dangerous dark and violent as they progress therefore any movie after should be viewed with caution Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Motion picture rating system Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sydney Riot of 1879 Theory of conduct Harry Potter (character) Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Young adult literature EastEnders Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Knots Landing MPAA film rating system Minor Hufflepuffs Danger Man The Shining (film) Hogwarts Ron Weasley Sharon Tate Severus Snape Little Britain The Pilgrim's Progress Iron Maiden Trapped in the Closet Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Socrates Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Cindy Sheehan Mary Sue Ginny Weasley Death Eater AFI 100 Years series Blood purity (Harry Potter) Paul Is Dead Bat Boy Minor Ravenclaws Hogwarts subjects J.
