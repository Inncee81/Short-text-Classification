horrible terrible misrable two's what to do my son is months old does not listen he is constantly getting into things breaking things i never thought could be broken but worse is that whenever we go anywhere it turns into me chasing and yelling at him if anyone but me says stop or sit down he listens it is becoming so frustrating especially when we are out in public i dont want to spank or scream any other good options time out has been working for the moment and only that moment then he gets into something else your son sounds just like my daughter at that age she got into everything broke things i didn't think she could break and tested me every chance she got often she would look at me and say no before i even asked her to do something i was very frustrated i did alot of reading and researched behavioral type books for ways to get her to listen i finally tried a reward system i made a chart with all the days of the week and several little squares under each day every time she did what she was asked i would give her verbal praise as well as hugs and kisses i would then let her put little stars next to the boxes on her chart i told her that when she filled in her chart i would take her to the store and let her pick a prize it doesn't have to be expensive i took her to a store and let her pick a toy she was really happy it will take a while but when a child sees that behaving properly and listening will be to their benefit they eventually come around it is very necessary to stand your ground on accepted behavior if you make exceptions your child will quickly pick it up it took about weeks for my daughter to get used to the routine and in time she embraced it things improved dramatically i also started doing this to establish a good tooth brushing schedule it really worked for me i hope you have the same results Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Dog training Milton H.
