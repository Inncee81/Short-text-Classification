my daughter is years old and still breast feeding we both love it do we stop i love the feeling and the closeness we have my husband doesnt think anything of it but im pretty sure this has to stop my daughter is so close to me she loves it but im guessing it has to stop if i had it my way she would do it forever as long as it kept us this close for all of this baloney about how it can damage her teeth it can only damage her teeth if she sits there with mouth full of milk swishing it around in her mouth and this crap about they only need it until three months or all those other stupid comments about how minimal the length of time breastfeeding should be obviously they are very uneducated about breastfeeding and should find a la leche league to discuss this matter more accurately so they get all the facts one commenter said they say to continue breasfeeding as long as it's a mutually positive experience but there comes a time when you have to consider the weirdness factor and i agree with that i'm not going to tell you that you have to wean her i'm not going to tell you that is disgusting it's not btw i'm not going to tell you that you are horrible for doing it those people need to just shut up but you do need to consider the weirdness factor i understand the bonding experience involved with it and i'm glad your husband isn't concerned about it but your daughter is getting to the age where she will be entering school it is time to start weaning her don't worry about the bond you have a bond and it will not be broken because you wean her but yes it is time to start weaning not because other people find it offensive or disgusting but because of the developmental steps your daughter will soon be taking Kodocha Fertility awareness Polyamory Shaggy dog story Childbirth "Weird Al" Yankovic EastEnders Nine Inch Nails Eric Cartman Anne Rice One Tree Hill (TV series) Jean Grey Tooth enamel Taken Late Night with Conan O'Brien Whose Line Is It Anyway?
