why are some parents nots teaching their children to cook clean or even do laundry i have noticed more and more over the years that a lot of people do not teach their children how to cook clean or even do laundry and i wish understand the reasoning behind this i would think that teaching your children these skills would be a valuable asset in their adult lives and i'm not just talking about new parents today i know people who cannot do any of these things that are years old and all the way up to years old so when i do ask them why do you eat out everynight why don't you cook why do you have to take your laundry to a cleaning service do you know what kind of responses i get i don't know how no one ever showed me how to do it we had somebody else do it for us what sense does this make and please before i have to hear about the fact that i don't have children i grew up in a large family and being the oldest i had to help raise and take care of my siblings and all of us know how to do these basic things for those who asked what is my basis for this here are a few examples example my mother has a neighbor who is years old and his mother comes over days a week to do his laundry buy groceries cleans his house and takes out his garbage example my ex who is years old never had to do anything in the house when he was growing up so when we moved in together you could imagine what i came home to on after the st day example a year old coworker of mine eats out every meal of the day and doesn't even know how to make a sandwich at home it seems that your examples could also be a cause of laziness and dependency however i know what you mean my children help me do the household chores yes they are supervised when using solvents or machinery but my year old knows how to operate the washing machine does the dusting she loves to dust go figure vacuums the house mops the floor washes windows and cleans the bathroom counters all without complaining because she understands that these things need doing and that mommy is not going to do it all by herself why should i her dad is also teaching her how to cook i don't like to cook so that is my hubby's job the year old feeds the dog helps me unload the dishwasher also loves to dust it must be the neat duster we have and picks up her toys every day this is just how it is in our family so they know no different i want them to be able to be self sufficient when they get older i also want them to have respect for all the chores that must be done and for the people that do them daily like mom we have a chore choice chart at home and the kids get to choose their own chores to do each week it is a laminated sheet that we can write on with a dry erase pen and each week we start with a blank page each person can choose to do whatever chore they want provided that they all get checked off during the week my oldest likes this and tries to get her favorite chores before anyone else does which is great since it makes her do it quickly and motivates her my hubby's best friend still lives at home has mom do his laundry and basically take care of him i don't want my kids to be living at home when they are The Fairly OddParents Pitaten Fecal incontinence Hamster Garfield Laura Schlessinger Kitchen Calvin and Hobbes The Adventures of Pete & Pete Theory of conduct About a Boy Microeconomics The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Textile manufacturing Laundry Humphrey Bogart Kimi Finster Baby Blues Dog training Rich Mullins Infantilism Social rule Good Times Little Britain Married... with Children Abortion debate Milton H.
