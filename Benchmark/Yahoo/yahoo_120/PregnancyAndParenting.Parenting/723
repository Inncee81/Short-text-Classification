how should i ask my employer about reducing my hours as my daughter is starting school hi hurni i had to do this to and lost many hours of sleep over it before i worked up the nerve to approach them pick someone you work or communicate with who has a finger on the pulse of management and knows which policies they are flexible on communicate openly and ask the direct question have they made consideration in the past for an employee or employees who need their hours adjusted for child care when you get your answer determine who is best to speak with ask for a few minutes of their time and have this converstion in person be up front and honest and keep it on a professional level for example don't get into the specific details of your household any family issues etc just stick to the facts point out your past attendance and work performance ask this individual directly if your hours can be changed and give specifics i need to be allowed to arrive at and leave the office by ask if this would be possible or if other arrangements can be made give a timeline i need the adjusted schedule until my employer was more than accommodating and appreciated that i didn't do this in email or on voice mail plus it is more difficult for someone to look you in the eye and tell you 'no' or to blow off your request they granted a trial period for one month i was allowed to arrive at am instead of i left the office at instead of five when they saw no decline in my productivity they agreed to adjust my schedule until summer vacation good luck to you Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Call centre Labour economics Extreme Programming Sydney Riot of 1879 Surveillance Unemployment Education in the People's Republic of China Infantilism Domain Name System United States House of Representatives Eye Dog agility E85 Timpani Hearing aid Education in Japan Hearing impairment Scientology beliefs and practices Computer Supply and demand Economic inequality Article One of the United States Constitution Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Volleyball Canadian Senate Daylight saving time First aid Appeal Shaggy dog story Bob and George Autism Canadian House of Commons Same-sex marriage in Canada CPU cache Single Transferable Vote Customer relationship management Microeconomics Password Communist Party of Czechoslovakia City of Heroes Social rule Milton H.
