preschool or daycare i am a stay at home mom my oldest goes back to school soon and i have another baby on the way in dec my nd child is and can be some what of a handful on his own my husband suggested that we put him in daycare a couple times a week to get him ready for preschool next year and to give me some what of a break during the rest of my pregnancy and after the baby is born then one of my friends told me that the preschool that my daughter went to has a program days a week for year olds too there is only one problem with the preschool my husband and i hate the teachers there we constantly had problems with them while our daughter was there the year olds have a different set of teachers but we are unsure if we should give them another chance with our son which would be better the preschool or a daycare j o y good for you i am glad that you have the patience and time to keep your children with you at all times that is your way of parenting not mine you can keep the rest of your opinions of me and my husband to yourself thank you wow some people are messed up joy anyways i would go with the preschool if you are wanting to prepare your child for school i am an early childhood educator and a mother and i would rather put my child in a preschool rather than a daycare because they are more structured and would prepare him better but it all depends on the daycare some daycares are more like a preschool i would check around for different daycares and you might find one that is more like a preschool and one that has really great staff and a very structured program don't do something that is not comfortable for you and your husband daycares and preschools are a great way to ready your child for school and being in a social environment i think that people that keep theirs kids home forever will find that their children will have a harder time coping with school and social situations good luck explore your options Kindergarten Day care Laura Schlessinger Early childhood education EastEnders McMartin preschool Montessori method Dissociative identity disorder Education in Taiwan Kodocha Social rule Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Phil of the Future Narcissism Boston Public Prenatal diagnosis The Adventures of Pete & Pete Friends Knots Landing Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Critic Neighbours Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pitaten Shaggy dog story Sesame Street Melanie Wilkes Unemployment In vitro fertilisation Child sexuality Hikikomori About a Boy Childbirth The Notorious B.I.G.
