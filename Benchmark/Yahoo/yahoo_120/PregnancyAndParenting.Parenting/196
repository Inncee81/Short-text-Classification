my yr old daughter and yr old son want to share a room is this to old for a boy and a girl to share a room they want to get bunk beds and share a room because they saythey are best friends its sooo cute i am just wonderin everyones else thinking on this btw they have their own rooms at the momment the yr old sleeps in the yr olds bed every night though honestly i wouldn't worry about it at this age i do have to say one thing about someone elses comments tseruyah suggested it wasn't a good idea because boys are curious about the sexual differences between the sexes at this age but the truth is both boys and girls are curious about it no need to become paranoid though and what tseruyah says about the touching is a bit overboard it's normal for children to recognize the differences between boys and girls it's all part of growing up but her suggestion that your son would start touching your daughter inappropriately is ridiculous that is a learned behavior and usually occurs among siblings that have been molested by someone thus repeating what they have experienced on others around them it kinda bothers me that tseruyah would suggest such a thing and then include that this has happened among ppl she knows that would send up a red flag to me as a parent that something fishy was going on in that house kids are curious yes but usually they have questions or comments that they share w everyone about what it is they don't understand rarely do they touch each other knowingly as if they understood the function of each part of each others bodies as for how old is too old i'd say when your son starts to ask more questions about life in general the typical stuff that needs explaining the birds and the bees stuff then i would separate them that and he will be going through puberty around age and boys tend to want their privacy then i would however discourage the sleeping in the same bed not because of what could happen but simply that it's become a bad habit and needs to be broken now before your son is soon your son might not think it's such a fun idea to have little sis crowding his bed and your daughter might take this as a rejection of some sort and could hurt their bond as brother sister it's better to get across to your daughter now that sharing a room is okay but that everyone has their own sleeping space and needs to stay in it be prepared for your daughter to want and try to climb into your bed at night if she can't sleep w your yr old it sounds like she just is wanting comfort this is not much different from older kids that still want to sleep w the parents and the parents are conflicted on how to get their older child to sleep in their own bed your going to have the same issues here Milton H.
