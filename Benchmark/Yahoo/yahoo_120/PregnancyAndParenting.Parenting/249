what do you think about multi age classrooms especially anyone that has had a child in a k class or teachers i have just found that my son is going to be in a multi age classroom this year i had already known he'd be with the same teacher from last year and i had said that i thought that a multi age classroom might be good for him i had read about some benefits including overall more acceptance of differences and of peers less peer pressure the fact that children grow and learn from siblings that are of different ages than them it can promote leadership and nurturing qualities as far as i know they will all be learning the first grade curriculum children kindergarten age that are ready to begin learning first grade skills already will be in this class along with the st graders i can see how it could benefit a child like my own who entered school at an early age and give them extra time to mature at their own rate and i like that he will still be learning st grade level work i was also wondering if anyonelse had any thoughts on this or anyone that who has experienced this could i used to teach at a school that had rooms and was grade k i taught special ed there so i didn't have experience in the classrooms but i did observe them it was k then then then i think it really helped the kids being in those kinds of classes they would have frequent study times while the teacher taught the other side of the room i subbed in one of them before and it went really smoothly the kids played together well if you have the right teacher and limited students i think k would work well Education in the United States Education Education in Japan Experiential education Graduate school Secondary education in Japan Education in Taiwan Homeschooling Education in Portugal Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Education in Hong Kong Drama No Child Left Behind Act Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Gifted Intelligent design movement Primary education Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Education in Romania Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Alexander Technique Glen Ridge, New Jersey High school E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
