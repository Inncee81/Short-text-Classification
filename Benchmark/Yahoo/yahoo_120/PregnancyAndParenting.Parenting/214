should bad behaviour be rewarded when my boys were little if they did something wrong they had smacked bottoms or some other form of punishment if it was causing damage like when they flooded my kitchen playing firemen they had smacked bottoms and were made to put the damage right if it had been deliberate vandalism they wouldn't have been sitting down for a week and they'd spend that week doing lots and lots of chores to make up for what they'd done and think about not doing it again so why is it that teenaged graffiti artists who spray obscene language all over our town where young children can see it are given grants to attend art college and those who steal cars and drive them dangerously are sent on car maintainance courses or taken go carting what sort of a deterrent is that what example does it set to the children who stay within the law shouldn't vandals and thieves rather be birched and then set to work in the community in distinctive uniforms so that we can see justice being done i mean set to work on community projects like scrubbing their graffiti from the walls cleaning up the canals buiding cycle paths and play areas for the children and so on well i agree that these things should ideally be dealt with within the family but i am talking about families where this will not happen and then the authorities must step in yes they can be trained and rehabilitated with courses after they have been punished but i am talking about deterrence what incentive is there for the well behaved children to continue to do so if they see the naughty children constantly being rewarded and given all of the attention see what sparkles says also the public who suffer from their activities need to see justice being done or else one day there will be an explosion of vigilanti ism if there isn't already hence the public works idea why don't we just try it and see what happens well as i say above skeet i am talking about those families who will not discipline their own children as for the birch i have heared that when we did have it here very few went back for a second dose and that is the point isn't it if it works as a deterrence that is good enough for me and it's hardly anything more than a temporary short sharp shock that will hopefully change attitudes and behaviour permanently excellent answer caroline s and from real life experience not parenting books and theories we all knew what you say to be true once just as our parents and grandparents did before us well moonstone maybe you can begin to understand me i want the best for all of our children's and grandchildren's future and above all that means creating a decent society for them to grow up in families play the major role but if they don't and within families too grandparents can play a role thank you for your answer i agree with you too on that sparkles' edit b from the number of thumbs downs i get on here do you think that i would be elected ha ha i find the idea of constantly praising children and ignoring bad behaviour very wearing i went on a parenting course because i was having problems managing my then yr old son i got sick of having to 'meet him at his level' and tell him all the time how great he was if a child is kicking you in the shins how can you ignore this i was supposed to wait until the naughty behaviour had stopped and then praise him after a few disagreements with the course leader i said what's wrong with a quick whack it always seems to work so much faster he looked at me like i had suggested frying kittens every action must have a consequence this is a fact of life the sooner people get this the better Theory of conduct Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Plame affair Ethics Spanking Corporal punishment Punishment Social rule Nicomachean Ethics Justification (theology) Shaggy dog story Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Transactional analysis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ecco the Dolphin Goodness and value theory Religion Dog training Motivation Scientology beliefs and practices Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Graffiti Beetle in an Anthill Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism 2000 Australian Grand Prix Second language acquisition EastEnders Causality Leadership Theodicy The Catcher in the Rye Capital punishment Fathers' rights The nature of God in Western theology Determinism Economics Abortion debate Development of Darwin's theory Kender One Tree Hill (TV series) Grand Theft Auto (game) Originalism Contract Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Entropy Bernard Williams Karma Sin Buddhism Value system Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Futurama (TV series -
