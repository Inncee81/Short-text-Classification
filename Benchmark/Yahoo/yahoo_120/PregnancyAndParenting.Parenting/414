what is the difference between 'spanking' and 'abuse' this is my definition of both spanking when physical punishment is used as a consequense to unacceptable actions and is used to teach a child what actions are unacceptable this type of punishment does not cause any permanant marks doesn't break the skin doesn't break any bones doesn't bruise and doesn't cause any permanant damage example little johnny jerked his sisters ponytail purposly and his mother spanks his bottom little johnny feels pain briefly and cries however that is the last time he pulls his sisters hair abuse when physical punishment is used simply to lash out at a child out of anger frustration or meanness and is not used to teach a child about consequenses or unacceptable behavior this punishment causes bruises cuts broken bones and other long lasting physical marks example little johnnys father is tired after working and johnny accidentally spills his milk in the floor so his father closed fist hits him across the face causing a bruise that lasts for days Spanking Domestic violence Flagellation Diving Serial killer Fred Phelps Corporal punishment Dog training Bruise Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Equine conformation James Dobson Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Infantilism Fecal incontinence Boxing Incest Eddie Guerrero Child abuse Human sexual behavior Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Violence in sports Knots Landing Pitaten Comanche Self-harm Boston Public Cephalic disorder Beavis and Butt-head Paddle (spanking) Buttocks Child time-out Punishment Urinary incontinence Erotic spanking Great Teacher Onizuka Torture BDSM Radiation therapy Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Fathers' rights Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Ten Commandments Poker jargon Switch (rod) Psoriasis Puberty Hansel und Gretel Physical attractiveness Breech birth Hypoglycemia Guinea pig Professional wrestling The Catcher in the Rye Professional wrestling holds The Caves of Androzani Ranma __ characters Tenshinhan Narcissism Pillory Cat Jackass: The Movie Good Times Milton H.
