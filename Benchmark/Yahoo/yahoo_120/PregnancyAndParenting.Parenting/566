why do parents get mad when kids get lice my aunt is a nurse and when she tells the parents that they're kids have lice they get mad at the kids it's not their fault so why get mad i have never understood this myself i think it has to do with parents being embarrassed and ashamed my guess is they think it's some sort of reflection on them like they don't keep their children clean or something i managed to not get lice when i was a kid but a lot of that has to do with the fact that we didn't live in the us and i went to expensive private schools had i gone to public schools especially when i was really young i would most likely have gotten it my cousins got it twice both times my younger cousin brought it home from school it's such a natural normal thing for kids to get i don't see what all the fuss is about yes you have to do a lot of cleaning and not just of your kid's head but it isn't their fault i know one of the times my cousin got it every single kid in her classroom had it as well and they spread it to kids on the playground so the school had everyone stay home for three days until stuff at the school could be cleaned up the thing i remember most though is that my aunt was absolutely mortified it was like my cousin who was all of about six the first time had gone and hung out with homeless people or something and brought it home just to shame my aunt i remember my mom talking to her about it later and telling her it wasn't a big deal and since the whole school had to deal with it no one was going to worry about pointing fingers i also remember that my aunt got really indignant with my mom and said that was all fine and dandy my mom didn't have to deal with a kid with lice did she little kids share germs too so getting mad at a kid for catching lice is like getting mad at them for catching a cold or the flu both are equally useless parents need to get a grip treat the kid and just move on EastEnders Theory of conduct The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kodocha Little Britain Empire Burlesque Rugrats AFI 100 Years series Rich Mullins Codename: Kids Next Door Infantilism She Loves You Recess (TV series) Laura Schlessinger Hey Arnold!
