what difference is it if a young mother has more then one kid my cousin has just added on to her family she now has two beautiful little boys she's she's told me she constantly gets dirty looks and people are so rude to her she financially supports her kids she's married she's graduated high school most of all she loves her kids i also have heard people say in shock oh my gosh i can't believe is only twenty two with three kids about other people so after you are already a teenage parent and can support and raise these kids what difference does it make if you expand your family is it just a stigma i'm also asking because i'm a young mother and i'm planning on starting to try for baby two in october i'm so excited but i'm not looking forward to the rude people again she probably gets those looks because most teenage parents aren't that stable or mature there are few out there that are like your cousin but unfortuately in my un popular opinion most teenagers don't make good parents Recurring South Park characters The Fairly OddParents Generation Y EastEnders Saved by the Bell Boston Public Neighbours The Marshall Mathers LP Kender Adoption Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) The Fast Show Humphrey Bogart The Young Ones (TV series) AFI 100 Years series Haven (TNG episode) Laura Schlessinger About a Boy Teenage pregnancy Silent Night, Deadly Night New Kids on the Block Hikikomori Baby Blues Supergirl Cardcaptor Sakura Rugrats Rocko's Modern Life Joke Friends Hey Arnold!
