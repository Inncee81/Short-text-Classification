parents how do you deal with the way your kids are coached in sports before i was married i was an athlete and coached pee wee football i am still heavily into sports and am a personal trainer now i think i am becoming one of the parents i used to hate right now my son plays pee wee football and my daughter runs track i get to the point where i can't watch practices and games because i don't like the way the coach is coaching i am very competitive and just want to step in and take over i have even exchanged words with coaches and afterwards felt really bad and had to apologize especially for the sake of my kids i know in my mind i need to step back and let the coach do his job and this year i am trying to do that but it's hard do any other parents have this problem and if so how do you handle it i am a coach as well as a parent i'm not as competitive as you seem to be but remember that in peewee football the coach is a volunteer and is out there because he she wants to be there or no one else volunteered in school sports it's a little different and a little more competitive but the more parents interfere the more difficult it is to coach or keep the kids' respect have you volunteered to coach peewee one season of coaching should give you a whole new perspective on the parent situation i coach soccer and we have a zero tolerance rule if a parent interferes at all the parent is banned from games how sad for the child try hard to step into your child's shoes during practices and games concentrate on what they are feeling thinking and doing during that time instead of what the coach should or should not be doing live life through your children's eyes and realize how embarrassing it is to them to be one of those parents i don't always agree with the way other coaches coach or how parents act however i make sure i try hard to be a positive role model for my children as well as my players seeing parents so upset or frustrated during practices or games makes the kids lose concentration and takes all the fun out of it pretty soon they won't want to play anymore this is really sad if they have natural talent try taking an anger management class it will teach you methods to calm down instead of over reacting my brother took an anger management class and he's so much better at controlling his outbursts Football (soccer) American football Sport Cincinnati Bengals Ty Cobb National Football League Norway national football team New York Giants Ben Johnson (athlete) New York Jets Football Volleyball Jim Thorpe ELO rating system Indiana Pacers Infantilism Pitaten Boston Public Major League Baseball television contracts Buffalo Bills Cleveland Browns Rugby union Theory of conduct Blackjack Baseball Violence in sports New York Knicks R.S.C.
