moms help kid's school question first time in school i went to school overseas i'm not familiar with school in the united states my yr old is starting prek at the public school next week and i'm clueless why do they require duplicates of things like sets of crayons markers etc do we have to buy the brand on the supply list do we get them back at the end of the year do you all label your stuff with your kid's name are washable markers and crayons really better than the ones which are not labeled washable my son uses markers at home and has never gotten the stains on his clothes so i'm wondering can kids wear closed sandals to school and change to sports shoes when it's time to play i really am clueless about everything the system was different where i went we wore uniform and kept our tennis shoes in a locker for pe time any help would be appreciated also stuff that i may not have thought to ask thanks moms why do they require duplicates of things like sets of crayons markers etc they don't exactly require them it is mostly a precaution so if your child runs out they will have another set do we have to buy the brand on the supply list no but some brands do tend to be better than others for crayons markers and colored pencils i would recommend crayola and for glue and glue sticks i would recommend elmers but for everything else it doesn't really matter what the brand is do we get them back at the end of the year yes unless they are an item for the classroom such as tissues do you all label your stuff with your kid's name some schools request that you do it but they usually do not require it i believe it is a good idea to label if you have a young child but always label backpacks and lunchboxes are washable markers and crayons really better than the ones which are not labeled washable my son uses markers at home and has never gotten the stains on his clothes so i'm wondering to tell you the truth i have never noticed any big difference in the two either kind you choose should be fine can kids wear closed sandals to school and change to sports shoes when it's time to play that decision is usually the schools choice but it is usually permitted also i'm not a mom just a regular year old kid haha hope i answered all of your questions Crayola Upholstery The Amazing Race New York Giants Economics Ethical consumerism Clothing Theodicy Calvin and Hobbes CPU cache Paintball Genericized trademark The Adventures of Pete & Pete Sears Holdings Corporation Sanitary towel Drawing Mario Diaper Mattress Microeconomics Softball Bob Jones University Mnemonic Domain Name System Dog training Marching band Culture of the United States Teachers (film) Tag Volleyball Brand Motion picture rating system The Ashlee Simpson Show Triathlon GED Shaggy dog story Extreme Programming Poker jargon French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Fast bowling Rich Mullins Topps Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Presuppositional apologetics Swimming pool Social aspects of clothing Electrophysiology Hey Jude Empire Burlesque Tattoo Password Betting (poker) Surveillance Public Eye Menstrual cup Motion capture Badminton Green Day School uniform Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Philosophy of language Deconstruction Customs and etiquette of Japan Tennis Fashion Humphrey Bogart Supply and demand Kurt Cobain Kimono Orienteering Education in Germany Expert system Intelligent design movement About a Boy Violin Pencil Teacher's Pet (Disney) Textile manufacturing Raffles Institution Archery Theory of conduct School choice Doug Athletic shoe Rave party Double Dare Homeschooling RuneScape quests Little Britain Frogman Trademark Baseball The Human Stain African American Vernacular English Nanyang Girls' High School Homer Simpson Sento Corset Rick Santorum Japanese tea ceremony
