to the parents whom spank how many of you have thought about your actions and have at least considered using discipline over fear to teach your children it would be a joy to hear that at least some people have thought better of using violence against their own children sunny i didn't ask a question about spanking being banned we're all very defensive aren't we i'll bet you probably wish you could spank me how will you get your way with only words right leslie k that scenario wouldn't happen because my children are under my control and not running all over the place not like those little hooligans you see whose parents think a slap is good enough nope my children weren't taken away from me all but one are grown up now and doing excellently i'm just giving my opinions and asking questions call it curiosity and the fact that i care about children not being raised with fear sometimes its absolutely vital to gain there attention but i think they should stop early my parents stopped when i was about yrs old and they just started showing us they were disappointed and allowed us to make the right choice and i dont know if it was luck but times outta we did we talked about everything openly and they became more of advisers and guidance than just mom and dad i wouldnt say they tried to be our friend because no parent should ever do that they just talked to us like we were people and they treated us like they knew we were capable of doing the right thing and they accepted the fact that we were going to make mistakes i greatly appreciate this because i have strong morals and i am confident enough to know i can make the right decisions Spanking Theory of conduct Religion Shaggy dog story Theodicy Abortion debate Motion picture rating system Fathers' rights God Emperor of Dune Infantilism Philosophical skepticism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Blonde on Blonde Child sexuality Social rule Corporal punishment James Dobson Fred Phelps Time Out of Mind Transsexuality Plame affair Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
