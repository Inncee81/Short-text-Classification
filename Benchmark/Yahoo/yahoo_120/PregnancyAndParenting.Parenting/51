to anyone who grew up in a large family do you plan on having a large family yourself i grew up in a family with kids including myself my parents and a jumble of pets i now have kids of my own am pregnant with a th and own animals i never did plan on having a huge family myself it just fell in place now i can't imagine anything else this just seems right i only have one brother and i always longed for one of those big really close families they always seemed so full of fun and love i definitly want a big family i was always so lonely despite what people say it's really hard to relate to a brother and i really wanted a sister a sister and a brother that's all i'll need both my parents were the youngest of big families so maybe that explains the fact that there's only two of us bad news is that i'm the oldest so i always had to care for him and my brother with his male ego didn't like that so i got in trouble and the fact that both my parents are youngests doesn't help i plan on a big family i am so envious of people with lots of siblings they're your best friends and they'll always love you so i didn't grow up in one but now i want one you always want what you never had huh d Humphrey Bogart Garfield Pitaten Kimi Finster Doug Kodocha Kyle Broflovski EastEnders Hollyoaks Baby Blues Charmed K' Koopa Kid Friends Static Shock Incest W.I.T.C.H.
