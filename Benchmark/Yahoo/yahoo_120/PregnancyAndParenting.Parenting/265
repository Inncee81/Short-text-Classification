where are the parents why are there such young kids getting on here asking questions that are so 'adult' what happened to being a kid parents get your heads out of you a es and pay attention to what your children are doing i don't let my kids touch the computer unless it's school related i grew up without it so can they it's hard to be a grandma when i am so no no grandma here child just a year old with three kids ages who cares about what's going on with kids who worries about other kids because my children do have to be around them and the lack of parenting out there makes for troubled kids hopefully i am strong enough as a parent to keep my kids straight amen heidi i have often thought the same thing i've decided the first thing parents should do is instead of letting them post questions on here sit them down with a spelling and grammar book it's appalling not to mention really scary that their language is text speak i really do worry about the future because if it's as bad as it is on here sometimes we are all in big trouble thanks for being a responsible adult there should be more like you out there The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Fairly OddParents Humphrey Bogart Child Malcolm in the Middle A Series of Unfortunate Events Milton H.
