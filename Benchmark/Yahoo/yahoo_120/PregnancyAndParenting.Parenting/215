what do you think of a homeless shelter that refuses to house boy's ages i have a friend that got into a fight with her violent husband so she yr old son went to the local homeless shelter they would not let her stay b c her son was between the ages of the reason given was that there was no place to house the boy with other females the women may be afraid of boy's and there was a privacy issue with males females housed in close quarters the shelter told my friend to take her son to a shelter that housed run away teens leave him there then she would be welcomed to stay at the shelter she refused to leave her son with troubled teens who may be a bad influence on him so the shelter told her to just go back home isn't this illegal the shelter is discriminating against age gender singling out boy's in a specific age group just doesn't sound right to me do you think anything legal could be done to force the shelter to make suitable housing for boy's with their mom's if dad came in with same son they would be allowed to stay it's a family shelter they have different units one for men over one for females over without children one for mom's with children under other than the problem mentioned the shelter is a nice one they get a lot of from local churches business's not to mention funds from individuals i personally have donated a lot of money to them over the years but never again we live in oregon and i don't know about the laws here i can see both sides of the argument here but at the boy does know about females and the women's shelter doesn't know what kind of history that kid has or moral fiber for that matter Domestic violence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Theory of conduct Anarcho-capitalism Kyle Broflovski Homelessness Fathers' rights Transsexuality Social rule Federal Marriage Amendment Age of consent Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Transgender Homosexuality and Christianity 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Adolescence Shaggy dog story Gender role Salic law Order of succession Recurring South Park characters French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Pitaten Elections in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Grandview, U.S.A.
