pothos toxic to month old i really need some quick responses my husbands mother left her stupid plants at the house with the baby here and didnt see fit to mention that they were possible toxic we have kittens and even though the hanging plants were set up on a table out of his reach the kittens keep knocking the plant parts down where they dangle and he can grab them we just realized that the cats were doing this and he had a leaf in his hand that he had pulled off i dont know if he ate any but since he is teething i would say its a safe bet she called posion control to be safe and i think she gave them the wrong plant name pathos instead of pothos so i dont know if they gave her the right info just said it would irritate his mouth does anyone have any advice he is not fussy or anything and as i said its possible he didnt swallow any but also like i said i didnt see the cats knock it down so i dont know how long he had been playing with it it says that it can cause swelling of the throat should i be concerned about him napping or should i be concerned about it causing him breathing difficulties concerned about trouble breathing in his sleep s i did wipe out his mouth with a damp baby washcloth and gave him a couple ounces of water i did call them and confirm that the information was correct they said he would just have an irritated mouth and to watch him for an hour he didnt have any trouble so i think we caught him before he got any in his mouth still better safe than sorry either way i am still furious with his grandmother for irresponsibly bringing something around that could have hurt him its just a good thing i thought to look it up instead of trusting that she would know better s call posion control again and go through all the info with them never assume that posiion control knew to correct an incorrect name they are there to answers all questions even if we as parents think they are silly or stupid i called posion control about some depression pills that my son had gotten a hold of and the lady from posion control called me back later to check up on him and was very sweet even though it turned out he had not eaten any just call yourself it will make you feel better Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Atomic Kitten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat Kodocha Garfield EastEnders One Piece minor characters Little Britain Friends Calvin and Hobbes Boston Public Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sin City One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Inside Humphrey Bogart Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Days of our Lives Jam (TV series) Poker jargon The Amber Spyglass Fancy Crane Kitten Pitaten Social rule Oral sex RuneScape quests The Catcher in the Rye Elephant The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Menstrual cup Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Happy Tree Friends Rose (Doctor Who) Guinea pig Rebreather Columbine High School massacre Traumatic brain injury Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Hamster Theory of conduct Mystique (comics) Palindrome Eric Cartman Plame affair Wolfrider Boom Town (Doctor Who) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tobacco smoking Professional wrestling attacks Silent Night, Deadly Night Dilbert Good Times Childbirth Hiccup Ron and Fez Conker's Bad Fur Day Book of Isaiah Characters of Naruto Softball Japanese mythology Haven (TNG episode) Gaia Online Professional wrestling holds Ed, Edd n Eddy Piccolo Junior Saga Characters of Lost Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Trapped in the Closet Professional wrestling throws Vampire Jumpstart 3rd Grade StarCraft: Uprising Tomato Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Abortion debate Jon Secada Coffee Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist
