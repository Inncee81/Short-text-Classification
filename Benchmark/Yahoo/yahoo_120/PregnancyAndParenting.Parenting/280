when your child children from the ages listens follow simple instructions behaves what do you award them with example a piece of candy a day out buy them a toy etc i know that you can't always award them with things because then they'll get use to it that's how it leads to getting spoiled but most kids that act up a little don't understand if you just give them a hug or kiss for behaving because i don't stop giving my kids hugs or kisses because they don't behave i give them that at all times wether being bad or good if they behave listen something that they're not use to doing why not award them with something for example i will take my kids out to the park if they behave or maybe give them something they don't eat every day perhaps gummie bears or maybe a bag of chips what do you guys think you reward them with a pat on the back and i am proud of you the reason you wouldn't want to spend on them for listening or take them out is because you will be setting up the expectation of that reward each time children are supposed to listen and we as moms are trained these days to think that we must reward the listening when instead rewarding should be saved for behavior that is by far and wide exceptional children deep down want to impress their parents and to be noticed so by just doing that you are encouraging more good behavior minus the hand out for a freebie try reading the new six point plan for raising happy healthy children by dr john rosemond i wish i had read that when my kids were younger it really helps put things into perspective and it's not like any other parenting book i have ever read good luck mom and keep up the good work Theory of conduct The Fairly OddParents Dog training Care Bears Humphrey Bogart The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Microeconomics Kodocha Laura Schlessinger The Catcher in the Rye Kyle Broflovski David Hume English grammar Customs and etiquette of Japan Social psychology Milton H.
