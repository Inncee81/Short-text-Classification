is my brother insane i just found out that my brother has been giving his four year old daughter benedryl to put her to sleep i think this is absurd she is four years old for the love of pete i confronted him with my concerns mainly of side effects and he told me his dr told him to do it what kind of dr would tell someone this kind of hazardous advice since i have the tendency to over react i thought i would ask the public their opinion and then perhaps emailing him the out come however if this isn't going to work then what step should be taken next i would like to add that however irresponsible he is he is still a good father who loves his daughter very much he is just constantly making jackass decisions my son's dr suggested same thing for my very active never tired son he said occasionally i don't tend to agree with unnecessary drugs for kids when i was in my 's i worked jobs where i was surrounded by cig smoke constantly i took actifed another antihistimine every day eventually i had a sore throat for month the specialist i saw said i was actually hurting myself worse than the smoke because the antihistimine was keeping me too dry go figure i'm not sure what you mean by what step to take next if you are considering child protective services don't all that will happen is you being cut off from the child some drs do say benedryl is ok if you really want to help address the not tired enough for sleep issue with my son the answer was karate american taekwondo association starts at age and does an awesome job i put him in it because the dr suggested he had add and i didn't want to drug him the bedtime willingness was one of many great side benefits he had years karate and never any drugs what an awesome young man he is straight a's advanced classes at school works hard controls himself and treats everyone with respect if you can possibly give a year of karate as a gift you will be changing her life i have to say that ata made us better parents too plus imagine the piece of mind you will have knowing she can kick butt if needed when she dates by the way physical fighting is discouraged at ata you are not allowed to fight unless it is necessary the instructor can and will take their belt away for a week or two for punishment i had one fight between my boys in those years they were high ranked so they lost their belts for weeks never fought physically again Martial art Plame affair Kodocha EastEnders Boston Public Humphrey Bogart Infantilism Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a Boy Taekwondo Pitaten Friends Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Social rule Knots Landing The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Aikido The Contender (television series) The Marshall Mathers LP Stomach cancer The Critic W.I.T.C.H.
