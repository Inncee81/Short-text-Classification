if someone gave your child a gun what would you do long but please read my year old daughter has just returned from her school friends th birthday weekend it was held hours away from home and there was girls from school traveling with the family to their rural property when i asked her what they did she has told me that they fired actual loaded pistols at cans and also they were allowed to drive a car in a paddock my daughter told me that the dad has a gun license i am absolutly mortified that adults would allow this i was not told any of this would be going on i do understand that they were on a rural property and i am by no means a prudish parent my question is should i call these parents and let them know how disappointed i am for endangering my child or just let it rest i did ask you should most definately give those parents a peice of your mind or maybe even get police involved bc what if your daughter accidently shot her freind or greater yet what if someone shot your daughter you would most definatley be mortifed and maybe the dad has a gun liscense but the little girls that he let shoot it off didnt and to drive a car is illigal even on rural property i think im pretty sure it is so you should give those parents a hard time and not trust them if i was your daughter i might go for the car ride lol jk but i would most definately feel uncomfortable handling a gun and there was probably peer pressure to do these things so theres my answer for you Sharon Tate About a Boy Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Jam (TV series) Theory of conduct Father's Day (Doctor Who) Grandview, U.S.A.
