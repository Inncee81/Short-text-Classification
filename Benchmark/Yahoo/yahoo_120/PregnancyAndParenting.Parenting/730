what do you think about cosleeping we've never done it my daughter has always slept in her own bassinet or crib we have family that does it and it's always seemed odd to me especially when the child is five or six i was just wondering other people's opinions on this i don't personally agree with it because i have seen it go too far and too long and contribute to ruined marriages when my daughter was nursing and woke up for her morning feeding between and am i would get her let her nurse and fall asleep in bed with me for about hours i do love the snuggling every once in a while but don't want it to be a habit our bed is the only place in the house that hasn't been invaded by our daughter we as adults need our own space too if she isn't feeling well or having night terrors she will sleep a whole night with us but only if she really needs it The Amber Spyglass Co-sleeping Knots Landing Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Shining (film) Insomnia Sudden infant death syndrome The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Narcolepsy Aphrodite Sleep Grandview, U.S.A.
