pregnant with nd child how do we tell his parents i am a year old mother of a year old son my son's father is horrible he sees him occasionally but doesn't do absolutely anything for him my boyfriend and i have been dating for the better part of a year now he has been a tremendous help with my son we are planning on getting married within the next years he is and still lives at home with his parents who seem to like me a lot until he graduates with his bs in accounting in may we just found out that i am pregnant and have decided to have the child he is worried about when to tell his parents and how he is afraid that he will be letting them down to a certain degree i know that everything is going to be ok and i let him know that he is just not sure when to tell them i think we should tell them asap p s we are happy and the fact that i am pregnant is not the issue for those of you who feel the need to comment on such things your honest yet intelligent and considerate answers are appreciated wow some of u are cruel don't make this out to be a bad situation because it is not i know what to do i just asked you all so that he could see that i know what i'm talking about secondly he is definitely not a loser he is on his way last time i checked a loser is someone who had no direction and didn't even try i already have a career in real estate belive me i take care of home as i mentioned before the fact that i am pregnant is not the issue at hand it's what's the right and respectful way to inform his parents think of the big picture it's his life not his parents sometimes children don't come into our lives on a planned schedule but it doesn't mean they are shameful as some people would think the taboo of children out of wed lock isn't really a big deal anymore in our generation i understand his concern for his parents' feelings and i think that s very thoughtful of him but at years old he is a grown man and should not hide something that is so important he should tell his parents about the news the sooner the better since they are helping him with school and living expenses i feel they have the right to know what's going on that doesn't give them a right to demand their personal beliefs onto you or him but a baby will be better received if not hidden from your description he sounds like a wonderful and mature guy he is also shown experience with being a good father with your son when he tells them about the new baby have him prepare what he is going to say to them including what the plan is how does he plan to support his new family does he plan a marriage soon where will the baby live who will take care of the baby how will he finish school with a baby to take care of hey even write down your plan to present to them a plan will reassure his parents that he is ready to be a good parent these are probably questions that they would be thinking about it would also be a good time to ask his parents if they are willing to help out but make it clear that they are not expected to tell them that you too are very much in love are happy together and do plan to marry also make it clear that you value them and would love to have them part of your baby's life if the baby will be their first grand child it will be hard to swallow even under the best conditions i still remember the shocked look of my father's face when i revealed my first pregnancy i was married at the time i came to visit them after a medical appointment he had asked what the appointment was for i simply replied a pregnancy test period gave him a few minutes to collect his thoughts because i think he probably stopped breathing for a few seconds as for your first son you should fight for child's support if you haven't already Friends EastEnders Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Kodocha God Emperor of Dune Humphrey Bogart Pregnancy Adoption Shaggy dog story About a Boy Pitaten Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Ashlee Simpson Show Avenue Q The Smoking Room Goodness and value theory Social rule Infantilism Futurama (TV series - season 5) The nature of God in Western theology Pok__mon Live!
