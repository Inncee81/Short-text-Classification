why do so many people answer a question without answering it then give an opinion about something else just one example the question where can i get information about overseas adoption answers you should wait until you're married you should adopt in your own country you should have your own baby why do people do this does it annoy anybody else i don't know you shouldn't eat spaghettio's for breakfast just kidding i think there are a lot of people who don't get the idea that some people are actually looking for legitimate answers on here go figure i have seen quite a few well informed answers quite a few people who researched and educated themselves before forming an opinion and they state their case intelligently and coherently then there are the rubbish questions and many more rubbish answers posted by people who are really only in here because the school semester hasn't started yet and there are the answers that are just people who are inordinately proud of their own opinions without any kind of facts to back them up and then there are the ones who create dummy accounts just to see how many thumbs down and bad reports they can get yes it is incredibly annoying but those of us who are actually looking for facts and or honest opinions just have to lump it and take the good with the bad Theory of conduct Plame affair Epistemology The nature of God in Western theology Creation-evolution controversy Creationism Shit Teach the Controversy Intelligent design William A.
