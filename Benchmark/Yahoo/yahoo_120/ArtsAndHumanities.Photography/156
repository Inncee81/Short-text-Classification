does anyone know of a place that does cheap cross processing e to c in or near l a if you can find a custom colour printing lab they may do that for you but since it changes the chemistry so much that it cannot be used to process negative film without risking cross development of the emulsions you will end up paying for both a hands development and the chemistry needed to development i used to save my transparency film i wanted cross developed until i had a number of rolls and then have my lab guy develop them all at once this was back in the late 's when we were first experimenting with colour film so times i am sure have changed calling around to some of the smaller custom labs may be your best bet or buy some chemistry and do it yourself Digital photography Craps Photographic film Photographic developer Chemistry Betting (poker) C-41 process Film editing Atari ST IBM PC compatible Photography Transparency (photography) CDC 6600 Outsourcing CPU design Data General Technicolor RISC Photographic paper Spring operating system Konica Minolta Computer Gramophone record Illegal drug trade Panavision Color photography Enlarger Deflation (economics) Nuclear magnetic resonance Advanced Photo System Bob and George MAME Software engineering Widescreen Film stock Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Spectroscopy Kodachrome Solar cell Short selling Stud poker Screen-printing Sega Saturn Drowning Monetary policy Plan 9 (operating system) Anamorphic widescreen Emacs Risk management Food and Drug Administration Laboratory Floppy disk Nanotechnology Fixed-wing aircraft Sudoku Textile manufacturing Credit card Cable television Extreme Programming Fred A.
