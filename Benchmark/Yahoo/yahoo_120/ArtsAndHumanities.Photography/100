changing the dpi resolution on a digital camera i am still a bit confused at the dpi resolution concept of a digital photo even on a megapixel camera using the highest resolution of x the jpeg quality and or if they are the same the dpi comes out at is it that some cameras do not have the capabilities of higher dpi so many sites like bay photo etc are talking about higher dpi numbers for better quality it is a digimax a megapixel camera resolution in a camera has nothing to do with dpi more megapixels in a camera simply mean that it can resolve more make sharper pictures all other things being equal which they seldom are when you print a picture the resolution of the picture itself is converted to the resolution of the printer which is almost always much more printers might go up to dpi but your eye can't distinguish that much it's just to make the picture look a little smoother dpi doesn't sound like a lot but in most cases of photographs its more than sufficient if you printed text or straight black lines at dpi you would see jaggies but in a photo you won't photo printers either the inkjet you use at home or the fancy one they use commercially always print at their highest resolution but the actual resolution you get is whatever the camera was capable of a better camera will look better Pixel Digital photography Dots per inch Digital camera Dot matrix printer Konica Minolta Computer printer Raster graphics Digital cinema Photographic film JPEG Mouse (computing) Circle of confusion Image scanner Analog-to-digital converter Video Digital Digital video NTSC Image file formats Photography PostScript ImageWriter Movie projector Fax High-definition television Gamut Laserdisc Photograph Trademark Digital cinematography Anamorphic widescreen Raw image format 8 mm video format Stereoscopy DVD LaserWriter Common Unix Printing System Panoramic photography View camera Movie camera Widescreen Digital image editing Color printing Inkjet printer Machinima Road-rule enforcement camera Atari ST Digital camera back Computer Color management WYSIWYG Walkman Traditional animation Atari 8-bit family Camcorder Ebook Windows XP Multifunction printer Windows Vista Photojournalism PlayStation Portable MP3 PNG Macro photography Modem Geographic information system Apple Computer H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Foveon X3 sensor Moir__ pattern Typeface Charge-coupled device Motion capture Digital-to-analog converter Dither Camera Xerox TRS-80 Ricoh DV Color Computer numbering formats Display resolution Computer animation Technicolor Film preservation Musical Instrument Digital Interface Halftone Schneider Kreuznach Hubble Space Telescope RGB color model Medium format Single-lens reflex camera Television System/34 Sound Blaster Plotter
