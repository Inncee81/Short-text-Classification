photograph that's creased ive got a large photograph thats very special to me unfortuneatly its been ouy of a frame for a few years ang got creased question how can i get rid of the creases without marking the print i cant get another copy simply because this pic has been autographed by my favourate singer sugestions this is not what you want to hear but your original is damaged in a way that is likely to render it unrepairable you can scan it or have this done and the crease can be removed with photoshop or similar program then you can display your copy knowing that you actually do have the original which is put away for safe keeping otherwise you might seek the services of a professional photo restorer and then put the picture back in a frame warts and all knowing that that's the best that could be done Digital photography Photography Hockey rink Laws of cricket PNG Stereoscopy Technicolor Anamorphic widescreen Patricia Ford Screenshot GIF Biblical inerrancy Traditional animation Trademark Ebook Cricket pitch Goatse.cx Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Book of Kells Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Enterprise content management The Star Wars Holiday Special Photographic film Sneakers (film) Cathode ray tube Cricket EIA-708 Roswell UFO incident Panoramic photography Computer virus Secret Gospel of Mark Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 IPod Game programmer Yearbook Spyware MAC address Pornography Photojournalism Run out Cinerama Graphics Photograph View camera Singlish STS-114 C__line Dion Insurance Fine art photography Counterfeit Adobe Photoshop Windows Vista Cinematography GNU General Public License Digital video Amiga Power Autograph Shroud of Turin Partnership (cricket) Film preservation Virginian Railway Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Macintosh Finder Image scanner 2D computer graphics Plame affair Sponsorship scandal Bob and George Fair use Killian documents Gmail Nude celebrities on the Internet BASIC programming language Warez Starfleet ranks and insignia ZX Spectrum Super Mario Bros. 3 PostScript Fast bowling Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Digital art The Star-Spangled Banner Floppy disk Dismissal (cricket) Digital camera back Down syndrome Weekly newspaper Windows 2000 G-Man (Half-Life) Screenplay Hat Drawing Three card monte Machinima Copy protection Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lionel Corporation
