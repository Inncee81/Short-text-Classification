what do you think so i hear people say on this site i want to be a pro freelancer i have a xyz camera its the best what do i do now its one of the most wanted to be professions everyone almost can afford the technology to make notice the word make good images with other professions like say a builder or a dentist respect dr s people dont buy the tool then think they can do it like a trained professional buy a hammer build a house buy a drill be a dentist it confusses me i wanted to do this didnt know anyone who did it so started going to schools and learning the trade like a dentist or builder would so my question now if you had all the equipment and money needed would you go pro good morning antoni well i am a pro and i do have all the equipment needed including all the the studio and payroll bills to go along with it but the difference between me and many who buy new equipment and 'become a professional' is that even after twenty years of earning my living doing this my husband and i know we don't know it all and are constantly on the search to learn to be even better than we are we are always looking to learn at the feet of masters in our craft what we have experienced in our area are the soccer moms or as we used to call them in the film days 'bathtubbers' are several people who have purchased great cameras and set up shop they can't pose so shoot hundreds of images 'hoping against hope' that they will get at least a few really good images they don't know lighting but they can work photoshop to repair their messes unfortunately most of john q public are not really educated in beautiful photography and are impressed with a camera room with backgrounds and expensive equipment and hours spent on the subject it makes me nuts and alice really must be in wonderland i own the same equipment my husband does but i take snapshots compared to his beautiful work he has trained me but i am light years behind him and he is on the ever present quest to be better he is never too proud to listen to a more skilled talented qualified photographer instruct him he lives for texas school which is one of the best weeks of professional photography instruction in the world okay okay i am on a soap box and have now crossed over to ranting and rambling please forgive me i'd better get off answers and get to work there are portraits to be made and bills to be paid Photography Digital photography Stereoscopy Education in the People's Republic of China Microeconomics Scientology beliefs and practices Surveillance Ocean's Twelve Parachuting Aesthetic Realism Guild Emergency preparedness View camera Dentistry University of San Francisco Adobe Photoshop Apprenticeship Barrister Shaggy dog story Richard Avedon Best Buy Wal-Mart Gross domestic product FairTax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Apollo 11 Camera MMORPG Japanese tea ceremony Little Shop of Horrors Supply and demand Star Wars: Galaxies Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Firefighter Marilyn Monroe Dog agility Glen Jacobs The Amazing Race Sento Education in the United States Art Desperate Housewives Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Boston and Lowell Railroad Meccano Camcorder Panoramic photography Traditional animation Photojournalism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Medium format Road-rule enforcement camera Singlish Donald Neilson Leica Macro photography Stuttering Single-lens reflex camera Salary cap Audiophile Cinematography Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards RuneScape quests Internet fraud Ethical consumerism Konica Minolta Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital camera Slow Train Coming Upholstery Resident Evil (film) Social rule Panavision Labor theory of value Article One of the United States Constitution Depth of field Kill Bill Guild Wars Bart chalkboard gags Paragliding Sharon Tate Soap opera Education Another World (TV series) Football (soccer) Education in Hong Kong Advertising Teacher Paramount Pictures Multimedia literacy MapleStory
