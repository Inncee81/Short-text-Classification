can you save this shot this is one of my favorite shots but it is a slide that has faded over the years the original was taken in or on ektachrome while hanging out of an airplane door at about feet up maybe it was feet i can't recall i have had an x version on display in my office for years and it has finally faded to muted shades of brown so i want to reprint the picture i have made one stab at editting for balance between light and dark levels and pumped up the contrast and saturation a little bit i added some orange in the blown out highlight of the sun reflection on the river i applied unsharp mask what would you do if this was your shot see the original and also edit no at this link http www flickr com photos samfeinstein tags cohansey antoni i hear you but read on kitty the point is to see if we can collectively some up with some ideas here as a learning exercise seamless see above this is one of my favorite shots but it is a slide that has faded over the years the original was taken in or on ektachrome if i could start with a better scan i would so i really appreciate your efforts if i had a time machine which is one of my frequent recommendations i'd go back and use a haze filter this was one fo shots i took to get the film out of the camera before i reloaded with plus x to shoot some skydivers for the newspaper my main subject would not present a problem with haze so i was not equipped for it continued cont i'll take your answer and go through this process myself as it is a great lesson in photoshop as far as your rendering i know that you have no memory of the scene and you didn't discuss it with me but you have preserved the fine detail of the highest clouds and i like the depth of the ground colors you lost the yellow of the sunset along the right horizon though i'd darken this just so the viewer isn't drawn to the whiteness of that area thank you for spending the time and contributing to my education vance i definitely like the winding river better in edit and certain things about the sky but looks more true to nature overall time machine i need one to take the shot over or at least scan the slide when it was new you need one to allow for hours today instead of the usual nurse in ky the lower of your edit looks god and then the top half is pretty much lost i know you didn't set yourself up for this but a group of us have decided that it is good to simply be honest with each other instead of saying how wonderful everything looks it's a learning process i hope you are not upset i do appreciate your result though as i can see what is possible for the foreground in my edit i used a couple of adjustment layers so i could preserve the detail in the areas where yours is now washed out save it i would start with a better scan first anyway i took your challenge and gave it some time to see what approach i would use i didn't try to do anything with the noise but i would have if this was something i had to do the process was about like this in photoshop cs duplicate background layer o adjustment layer set the hard light for contrast with a fairly radical adjustment to the curve adjustment layer are set to screen for lightning with a fairly radical adjustment to the curve duplicate visible layers as one layer use highlight shadow adjustment shadow set to lighten highlights reduced by duplicate layer and set new layer to soft light at collapse layers blue gradient applied the sky make a selection of the sky and sea make a new layer of the selection and apply a high pass filter out a radius of pixels set new layer to soft light collapse layers without having seen the original i have no idea how it really looked and not having discussed it i don't know the representation that would best fit your recall this is just an interpretation based on my experience with similar lighting conditions total time about an hour not including the time i wondered why i was doing this instead of working on my website this is the result http picasaweb google com vance lear shadowstemp photo authkey eqcasb jqte regards vance addendum okay now i have a better sense i don't think that just adding a sunset coloration will pull the viewer back from the sun and water glare it will help though so i did the following selected river and made a new layer of it and set it to screen used variations on this new layer to increase blue in the mid and highlight range so that it looked more like it was lit by the sky then i backed off the opacity until it looked about right in terms of tonality not to obvious the shape of the river and the added emphasis from lightening it pulls the viewer more towards the middle and bottom of the image created a saturation mask for the sky and sea which i used for an adjustment layer created a photo filter adjustment layer using the saturation mask and applied the orange filter varying the color intensity as seemed right this kept the blues of the sky from being effected too much by the orange filter this is a little more complete answer and here is the edit http picasaweb google com vance lear shadowstemp photo authkey eqcasb jqte this is only for illustration purposes only illustrating an approach the haze you see is from the broad glare created by the sun reflecting off the water and a haze or other filter 'cept polarizer would have only partially helped what you are really seeing is low level flare within the lens time for second adjustments min Photography Opportunity rover Rendering (computer graphics) Technicolor PNG NTSC Solar eclipse Drill bit Autostereogram
