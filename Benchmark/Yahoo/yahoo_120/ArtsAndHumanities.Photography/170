b w photos tips i know two ways of creating b w photos using the black and white feature on my camera desaturating it in photochop either way it ends up being very flat i tried playing with the curves and levels in ps but it just ends up looking weird unnatural i always see these stunning b w photos with great contrast and i was wondering how i can achieve that or maybe it's cuz im not using a slr i dont know this would depend on which version of photoshop you use not all are created equal in terms of b w conversion photoshop lightroom elements and cs all have improved b w conversion engines with more ways to adjust individual tonal effects and colors i too am working on my b w work have been for months so i feel your pain bro i use photoshop lightroom and shoot in raw this way i can use the most of the available color information while desaturated programs like lightroom that automatically work with raw files do not discard the color information when desaturating and are known as 'non destructive' editing programs retaining the original digital negative as the primary layer adjusting the various color sliders can achieve pretty dazzling effects with contrast especially darker colors like blue and magenta that is the main reason for not using your camera's b w option the camera will discard almost half of the information captured by the image sensor including the color information which you wouldn't think would be important to you when desaturating but believe it or not that color information is crutial to having the ability to create slight color hues in your b w images also you may want to look into getting an slr so you can shoot in raw format unless your present camera can do so believe me despite most peoples intimidation with using that format you'll love how much image information is retained once you learn how to use it with the right tools it's easy and you'll never go back to jpeg fine for your serious work and the more image data you have to play with the better your work will be using contrast is really important as well and if you can use threaded filters a circular polarizer works wonders for rendering beautiful contrast if your camera can't use a threaded filter there may be specialized accessories for your camera that you can use to achieve the same effects worse case just get a square linear filter and hold it in front of your lens while you compose your shots just know the orientation of the filter and you'll get the same effect as a threaded polarizer well i hope this helps and i hope a b w pro answers your question as well maybe we could both learn peace Adobe Photoshop Stereoscopy Color Digital camera Digital image editing Photography PNG Technicolor Raw image format Pixel Leica Drawing Polarization IPod Canon EOS Macro photography NTSC Anaglyph image Cinematography RGB color model Konica Minolta Floppy disk Screenshot PlayStation Portable Color theory Movie projector Stage lighting JPEG 2000 Gamut JPEG Single-lens reflex camera Hard disk Anamorphic widescreen Image file formats Windows 2000 MP3 Advanced Photo System B3ta Lightsaber Windows XP XML ImageMagick Mars Exploration Rover Filter (photography) Canon T90 IPhoto Game Boy Macromedia Flash Digital single-lens reflex cameras Color temperature Camouflage Wassily Kandinsky DVD Television Photographic film Enterprise content management Bayer filter Digital camera back Portable Document Format Analog-to-digital converter GIMP Atari 8-bit family Geographic information system ITunes Nikon Corporation Widescreen Panoramic photography Contax 2D computer graphics Light-emitting diode Photographic lens Rangefinder camera ATI Technologies Common Unix Printing System Blog Dither Bluetooth Radar Second language acquisition Autofocus C programming language Java programming language Motion capture H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Rendering (computer graphics) Objective-C Sega Saturn Eye
