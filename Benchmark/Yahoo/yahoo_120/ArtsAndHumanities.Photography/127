what is dpi i wan to save a photo at dpi how do i go about doing that also how do i take a panoramic photo do i need a special lens or something dpi or dots per inch is very important in the world of printing where it refers to the actual density of dots within the boundaries of one square inch dpi is usually considered a standard resolution for prints in photoshop you need to go to image size and set the third parameter in document size to pixels inch and then save the image this should do the trick however if you don't wish to resize your image you should keep resample image unchecked else you will end up changing the pixel size of the image to take panoramic photos you either need a panoramic camera such as the hasselblad xpan or the horizon the noblex etc or shoot multiple pictures and stitch them together in photoshop or in another dedicated stitching software like the realviz stitcher in order to get good stitches you need to rotate the camera around the nodal point of the lens and not on its tripod screw this can be done hand held or by using special panoramic heads that fit onto profesional tripods Panoramic photography Dots per inch Pixel Digital photography Mouse (computing) Image scanner View camera Digital camera Digital image editing Television Tagged Image File Format Autostereogram Anamorphic widescreen Photographic film Photography Computer printer Dot matrix printer Stereoscopy Photograph Adobe Photoshop Raster graphics Medium format Movie projector PNG 2D computer graphics Konica Minolta WYSIWYG Geographic information system Digital camera back Binoculars Halftone Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Windows Vista Eyepiece Pixelation Photographic lens Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Screw thread IPhoto Depth of field Floppy disk Liquid crystal display Panorama Opportunity rover Image file formats Aspect ratio (image) Cross-stitch Video Pixel art QuickDraw Single-lens reflex camera Screenshot Ebook Clementine mission Goatse.cx Logo programming language Pinhole camera PostScript Portable Document Format Rangefinder camera IMAX Shutter speed Normal distribution GIMP Canon T90 Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Atari 8-bit family Ray tracing Amateur astronomy 135 film Digital cinematography Eye Panavision Danger Hiptop Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Typeface Camera Bluetooth Bookbinding Drawing Apollo moon landing hoax accusations GIF Parallax Color Graphics Adapter Plasma display Camcorder Typewriter PlayStation Portable NTSC Street photography Wallpaper group Digital cinema Leica
