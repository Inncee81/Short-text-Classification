advice from professional photographers and photojournalists please ok so i am in high school right now and for the last two years photography has been my main focus i've never had this drive for anything else in my life i'm constantly taking pictures learning new skills and it's all i talk about with any passion i'm also really into writing and am therefore wanting to be either a photographer or photojournalist but my question is is there any job security with being a photographer with the internet videos and how digital has taken over are photographers still going to be in demand a lot of people have suggested to me to just keep it as a hobby because the outlook isn't very favorable is that correct it's not that i want a huge paycheck but i do want a job and the possibility of great success and i just want to know how competive is the field in photography and what the outlook is i have some photos on deviantart www browniemonster deviantart com if you'd like to check them out or critique thanks for any help and suggestions correct link www browniemonster deviantart com a very good question firstly until a camera can always meter for light correctly can set up and arrrange lights and manipulate available light can artistically compose shots can select the correct apepture and shutter speed to give artistic results and advise the photographer what view points are needed then there will always be a demend for professionals the demand for professional images is growing particuarly for low res internet images of quality job security unless you become a reporter security isnt really part of the deal if you work on the writing as well it will open alot of doors for you images with words are worth more in the market place my english is poor so i work with for writers time in the business is the best security if you build a good client list and some asset like say a collection of stock images dont know how to view you pix link would be good suggestions use a tripod whenever you can expose and focus manually whenever you can when you talk about your passion dont say taking photos thats what anyone with a camera can do start saying and doing this i have been making lots of images take it or leave it my point is theres nothing great about taking photos planing an image in your mind setting up and controling light selecting the best depth for the image exposing perfectly and controlling focus are what great photographers do they dont take pictures they make them great to hear you have the most important asset needed passion a View camera Digital photography Stereoscopy Photojournalism Panoramic photography Konica Minolta Single-lens reflex camera Cinematography Leica Street photography Canon T90 Shutter speed Digital camera Enterprise content management Camera Photographic film Depth of field Autostereogram Macro photography Goatse.cx Canon EOS Floppy disk Photograph DeviantART Economics Exposure (photography) Contax Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Digital art Apollo 8 Art Movie projector Camcorder F-number Photographic lens Blog Closed-circuit television Technicolor Film Pornography Enlarger Oscilloscope Computer World Wide Web Plame affair Extreme Programming Surveillance Television PlayStation Portable Capital accumulation Anamorphic widescreen Traditional animation Theory of conduct Mutual fund Digital single-lens reflex cameras Charge-coupled device Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Canon EF lens mount Enron Corporation Librarian Shutter (photography) Independent Media Center Aperture Scientology beliefs and practices Opportunity rover Inflation Electronic journalism IMAX Film speed Road-rule enforcement camera Henri Cartier-Bresson Eyepiece Apollo 11 The Shining (film) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Internet fraud Aikido ITunes Reflecting telescope Bluetooth Motion capture Mojave people CPU design Microeconomics Rudolf Steiner Holography Circle of confusion Political economy Automatic number plate recognition Past teachings of Prem Rawat X Window System Strategic management
