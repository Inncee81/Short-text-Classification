will canon a lenses work with a canon rebel xti my sister has a canon a with some good lenses and i was wondering if they would work for the rebel xti im fixin to buy from a practical point of view no there are adapters available however they are either very expensive and only work with a few lenses or very poor quality or they don't allow you to focus to infinity save yourself some trouble and just buy eos lenses edit yes there are adapters available that allow infinity focus and work with all fd lenses the quality is extremely poor however making the best fd lenses like my mm and mm f look like single element box camera lenses i've tested all of the adapter options available including the very good but extraordinarily rare and expensive canon made x teleconverter adapter the x is excellent but only works with a handful of fd lenses which your sister most likely doesn't have all are long expensive telephotos and typically sells for over the one i tested i did not own it i borrowed it would only work with two lenses i own the mm and internal focusing mm it completely preserved the sharpness of both of these lenses however the mm and only the internal focusing version is the shortest it will work with if you really want to use cheap manual focus lenses pick up a nikon to eos adapter which will allow infinity focus with no optics and pick up some inexpensive older nikon lenses Photographic lens Canon EF lens mount View camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital photography Leica Contax Canon EOS Binoculars Macro photography Camera Canon FD Cinematography Eyepiece Canon T90 Nikon D70 Zoom lens Nikon Corporation Single-lens reflex camera Panoramic photography Konica Minolta Rangefinder camera Lens (optics) Stage lighting Movie projector Digital camera back Canon EOS-300D Photography Schneider Kreuznach Zeiss Gross domestic product Reflecting telescope Advanced Photo System Panavision Aberration in optical systems Nikon FM2 Nikon FE2 Canon Inc.
