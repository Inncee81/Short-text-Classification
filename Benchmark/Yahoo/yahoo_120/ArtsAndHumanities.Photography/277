focal length question a basic telephoto lens consists of a converging lens of focal length mm positioned mm from a diverging lens of mm determine the distance between the diverging lens and the image plane state the physical length of the camera its no point worrying about the length of the camera dude you have bought it and you cannot get it replaced so just click and enjoy Lens (optics) View camera Photographic lens Eyepiece Photography Cinematography Single-lens reflex camera Aberration in optical systems Digital photography Pinhole camera Macro photography Autostereogram Depth of field Contax Magnification Reflecting telescope Digital camera back Parallax F-number Leica Stereoscopy Schneider Kreuznach Eye Telescope Binoculars Zeiss Panoramic photography Clementine mission Perspective projection distortion Diffraction Rangefinder camera Chromatic aberration Gamma ray burst Mirror Shutter speed Aperture Headlight Geodesy Fisheye lens Railway signal Digital camera Afshar experiment Optical telescope Camera Ray transfer matrix analysis Bokeh Opportunity rover Renormalization Bloodstain pattern analysis Shutter (photography) Advanced Photo System Panavision Trigonometric function Vector (spatial) Twin-lens reflex camera Canon EOS History of telescopes Stage lighting Einstein-Cartan theory Film speed Confocal laser scanning microscopy Nikon Corporation Black hole Series (mathematics) Fresnel lens Microscope Antenna (radio) Laser engraving Four Thirds System Enlarger Surveyor 3 Surveyor 7 Random walk Canon T90 IMAX Extrasolar planet Refracting telescope Glasses Surveyor 5 Convergence of Fourier series Schmidt camera Zone plate Digital single-lens reflex cameras Railroad switch Cinerama Dimension Konica Minolta Polarization Riemann zeta function Zeno's paradoxes Divergence Color temperature Binocular vision Crystallography Dynamical system Eyeglass prescription
