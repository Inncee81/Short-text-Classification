poster for reducing green house gas emissions i fiddled with this digital shot to make it more poster like do you think it would make a useful image for promoting bikes as a mode of transit http i photobucket com albums x gazpacho bikes jpg what other uses could it be put to how can i improve this shot honestly i very much like the picture you're a great photographer but i don't think it would work for this purpose i know all the advantages of biking over driving a car but people who would look at this picture would probably feel a bit overwhelmed by so many bikes and think that if they have to be in a traffic jam they better be in their cars with air conditioning and music the picture is great and i know you'll find a good use for it Segregated cycle facilities Automobile Utility cycling Bike lane debate Digital photography Toyota Prius Fuel injection Bon Jovi Triathlon Bicycle lighting Billboard (advertising) JPEG Speed limit Recumbent bicycle Vehicular cycling Hybrid vehicle Fuel efficiency Federal Standard 1037C Bicycle Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Road-rule enforcement camera Freeway E85 Mountain bike Motorcycle Carburetor Automatic number plate recognition Personal rapid transit Resident Evil: Apocalypse Transportation of Los Angeles Automobile emissions control Bus rapid transit Taunton, Massachusetts Spirit rover Traffic light Valentino Rossi Cinematography Honda CX series Battery electric vehicle Light-emitting diode Digital camera Vehicle registration plate Stereoscopy Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children ITunes Gas turbine Goatse.cx Tire Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man 2000 Australian Grand Prix Photography Mitsubishi 3000GT Grande Prairie, Alberta Digital cinema Resident Evil (film) Turbocharger Back to the Future CPU design Honda German car number plates Asynchronous Transfer Mode Global Positioning System Def Jam Vendetta Refrigerator car Bicycle brake systems M16 (rifle) Opportunity rover Vacuum tube Honda Ascot They Might Be Giants Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Transmission (mechanics) Mazda Wankel engine Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Raw image format Hot air balloon BMW Sharon Tate Air traffic control Ron Weasley Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune Diesel engine Scandium Bicycle helmet Grand Theft Auto (game) Motocross Jet engine Gramophone record Violin Badaling Expressway Boston transportation Widescreen Depeche Mode Digital television Hydrogen Law of value Public transport Transistor Internal combustion engine
