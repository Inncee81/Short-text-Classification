man ray who are photographers the new conservatives man ray who my daughter uses her mobile phone quite a lot these days i think there is a fresh new artistic style developing out of this technology and the likes of myspace and the importance of the re emergence of the self portrait and it seems worthy of exploration my thoughts lately are that professionals have tried to remain so elitist and fixed in their thinking that they can't transgress the post modern culture that they helped develop indeed instead of the arte nuveau i think many are the new conservatives too fixated on exposure settings and depth of field to recognise what fresh ideas young artists are now generating using their simple inexpensive tools and a home pc is the mobile camera phone the box brownie the new polaroid would you buy yorself anything costing more than if it will be obsolete technology in a month is this the age where the law of averages applies keep pressing the shutter button something exquisite will appear on pc later in a studio setting nater i can appreciate compltely your opinion on refining the technique but there is a whole lot of patience timing and luck involved in capturing a dynamic subject skill too in just the right light that you simply can't refine by re taking the shot thanks for those thoughts jack i also enjoy the idea that you can reduce pictorial art into lines shapes surfaces and colour what i like most is that kids seem to do this intuitively no training they havent heard of rodchenko these new kids on the block just think they know what they like and try to do it with whatever tool is available photoguy it's the accidental and anecdotal results that make their work so optimistic so interesting compared to yours i guess sneezecoughwheeze having technical knowledge is a miniscule part of the journey isn't it i mean just because you sell cameras doesn't make you an artist right true words of wisdom some of the so called elite may have some technical advantages such as lighting and contrast but i promise you what our kids are taking on their cell phones would draw more of a crowd in a manhattan art exhibit than some of the elite photographers i have only caught a glimpse of my grandsons' collection and they were not boring the salvador dalis' of the captured frame of a moment not lost to time well maybe not exactly but a true contemporary form of art works for black mail too View camera Microeconomics Art Technology Stereoscopy Drawing Henri Cartier-Bresson Surveillance Extreme Programming Movie projector Leica Camera Single-lens reflex camera Konica Minolta Game programmer Supply and demand Floppy disk Modernism Surrealism Digital camera Logic Mathematics Comics Strategic management Mouse (computing) Piet Mondrian Computer Search engine optimization Land use forecasting Graphics Television Philosophy of language Cinematography Amateur astronomy Human Holography Enterprise content management Pottery Street photography Solar power Characters of Lost Science Hubble Space Telescope Apple Newton Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dither Martial art Panoramic photography Socrates Plame affair Bluetooth Philosophy of mathematics Traditional animation Scientific method Canon T90 TRIZ Alfred Hitchcock Time Out of Mind Kylie Minogue Public transport About a Boy Surrealist techniques Windows Vista Parallax Cognitive science Product Lifecycle Management Salvador Dal__ Special relativity Depth of field Open source culture Alexander Rodchenko Hip hop culture Telephone tapping Speech recognition Photojournalism Danger Hiptop Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paragliding Motion capture Windows XP Requirements analysis Poker jargon Wealth Goodness and value theory Software patent debate London Congestion Charge EastEnders Welding Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Oscilloscope Nintendo Professional wrestling slang Electronic Arts
