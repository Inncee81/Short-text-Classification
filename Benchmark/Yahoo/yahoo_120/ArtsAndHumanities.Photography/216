what is the use of lens hood on slr camera a lens hood is used to prevent lens flare it prevents flare by blocking stray light that might come in from a side angle to the lens light that comes in that way can bounce off the inside of the lens housing and cause a reflection off the optics some lens hoods are petaled which means they have cuts in them that make them look like a flower this is done especially for a zoom or wide angle zoom lens to prevent the hood from blocking the optical angle at which the lens is capable otherwise too long of a lens hood without the petal shape and you'd get an image that had the hood in it at the edges Photographic lens Leica Lens (optics) Contax Single-lens reflex camera Movie projector Digital photography Zoom lens Cinematography Reflecting telescope Nikon Corporation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Eye Konica Minolta Telescope Panoramic photography Anamorphic widescreen Four Thirds System Headlight Stage lighting Binoculars Digital camera Eyepiece Optical coating Cinerama Eyeglass prescription Depth of field IMAX Microscope Camera Optical telescope Vignetting Motion picture terminology Stereoscopy Zeiss Parallax Canon FD F-number Digital camera back Schneider Kreuznach Canon T90 Laser Rangefinder camera Red-eye effect Aperture Contact lens Mirror Fisheye lens Full frame digital SLR Glasses Camcorder Photography Railway signal Macro photography Bokeh Rainbow Amateur astronomy Twin-lens reflex camera Gravitational lens 3D computer graphics Autostereogram Angular resolution Ray tracing Sun Shutter speed Polarization Glass Nuclear weapon design Observational astronomy Canon EOS Joel and Ethan Coen Filter (optics) Lighting Pentax Widescreen Point and shoot camera Autofocus Automatic number plate recognition Sundial Drill bit Optics Laser engraving Knife Optical fiber Technicolor Tank Cosina Kenny McCormick Diffraction Video camera tube Bicycle lighting Hubble Space Telescope Light Gradient index optics DVD Laser diode Intraocular lens
