what is the difference between a linear and circular polarizing lens filter which one would be better for outdoor shooting they both do the same thing they just go about it in different ways the biggest difference that you should be concerned with is if you have a camera i'm assuming you have an slr that is auto focus linear polarizers can be used for manual focusing cameras but circular polarizers must be used with cameras that feature auto focus now you can still use a linear polarizer with an auto focus camera as long as you're focusing it manually you can use either type of filter with a manually focusing camera and get the exact same results a circular polarizer is simply a linear polarizer with an extra layer within the filter to convert the polarized light into circularly polarized light which allows the af and metering systems to function normally if you have just an example a canon eos rebel xti then you would need a circular polarizer the reason being unless you disengaged the auto focus and focused manually a linear polarizer would not allow your camera to meter or focus correctly circular polarizers because they convert the light coming through into convert it to circularly polarized light will not interfere with your metering and af systems so if you have an auto focus slr or dslr you'll need to get a circular polarizer if you're old school and still work with a manual film camera you only need to get a linear polarizer unless you plan on using it between a couple of different cameras this wasn't the best explanation of the matter but i hope it helped the answer below is wrong sorry to say the linear and circular aspect of the filter has to do with the filtering layers within the glass of the filter not the shape of the filter there are systems that use square filters but they operate in the same way as the screw on type there can be a square shaped circular polarizer you can change the strength or rotate a linear polarizer to get a variable effect Digital photography Polarization Leica Canon EOS Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon T90 Antenna (radio) Transformer Stereoscopy Macro photography Contax Single-lens reflex camera Konica Minolta Light-emitting diode Sun Eye Cinematography Manual transmission Depth of field Canon EF lens mount Stage lighting Analog-to-digital converter Filter (photography) Maxwell's equations Light Autofocus Loudspeaker Welding Nikon Corporation Color Sensor Point and shoot camera Optical coating Camera Carburetor Coordinates (mathematics) Canon FD Microphone Quantum cryptography Floppy disk Motion capture Solar power Advanced Photo System Panoramic photography Liquid crystal display Anamorphic widescreen Cell (biology) Technicolor Glasses Fluorescent lamp Linked list Aliasing Photographic lens Federal Standard 1037C Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Laserdisc Nuclear magnetic resonance Digital camera back Sewage treatment Planetary orbit Quantum mechanics Microscopy Faraday effect NTSC Monochromator IMAX Full frame digital SLR Vector (spatial) Mars Photographic film Supernova Canon PowerShot G Geology of the Moon Gravitational radiation Compact disc Canon EOS-300D Pentax Normal distribution Nikon FE Ozone depletion Orthogonal matrix Optical fiber Unix time Rangefinder camera Telescope Enceladus (moon) Slide rule Pinhole camera
