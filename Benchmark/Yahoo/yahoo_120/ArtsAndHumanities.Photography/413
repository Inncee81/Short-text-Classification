what digital camera do you use i have a kodak easyshare megapixel and i love it it's nothing special but it's perfect for me i use my mobile phone quite a lot these days i think there is a fresh new artistic style developing out of this technology and the likes of myspace and the importance of the re emergence of the self portrait and i want to explore these ideas my thoughts lately are that professionals have tried to remain so elitist and fixed in their thinking that they can't transgress the post modern culture that they helped develop indeed instead of the arte nuveau i think many are the new conservatives too fixated on exposure settings and depth of field to recognise what fresh ideas young artists are now generating using their simple inexpensive tools and a home pc so keep using your kodak easyshare megapixel camera i have a megapixel version of the same thing and i it it's my box brownie it's the new polaroid don't go an buy yorself anything costing you more than because it will be obsolete in a month or two good luck and keep clicking the shutter button it's now the time that the law of averages applies Photography Digital photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Konica Minolta Digital camera Pixel Camera View camera Single-lens reflex camera Digital cinema Microeconomics Leica Movie projector Computer Stereoscopy Digital video Bluetooth Open source culture Supply and demand Instant camera Organic light-emitting diode Panoramic photography Pinhole camera Photographic film Henri Cartier-Bresson Nintendo IPod Floppy disk Telephone numbering plan Surveillance Art Street photography Canon EOS Camcorder Motion capture Technology Film speed Medium format Sexual orientation Camera phone Mobile phone Shutter angle Charge-coupled device Cyberspace Fundamentalism Hubble Space Telescope NeXT Cinematography Closed-circuit television Software engineering Windows XP Modernism Oscilloscope IMAX F-number Windows Vista Anarchism and society Copyright Nintendo GameCube Image file formats Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Evil Ten Commandments Aesthetic Realism Canon T90 Shutter speed Rangefinder camera Dither 120 film Electronic Arts Intellectual property Sony Ericsson K750i Trademark Game development Economics Walkman Large format Nikon D70 Voice over IP Treo 650 AmigaOS Zire Handheld Digital television UK telephone numbering plan Sharp Zaurus Foveon X3 sensor Inkjet printer Japanese copyright law Macromedia Flash Postmodernism Mouse (computing) Pocket PC Telephone Secret photography Embedded system Enlarger Wealth
