how take model type pictures with a digital camera i have a coolpix l i want to get a pic of me to put on my cd cover i use photoshop cs for my graphics also just wanted to know how would i take very good picture quality like pics u see for models if not possible with this camera which one should i get to do this i would make sure that you're shooting with the highest image quality you can find out how to change that in the instructions for modeling type pictures the most importatnt thing is lighting usually the on camera flash will produce unflattering shadows or overexpose a face so you could ask around and see if anyone has any modelling lights that would be ideal failing that set up an indoor shoot with lots of different light sources so you don't have to use the on camera flash use a white piece of cardboard held in your lap to bounce light up thereby filling in shadowy areas on your face outdoors go for diffused light sun setting is a good time don't stand with your back to the sun get it so that it's on your face also simple backdrops outfits are good so lighting is the key play around with it diffused filtered by something lighting is best good luck Digital photography Stereoscopy Road-rule enforcement camera Point and shoot camera Digital camera Photographic film Leica Lighting View camera Cinematography Adobe Photoshop Rendering (computer graphics) Color temperature Welding PIC microcontroller Ray tracing Drawing Liquid crystal display Digital cinematography Solar cell Single-lens reflex camera Film speed Contax Raw image format Gamut Computer vision Computer Traditional animation Camera Goatse.cx Movie projector Television Ra (board game) Digital image editing Syphon Filter Computer graphics Oscilloscope Camcorder Macro photography Film Billiards Patricia Ford Computer animation Motion picture terminology Volleyball RGB color model Shader Solar eclipse Analog-to-digital converter Red-eye effect Light-emitting diode Canon T90 Sunglasses The Ashlee Simpson Show 3D computer graphics NTSC Infrared Automatic number plate recognition Enlarger Mouse (computing) Konica Minolta Photograph Screenshot Embedded system Pinhole camera Time-lapse Archery Bob and George Houseplant Spirit rover Resident Evil 4 The Bill Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March 2D computer graphics Sun Cassini-Huygens Pornography Holography Autostereogram Parallax Marching band Nintendo 64 Closed-circuit television Digital camera back Canon EOS Medium format Opportunity rover ATI Technologies Motion capture Widescreen Binoculars Nikon Corporation Lightsaber Serial Game Boy Shen Gong Wu
