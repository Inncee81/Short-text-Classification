how do i make a lot of different pictures into one please help how do i make different pictures into one not a collage or anything but like you know how on movies they always have one person's face on anothers body and it looks perfect how would you add parts from one picture to another and make it look normal like thats the real thing i guess it's something with photoshop and i have photoshop its for my layout advice icon contest site on myspace please help it's called cropping on the left hand side there should be a pane with tools find the top left tool and go down thats the crop tool i think not looking at it right now use that to cut what you want which will make a box then right click and hit crop go to the picture that you want to paste that small picture onto and just hit ctrl v on your keyboard to paste use the arrow to move it then use the eraser to cut off the edges you don't want the blur tool to make a fins seam and eye dropper tool to make the colors together you will probably need to zoom in to get individual pixels ctrl believe me all that work is worth it when your finished thats how its done you can do it in paint but its actually easier in photoshop Mouse (computing) Autostereogram Drill bit Digital image editing Drawing Fast bowling Casting Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Adobe Photoshop Minesweeper (computer game) Screenshot Stereoscopy Amstrad CPC B3ta PNG Professional wrestling attacks Pump It Up Pixelation Keyboard layout Game programmer Graphics Graphic design Pixel Inkscape Collage Electric Light Orchestra Finale notation program Goatse.cx Wood carving 2D computer graphics Opportunity rover Danger Hiptop AmigaOS Leica WordStar Table tennis Pottery Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Craps Typewriter The Big Break Tag IBM PC keyboard Map Frogman The Cure Boxing Game theory Fark.com Blender (software) In The Groove (game) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Jennifer Lopez Macromedia Fireworks Abstraction Pixel art GIMP Archery Rich Mullins Swing bowling Control key Password Glass The Best Page in the Universe Digital photography History The Amazing Race JPEG RuneScape skills Microsoft Paint Jon Secada Upholstery Adobe Illustrator Google Maps MySpace Empire Burlesque Jumpstart 3rd Grade Knife Mattress Contredanse Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Photoshopping Amiga MacPaint Calvin and Hobbes Computer keyboard Surrealist techniques DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Plane (tool) Unicode Shawn Michaels Woodworking Product Lifecycle Management Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Window DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Nintendo 64
