my toenail cracked in half two days ago my sister accidently slammed the leg of a chair on my toe and my toenail cracked in half horizontally i cleaned all the blood off of it and put a band aid on it thinking my body would take care of it itself but when i looked at it this morning i realized that skin was growing inbetween the broken toenail and it really hurts help me i want to wear open toe shoes on the first day of school which is august you'll be ok i hope you can use artificial nails to put on top of it just don't put glue inside the crack not right now let it heal itself before but your nail won't become whole again it hurts but it's ok i ususally glue carefully plastic nails on injured nails to replace the missing part and protect skin under it but only after it stops to bleed and heals the wound you should be ok by august some time left good luck Wound Bleeding Nail (anatomy) Callus Professional wrestling holds Nine Inch Nails Bone fracture Violin Paul Is Dead Professional wrestling match types Upholstery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Joker (comics) Horseshoe First aid Shoe Glossary of climbing terms Equine conformation Pointe shoes 1957 World Series Tenshinhan Professional wrestling slang Skin Textile manufacturing Fast bowling Nail disease Poker jargon Aerial (dance move) Manicure Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Massage Marching band Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Eddie Guerrero Scar Diving Los Angeles Dodgers Golf Crocodilia Crucifixion Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Irish dance Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Jon Secada Skin graft Shaggy dog story Seismic retrofit Crimson Chin Wound healing phases Ocean's Twelve Hip fracture High-heeled shoe Columbine High School massacre Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Traumatic brain injury Rei Ayanami Characters of Naruto Drill bit Cliff Richard Knife Batting (cricket) Dialysis Hair John Lennon Manhunt (video game) Body piercing Adam Copeland Pitaten 2000 Australian Grand Prix First aid kit Vampire Skateboard Motorcycle helmet Shawn Michaels Salad Fingers Wind turbine Leather Professional wrestling throws Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Social rule Milton H.
