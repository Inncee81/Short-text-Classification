question about infected scrape i just recently fell and scraped my knee about four days ago and was unable to treat it until later because i was no where near home or any pharmacies and had no treatments except bandaids so for a few days it was dripping with yellow pus but now it has stopped after i cleaned it but now it just feels really sore around my knee and kind of swollen too should i go see a doctor i have been putting neosporin on it and washing it with soap and water but i'm not sure of what else to do because it still hurts and i don't know how much longer to wait until to consult a doctor i'd rather not have to resort to that but it would be helpful if someone could give me some advice please thanks honestly if it's been less than seven days you've been using the neosporin i would try it until you hit seven days if it's not clearing up or feeling better you will need a dosage of antibiotics most likely it will clear up on it's own if you're prescribed antibiotics make sure you take them the entire length of treatment of the infection will return ten fold good luck Psoriasis First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Group A streptococcal infection Mouth ulcer Stomach cancer Cellulitis Wound Chronic fatigue syndrome Hip fracture Acne Cephalexin Prostate cancer Antibiotic Fancy rat Common cold Osteoarthritis Gonorrhoea Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diarrhea Fecal incontinence Rosacea Shock Chemotherapy Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Virus Tattoo Conjunctivitis Bubonic plague Radiation therapy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Folic acid Clostridium difficile Pharyngitis Medical cannabis Intravenous therapy Ebola Theory of conduct Abscess Traumatic brain injury Antibiotic resistance Cystoscopy Equine conformation Eczema Sexually-transmitted infection Otitis externa Malaria Obsessive-compulsive disorder Anthrax Pneumonia Diving Candidiasis Syphilis Babe Ruth Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Tuberculosis Domestic rabbit Helicobacter pylori Infectious mononucleosis Childbirth Japanese tea ceremony Asthma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lyme disease Mastoiditis Knife Antiviral drug Diseases of the honeybee Aloe Boil Sickle-cell disease Gangrene Medicine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Upper respiratory tract infection Textile manufacturing Allergy Scabies Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Otitis media Social rule Pelvic inflammatory disease Rabies AIDS Gastroparesis Cytomegalovirus Legionellosis Neighbours Tonsil Hand washing Glossitis Mattress Cocaine Peptic ulcer Traditional Chinese medicine Manicure Menstrual cup
