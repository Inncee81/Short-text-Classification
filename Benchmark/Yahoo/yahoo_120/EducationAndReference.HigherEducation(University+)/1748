college ok i have been looking at applying to this college for a while but i have looked at student reviews on it and the people don't seem to like it much they say it is boring and the food is bad i don't feel like this is a reason to exclude a college what do you think are these reviews valuable to me and my decision on this college thanks so much keep in mind that those who have complaints always write more than those who are satisfied bad food is not a reason to avoid a college but if everything is boring that could be a problem on the other hand i always found that classes that other people loved i thought were terrible and vice versa so you can't rely too much on other people's opinions if you get a chance visit the place and make your own decision Theory of conduct Equal Protection Clause American and British English differences GED Internet troll Health insurance Friedrich Schleiermacher Intelligent design Scientology beliefs and practices Bertrand Russell Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Appeal Social rule Alexander Technique Education in the United States 2000 Australian Grand Prix Originalism Augustus De Morgan The Skeptical Environmentalist Time Out of Mind Simone Weil Jon Secada Another Side of Bob Dylan Strategic management U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 College and university rankings Sydney Riot of 1879 Religion Public domain Regents of the University of California v.
