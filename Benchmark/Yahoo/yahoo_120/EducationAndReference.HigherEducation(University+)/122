how useful is a businese major anyways hi thanks for helping a confused to be senior well this year their is lots of pressure on me for choosing a major and ultimatly a college the problem is i was doing some research online and found that businese major in general isn't profitable as it sound because occupations like docter lawyer engineer has a better staring wage and future wages that is why i am second thoughing taking a major in business the first reason i choose business was because i like straegy leading a unit and out thing oppenents type of things so if you have other major that might fit this passion i will like to hear from you or you can explain why a business major might be worth pursuing thank you so much for helping me in my journey also my family is a little below middle class this worries me too since i won't have experiment money to try out my business's ideas and would not have many business network or realtion compared to richer competors who wnet to harvard and has been in the rich social cirlce t t business major like any major is only worth what you put into it out of my group of friends from college the starting salary for the business majors was between k k i've heard that engineers have a higher starting salary in general however without additional schooling the salary increase year after year doesn't grow very much doctors and lawyers will make more but you'll be in school for much longer also doctors are faced with a lot of problems in the health care industry and i've never met a doctor who hasn't complained about the enormous cost of malpractice insurance figure out what you want to do if you walk into a store and can estimate how much money their generating daily what they're doing right and what they could be doing better well you should probably be a business major there are a wide range of positions you can take as a business major versus doctors lawyers and engineers who can specialize in something but basically they are doctors lawyers and engineers with a business major you can get into accounting consulting all kinds of management positions investments and real estate just to name a few hope that helps and good luck Capital accumulation Insurance Health insurance Education in the United States Microeconomics Economic inequality Economics Warren Buffett Medical malpractice Unemployment Surplus value Gross domestic product Inflation Canadian and American health care systems compared Social Security debate (United States) Lawyer Capitalism Publicly funded medicine Life insurance Prostate cancer Ra (board game) Deflation (economics) Anarchism and capitalism Juris Doctor Tax Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Blackjack Public policy Productive and unproductive labour American individualist anarchism Flat tax National Football League Law of value Education in Germany Medicare (Canada) Division of labour Berkshire Hathaway Wal-Mart Social class Professor Strategic management Economic history of Japan W.
