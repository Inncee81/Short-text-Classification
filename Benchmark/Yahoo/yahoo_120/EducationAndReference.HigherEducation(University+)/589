online degrees can anybody tell me anything about getting a degree online is it a good idea or bad idea and so on any information will be appreciated thank you there are advantages and disadvantages to doing your degree online provided that you have selected a reputable and accredited college to study at you will likely find the courses to be harder than those done in the classroom the professors are usually the same professors that teach in the classroom and the material to be covered is identical there is far less opportunity for interaction between you and the professor and there is no push to get things done it's entirely up to you if you put off that page paper until the day before it's due because nobody reminded you you fail if you're a self starter and hard worker who likes to read and learn on your own then a dl degree may well be right if there are reasons you can't go to a classroom job family disability military prison then dl may be the only way if there is a school that has a program that you can't get where you are not too many marine science programs where there's no ocean then dl may be the only way don't forget to look at the online degree programs at your state public university those heavily advertised private schools aren't the only online options out there if you're looking for an easier or cheaper way to get a degree online education isn't the place to look Homeschooling Education in Portugal Education in Australia No Child Left Behind Act Education in Germany Graduate school Juris Doctor College Community college Academia Athabasca University Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Columbia University GED Education in Malaysia ITESM Law school Teacher Associate's degree Florida State University University of Houston Education in Austria Distance education Librarian Cornell University American University Northeastern University, Boston Physical therapy Florida Institute of Technology Teach the Controversy Dublin City University Intelligent design movement Open University United States Air Force Academy University of San Francisco Education in Hong Kong Theory of conduct Education University of Maryland University College Secondary education in Japan Kaplan Otterbein College University of Szeged Bilkent University Emerson College Montessori method Master of Business Administration Education reform St. John's College, U.
