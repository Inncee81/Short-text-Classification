concordia vs mcgill i'm from la i'm debating whether i should go to mcgill or concordia i know those are the top school in montreal which school has a better art department in photography and music engineering just art in general i know mcgill has a much bigger reputation than concordia in general but it has not fine arts faculty at all it has a great music faculty but for photography concordia is your best bet especially if you are most interested in a strong artistic orientation the faculty include genevi ve cadieux evergon raymonde april and other award winning photographers it is not an easy program to get into though i hope you have a great portfolio as to music engineering concordia does not offer the official tonmeister program as does mcgill although only at the master's level but the electroacoustics major has good recording courses and is concerned completely with learning about manipulating sound check out both programs and get in touch if you'd like photography is in studio arts and electroacoustics in music http studioarts concordia ca and http music concordia ca i know i'm biased in favour of concordia because i work there but i do not hesitate to recommend mcgill in areas where they are stronger than we are visual arts is not one of them and i wish you luck in your decision come visit ok Concordia University University of Maryland Baltimore County Underground city, Montreal Photography Medical school Master's degree Education in the United States University of Victoria University of Connecticut University of Bristol Chinese University of Hong Kong Graduate school Washington University in St. Louis University of Notre Dame Digital art Savannah College of Art and Design Dafydd Williams Bilkent University Montreal Advanced Placement Program Hampshire College University of Michigan University of Central Florida Associate's degree Henri Cartier-Bresson Temple University York University Queen's University Canadian Interuniversity Sport Henry Cow Luther College Grammy Award Leiden University Graphics University of British Columbia Simon Fraser University University of Alabama Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences MIT Sloan School of Management College Queen's School of Business Ryerson University Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences University of Waterloo Caulfield Grammar School Massachusetts Institute of Technology Georgetown University Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Juris Doctor Professor University of Toronto Usher (entertainer) Australian National University Modern Iranian scientists and engineers Education in the People's Republic of China Doctorate Fine art Ice hockey City and Guilds of London Institute Pulitzer Prize Far Eastern University Ajax (programming) UCLA School of Theater Film and Television Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Software engineering California Polytechnic State University Art school Hunter College High School Cooper Union Middle Tennessee State University North American Debating Championship Open University (Netherlands) Linus Pauling World Universities Debating Championship Seneca College YMCA Christian Brothers University Lyceum of the Philippines Columbia University University of California, San Diego Intelligent design movement Cinematographer Students' Society of McGill University University of British Columbia Alma Mater Society Middle East Technical University Electroacoustic Northeastern University, Boston University of North Carolina at Charlotte Experiential education The Catholic University of America Raffles Institution University of Canterbury American University TLC Stanford University Sheryl Crow
