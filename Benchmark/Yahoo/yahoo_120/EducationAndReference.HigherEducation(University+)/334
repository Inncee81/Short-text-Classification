please give me your opinions on some of these private colleges located in florida i just recently moved to florida from new york and attend community college here i am interested in studying elementary education and eventually getting my master's i do not know the reputation of the schools here in florida and only really hear positive things about university of florida these are the colleges i am interested in florida southern university flagler college barry university rollins college lynn university university of tampa any information would be useful expessially first hand accounts i would love to hear from people who have attended these schools thanks for your help i would really like to narrow this list down to three possibly four because i would also like to apply to three state schools in florida thanks for all the help so far i suggest looking at yahoo education left menu bar on the homepage where you can get some basic statistics about each of the schools average sat score hs gpas etc you can get similar info from peterson's guide and also from usnews world report i have a colleague at the university of tampa in the bio department and he's top notch got his degree from johns hopkins school of medicine my understanding from him is that the professors pretty much all love teaching and most of them apparently have undergraduate students that they treat like grad students using them in their labs for research publishing papers with them etc i had a colleague who sent his daughter to rollins and she loved it it's well respected outside of florida as well as in florida the rest of the schools are more of what i would call regional sorts of places they're known in florida but not particularly well known outside of it all of them are basically undergraduate schools but my impression is that university of tampa and rollins are both more international in their student body and both have faculty members who are active in research not just teaching not sure how much of what i said has meaning since my experience is really through colleagues but maybe it'll give you something to focus on as you research the schools good luck Graduate school College Juris Doctor Florida State University University of Central Florida Johns Hopkins University Emory University College and university rankings University of Michigan Chinese University of Hong Kong Law school University of Bristol Education in Germany Columbia University Grade (education) York University Master's degree University of Alabama Ball State University Education in Australia Trinity College, Dublin University of Southern California Professor University of Toronto Academia Education in the People's Republic of China Florida International University Vanderbilt University Florida Institute of Technology American University Lawyer Washington University in St. Louis University of Chicago University of Nottingham Dublin City University Rollins College Education in Portugal Education in Taiwan University of Houston Christian Brothers University Stern School of Business University of California, Los Angeles Chiropractic Barbara McClintock University of Maryland Baltimore County Linus Pauling Stevens Institute of Technology No Child Left Behind Act Harvard University University of Cambridge College admissions University of Pittsburgh University of Edinburgh Emerson College Tufts University University of Hong Kong Middle Tennessee State University University of Pennsylvania University of Indonesia Far Eastern University Teacher University of Wisconsin University of Notre Dame University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Physician Education in Japan Brigham Young University Academic rank University of Szeged Arizona State University Software engineering Education in Romania University of Melbourne Georgetown University Affirmative action University of California, Santa Barbara Northeastern University, Boston Memorial University of Newfoundland Lars Onsager Rice University University of California, Berkeley Johns Hopkins Hospital University University of Warwick Student loan Middle East Technical University The George Washington University Bowdoin College Tulane University Degrees of Oxford University
