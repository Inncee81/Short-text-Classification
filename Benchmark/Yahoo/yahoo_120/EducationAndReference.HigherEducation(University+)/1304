freshmen year in college i wondering what school material are needed for college b c i have no idea i know this question stupid but i really have no idea if i need a binder or a notebook any advice would be really nice thanks i was kinda of talking during class you don't need a specific format like binder or notebook it's completely up to you whatever works for you just make sure that you keep everything organized and handy your is not stupid you have never been in college before let me tell you something school is what you make of it if you want to do good and you put your mind to it you can do it if you want to take it easy and party all the time yeah you can do that too as far as buying supplies you can buy the basics like your backpack paper writing stuff and then your notebooks or binders i found that what worked best for me was to have one ring binder with tabs on it to separate the different classes you have and in addition to this i had a subject notebook to take lengthy notes in but again it's what works for you Laptop Notebook Inception of Darwin's theory Floppy disk GED She Loves You Quizbowl Student Community emergency response team Paper size Brown University RuneScape quests Can't Hardly Wait Blood on the Tracks Mouse (computing) On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Objective-C Yearbook The Amazing Race Economics The Origin of Species The Diary of a Young Girl Expert system Little Britain Shit Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Trinity College, Dublin Chester Carlson Guy Davenport Joke Theory of conduct Cliff Richard Richard Feynman Hiberno-English Charles Darwin Avenue Q Cruising (maritime) Advanced Squad Leader The Citadel (Military College) Social rule Antonio Gramsci The Star Wars Holiday Special Singlish Contract University of Houston Socrates Education in Romania Dilbert Education in the People's Republic of China Marxism Idealism Francis Crick Communication skill Development of Darwin's theory Laura Schlessinger Time Out of Mind John Aubrey Education in the United States W.
