san francisco state university what do u think about does it have a nice campus is it fun i wanna study biology pre med there tell me what do think thank s is it fun not in my opinion does it have a nice campus no it's a bit on the rundown side granted most of the cal states don't have the nicest campuses but sf state is on the lower end imo bio pre med is fine just know that it's going to be quite hard to get accepted so make sure you get as high a gpa as you can and to study really early for the mcat also get involved and be active outside of the classroom you're going to have to make up for the poor cal state prestige you're competing against berkeley kids across the bay and stanford kids to the south Medical school University of California, Berkeley Education in the United States California Polytechnic State University California State University California State University, East Bay Stanford University Cal Poly Pomona University of California, Davis San Francisco Bay Area University of California, San Francisco California University of California, Santa Barbara University of Southern California State university Oakland, California San Francisco State University University of California Stanford University School of Medicine Silicon Valley Affirmative action San Jos__ State University California State University, Chico The Stanford Axe Duke University California State University, Northridge Berkeley, California University of California, San Diego Stony Brook University California Baptist University New York University Autograph Education in Germany San Diego State University California State University, Fullerton Lowell High School (San Francisco) Grade (education) California Institute of Technology Master's degree Yale University California State University, Long Beach Boston University Big Game California Institute of Integral Studies Mapua Institute of Technology University of Connecticut San Francisco cable car system University of California, Santa Cruz Sacramento, California University of Pennsylvania University of Victoria NCAA Men's Soccer Championship The Citadel (Military College) Bristol Grammar School California State University, Fresno University of San Francisco University of California, Riverside Central Coast, California Indiana State University Belmont Abbey College Palo Alto, California University of Chicago California State University, Los Angeles Alpha Phi Medical College Admission Test Case citation Campus Crusade for Christ Middle Tennessee State University Graduate school University of San Diego Pacific Ten Conference California State University, San Marcos University of Houston Pennsylvania State University San Francisco, California California Lutheran University University of Wisconsin Ivy League College Cal Tjader Free Speech Movement Southern California Sigma Nu Super Bowl Quezon City Johns Hopkins University Lynbrook High School Yale Law School Emerson College Law school The Play Education in the People's Republic of China University of Queensland Freed-Hardeman University Regents of the University of California v.
