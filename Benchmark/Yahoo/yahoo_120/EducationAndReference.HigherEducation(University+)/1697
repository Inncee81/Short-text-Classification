where can i get funds to attend an international conference i am a permanent faculty member at a central federally funded university in asia and i have to attend a conference in canada it will cost approximately usd including air fare board lodging and other expenses this is a huge amount in my own curency it is a very prestigious conference and so it is a great honor to have had my paper accepted there it would mean a lot for me to be able to attend this conference and of course it would be very disappointing to miss it due to a lack of funds if you know of any agencies institutes organizations trusts or individuals that provide funding for attending conferences or seminars please do let me know the primary focus of the conference is on english language and literature thanks in advance to all answerers can you not ask your university to help fund the trip i would think that the international attention you would get would help increase their status as well and would thus make them more likely to want to help you out with the expenses good luck Education in the United States University of Central Florida Open access Graduate school Student loan College Health insurance Mutual fund Publicly funded medicine Life insurance University of California United States dollar Microcredit University of Connecticut Public transport University of Toronto International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement United Nations Education in Portugal Charter school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus No Child Left Behind Act Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Education in Japan International response to Hurricane Katrina Education in England Education in Hong Kong Boston College Education in Romania European Union Trust (Law) USA Johns Hopkins University Corporate governance Charitable trust Social Security (United States) Federal Reserve University of San Diego Commonwealth of Nations Canadian federal election, 1993 Public education Advanced Placement Program Yale University Trinity College, Dublin Brigham Young University Taxation in the United States National Health Service University of Virginia Hawaii Non-profit organization International Monetary Fund Princeton University Simon Fraser University Monetary policy Boy Scouts of America University of Maryland, College Park Professor Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Teach the Controversy Education in Austria School choice Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology Rice University Credit union University of Oregon Hanscom Air Force Base Doctor of Philosophy Social Security debate (United States) Bank Education in Singapore University of Southern California Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs University of Massachusetts Amherst FairTax Dalhousie Student Union Students' union Green Party of Canada San Diego State University Dublin City University Organization of the Islamic Conference Microeconomics Culture of the United States Inflation Intelligent design movement Coalition Provisional Authority Emerson College Vanderbilt University Land use forecasting National Kidney Foundation Singapore Sport in the United Kingdom NAACP Peer review Education in Australia Income trust European Space Agency Bond Model United Nations United States International Space Station Elections in the United States
