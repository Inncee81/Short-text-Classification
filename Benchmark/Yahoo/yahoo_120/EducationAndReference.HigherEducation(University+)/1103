is it worth it to get my mfa i am interested in hearing from people who have one what are you doing now that you have it has it improved your career do you have a job with more securities and benefits thanks i don't have one but once was in the program i decided that it wasn't worthwhile because i wasn't going to work in a music job if you want to continue with work in the area of your bfa then the mfa will probably be beneficial however the most benefit will come from a phd most schools will allow you to skip the m and go for the p with just a few extra hours work so are you going to commit to a lifetime of work in your bfa study area if so continue your education with either option mentioned above if not and you still want to better yourself consider a m in business you will be much better prepared for a management position if you are looking for security get a government job you'll know on day one what your pay will be years out and you probably won't like it many people put too much emphasis on security they are afraid to take any risks the risk takers may fail but are usually the ones with the better jobs and life styles Emerson College Graduate school Master's degree California Institute of the Arts Chinese University of Hong Kong Alex Ferguson Washington University in St. Louis Education in the United States Social Security (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Unemployment benefit Education in the People's Republic of China Option Independence Party (Iceland) Social Security debate (United States) Tort reform Affirmative action Insurance Academic degree Pension Tisch School of the Arts British degree abbreviations University of Santo Tomas GED Charles Ponzi New Deal Health insurance Education in Australia Security (finance) Seneca College Warren Buffett Interest Trade union Poker jargon Freeters Economic inequality Community college Degrees of Oxford University Unemployment Mortgage-backed security Hedge fund Free trade Paul Hackett Extreme Programming Corporate governance United Kingdom corporation tax Ra (board game) Bipolar disorder Privatization Medical analysis of circumcision 401(k) Mark Calaway Externality Vaccine Life insurance The Apprentice 2 candidates Education in Germany Plame affair Ben Johnson (athlete) Baseball Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Welfare trap Corporate finance Hillary Rodham Clinton Food Stamp Program Flat tax Real Love (song) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Capitalism Arturo Frondizi Ty Cobb Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Labor theory of value The Apprentice 2 Blonde on Blonde Landmark Education Michael Garibaldi James J.
