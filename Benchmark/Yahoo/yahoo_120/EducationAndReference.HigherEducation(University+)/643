better to go to a commnuity college for associate degree in radiologic tech or university for bachelor degree i wonder if any one knows roughly how many credits i can transfer or how many years to study before i can get my license in the us i am an international graduate in radiologic tech and what does advanced placement in the program means i think it depends on your career goals if you do intend on finishing with a bachelor degree i hear that it may not be a good idea to start at a junior college if you only want to get an associate degree than you should go to a junior college however i am a university student and i don't regret going to a university right out of high school i think it depends on what you want to do and what learning environment is best for you Associate's degree Education in the United States Community college Dentistry Graduate school Master's degree Juris Doctor Physician Florida Institute of Technology Medical school Athabasca University High school Seneca College Education in Germany Education in Australia Advanced Placement Program Education in Canada Georgetown University Education in Taiwan Bachelor of Arts Grade (education) Architect Law school Teacher Academic degree The College of New Jersey Education in Hong Kong Far Eastern University Education in the Republic of Ireland University of Houston Kwantlen University College Nurse Bologna process Education in Japan Memorial University of Newfoundland Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Georgia Institute of Technology University of Texas at Dallas Miami Dade College Education in Portugal Academia American University Indiana State University State university Master of Business Administration University of Pennsylvania Australian Qualifications Framework Chiropractic Florida State University Bachelor's degree University of Notre Dame Paralegal Education in the People's Republic of China Cooper Union Education in Finland University of Pittsburgh Oregon State University Trinity College, Dublin Emerson College Babson College GED Scientology beliefs and practices Western Kentucky University Gwinnett University Center Medical University of South Carolina Stevens Institute of Technology Master of Laws University of Central Florida University of San Francisco Pennsylvania State University Education in Sweden The Catholic University of America Johns Hopkins University Cooperative education Northeastern University, Boston Tulane University Distance education City and Guilds of London Institute Software engineering Quizbowl Michigan Technological University San Diego State University Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences University of California, Davis Kennesaw State University Baldwin-Wallace College Institute for Christian Studies Boston University Mapua Institute of Technology Professor Bachelor of Laws Doctorate Degrees of Oxford University Higher education in Japan University of Santo Tomas Dallas Baptist University Texas Tech University
