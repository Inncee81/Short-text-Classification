when do you buy books for college hello i am going to a community college in san diego and i've already choosen several classes the question is when do you buy books for the classes do you buy them ahead of time i still don't know what books that i'm gonna need or do you wait until the professor to tell you what to buy thank you for answering i usually buy the books after the first class because then you can see if the professor recommends the book or not but if you want to save money get the books as soon as possible because the used books go fast The Amazing Race Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban San Diego State University William A.
