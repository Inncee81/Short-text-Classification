community college by going to a community college without dorms does it get rid of the whole college expirence also do jobs such as interior design care about only having an associate degree its true that dorming is part of the college experience but its not the whole experience college is a different environment socially academically from high school you may miss out on the dorming but you get everything else i'm not in that industry however in my experience an associates degree in any field is minimal maybe not even enough you may want to consider transferring after you get your associates to a four year or get a job or an internship in an interior design firm to get some experience Community college Trinity College (Connecticut) Architect Medical school Boston University Juris Doctor Cooperative education Claremont McKenna College Connecticut College Harvey Mudd College College Florida Institute of Technology Reed College Georgia Institute of Technology Law school Education in the United States Franklin W.
