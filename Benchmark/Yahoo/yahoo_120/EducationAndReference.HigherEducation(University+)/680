what calculator should i buy for my college calc class this is probably going to be my last math class in college and want to know what calculator would be best have all the functions that i will need of course i would like the least expensive one that still gives me what i need also i prefer ones with a battery as opposed to solar power thanks check with your math instructor you might not be allowed to use certain calculators on your tests i would think they would ban a ti because it is a power calculator most colleges i am sure would be ban such calculators on calculus tests since it can do symbolic calculus Calculus Calculator Mathematics Integral Computation Propositional calculus Derivative Stuyvesant High School TI-89 series Education in Romania Graphing calculator Advanced Placement Program Jaime Escalante GED Polynomial Archimedes Slide rule Physics TI-83 series Turing machine Model (economics) Lambda calculus SAT Solar cell Microeconomics Watch Solar power Normal distribution Calculus of variations Natural deduction Aberration in optical systems Education in the United States Hunter College High School G__del number Victoria University of Manchester Palm OS Lebesgue integration Lazy evaluation Combinatory logic Convergence of Fourier series Grade (education) Tensor William Rowan Hamilton P-adic number Fractional calculus Credit card On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Pi First-order logic Mathematical logic Statistical hypothesis testing Doomsday argument Turing completeness History of computing Jesse Douglas History of physics Fundamental theorem of calculus Spacecraft propulsion Common Lisp Scheme programming language Overclocking Mutual fund Slope Standard deviation Computer algebra system Determinant Supply and demand Radius of convergence Python programming language Finite element method Automated theorem proving Manifold Numerical analysis Collision detection C plus plus Parsing Massachusetts Institute of Technology Graduate school TI-92 series Separation of church and state Universal Serial Bus PLATO Church___Turing thesis GURPS Logic Henri Lebesgue Navigation Cheating in Counter-Strike Second-order logic UBASIC Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Nickel Compiler optimization Chi-square distribution National Rifle Association STS-61 Expert system Specified complexity New math
