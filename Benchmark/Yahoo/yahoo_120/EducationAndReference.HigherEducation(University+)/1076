do companies actually repect an online degree i doubt they do attending a ranked university to me is much more credible the experience the difficulty of classes etc wouldn't it depend upon where the degree came from i'm thinking that the online master's degree that harvard university issues is much better received than one from say east podunk state university how about one from umass or boston u online versus one from yoursmalltown local college done traditionally then too consider where on the transcript or diploma does it say online and where on the resident degree does it say traditional as for difficulty of classes try one of those easy online classes at harvard or umass and tell me what you think the world has changed education happens in places other than a classroom that's the way it is and the way things are going to be more and more just my thoughts though Education in the United States University of Massachusetts Amherst College Education in Germany Ohio Wesleyan University Master's degree Juris Doctor Education in Australia Massachusetts Institute of Technology IB Diploma Programme Harvard University GED University of Massachusetts Boston University Diploma mill Boston College Columbia University Graduation Education in Malaysia Mitt Romney Model United Nations Associate's degree College admissions Academic degree Harvard Division of Continuing Education Community college University of Guelph University of Maryland University College Emory University Medical school Charles William Eliot Cornell University Harvard College Northeastern University, Boston John Calipari Education College and university rankings Education in Romania Georgia Institute of Technology Johns Hopkins University Pennsylvania State University Teacher University of Central Florida Marylhurst University Education in the People's Republic of China Coeducation No Child Left Behind Act Lawyer Christian Brothers University University of Idaho Bowdoin College Memorial University of Newfoundland Education in Hong Kong Athabasca University W.E.B.
