college help instate or out of state i am going to be a senior this year and i can't even decide between colleges in my state or outside i'd like to be independent and get a solid education also i'd like to travel possibly and i don't necessarily want to study abroad to do this or be active military which do you prefer instate or out and what's a good way i could travel without it being risky and too costly hi the benefits of attending college in state include lower tuition close proximity to friends and family and familiarity with the area whereas if you attend college out of state you will pay higher tuition leave behind friends and family and adapt to a new situation and environment both of these options have their pros and cons as far as safely traveling once you are in your junior or senior you can opt to study abroad for a semester if you so desire also students get discounted rates for traveling together in a group to europe and staying at youth hostels this is a great way to see the world in an inexpensive way and meet students with whom you have many things in common do you have a person you trust that you can discuss these options with i recommend your high school counselor for starters and also your parent s best wishes High school Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Tuition Student loan Education in Germany College admissions Education in Taiwan Affirmative action Graduate school Education in Australia Hunter College High School Private school School choice Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Brigham Young University Education in Romania Juris Doctor Culture of the United States Community college Education Students' union Scholarship College Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Lawyer Lynbrook High School Victoria School Student Education in Malaysia Education in Japan Principal-agent problem Education in England Education in Finland The Citadel (Military College) Education in Albania Bicycle lighting Kwantlen University College Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder University of New England, Maine Otakon Education in the Republic of Ireland One Tree Hill (TV series) Hopkins School Professor Education in New Zealand Price discrimination No Child Left Behind Act Princeton University Phillips Exeter Academy Social Security debate (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Publicly funded medicine Education voucher Kasparov versus The World NHH GED Bond Redundant array of independent disks High School of Dundee American University Associate's degree University of Pennsylvania Annuity Friends Harvard University Physician Mutual fund Miami University Education in Hong Kong Liberal Democrats (UK) Hostel Williams College Order of succession Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in Canada Canadian Federation of Students Health insurance Columbine High School massacre Taipei American School Carey Baptist Grammar School Caulfield Grammar School Separation of church and state Centrelink Public education College and university rankings Barrister Yeshiva Social rule Open access University Walt Disney World College Program Anglo-Chinese School Danish Folkeskole Education Kalamazoo College
