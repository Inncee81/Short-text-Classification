double majoring i am goin to be a freshman at virginia tech this year and as of now im majoring in physics and i want to either minor or double major in chem i know double majoring would be alot of work but would be too much with those two subjects and would it be worth it it would not be a lot of work it would be a ton of work since chemistry and physics is a very very large field if you ask me is it worth it course it is but you should ask yourself are you capable if not don't push it you're just gonna give up in the middle of it and it'll be a waste of time i say stick with one if you're doing good on it then consider i am majoring in computer science and minoring in music and even that is a lot of work chemistry physics suicide Doctorate Georgia Institute of Technology Florida Institute of Technology Computer Massachusetts Institute of Technology California Institute of Technology Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Linus Pauling Texas Tech University Science Physics Georgetown University University of California, Irvine History of chemistry Science and technology in Israel Biophysics Smith College Computer science Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Stuyvesant High School Victoria University of Manchester Theoretical chemistry Quantum chemistry Computational chemistry Science Bowl Concerto Education in the United States Organic chemistry Scientific method College of William and Mary University of Virginia Virginia Military Institute University of Michigan Bristol Grammar School Gymnasium (Denmark) University of Connecticut Oregon Museum of Science and Industry Agriculture W.
