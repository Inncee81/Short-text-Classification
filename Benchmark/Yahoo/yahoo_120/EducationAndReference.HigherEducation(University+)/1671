how do i be as stress free as my bf when it comes to college classes he hardly ever studies for any class and he manages to get all a's and b's i study my a off and get the same grades sometimes it really ticks me off last semester i was in of his biology classes we had our finals for those classes the next day i was freaking out and studying for hours i decided to go over to my bf's place so he could help me study i get over there and expect to find him studying instead hes playing xbox with his roomate he told me that studying is a waste of time you either know it or you dont he shows up to classes with nothing he did make a good point why he does this however one day after class he started talking about stuff and i had no idea the professor had said these things then he tells me because i was too busy taking notes that i did not pay attention and thats why i have to study so long i noticed that on our tests he misses all the easy questions that you would know from studying like vocab while he gets all the thought thinking ones correct should i try his ways or is he just smart and he doesn t have to take notes he told me that he wasn t smart and that i was smarter then him he also said that when i stress out over tests like finals i m too busy worrying about taking the test and that s what i think about while i m studying therefore i need to study longer so then how do i change my habits should i change my habits i would like to be as stress free as he is and enjoy my last year of college everyone learns differently i thought i would try a few new studying routines i e notecards and making lists for o chem instead of my normal studying routines of working as many problems as i could get my hands on and i ended up having to put more time in learning what i should have learned with the note cards and then stressing to pick my grade back up i guess my point is its worth trying new things but make sure you have the time to make up the points if the new study method isn't the best for you Extreme Programming Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Education in Germany Education in the United States Procrastination The Inside Graduate school Milton H.
