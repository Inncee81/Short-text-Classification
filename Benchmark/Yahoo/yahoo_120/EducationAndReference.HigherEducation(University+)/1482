can i get in i was soo excited i finally found my dream school the university of miami i heard that this school is really hard to get into to and i don't have the best grades please if you know what you are talking about can you tell me my chances and if i should even be excited about applying i have gpa on a scale on act writen club president nhs student council varsity track just quit varsity basketball have been in youth groups and stuff like that african american and katrina victim do i have a chance according to the college board only of their admitted students have gpas under and the middle of their students have act scores between and so your chances are somewhat limited i would suggest that your application essay should be really meaningful and carefully writtten in order to give you an opportunity for the person who suggested that you would get in because you are a person of color the university of miami is at least students of color already so that may not play much of a role in their decision not to mention that it is insulting to assume that you would get in for that reason alone regardless of their standards Grade (education) College admissions Affirmative action Tulane University Middle Tennessee State University SAT Education in the United States Law School Admissions Test Miami University Law school University of Alabama University of Tennessee Regents of the University of California v.
