high school freshman worried about college both my parents did not go to college i plan on studying in engineering but of course that's nothing final my colleges of choice are uc berkeley la and i can dream for mit currently i have a gpa and i next year sophomore i am taking english ii honors world history ap chem algebra ii honors and mandarin iii honors i am in cross country and track field and i plan to continue with these all four years i am in my school's robotics club but honestly the club has been quite dead and i am not so interested in it so i don't know whether i should continue in it i am also part of the drill team at our school and have 'commanded' as a color sargeant and other roles does that count as a 'leadership' role colleges look for what i'm worried about are things such as summer programs that colleges look for going to cosmos like one of my friends did in his junior year doesn't seem like something i would do also i see on the mit application that they ask what you do simply for pleasure for me that is drumming i am also very interested in web design and art i am wondering if things like this have any effect on college applications also does it matter how many times the sat is taken if i take it next year and screw up but got better scores afterwards would that look worse than if i just got good scores taking it later also i forgot to mention i just started volunteering weeks ago and i have racked up hours so far the college apps want hours per week and weeks per year but what if i don't volunteer consistent hours as in the summer i'll volunteer more often than during the school year just wondering what do to when im going to be filling the thing out though that is a ways from here thanks for any help sugguestions one more thing i am debating whether to join first robotics aside of robotics club at my school or not this would look good on the college app but my lazy self does not want to stay at school til pm every day i am half interested and since it overlaps with track season it will hinder my training hi i'm currently an mit student and will be helping with admissions committee in the fall so i guess you're pretty much in luck for classes we know that there are some schools out there that offer a ridiculous number of ap classes and others that don't what you need to show is that no matter what you always took the hardest classes that you could and that you can handle a challenge looking from your courseload you took the same classes i did when i was a freshman activity wise do what you're passionate about there are so many people at mit and none of our lives revolve around school work it would be a killer if it did when we ask for something you enjoy doing we don't want to hear that you enjoy doing your homework although you might have to enjoy doing it a little for you to want to come to mit if you really enjoy playing the drums then write that down my roommate plays the drums and she's quite good for that essay i wrote about being a dj at a local radio station it had nothing to do with engineering but it was something i was passionate about and you could tell from my essay leadership is pretty important too so presidents of clubs organizations all of those are definitely a plus i did a summer program but you definitely don't need one to get in several of my friends did rsi which actually takes place at either caltech or mit i did one and it was literally the best time of my life i came back home starting my sentences with while i was at mit i yes nerdy i know but that was how i knew mit was right for me do something with your summer though do some research or find an internship or volunteer summer is a great time to try new things out and figure out if you like them or not it seems like you're really ahead of the game keep up the stellar academics do well on the sats and try and find a couple of activities that you're really passionate about and then try and acheive a leadership position in those robotics for me was a lot of fun and first was a pretty awesome experience if you're not that into it then it's a really time consuming activity and there are probably better ways to spend your time like i said there are plenty of things out there for you to try and experience it's better to spend your time doing those instead of spending a whole bunch of time doing something you don't really like also relax high school is supposed to be the easy part good luck Education in the United States The Citadel (Military College) Graduate school SAT University of Southern California Education in the People's Republic of China Lowell High School (San Francisco) Franklin W.
