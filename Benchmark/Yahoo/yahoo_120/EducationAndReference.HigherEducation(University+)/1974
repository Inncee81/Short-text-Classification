med school do u have to live at med school or can u live at an apartment and at the residency training after med school can u live in an apartment also is it a bad idea to have a kid the summer between college and med school many med students line in apartments it is common but if you have a kid before entering the med school you will not be able to split time between school and the kid i mean it will be very difficult you will feel that you don't have any time for your kid however some med students are able to manage both so its up to you in the end i would suggest talking to med students with kid and how they are doing Medical school Seneca College Education in the United States Code: Lyoko L.O.C.K.D.O.W.N.
