should i continue my education i currently have an mba no specialization and i work in market research as a project manager for years now i would like to eventually become a director of market research within the next years i have been accepted into a masters of market research program i am still wondering if i should go through the program or not do you think it would help my career or is my mba enough to get into the position i want you are asking the wrong question you can undoubtedly get the position you want with the mba if you have the right knowledge the problem is that doing market research well requires extensive knowledge of statistics and research design not taught in mba programs i realize that the mba generally requires statistics but it isn't enough for many marketing research firms so the question is how much of these things have you learned either on the job or in some other setting if your current firm for example only does focus groups or uses a particular approach for all research then your chances of moving to a director position anywhere other than at your current firm may be limited without the mmr if your current firm is one which designs very different projects for each client and you have been taught about extensively about research design and analysis so that you feel confident doing more than just writing another survey for the next client who comes in the door then you may not need the degree Graduate school Master of Business Administration Strategic management Master's degree Ross School of Business Cass Business School, London Software engineering Doctor of Philosophy MIT Sloan School of Management Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in the United States Psychology Athabasca University Lawyer Nurse Extreme Programming Marketing research Stevens Institute of Technology Economics McKinsey & Company Librarian Electrical engineering Saint Joseph's University Case study University of Pretoria Baruch College Requirements analysis Milton H.
