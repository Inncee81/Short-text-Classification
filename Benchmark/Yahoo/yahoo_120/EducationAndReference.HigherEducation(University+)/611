colleges in ohio i'm going to be a senior this year and i'm still not sure what schools to apply to i'm considering university of cincinnati miami university case western osu and ou i got a on my act and i have a weighted gpa i am also thinking about majoring in business finance or some sort of business related degree i don't think i want to join the greek system and i'm not all that big on sports what do you know about these schools if you attend or visited and what school do you think i have a shot at attending i almost choked reading that osu would be the hardest go get into osu has students and isnt that hard to get into miami is easily the hardest to get into on your list just look at the average act scores for miami vs osu and that will be instantly obvious hey im a bucks fan but facts are facts with that gpa and act score you will likely get into every one of these universities if you apply that being said if you are going to do a business major then miami is certainly the way for you to go the reputation of miami's undergraduate business program is unrivaled by any other university in ohio the nearest university that even comes close actually its better but miami is very very good is indiana university uc is a good engineering school and has some other decent programs osu is good for a number of majors including engineering pre med and many others ou is known for its communications program which is excellent and case western well the only thing ive heard it mentioned in regards to its programs is pre law i would strongly suggest you choose on the strength of theprogram you intend to study and on that basis miami is head and shoulders above your other choices in regards to business the biggest negative to you is that the greek system is very very strong at miami but there are plenty of options outside of the greek system and i knew plenty of gdi g d independants that had a great time at miami outside of the greek system although if you find the right fraternity you might be suprised i helped start one at miami that went somewhat outside of the typical greek mould anyway good luck to you Oregon State University Grade (education) Ohio State University Miami University Law school Medical school College admissions Education in the United States Graduate school University of Connecticut Chinese University of Hong Kong Middle Tennessee State University Education in Germany Woody Hayes Education in Romania University of Notre Dame University of Central Florida Ohio Oklahoma State University - Stillwater Fight song Stern School of Business Case Western Reserve University University of Michigan College football University of Alabama University of Idaho University of Pennsylvania High school Florida International University Purdue University Master's degree University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ELO rating system Brown University Jim Tressel Affirmative action New York Knicks Johns Hopkins University Columbus, Ohio Cincinnati Bengals Big East Conference Seneca College New York Giants National Certificate of Educational Achievement Columbia University Delta Tau Delta Quicksort Education in Taiwan Grove City College Andre Agassi Phi Delta Theta Economics University of Southern California Northwestern University Theory of conduct Intelligent design movement Fraternities and sororities Juris Doctor Washington State University University of Chicago Education in Australia York University University of Miami California Polytechnic State University Education in Portugal Education in Hong Kong Macquarie University Cornell University Education in the People's Republic of China The Citadel (Military College) Dayton, Ohio Alpha Epsilon Pi Major League Soccer University of Texas at San Antonio Florida State University Pennsylvania State University City and Guilds of London Institute University of Arizona Washington University in St. Louis Extreme Programming Trademark Auburn University American University Babe Ruth Heidelberg College Phillips Exeter Academy University of Florida University of California, San Diego Temple University Diving Pittsburgh Steelers
