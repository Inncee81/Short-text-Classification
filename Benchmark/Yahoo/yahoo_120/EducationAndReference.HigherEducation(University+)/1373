i plan to go into music as a career and i really can't think of much i can do with it i know i do not want to be a teacher but i will if i have to be i definitely don't want to teach anything lower than college again if i must i've always been pretty good at composing my own music and i saw that some colleges provide a major in composing i thought about this a while ago as i also thought about going into performance but i just don't know what kind of jobs i can get with composing i'd like a steady job that i know i wouldn't have to worry about money i'm only a senior in high school so i have at least a year if that to think about it so in short how sensible would it be to go into composing if you're talented at composing then that's a viable career option most composers aren't salaried though they are contracted or they simply compose because they love it and maybe someone else will too a bachelor's degree in music qualifies you for no professions even teaching directly your ability as a musician arranger conductor composer performer qualifies you for a job the degree simply enhances that ability the bottom line when you go to audition for the st louis symphony it's about how you play and that's all it's about the bachelor's degree helps but promises nothing teaching the degree you need to teach in high school and the one you need to teach in college are very different a bachelor of music bm or a ba in music won't qualify you for either to teach in highs school and below you will need a bachelor of music education or a bachelor of education in music or a bachelor of arts in music education and a state teaching certificate many music teachers have a master's degree and that makes having one almost essential to finding a job to teach in a college you will need at least a master of arts or master of music and most jobs require a phd or dma doctor of musical arts but not in education which would qualify you to teach in hs as well but instead in the specific subject you are going to teach such as theory or composition as a profession we musicians rarely have a steady job that we don't have to worry about for the most part we study music and perform for the love of our art it's just not about the money we realize that the odds of being the star who gets rich are about the same as winning the lottery those that are arrangers and composers are about the same the chance that we're the next john williams isn't very high at all it's about the art not the money now all of that said if you love the music and it is calling to you go for it remember though music majors have a course load of classes while their friends in the english department take classes per semester music majors spend upwards of four hours a day in practice sessions on top of classes and ensembles music majors study telemann even if they hate baroque music it's one that requires an absolute commitment or you will not make it out and remember a bachelor of arts in music is still a bachelor of arts you qualify for all of the jobs that people get that require a bachelor's degree but the major isn't important i have a friend who is well paid as an insurance adjuster with his bachelor of arts in music voice another went on to get a master's in instructional technology with her ba in music i'm in an mba with mine more than a few of my former classmates mueds are teaching marching band camp somewhere as we speak it's f heat index out there if the music is calling you then go for it if it's not your passion look at other options Graduate school
