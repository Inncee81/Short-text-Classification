college question i have questions i am going to pursue being a lawyer prosecuter and i know i'm going to need years of law school after i get a bachelors degree how many years of college does getting a bachelors degree take and my nd question i also want to study ministry theology while in college can i pursue ministry theology while getting my bachelors in law i am not sure where you live but in the us there is no such thing as a bachelors in law there is a pre law bachelor's program at some schools but most people who plan to go to law school get their b a or b s in something else i see no reason why you can't get a b a in theology and then move on to law school after you graduate with your b a most people do something like finance or business but i also know people who went to law school who had bachelor's degrees in things like english and history and chemistry the average time to get a bachelor's at least in the us is four years give or take a few terms that's based on taking summers off and on taking an average class load when i went to college my university was on the quarter system and hours was a normal class load while was the maximum allowed by the university i did one quarter which was classes and it nearly killed me anyway figuring that way on a quarter system and taking summers off you end up with approximately hours per year and it varies by department but the average to graduate was hours depending on your degree so you can see that it took approximately four years to get your bachelor's i did know people who went summer term as well as that gave them hours a year and they were able to graduate in three but they were in the minority it all just depends on what you want to do but most people if they are going to school full time finish a bachelor's in about four years in fact most universities plan for four years if you look at their catalogs they usually have a suggested course listing for each year and those are usually planned as four year programs with the first two years being general ed and general survey classes in your chosen major and the last two years being the more intensive upper level classes in your major so find a school with a good theology or divinity program and get your b a and then take some prep classes for the lsat and then go to law school the schooling will take you about years total if you don't have to take time off for something best of luck Education in the United States Graduate school Juris Doctor Chinese University of Hong Kong Lawyer Law school Education in Australia Master's degree Georgetown University Medical school Education in the People's Republic of China Degrees of Oxford University Doctorate Theology Education in Taiwan Physician Education in Germany SAT Community college Clergy Boston College Education in Portugal American University Academic degree Paralegal Professor High school University of San Diego Law School Admissions Test Bologna process Education in Hong Kong Education in the Republic of Ireland British degree abbreviations Oregon State University Grade (education) GED Drew University Stevens Institute of Technology University of Santo Tomas Duke University Education in Sweden Northeastern University, Boston City and Guilds of London Institute Ball State University Western Kentucky University University of Central Florida Memorial University of Newfoundland Bachelor's degree IB Diploma Programme Education in Austria Florida Institute of Technology Master of Laws Chiropractic University of Houston Florida State University Columbia University Education in Japan Advanced Placement Program Virginia Military Institute Education in Finland Smith College Cooper Union University of Szeged The College of New Jersey Academia Emerson College University of San Francisco Brown University Ateneo de Manila University Nurse University of Michigan Norwegian Lutheran School of Theology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus University of Connecticut Far Eastern University Bachelor of Laws University of M__nster Teacher York University University of Toronto University of Alabama Associate's degree Biblical studies Medieval university Independent school (UK) Economics Electrical engineering Harvard Division of Continuing Education Architect Johns Hopkins University Holy Orders Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences National Certificate of Educational Achievement
