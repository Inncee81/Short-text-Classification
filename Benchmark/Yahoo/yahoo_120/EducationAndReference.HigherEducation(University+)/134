is this a good schedule im hoping to be in a fraternity and i was wondering if anyone thought that it would be easy or hard todo with this schedule mondays to intro to college algebra to intro to criminal justice to english to freshmen sem tuesdays to intro to college algebra wednesdays to intro to college algebra to intro to criminal justice to english to freshmen sem thurdays to intro to college algebra fridays to intro to criminal justice to english i love to drink and party but im also one of the most morning ppl yo can meet the only problem that i can possibly think of is that you might have scheduled classes too closely together i don't know how hard it will be for you to get from one class to the next i don't know how far the class buildings are from each other i hope that you can get to all of your classes within minutes as that is all you seem to have given yourself between your classes on mondays wednesdays and fridays as a rule you don't want to be late or your professors won't take you seriously not giving yourself enough time between classes is a classic freshman mistake i think your schedule looks fine for joining a fraternity i think the only things you have to worry about are late afternoon and evening classes Education in Romania Princeton University Operation Market Garden College of William and Mary Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Lynbrook High School Sydney Riot of 1879 Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Lipscomb University Hurricane Wilma Good Friday Social rule STS-59 Student AFI 100 Years series Midnight Run American and British English differences Virginia Military Institute Wednesday Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Major League Baseball television contracts Visit of King George IV to Scotland BBC Radio 2 Avenue Q Johnnie Walker (DJ) Education in the People's Republic of China Hurricane Katrina timeline Easter Soap opera Northern Ireland peace process Jon Secada Monday Night Football History of Test cricket (to 1883) Blood on the Tracks Back to the Future timeline Bowl Championship Series Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sunday Middle Tennessee State University Brown University Munich U-Bahn The Rutles Saturday Night Live Liturgical year Holy Week Dorama Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Fathers' rights movement in the UK Velvet Revolution MTV2 Washington State University Hillsborough High School Williams College Vote for Change Bush Supreme Court candidates Rice University 2004 Republican National Convention Ron and Fez Tuesday Augustus De Morgan Darkwing Duck Paul Is Dead CBC Radio One Carnival Northeastern University, Boston September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for October Bob Harris (radio) Toonami National Lampoon's Animal House Baltimore Convention Center Hotel Project Doomsday rule Education in the United States Lattice (order) Can't Hardly Wait Fasting Interior algebra Harrow School Freed-Hardeman University Merrimack College Ash Wednesday Grove City College Hiberno-English 21 July 2005 London bombings Friday Fireside chats Monday WFAN (AM) Kodocha Abigail Folger Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Honey and Clover Days of the week BBC television drama EastEnders American Parliamentary Debating Association Jesuit College Preparatory School Dartmouth College
