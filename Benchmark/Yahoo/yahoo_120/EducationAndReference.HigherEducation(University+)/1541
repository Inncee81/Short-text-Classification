importance of ap courses upon beginning this school year in september i will begin my year as a junior i signed up for ap english and u s history but i don't really want history so i've been thinking about dropping it but i keep thinking how much do colleges look into ap courses i'm also on the tennis team and have been since last year and plan to stay until i graduate should i drop this class p s i'm hoping to get into ucla or uc berkley thanks i think it depends on what you want to study and where you go to school my college gave me some college credits for my ap courses which was a nice initial boost for my gpa but that was about it i know that most programs will allow you to clep certain entry level courses with ap credit but i wouldn't necessarily recommend doing that for me those entry level courses brought me up to speed in college and were good preparation for more difficult courses that came along later in my experience extra curricular activities like being on the tennis team count just as much as grades to college acceptance and scholarship committees if you can maintain good grades in both ap courses and still play tennis then i would recommend doing that if you think that's too much for you to handle then i would choose the one ap course that best suits your planned college major i would choose english if it were me because it can be applied to so many majors and then drop the other one and remember the ap class itself will do nothing for you in college unless you take the exam at the end year and do well on it i e a score of or if you're not planning on taking the ap exams at the end of the year then by all means drop both courses and just take regular english and history Graduate school Grade (education) Education in the United States Advanced Placement Program College admissions Education in Germany Law school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Taiwan Community college Education in Australia SAT Education in Portugal High school Hopkins School National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in Romania A-level GED Juris Doctor Education in Hong Kong Education in Singapore Junior Certificate Medical school Affirmative action Tennis Brown University Ontario Academic Credit Secondary education in the United States Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Secondary education in Japan College The Sims 2: University Law School Admissions Test Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Physical therapy University of California, Los Angeles Hunter College High School University of California, San Diego Education in Sweden University of Central Florida Clements High School University of Michigan Trinity College, Dublin Massachusetts Institute of Technology Caulfield Grammar School Kwantlen University College Lawyer Secondary education in France Education in Canada York University Franklin W.
