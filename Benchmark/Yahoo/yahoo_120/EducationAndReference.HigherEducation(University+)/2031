how much math is required in an economics major i took calculus in grade but failed it i think that was contributed to the fact that i had poor background knowledge of the subject i didn't do any math in grades the teacher gave challenging tests questions often borrowed out of university past papers and i was genuinely a bit slow compared to my peers and couldn't understand what was being taught most of the time now i'm considering a possible major or minor in economics and wondering if i really should pursue it because of my lack of math smartness so to speak i know it's largely a logic based course so i don't know if i can make it especially during my upper years my other career possibility is law majoring in political science but it's a challenging decision because most of my family who have graduated with degrees in science engineering math etc disapprove i don't know what to do i don't mind pursuing economics because i was good at it during high school but will i make it please help econ typically needs calculus at least most of the business related majors do i'd study ahead for calculus and do econ even if you decide to go into law you can do it with an econ major it sounds like you're only picking poly sci so you can go into law school well only pick poly sci if you really love that subject otherwise it's more of a negative than anything in terms of applying to law school it's an easy major so law schools will expect high grades since they get so many poly sci applicants it also has no use once you graduate undergrad holding an econ degree will be useful in getting an internship or law job in the business law area Graduate school Science Mathematics Education in Romania Education in the United States Education Grade (education) Master's degree Logic A-level Education in the People's Republic of China SAT Education in Taiwan California Polytechnic State University Medical school Psychology Polyamory Physics Probability Hunter College High School Philosophy of mathematics No Child Left Behind Act Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Portugal Juris Doctor Law school GED Natural deduction Philosophy College admissions Calculus Western philosophy George Lakoff Affirmative action Professor Academia Jaime Escalante Software engineering Education in Austria Education in France High school Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Predestination Economics Junior Certificate New York State Department of Education Appeal Contract Education in Sweden Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Falsifiability Quizbowl Homeschooling Physician Supernatural Education in Japan American University Game programmer Graduate Record Examination College Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Columbia University Bachelor's degree Scientific method Democracy Augustus De Morgan Test (student assessment) Kripke semantics Nerd Doctor of Philosophy Bayesian inference Teacher Fractional calculus National Certificate of Educational Achievement G__del's incompleteness theorem Second language acquisition Education in Australia Epistemology Education in Malaysia Stuyvesant High School Secondary education in the United States Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
