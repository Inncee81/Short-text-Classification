which degree would you do i have a masters degree already and am thinking of either doing a phd in my field linguistics or a bachelor of laws degree if i do the phd i am pretty much locked into that career even though i love it now it may be better to branch out into a different field i am extremely interested in studying law of course ultimately i have to make up my own mind but what would you do last jedi you don't know i have achieved success with my degrees thus far i don't think you are qualified to respond if i were put into your situation i would go with the bachelor of laws degree it would give me the most chance of success in money and security plus you mentioned that you're interested in law so what a nice little bonus and it's always fun to diversify your education i should know because i'm a current double major in finance and management and see what else is out there too you only make yourself more valuable to any future employer if they see that you're qualified in two areas the bachelor's masters and then the ph d all in the same field inherently narrows your educational scope but whatever path you decide to go in i wish you the best of luck Graduate school Doctor of Philosophy Academic degree Juris Doctor Chinese University of Hong Kong Lawyer Education in Australia Nurse Doctorate Psychology British degree abbreviations Librarian Paralegal Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe University of Notre Dame Georgetown University Software engineering Chess strategy and tactics Education in Portugal Bachelor of Arts Physician Education in Germany Roxette Education in Finland Far Eastern University Philosophy Law school Medical school Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Civil engineering Bologna process Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bachelor's degree Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration Linguistics Education in Japan John Locke Theory of conduct Master of Laws Spice Girls College Florida Institute of Technology Boba Fett NHH Property (ownership right) Science Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution $ale of the Century San Diego State University Philosophy of mathematics Obi-Wan Kenobi Advertising Game show Memorial University of Newfoundland Galactic Civilizations Master of Business Administration Corporate finance Capitalism Western philosophy University of Houston Ball State University Milton H.
