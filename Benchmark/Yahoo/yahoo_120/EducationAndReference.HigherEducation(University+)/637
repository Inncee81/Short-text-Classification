federal and private loans for university i'm just plain confused i paid for my own university cash so i don't understand the process i have fafsa and sallie mae up on my desktop it still is very confusing my daughter's tuition is due sept my husband makes a lot of money but he is her stepfather and i don't work will i still be approved by sallie mae with decent credit will my daughter be approved without a cosigner how long does it take to get results from loan applications through sallie mae how much will they give her somebody take my hand and explain a few things to me because i'm overwhelmed by all the reading material and not knowing what direction to go in i'll have to pay cash if i don't get these loans hello i have a bit of encouragement advice and a warning first given your situation i don't see any problem qualifying as most loan programs are not need or income based as the grant programs are no co signer should be necessary but call sm if you have that q they want your money and are glad to answer your q just fill out the forms asap as it is getting late to try for any loan approvals the deadlines are written on the forms follow the directions and you should be fine the forms are much shorter and easier than in earlier years the loan process used to take months after you sent in the page application with your s the loans are geared to the tuition book and fee costs of the chosen college and vary as such second think carefully about how the loans will have to be repaid by whom how soon and how quickly third i didn't take these last factors into consideration as much as i should have and it has become a burden i may never overcome when you consider the fees interest and other charges all together these are not cheap loans these loans are rife with exclusions and special clauses given to them because of their status as aids to education read everything before you commit for instance in times of unemployment financial difficulty or illness you can forbear your payments for a time yet the interest keeps accumulating it really hits you when you realize that you end up paying back interest on the interest during the forbearance seemingly in exchange for that privilige you cannot include sm loans in a bankruptcy these loans used to expire only after payment in full or the confirmed death of the borrower but i don't know about the latter at this time personally after several recessions layoffs stock market crashes a return to college for a masters a period of disability some positions with less pay than expected or needed and assisting my children and parents with their expenses it is now years into a consolidated year loan mth and i still owe sm the same k that i started with maybe a crystal ball would have helped but i didn't have one of those either just know what you are getting into as i didn't i should have held down another job and had less fun best wishes Mortgage Bond Education in the United States Tuition Credit card Deflation (economics) Insurance Debt Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Taxation in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Economy of Russia Gold standard Annuity Bank Bretton Woods system Government debt Unemployment Monetary policy Social Security (United States) History of the United States (1918-1945) Money Great Depression Microeconomics Interest Article One of the United States Constitution Inflation Mutual fund Stock Federal National Mortgage Association Capitalism Divorce Economy of Pakistan Hyperinflation History of post-Soviet Russia Predatory lending Economy of India Keynesian economics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Unemployment benefit Financial aid Education in Germany Economy of the United States Mortgage-backed security Tertiary education fees in Australia Primerica Financial Services Microcredit Tax Mergers and acquisitions Short selling Lawyer Schabir Shaik Trial Islamic banking Bank fraud Debt consolidation Corporation Leeds United F.C.
