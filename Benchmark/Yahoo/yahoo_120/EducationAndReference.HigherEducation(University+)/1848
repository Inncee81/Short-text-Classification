is this a good semester schedule for me my gpa is i would like to do a whole lot better i had my bad experiences figuringout how college works my freshman year and now im turning it around i had a counselor meeting and it felt good to talk to people about school now i need to take between credits but i think is too little if i want to get out of college in years here is my schedule all credit classes geoscience natural disasters intro to american criminal justice system intro to american politics statistics phil critical thinking class partially computer based i was just going to take classes but than i was pressured by my sis to take another because credits is way to little i want to take more like i have now ill admit im not the smartest person but i study like crazy and things dont work out much would it be wiser to go to credits and play it safe or try for the i have now i think i can handle it but i just dont want to get so overwhelmed i do bad ones and to get the refund for dropped classes is only days after school starts stick with units for now next quarter semester you can jack it up again if you feel you did well also take summer school to catch up on credits or get ahead personally that schedule is very doable but a gpa is pretty low so stick with for now and raise the units the next quarter semester from personal experience stats is pretty easy and shouldn't require too much time but philosophy will eat you up geoscience should be simple i'm sure the politics and justice system classes will take your time up too with readings and other nonsense Theory of conduct Education in Germany Education in Romania Grade (education) Graduate school Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Education in the United States Academic term The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Juris Doctor Lowell High School (San Francisco) American University College admissions The Citadel (Military College) Poker jargon Ethics Baseball Massachusetts Institute of Technology Bernard Williams Princeton University Law school Pretty Good Privacy The Lovely Bones North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Kodocha University of California, San Diego Franklin W.
