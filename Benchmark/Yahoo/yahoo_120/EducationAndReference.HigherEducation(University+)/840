in finance majors are there a lot of classes that require this presentations where you have to speak in front of your entire class in my experience with my finance major you did have classes where you had to speak in front of the class but those were mainly involved with the management courses required for the major in my finance courses i never had to give presentations but in all of my management courses they always had at least one project that involved either a solo or group presentation there were also two speech classes i had to take one regular and one for business and they of course involved speaking in front of the class it's good to have these presentations because they definitely prepare you for some of the requirements within the finance world in my current banking career i have to constantly speak to a small to medium size group of people so having these presentations were a good way to learn how to do them best hope this helps Master's degree Toastmasters International Experiential education Stevens Institute of Technology Education in the People's Republic of China Extreme Programming World Bank Group Education in the United States Paragliding Finance Babson College Minor league baseball Alexander Technique German language Caulfield Grammar School Microcredit Community college Far Eastern University Mergers and acquisitions Construction Corporate finance Education in Hong Kong American University Scientology beliefs and practices Capital accumulation Investment bank United States Army College Hong Kong Police Force Cass Business School, London Model United Nations Physical therapy Primerica Financial Services Current teachings of Prem Rawat Strategic planning Greek language Economic relations of Japan Lecture Master of Business Administration Strategic management Cantonese (linguistics) Standard Cantonese Citigroup Bank Kingston University Dog agility Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Speed reading Japanese tea ceremony Service IB Diploma Programme Drama Massachusetts Institute of Technology Athabasca University Marching band Institutional fund management Nurse Past teachings of Prem Rawat Money laundering Productive and unproductive labour Spanish verbs Hampshire College Contract Consensus decision-making Bah__'__ Faith and Education Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Dubai Grade (education) Mario Kart 64 Church of Scientology Center for Science and Culture Accountancy University of Pretoria Hogwarts subjects Product Lifecycle Management Junior Certificate Total war Pitzer College Education Corporate governance British House of Commons Reform of the United Nations Ferengi Information Technology Infrastructure Library Cooper Union Open University Education in Romania Philosophy of language BAE Systems University of Maryland Baltimore County Indian School of Business Saint Joseph's University Pakistan MIT Sloan School of Management Business Management information system JADE programming language Law school The Apprentice 2 Business performance management
