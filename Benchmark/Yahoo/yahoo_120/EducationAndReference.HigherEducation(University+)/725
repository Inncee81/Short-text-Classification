which university is better asu or ua please help me im debating on which one to go to which do you think is better i agree with the other people that asu is a great school but i would favor ua i am currently a ua student i don't know if you're from arizona but i had a very hard time deciding between these two schools asu definitely has the advantage of being in a bigger city and it has some very strong programs as well in addition asu is more generous with scholarships they offered me about more per year than ua i don't know what you look for in a school we all have our preferences i like ua better because it offers more majors i started out as an undecided it has a more beautiful campus and the fact that it has many more graduate and professional programs with greater endowment sand research expenditures than asu it's the flagship university in arizona there are some great people here and i really loved it of course you can't really go wrong with asu either i think our schools in arizona are very underrated Arizona State University University of Michigan University of Arizona Pennsylvania State University Appalachian State University Stanford University University of Central Florida Duke University University of Toronto Education in the United States Johns Hopkins University Cornell University Boston College Northern Arizona University Education in the People's Republic of China University of Rochester Arkansas State University University of California, San Diego Graduate school York University Georgetown University University of Notre Dame University of Maryland Baltimore County Emory University Columbia University Washington University in St. Louis University of Texas at Austin University of Houston Phoenix, Arizona Tulane University Temple University University of Maryland, College Park Law school University of Connecticut Louisiana State University Affirmative action Academia Ivy League University of Alabama University of Illinois at Chicago Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism Tufts University University of Texas at Dallas School choice Angelo State University Juris Doctor Harvard University Marshall University Purdue University Charter school Halting problem University of Washington Bilkent University Stevens Institute of Technology Baylor University Miami University North Carolina State University University of Hawaii at Manoa University of San Diego Northeastern University, Boston University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill University of Southern California Education in Germany Seneca College University of Wisconsin University of California, Riverside Brown University San Diego State University Vanderbilt University Medical school Students' union University of Hawaii University of California, Berkeley Northwestern University Education in Portugal The Catholic University of America Caulfield Grammar School College University of Chicago Student loan Michigan State University New York University John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004 Scholarship University of Massachusetts Amherst Royal Military College of Canada Reserve Officer Training Corps California Polytechnic State University University of Virginia Aikido University of North Dakota A Painted House Trinity College, Dublin Indiana University Bloomington University of Pittsburgh Indian Institutes of Management Ohio Wesleyan University Software engineering Rice University Florida State University
