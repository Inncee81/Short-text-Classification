what is better mathcad or maple or is matlab better then both i know maple is a great tool it has great graphics capabilities and makes differential equations and such pretty i personally would recommend matlab but that's just me it has so much more power than both mathcad and maple Mathematica Maple computer algebra system Application software Calculator MATLAB Numerical analysis Computer algebra system SciPy Tensor On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Sugar Maple Collaboration Machine learning Field-programmable gate array Maple syrup Great Flag Debate Hello world program Electric guitar Exponentiation GNU Statistics Mare Winningham Prettyprint Recurrence relation Maple Nonlinearity Mie theory Partial differential equation Electroencephalography SAS System Einstein's field equation BMW M5 GNU Octave Euler-Mascheroni constant Sega Dreamcast Geodesy IBM PC compatible Scientific visualization Computer-aided design Calculus Toronto Maple Leafs Maple Town Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace History of computing Trigonometric function Pretty Good Privacy Union Jack Linkage (mechanical) Dimensional analysis Perl Data Language Decision support system Exact solutions in general relativity Personal computer Mathematics Ordinary differential equation Graphics Windows Vista Flowering plant Egon Zakraj__ek William Rowan Hamilton Toei Animation Maple Leaf Gardens Vector graphics editor Atari ST Command line interface Transmission line Geodesic Governor General of Canada Columbia River Gorge Reverse osmosis Tensor product Nondimensionalization Hockey Night in Canada Differential geometry and topology Xbox 360 Computer Mathematics of general relativity Order of Canada Indian English Complex number Four wheel drive Operational amplifier Maple Ridge, British Columbia Division (mathematics) Schr__dinger equation Red Maple Word processor RLC circuit Motion picture rating system Perturbation theory Linear differential equation Chicago Blackhawks Artificial intelligence Windows XP MapleStory Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Multivariate normal distribution Fourth-generation programming language Definitive stamp The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street
