i am a finance major right now but i think i should change it to accounting need advice i am just a junior so the classes i am taking are need in both degrees but i already took financial and managerial acct and i did ok my main problem was the teacher tries to make you remember certain sheets and equations and i am not good at remembering and playing a game of memory on a test i got a b and c in those classes respectively and i am just wondering is it going to get harder and are teachers going to expect me to remember all these minor details i think accounting is much more difficult than finance but than i only took junior level finance courses i don't know why your prof would make you remember the formula because there are not much formulas to remember for accounting anyways though there are procedures you have to take in treating stuff like consolidation lease etc managerial accounting is easy just concept and what you think but higher level financial accounting gets more complicated Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Professor ELO rating system Microeconomics Education in the United States Capitalism Inflation Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Citigroup Secondary education in Japan Education in Portugal Economics Theory of conduct Education in Japan Logic Expert system Reincarnation Strategic management Democracy Grade (education) Finance Personal finance Contract Credit card Code: Lyoko IP (complexity) Health insurance Education in Taiwan Divorce The Sims 2: University Polynomial Scientific method Junior Certificate Education in Hong Kong Price discrimination Voter turnout Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Musical mode College Financial audit Black-Scholes Derivative (finance) Digital circuit General relativity University of Bristol Spreadsheet Monetary policy Aspect-oriented programming Compiler optimization Richard Feynman Mathematics Lyceum of the Philippines Government of France IBM PC compatible Breastfeeding Politics of Canada Debugging Sport in the United Kingdom Economy of Russia Management Charter school Requirements analysis Modern portfolio theory Time Out of Mind Golf Curry-Howard Belief revision Password Quantification GED Dynamical system Credit score Martial art Gross domestic product Surplus value Experiment Volleyball Social rule Quizbowl Education in Austria Information Technology Infrastructure Library Corporate finance Mergers and acquisitions Gold standard Transformation problem National Football League Central processing unit Teacher Capital accumulation Corporate governance Education in Germany Workplace democracy Abstraction (computer science) Education in Romania Grade (climbing) Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Electrophysiology Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Sarbanes-Oxley Act
