becoming a doctor i'm and still in highschool i know i have a long time to decide what i want but i think being a doctor is right in my area i did pretty badly my first two years of highschool because of family problems my dad died kinda takes a toll so i wound up with like a do you still think there's still a chance that if i do very well for the next two years i could still become a doctor do they even really look at highschool when you go into medical school what classes should i take i was good in biology i'm taking chem this year so i don't know how well i'll do i'm good in amth except for geometry i know you have to be good in science do you think i qualify i just really want to help people and the more i've studied it the more i think being a doctor is just what i want to do would i be able to what are some thing i should start looking into or classes i should take what should i expect getting into college is pretty competitive so pay attention to what you are taking starting right away in your admissions essay you will be able to tell your story which will be very compelling get with a school counselor now to get going on strategy on grades courses and maybe even to target colleges you will do regular college before med school so the idea is to map out a strategy now it's ok if you change your mind later on and if you do don't feel bad but if that is what you think you want at this point get it together now to point in the right direction good luck to you i was about when it firmed up in my mind that i wanted to be an architect and i'm now so lucky i knew Education in Romania Medical school Education in the United States Graduate school Physician Education in Germany College admissions Theory of conduct Milton H.
