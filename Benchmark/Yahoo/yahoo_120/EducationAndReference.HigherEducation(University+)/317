what jobs can i get with my accounting degree i recently graduated from college with a bba in accounting i graduated cumme laude sp with a gpa i have found that i no longer have an interest in accounting and am wondering what sort of careers i can get in other fields i would like to get into psychology and am wondering if i would be able to get into this field without having a degree in it i am open to the idea going back to school for a masters but i really need to find a good job that has the salary and benefits that a college degree provides any ideas i am open to pretty much anything that requires a year degree because i don't want to have wasted the last years sources would be great as well anyways thanks for all responses you'll find out once you start interviewing a secret that most undergraduatesd don't fully realize is that after getting the first real professional job for advancement the major becomes less important than having the first degree ask around you will find a high percentage of people after or more years out of university working in areas other than what they originally studied Graduate school Education in Germany Grade (education) Juris Doctor Professor Medical school Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in the United States College Education in the People's Republic of China Community college Chiropractic Affirmative action American football Education in Japan College admissions Academia Master's degree Student loan Software engineering Education in Australia Lawyer Law school Avenue Q Unemployment University of Hawaii at Manoa Microeconomics The College of New Jersey Georgetown University Seneca College Paralegal SAT Master of Business Administration Salary cap University of Central Florida Intelligence quotient Nurse Physician Education in Portugal University of Notre Dame Florida Institute of Technology University of Bristol Science General practitioner Civil engineering Degrees of Oxford University Mach kernel Electrical engineering Athabasca University Parapsychology Anti-intellectualism Johns Hopkins University Doctor of Philosophy Psychology Education in Finland University of Michigan University of Maryland Baltimore County Health insurance University of Connecticut Supply and demand Baruch College Stevens Institute of Technology Doctorate Dentistry Education in Sweden Belmont Abbey College Northeastern University, Boston University of Alabama Biola University Boston College National Football League Advanced Placement Program Alfred Kinsey Librarian Wonderful Town Epistemology Scientology beliefs and practices Architect Baseball Education in the Republic of Ireland Trinity College, Dublin Outsourcing University of North Carolina at Charlotte Drew University Economic inequality Robert Hutchins University of Idaho Washington University in St. Louis American University Macquarie University Second language acquisition Social rule Bates College Ronald Fisher City and Guilds of London Institute Bowdoin College Florida State University Advance fee fraud
