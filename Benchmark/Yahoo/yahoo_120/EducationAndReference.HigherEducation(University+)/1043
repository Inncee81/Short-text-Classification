whats the different between elective courses and minors as far as i know the college sytem goes like major finance years program years minors major riiiiiight so whats eletive classes then the reason im askin this is because i am taking online courses at u of pheonix but im transfering them to u of arizona o i said that ill take math eng mis since thats whats in the sample plan for finance of u of arizoina so i thought i would take them online to save time i called them up they said they'll take math as elective i told them u mean ill have to take them again there when i come they said yes i asked if they dont count as minor or major then whats the point of doing credit hours online well im guessing that elective courses are the extra courses but how come i dont see it says elective in the sample plan anyway s so if i studied hard math online and they count it as an extra class and then il take it again that sucks wouldnt i just be easier it i take history online then trasnfer it i am just saying that since whatever courses i take online will transfer as extra courses so why not i take history since im good at it and transfer as an elective or whatever instead of study hard for math online and take again there since the both get the same results right heres the sample program tell me what coiurses called major n what called minor n what called elective http ugrad eller arizona edu academic majors finance yearplan aspx an elective is a course that you are permitted to choose there are science electives humanities electives physical education electives foreign language electives etc the first years satisfy your core requirements like getting an aa does your major is the group of specific classes that allow you to receive a b a or b s in a specific field art math marine biology etc if you take enough electives in a specific field of study art history for example you might be awarded a minor in art history not all schools do this and the requirements vary from school to school this would be along with your b s in business or whatever see my earlier response to details about applying your online credits to u of a and yes you are better off taking classes that will count for a real elective like history than a class you will need to retake Education in the United States Advanced Placement Program Education in Romania Secondary education in the United States GED Mathematics Master's degree Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Community college A-level SAT Associate's degree Hopkins School Education in Taiwan North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics College Education in Australia Single Transferable Vote Clements High School Kwantlen University College Georgetown University Doctorate Physician Education in Hong Kong Montgomery Blair High School Grade (education) Teen Girl Squad Education Florida State University University of Maryland Baltimore County Secondary education in France Junior Certificate American University NUS High School of Mathematics and Science Northeastern University, Boston Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Medical school Homeschooling College admissions Ontario Academic Credit Johns Hopkins University Cooper Union High school Hampshire College Bah__'__ Faith and Education Juris Doctor Grove City College Education in Singapore Economics Seneca College Bachelor of Arts University of Arizona Chinese University of Hong Kong Scientific method University of Massachusetts Amherst Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stuyvesant High School Gettysburg College Education in Austria Science UCAS Computer PLATO United Kingdom corporation tax Cornell University University of Michigan Gymnasium (Denmark) Hunter College High School University of Connecticut University of Central Florida Florida Institute of Technology University of Scranton Oregon State University Far Eastern University Physical therapy University of Judaism Graduate Record Examination Statistics University at Albany Computer science Columbia College of Columbia University Middle Tennessee State University World Wide Web Professor Savannah College of Art and Design Manifold Voting system Elections in the United States Psychology Columbia University
