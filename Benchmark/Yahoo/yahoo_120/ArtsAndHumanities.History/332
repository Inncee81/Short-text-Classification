did anyone else think attack wasn't as sophisticated as everyone was saying it was i'm not trying to invoke a heated debate or be disrespectful or introduce conspiracy theory but right from the onset the media was saying how well orchestrated the attack was for me having played ms flight simulator yes i know its a game and all but it didn't seem like rocket science to pull off what they did it was sophisticated compared to most terrorist attacks most terrorism is strapping a bomb on some suicidal people and sending them into a crowd or getting a gun and shooting up a crowded location they got people willing to die into the country got them flight training and got them to act in a coordinated way far from their handlers they had to get the airline scheduled so everyone took off before the first crash and on flights that would not be delayed they also had a structural engineer to figure out how to bring the towers down many people still can't understand how a plane could collapse the towers which is why there are so many conspiracy theorist the actual flying the plane into the target was not the hard part United Airlines Flight 93 September 11 researchers Suicide bombing Air India Flight 182 September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks World Trade Center American Airlines Flight 11 Accidents and incidents in aviation Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks B-47 Stratojet Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Ziad Jarrah Space Shuttle Columbia disaster V-1 flying bomb USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Korean Air Flight 007 Pan Am Flight 103 Messerschmitt Bf 109 TWA Flight 800 Aircraft Tenerife disaster Heinkel He 112 USS America (CV-66) Background history of the September 11, 2001 attacks Collapse of the World Trade Center Aircraft hijacking Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Osama bin Laden Fixed-wing aircraft Al-Qaeda 7 July 2005 London bombings Syphon Filter Vietnam Airlines Air traffic control 2005 Bali bombings Kamikaze Tier One Assassination Itavia Flight 870 USS Hancock (CV-19) United Airlines Flight 175 F-14 Tomcat USS Manila Bay (CVE-61) A-10 Thunderbolt II Oplan Bojinka Conspiracy theory Airport (film) USS Forrestal (CVA-59) Boeing 727 Israeli Air Force Saturn V American Airlines Flight 77 Airline USS Wasp (CV-18) P-38 Lightning Jet engine Boeing 747 Ryanair Alternative theories into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Terrorism Messerschmitt Me 262 Theory of conduct Gliding Fighter aircraft Empire Earth II Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Al-Aqsa Intifada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Los Angeles International Airport Pan American World Airways Japanese Red Army Simulation Short Sunderland USS Enterprise (CVN-65) B-26 Marauder Flight simulator SR-71 Blackbird Organizers of the September 11, 2001 attacks Terrorism in Kashmir Air safety Convair B-36 Perfect Dark Scramjet Palestinian political violence Zacarias Moussaoui September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September Ace Combat 5 USS Indianapolis (CA-35) John F.
