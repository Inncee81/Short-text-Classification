most ancient archaeological site in india the stone age in india begins with the paleolithic and terminates after the mesolithic middle stone age the paleolithic dates back to the geological era of middle pleistocene paleolithic sites abound in peninsular india and are found more prominently at pallavaram in tamil nadu hunsgi in karnataka kuliana in orissa didwana in rajasthan and bhimbetka in madhya pradesh the mesolithic sites far outnumber the paleolithic ones and are located all over the country synonymous with the advanced hunting fishing and food gathering economy mesolithic usually corresponds to the immediate post pleistocene or early holocene about years ago period the beginning of the disposal of dead and the formation of band level society also characterised this period the early rock paintings depicting hunting and ritual scenes are the period s most remarkable legacies the neolithic chalcolithic age the neolithic chalcolithic phase that followed the mesolithic culture was marked by remarkable progress in the techniques of agriculture and domestication of animals thus laying down a firm foundation for india s rural life wattle dab houses mushroomed over several village settlements during the rd and nd millennium b c inamgaon and walki in maharashtra navdatoli in madhya pradesh ahar balathal and gilund in eastern rajasthan budhihal sangankalur maski and brahmagiri in karnataka utnur in western andhra pradesh golbai in orissa pandu rajar dhibi in west bengal chirand in bihar and burzoham in kashmir have revealed a distinct neolithic chalcolithic phase in india the ongoing excavation at balathal near udaipur in rajasthan has surprisingly yielded the earliest known village in india so far radiocarbon dated b c indus valley civilisation while the neolithic chalcolithic sites of india were not matured enough to be labelled as civilisations around the same time over the indus and ghaggar river valleys in northwest india bordering pakistan and in kutch and saurashtra in gujarat flourished a civilisation that is referred to today as the indusvalley civilisation it extended over an area that was much larger than any of the other civilisations that were its contemporaries some well known indus cities in india include dholavira kalibangan lothal surkotda and rakhigari its marvelous planning the most outstanding feature of the indus valley civilisation was its unique town planning with well regulated streets oriented almost invariably along the cardinal directions the houses were made of either mud bricks or kiln fired bricks of regulated sizes an average house consisted of a courtyard around which rooms were constructed to live in and carry out various household activities the construction of towns an indus town consisted of two parts the citadel and the lower town each with their respective fortifications the citadel had monumental buildings like the great bath the granary and the assembly hall evidence of civilized economy agro pastoralism was the mainstay of the civilisation s economy besides coastal communities also exploited a wide range of marine life for their subsistence ample evidence to this effect has been found in kuntasi in gujarat the indus valley civilisation was also very well versed in the craft of bead making ceramics and shell its flourishing trade the indus valley civilisation was known for its trade both domestic and foreign its system of weights and measures its written script and religious beliefs the civilisation declined by b c and led to the growth of several fragmented settlements in north india in the upper plains of the river ganges collectively termed as the painted gray ware culture some of its important settlements have been excavated at ahichchatra hastinapura both in western uttar pradesh and purana quila in delhi the excavations were aimed at identifying areas mentioned in the great hindu epics the mahabharata and the ramayana megalithic phase at the time of the painted gray ware settlements in the north south india saw the predominance of the megalithic culture simple monoliths a cluster of stone circles or dolmens usually characterise a megalithic site agro pastoral communities erected these either to commemorate a burial or to depict an actual burial site in kerala the megaliths are mushroom shaped stone objects known as topikal or kodekal excavations conducted in a number of megalithic sites have revealed a substantial amount of artifacts indicative of a pastoral economy warfare and rudimentary trade and exchange between settlements some prominent megalithic sites of south india are found at brahmagiri maski and rajan kalur in karnataka bhagimari in maharashtraand the north and south arcot districts in tamil nadu interestingly the megalithic tradition has continued in certain tribal areas especially among the gadabas of orissa gonds of bastar and the bodosof northeast india who still erect menhirs monoliths as commemorative
