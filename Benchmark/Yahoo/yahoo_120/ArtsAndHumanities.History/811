can someone help me identify an th century depiction of hell i remember seeing either a woodcut or a drawing of a man in the center arms outstretched with the label sensuality above him were angels and below him were lucifer and beezlebub the picture was almost cartoonish does anyone know who drew this or what it might be called i think it must be either late 's or early 's i don't know but if they had to spell it out like that it was probably during those puritanical times when you first described it it reminded me of albrecht durer's harrowing of hell and angel with the key to the bottomless pit or even the conversion of st paul but durer was earlier and never needed to spell things out good luck on your quest Satan Devil Paradise Lost The Lesser Key of Solomon Lucifer Hell Harrowing of Hell RuneScape Daredevil Characters of The Sandman Angel Humphrey Bogart Belial Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Demon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Apocalypse Three Stooges Fallen angel Dolly Parton Jennifer Lopez Saint Peter Playing card Frankie Laine Book of Revelation Diablo II M.C.
