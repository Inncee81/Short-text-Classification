was abraham lincoln against segregation lincoln's support for segregation is not exactly what some try to make it out to be to begin with lincoln certainly did not think of blacks as 'less than human' more on that below and it is an absurd distortion of the emancipation proclamation to say that it didn't free any slaves or that lincoln didn't really care about their being freed he has left a long trail of evidence writings speeches and actions to the contrary now it is true that lincoln for most of his political career though not at the end was a proponent of a particular type of separation one that involved emancipation and colonization of the slave population but more as a solution to a difficult problem to rid the nation of the evil of slavery as well as to give former slaves a chance for a better life it is misleading to simply call this segregation without explanation of his purposes or attitude or without paying any attention to the context in which he lived and acted first note that when we think of segregation we think of animosity and often of a view of some whites that blacks are inferior perhaps not quite fully human and not possessing the same human rights as whites if you look at lincoln's full statements on these matters not just sentences and half sentences ripped out of context you find that from the early s on he argued on numerous occasions that blacks were part of the all men of the declaration of independence and were entitled to the rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that does not mean lincoln had enlightened views about race relations hardly anyone did in his day he appears to have shared the views of his countrymen in opposition for instance to racial intermarriage but the only time he said much about all this was during the lincoln douglas debates when he was seeking to blunt charges from douglas meant to wound him politically that is he was only responding to accusations not advocating his own program several times he disavowed plans to bring about social and political equality between the white and black races but he did not display animosity and in the next breath he would add i have made it equally plain that i think the negro is included in the word men used in the declaration of independence i believe the declaration that all men are created equal is the great fundamental principle upon which our free institutions rest that negro slavery is violative of that principle letter to j u brown oct http www gutenberg org files txt compare the following i have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races there is a physical difference between the two which in my judgment will probably forbid their ever living together upon the footing of perfect equality and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference i as well as judge douglas am in favor of the race to which i belong having the superior position i have never said anything to the contrary but i hold that notwithstanding all this there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness i hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man i agree with judge douglas he is not my equal in many respects certainly not in color perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowments but in the right to eat the bread without leave of anybody else which his own hand earns he is my equal and the equal of judge douglas and the equal of every living man speech at columbus ohio september http www gutenberg org files txt in line with all this lincoln insisted that slavery was a moral evil though one that the constitution did not allow people including the president to simply do away with his solution was that slavery must be contained not allowed to spread in the expectation that this would cause it to die out in the south as it had in the north he also had the notion that if the border states would accept compensated emancipation with the freed slaves being colonized the states then in rebellion seeing this would be open to reconciliation and to a similar plan to bring slavery to an end all these plans however came to an end with the emancipation proclamation once it was finalized on january he never argued for colonization again over the next two years he fought fiercely to guarantee the freedom and basic rights of blacks would be maintained after the war esp by his efforts to gain passage of the th amendment which applied to the whole nation more than that by the end of the war he was advocating that at least some blacks have the right to vote in other words he was now arguing that they ought to have political equality this is a shift from his pre war position note that lincoln always sought a constitutional solution this is why the emancipation proclamation applied only in areas then in rebellion lincoln's only constitutional authority for emancipating slaves was as part of the president's war powers that is as a means to undermine the rebellion he had no authority to emancipate otherwise also the proclamation did free slaves first it secured the freedom of those who had already fled then that of slaves in any territory the union armies were able to prevail in by the end of the war when the th amendment was not yet ratified it had freed slaves in all the confederate states lincoln was concerned that given the evil legacy of slavery blacks could never enjoy equal treatment in the white society that had enslaved them indeed there was something to his concern as seen in the strong southern backlash against reconstruction from black codes to lynchings until it finally fell apart the north losing the political will to continue and freed blacks were forced to live under the jim crow regime to get some idea of why lincoln argued for colonization considering the following quotes if as the friends of colonization hope the present and coming generations of our countrymen shall by any means succeed in freeing our land from the dangerous presence of slavery and at the same time in restoring a captive people to their long lost father land with bright prospects for the future and this too so gradually that neither races nor individuals shall have suffered by the change it will indeed be a glorious consummation from his eulogy on henry clay july http www gutenberg org files txt your race are suffering in my judgment the greatest wrong inflicted on any
