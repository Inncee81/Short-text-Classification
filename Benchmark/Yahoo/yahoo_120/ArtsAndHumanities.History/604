when did europe plung into the dark ages im not good in this area of history some say after the fall of the western roman empire others im one of them might say that it was some time after rome conquered most of europe and people abandoned the need to think like the philosophers did severals decades before the romans had many great achievements like their architecture but they got much of that from conquering the etruscans didnt they they didnt add on to many of their current knowledge because they felt they didnt need to and therefore the emire fell to barbarians when and how did europe plung into the dark ages the romans got all their knowledge from the greeks they added very little to that except for invading europe of course the dark ages started with the fall of the roman empire it was crumbling and could not hold all the restive native tribes fed up with the far away ruler who took their money but did nothing to protect them against invaders neither hold back the invading hordes they fell and pandemonium followed everyone trying to carve his piece of kingdom out of what was left and waves after waves of invasions it was a time when a sword was much more important than a pen most of the writings saved during that time were saved by the churches and abbeys and mostly by the arabs who kept them to be rediscovered later by europe in the later middle age however that period did not last a thousand years charlemagne was reknown because he brought peace to europe gave it back a new legal frame and allowed it to rebuild itself and that was in between and the official end of the middle ages in the famous dark ages europe knew a rebirth there were up and downs but it was still a thriving vibrant society just to give you an example look up the cathedrals built during that time visit medieval museums and look at the beautiful jewelry and statuary and those famous crusades in all couldn't have happened if they hadn't had the money for them crusades were hugely expensive and needed a huge logistic there was money in the middle ages merchants had thriving businesses and sent their merchandises all over europe there was a banking system like the one created by the templars to allow people to travel without carrying all that money on their person there were dark side to that of course serfdom is one it ended around the th century to become peasants taxes and duties there were also famines plagues the terrible black plague wars but those happened throughout history however when the renaissance happened they turned back and pointed at the middle ages and said look at those barbarians who didn't venerate the ancient greeks and romans like we do a truly dark age the name stuck it is only lately that people have started to look further than the name a few things made and created during the black ages the screw glasses to read universities bologna paris oxford in salamanca vienna Middle Ages Byzantine Empire Italian Renaissance History of Europe Crusade Late Middle Ages Western Roman Empire High Middle Ages Jews in the Middle Ages History of Toulouse Sassanid dynasty Ancient Greece History of the Middle East Bologna Celt Renaissance History of Greek and Roman Egypt History of Germany 1270s State Persian Empire History of Rome Bosniaks Reconquista Greco-Bactrian Kingdom Italy in the Middle Ages History of Palestine Black Death History of Greece Rome: Total War Dark Ages Military history of France Chariot racing Western world Military history of the Roman Empire Makuria 1280s Verona France in the Middle Ages Serfdom British monarchy History of Slovakia History of the Netherlands Roman Empire Protestant Reformation Constantinople Roman Britain Roman Republic Jewish history Reims History of Albania Jew Feudalism Sicilian Baroque Parthia Muscovy Ancient warfare Culture of Lithuania Mongol Empire Palermo Eastern Orthodox Church Islamic Golden Age Romania in the Middle Ages History of the World Kievan Rus' Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Academia Avignon Papacy Germanic tribes Hispania Paris History of Russia Holy Roman Empire Byzantine art Ancient Rome Roman law History of Portugal Islamic conquest of South Asia Names of the Greeks Medieval: Total War Gothic architecture History of Finland Aleppo Alans P__cs Novel School of Salamanca
