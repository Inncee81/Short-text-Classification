is there any truth in the allegation that elizabeth i of england was promiscuous i've heard this allegation from two or three spaniards who being what they are fiercely spanish to the bone detest the english queen who humiliated philip ii and his invincible armada they were sympathetic too to catherine of aragon and mary i there is a further allegation that elizabeth knew she was sterile if the spanish assertion is correct would that not explain elizabeth's alleged promiscuity i suppose your two or three spaniards were in the queen's bedchamber and the witnesses of all these elizabethan orgies no honestly do you think it is possible to answer in a serious way elizabeth had favourites such as robert dudley the earl of leicester or later the earl of essex and they may very well have been her lovers too but as for being promiscuous i think she was more interested in power by establishing a firm state religion and organizing a centralized power Elizabeth I of England Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester Henry VIII of England Mary I of England Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex Lettice Knollys Anne Boleyn Philip II of Spain Anne of Great Britain Mary I of Scotland Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham Francis Drake Catherine Carey Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Lady Mary Boleyn James I of England History of England Lady Frances Brandon Charles II of England British monarchy William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley Robert Dudley, styled Earl of Warwick Lady Catherine Grey Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey Elizabethan era Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork Black Legend Earl of Leicester Isabella of Castile George I of Great Britain Edward VI of England Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex Royal Assent Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick Anglo-Spanish War (1585) Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex History of the British constitution Marie Antoinette Richard III of England Robert Walpole John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland Thomas Wyatt the younger Edward II of England John Foxe War of the Spanish Succession Jacobitism Royal Navy Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford Henry VII of England William Cardinal Allen Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk Promiscuity Lady Jane Grey Philip Sidney House of Bourbon Mary, Queen of Scots (film) Succession to the British Throne Catherine Parr Catherine of Aragon Order of precedence in England and Wales Catholic Church in Great Britain Ferdinand II of Aragon Charles I of England Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough Tudor dynasty Plame affair Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon Walter Raleigh The Other Boleyn Girl John Perrot Stephen Gardiner Spain Henry Sidney Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Habsburg Spain Robert I of Scotland Eighty Years' War James II of England Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke Spanish Inquisition Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby Victoria of the United Kingdom Christopher Marlowe Lord Guilford Dudley John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville The Da Vinci Code Style of the British Sovereign Robert Crowley (printer) Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles Thomas More The Country Wife John Dee Matthew Parker Anglicanism
