what is the mystery behind king tut if you are speaking of the curse it is more or less added for drama like in many other cases a good mystery always makes things more interesting although a number of people including a bird died after the opening of the tomb the deaths were spread out over many years if there were really curses then finding a tomb that had not been robbed would not be an exception what made the finding of king tut's tomb so amazing was that it had not been robbed so many other tombs were robbed that the priests actually removed many of the pharaoh's mummies and hid them away in a mass tomb later discovered by archaeologists the main mystery behind king tut was how he died some have said it was murder either through a physical assault or by poison recent research has also indicated another possibility the pharaoh's were expected to master certain skills in driving a chariot injuries to the body of king tut are consistent with a serious fall from a chariot if so it is possible that an infection caused by the injuries specifically a severely broken bone in his leg ended his life as medical knowledge was somewhat limited back then infections were often fatal the bad break that he would have suffered would probably have led to one or more infections and possibly a blood clot each capable of ending his life one answer mentions an abcess tooth which is also possible i have not heard of that but a recent show on the search for the mummy of a queen of egypt used a tooth contained in a burial urn to identify her they were able to match the tooth which had part of the root missing to the part of the tooth left in the mummies mouth based upon the tooth they believe that she died from an infection due to an abcess in the tooth that had been pulled when the tooth was pulled the abcess broke and an infection spread through her body ultimately causing her death Valley of the Kings Mummy Archaeology Curse of the Pharaohs Nefertiti Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hatshepsut Resurrection of Jesus Kain (Legacy of Kain) History of ancient Egypt Hyksos Chariot Howard Carter Funeral Episodes of Lost (Season 1) John F.
