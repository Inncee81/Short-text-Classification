why do we care hitler's music collection turns up in dead russian soldier's attic berlin adolf hitler the most notorious champion of richard wagner and racially pure german music banished jewish and russian musicians from the concert halls of the third reich but apparently listened secretly to their work new light has been shed on the nazi leader s musical tastes by the discovery of what are said to be a hundred of his gramophone records found in the attic of a former soviet intelligence officer lev besymenski there were classical recordings performed by the best orchestras of europe and germany with the best soloists of the age mr besymenski said in a document explaining how the records came into his possession the year old who helped to interrogate captured nazi generals died this summer the document and the record collection have now been made available to der spiegel magazine because it shows us that everyone even hateful old hitler is all too human susceptible to the grasping tentacles of hypocrisy we make him out to be a villain and he truly is but tend to downplay the fact that he's not completely the disgusting bigoted man he's portrayed which certainly doesn't lessen the horribleness of his actions and crimes we can however take away from this article a very important lesson at his essence every man is the same prey to the same desires and demons as his fellows there are some things we can't forgive but as a compensation not to mention precaution we can always try to understand why something happened that's why we analyze history so much knowing the motives for an individual nation's actions helps us make better decisions when interacting with someone else under similar circumstances clearly hitler did not believe in the falsehoods he and the propaganda arm of his government was propagating that tells us he's not much different from the next man and not completely mad from this we can infer that he would also suffer from the same weaknesses as the next man greed for power fame etc and so on and so forth cheers Adolf Hitler Heinrich M__ller Nazi Germany Propaganda Gestapo Holocaust denial President of Germany The Holocaust Richard Wagner Eastern Front (World War II) Waffen-SS Nazism National Socialist German Workers Party Schutzstaffel Max Planck World War II Fatherland (novel) Nazi architecture Parsifal Hogan's Heroes Operation Barbarossa Andreas Hillgruber Battle of the Bulge History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union Red Army Anschluss Joachim von Ribbentrop Weimar Republic Pope Pius XII Battle of Berlin History of the Jews in Germany Rudolf Hess Continuation War Beer Hall Putsch Anti-Semitism Wehrmacht Heinrich Himmler Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact Ernst Z__ndel Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Hitler's death Erich von Manstein Appeasement David Irving Magda Goebbels The Bunker Historical revisionism (political) Richard Strauss Patriotism Karl D__nitz Racial policy of Nazi Germany Paul von Hindenburg Anton Bruckner End of World War II in Europe War Neo-Nazism Expulsion of Germans after World War II Martin Heidegger Mystique (comics) Joseph Goebbels Germany Occupation of Czechoslovakia Grammy Award Friedrich Nietzsche Daniel Barenboim Albert Speer Racism Adolf Eichmann Alfred Rosenberg Mein Kampf Arnold Schoenberg Music New anti-Semitism Polish September Campaign Music of Germany Central Intelligence Agency Ethnic cleansing Hitler in popular culture Pursuit of Nazi collaborators Axis Powers Military history of the Soviet Union Hitler's political beliefs Goodness and value theory ODESSA Hermann G__ring History of Germany Grunge music Sant Thakar Singh The Great Dictator British Free Corps
