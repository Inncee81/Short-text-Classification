what were some of the reasons for the rwanda genocide of well basically i want to know what the reasons for the rwanda genocide were if anyone knows what happened then please help me out your generosity will be rewarded with the best answer being chosen at the end giving you some points i am not sure but i think that the tutsi tribe oppressed the hutu tribe and eventually the hutu rebelled however im not sure so please help the tutsi and the hutus had always a rivalry but this was exacerbated by their coloniser belgium and to a lesser extent germany the belgians saw the tutsis as a superior people and so gave them favourable treatment over the hutu majority many tutsis formed a sort of african aristocracy in the colony the better jobs and education provided for tutsi fostered resentment among the hutus which sparked riots and rebellions in many tutsis were killed and many fled to neighbouring countries the puppet monarchy of rwanda which had a tutsi king was overthrown rwanda was decolonised in and the majority hutus took power playing on the resentment built up over the years the hutu government would routinely use the tutsis as scapegoats and this wasespecially true for the economic crisis that occurred prior to the genocide the hutu government also prevented the tutsis who had fled in from returning to their homeland this tutsi dispora formed a militia the rwanda patriotic front based in neighboring uganda to fight for their right to return president habyarimana used the threat of the rpf as a pretext to harass tutsis as potential collaborators the popular magazine kangura played up this threat as well as producing more anti tutsi racist propaganda the radio station radio t l vision libre des mille collines though nominally independent was materially supported by the government also spewed sensationalist popaganda that help create a charged racist atmosphere all that was needed was a trigger that came when the hutu president of rwanda juv nal habyarimana was assasinated when his private jet was shot down hutus blamed the rpf and this led to a wave of reprisals by hutus troops and paramilitaries this soon gathered pace and became the rwandan genocide United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Rom__o Dallaire Burundi Refugee Zaire Africa Pasteur Bizimungu Arusha Accords Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo Consequences of the Rwandan Genocide Initial events of the Rwandan Genocide Democratic Republic of the Congo Agathe Uwilingiyimana Mobutu Sese Seko Butare Analysis of the causes of the Rwandan Genocide Economy of Rwanda Darfur conflict History of Africa Genocides in history Death squad Protais Zigiranyirazo Cyprien Ntaryamira Racism Hamitic Sabena Caste Banyamulenge Laurent-D__sir__ Kabila Kosovo War Politics of Burundi Th__odore Sindikubwabo Ethnic cleansing Criticisms of Christianity Abkhazia Congolese Rally for Democracy Michel Micombero Hotel Rwanda Ruanda-Urundi Th__oneste Bagosora Bibliography of the Rwandan Genocide World War II History of the Netherlands Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda Charles de Gaulle History of Modern Greece Bukavu World War I History of Lithuania International Criminal Court Anti-communism Yugoslavia Francophobia Adolf Hitler Ituri Conflict Belgium Weimar Republic Lord's Resistance Army British Empire History of Sudan Foreign relations of the Democratic Republic of the Congo William Perry Democracy Second Sudanese Civil War Christopher Black Military history of Canada Texas Revolution Vietnam War Economy of Africa History of Poland (1795-1918) Decolonization History of Lebanon Arab-Israeli conflict 2003 Invasion of Iraq Saddam Hussein American Revolution Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Robert Mugabe Kurdish people
