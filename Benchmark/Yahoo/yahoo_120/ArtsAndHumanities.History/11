blitzkrieg where were the allies air forces when germany attacked in the west on may the air forces of the allies french british belgians dutch had a substantial combined numerical superiority over the luftwaffe certainly the luftwaffe's aircraft were generally superior plane to plane but the luftwaffe totaled bombers and fighters the total air forces' strength of the allies was bombers and fighters yet on the western front the only place that mattered the luftwaffe enjoyed an almost numerical advantage germany bombers fighters allies bombers fighters i know that the raf held much of its strength back in britain for home defence and both france and britain presumably deployed aircraft for imperial defense in the middle east india se asia etc were the allies so sure that hitler would never dare to attack on the western front that they squandered their aerial numerical superiority in pointless deployments elsewhere some excellent answers but for those that think i was ignoring poland that campaign had finished more than months previously many of the french planes were destroyed on the ground others were busy retreating to airfields that were not threatened quite a lot were in north africa and many more headed there during the biltzkreig however the main problems were organisational the campaign moved far too quickly for the allied command and control structures and the decisive point for the air war was where the stukas were and by the time the allied commanders knew where that was the stukas had moved on as had the blitzkreig only the germans had developed a doctrine of using close air support as flying artillery in support of ground forces and since they didn't understand the doctrine the allies hadn't developed any counter to it another other key factor was the pilots the germans had many experienced pilots who'd flown in spain spanish civil war and then in the polish campaign World War II Fighter aircraft Royal Air Force Arm__e de l'Air (Part I: From birth to "Torch", 1909-1942) European Theatre of World War II P-51 Mustang Battle of the Bulge Battle of Kursk RAF Bomber Command Norwegian Campaign Battle of Normandy Heinkel He 112 Polish Air Force Technology during World War II Operation Barbarossa Battle of Crete Strategic bombing Namsos campaign Participants in World War II British Home Guard The Blitz Messerschmitt Me 262 Polish contribution to World War II Burma Campaign History of radar Western Front (World War II) Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain Royal Canadian Air Force Aircraft carrier Napoleonic Wars Operation Market Garden Continuation War Siege of Warsaw (1939) Second Battle of the Atlantic RAF Fighter Command United States Air Force USS Wasp (CV-18) Imperial War Museum Duxford Middle East Theatre of World War II Tunisia Campaign Battle of Berlin Australian 8th Division Aleksandr Ivanovich Pokryshkin History of Poland (1939-1945) Dieppe Raid Western betrayal South-East Asian Theatre of World War II Heinkel He 162 Royal Australian Air Force Dive bomber World War I Messerschmitt Bf 109 Ground attack aircraft Bomber Command Erich von Manstein Japanese strategic planning for the Pacific (1905-1940) Polish-Soviet War B-29 Superfortress Kamikaze Heinkel He 111 4th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Brigade Nederland Aviation in World War I Wehrmacht History of the British Army Operation Torch History of Germany during World War II B-24 Liberator Eastern Front (World War II) Terror bombing Hawker Hurricane Battle of Midway Middle East Campaign Supermarine Spitfire Awards and decorations of Nazi Germany Operation Downfall War of the Austrian Succession Battle of Iwo Jima P-47 Thunderbolt Imperial Japanese Navy Six-Day War W__adys__aw Sikorski Irish neutrality USS Yorktown (CV-10) Battle of Singapore
