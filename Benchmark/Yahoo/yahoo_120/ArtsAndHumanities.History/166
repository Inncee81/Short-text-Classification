what are the basic beliefs of confucianism i dont want to know what it is and who developed it i just want to know about the beliefs although confucianism is often followed in a religious manner by the chinese arguments continue over whether it is a religion confucianism lacks an afterlife its texts express complex and ambivalent views concerning deities and it is relatively unconcerned with some spiritual matters often considered essential to religious thought such as the nature of the soul confucius' principles gained wide acceptance primarily because of their basis in common chinese tradition and belief he championed strong familial loyalty ancestor worship respect of elders by their children and according to later interpreters of husbands by their wives and the family as a basis for an ideal government he expressed the well known principle do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself similar to the golden rule he also looked nostalgically upon earlier days and urged the chinese particularly those with political power to model themselves on earlier examples the superior man seeks for it in himself the petty man seeks for it in others because no texts survive that are demonstrably authored by confucius and the ideas associated with him most closely were elaborated in writings that accrued over the period between his death and the foundation of the first chinese empire in bce many scholars are very cautious about attributing specific assertions to confucius himself edit ethics the confucian theory of ethics is based on three important concepts at the time of confucius l referred to the three aspects of life ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types social and political institutions and the etiquette of daily behavior it was believed by some that l originated from the heavens confucius's view was more nuanced his approach stressed the development of l through the actions of sage leaders in human history with less emphasis on its connection with heaven his discussions of l seem to redefine the term to refer to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony in the early confucian tradition l though still linked to traditional forms of action came to point towards the balance between maintaining these norms so as to perpetuate an ethical social fabric and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good these concepts are about doing the proper thing at the proper time and are connected to the belief that training in the l that past sages have devised cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when l must be adapted in light of situational contexts in early confucianism y and l are closely linked terms y can be translated as righteousness though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context the term contrasts with action done out of self interest while pursuing one's own self interest is not necessarily bad one would be a better more righteous person if one based one's life upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good an outcome of y this is doing the right thing for the right reason y is based upon reciprocity just as action according to l should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to y so y is linked to the core value of r n r n is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others most often translated as benevolence or humaneness translator arthur waley calls it goodness with a capital g and other translations that have been put forth include authoritativeness and selflessness confucius's moral system was based upon empathy and understanding others rather than divinely ordained rules to develop one's spontaneous responses of r n so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of y to cultivate one's attentiveness to r n one used another confucian version of the golden rule one must always treat others just as one would want others to treat oneself virtue in this confucian view is based upon harmony with other people produced through this type of ethical practice by a growing identification of the interests of self and other in this regard confucius articulated an early version of the golden rule what one does not wish for oneself one ought not to do to anyone else what one recognises as desirable for oneself one ought to be willing to grant to others confucius and confucianism richard wilhelm edit politics confucius' political thought is based upon his ethical thought he argues that the best government is one that rules through rites l and people's natural morality rather than by using bribery and coercion he explained that this is one of the most important analects if the people be led by laws and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments they will try to avoid the punishment but have no sense of shame if they be led by virtue and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety they will have the sense of shame and moreover will become good translated by james legge the great learning this sense of shame is an internalization of duty where the punishment precedes the evil action instead of following it in the form of laws as in legalism while he supported the idea of government by an all powerful sage ruling as an emperor probably because of the chaotic state of china at his time his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers he argued for according language with truth thus honesty was of paramount importance even in facial expression truth must always be represented in discussing the relationship between a subject and his king or a son and his father he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors this demanded that the inferior must give advice to his superior if the superior was considered to be taking the wrong course of action this was built upon a century after confucius's death by his latter day disciple mencius who argued that if the king was not acting like a king he would lose the mandate of heaven and be overthrown therefore tyrannicide is justified because a tyrant is more a thief than a king other confucian texts though celebrating absolute rule by ethical sages recognize the failings of real rulers in maxims such as an oppresive government is more feared than a tiger some well know confucian quotes when you have faults do not fear to abandon them what you do not wish for yourself do not do to others with coarse rice to eat with water to drink and my crooked arm for a pillow is not joy to be found therein riches and honors acquired through unrighteousness are to me as the floating clouds cited from www wikipedia org it is also interesting to know that during his life confucian was banned and outlawed by the first emperor of china who is accredited for forming and creating china into one nation from independent minor dynasties
