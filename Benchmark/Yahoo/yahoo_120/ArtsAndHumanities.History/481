why was the code of conduct significant in the han dynasty the han empire began in bc when liu bang prince of the han defeated the qin army in the valley of the wei the defeat was part of a larger rebellion that began after the first emperor's death the people were dissatisfied with the tyranny of the qin leaders and their legalist form of government however while chinese history portrays the han as having implemented many changes to the government evidence shows that the han continued to rule in the tradition of the qin only gradually incorporating confucian ideals into their legalist form of government economic expansion changing relationships with the people of the steppes strengthening the palace at the expense of the civil service weakening the state''s hold on the peasantry and the rise of the rich and the gentry were all factors that led to the adoption of confucian ideals under this new form of legalism and confucianism rewards and punishments were still used for the common people however the administrators were judged according to confucian principles with the justification for these different sets of standards as they were educated as a last resort the ruler could use punishment for both the people and the officials it was believed that force alone was not sufficient enough to rule so the emperor needed the help of the confucians to guide him morally evidence of rulers using power to punish is found in records of beheaded officials the han dynasty actually consists of two separate dynasties it is considered as one dynasty by the chinese because the second dynasty was founded by a member of the former han dynasty who declared that he had restored the han dynasty the original han dynasty was overthrown when wealthy families gained more power than the emperor the families became allies through marriage and were responsible for the selection of officials the widow of emperor y andi succeeded in placing all of her relatives in government and ruled in place of her son her nephew wang mang eventually declared himself emperor of a new dynasty the xin new his rise as emperor is unusual because he gained much public support and began the ceremony where a seal of the precious stone was passed to the emperor from then on whoever held the seal was the official emperor wang was overthrown by a secret society of peasants known as the red eyebrows they painted their eyebrows red descendents of the han eventually joined in the uprising and it was the armies of these nobles under the leadership of liu xiu who killed wang in the year the fighting continued until the year when liu became emperor as emperor liu was called emperor guang wudi millions of people died during the fighting leaving land behind for peasants and often freedom from debt as lenders passed away Chimei Yuan Dynasty Qin Shi Huang Ruzi Ying Emperor Ai of Han Xiao He Ming Dynasty Three Kingdoms L__lin Emperor Ling of Han Cao Cao Emperor Ping of Han Qing Dynasty Chinese nobility Taoism Emperor of Japan Emperor Cheng of Han Military history of China Liu Yan Romance of the Three Kingdoms Han Xin Guan Yu Warring States Period Traditional Chinese law Zhang Liang Joseon Dynasty Chinese surname Emperor Ming of Han Zhuge Liang Emperor of China Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period Liu Bei Cultural Revolution Emperor Zhao of Han Empress Dowager Cixi Spring and Autumn Period Han Zhao Chinese sovereign Buddhism in China Personages of the Three Kingdoms Empress Wang (Ping) Emperor Emperor An of Han L__ Clan Disturbance Qin (state) British monarchy History of Korea Emperor Huan of Han Mughal Empire Tokugawa shogunate Hongwu Emperor Yongle Emperor Edo period House of Bourbon Zhao Yun Emperor Wen of Han Empress Guo Shengtong Confucius Emperor Zhang of Han Taiping Rebellion Chinese art Ge Hong Huo Guang Consort Fu Fujian History of Poland (1795-1918) Emperor Hui of Han Emperor He of Han Jiangsu Empress Wu People's Republic of China Politics of the People's Republic of China Chiang Kai-shek Wu Hu Emperor Jing of Han Henry VIII of England Kamakura period Chinese Civil War Emperor Yi of Chu Muscovy
