when did cannon balls first contain explosives at first cannon balls were just solid and the ball itself did the damage at some point explosives were added so that the explosion could cause more damage when and how did this come about there is a great difference between the old fashioned solid iron cannon balls and the shells which guns fling among the enemy today the cannon ball was a very harmless thing so long as it did not hit anyone but a shell explodes among the enemy and may kill many who are at some distance from it solid cannon balls were replaced by explosive shells some four or five hundred years ago so in the early 's solid cannon balls were replaced by explosive shells the early explosive shell was an empty ball of cast iron these early shells had a hole such as a barrel has and through this hole the shell was filled with gunpowder and small pieces of metal the hole was then closed by a plug of slow burning powder which when lighted would require a certain number of seconds to elapse before the flame could reach the gunpowder in the shell Cannon Shell (projectile) Firearm Ammunition Hand grenade Bullet Terminal ballistics Artillery Team Fortress Classic Blood (computer game) Naval mine Explosive material GunBound Gun barrel Items in the Metroid series Field Artillery in the American Civil War Cartridge (firearms) Casting Shotgun Gunpowder Gunpowder Plot Worms weapons and tools Doom enemies R-Type Machine gun Combine (Half-Life 2) Battleship Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items The Legend of Zelda series enemies Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Firework Spark plug Unreal Glossary of nautical terms Mortar (weapon) Trench warfare Air gun Anti-aircraft warfare Drill bit Metal Slug Turok: Dinosaur Hunter Shrapnel USS Thresher (SS-200) Fireworks RuneScape weapons Shotgun shell Terran (StarCraft) Weapon Protoss Battle of Jutland Messerschmitt Bf 109 Springfield 1903 rifle Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Railgun Airsoft USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Star Wars: Battlefront Early modern warfare High explosive anti-tank USS Trigger (SS-237) Battle of Hampton Roads Half-Life: Opposing Force M16 (rifle) Super Metroid Piccolo Junior Saga Nuclear explosion Global Liberation Army Tribes 2 Shadow Warrior Smokeless powder Battle of Lissa (1866) USS Tunny (SS-282) MegaMan Battle Network 5 Solar cell USS West Virginia (BB-48) T-72 Ko shogi Supernova Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Half-Life Handloading Fire extinguisher Steel M61 Vulcan USS Wahoo (SS-238) Carburetor Pinball Airbag Starsiege: Tribes Blank (cartridge) Tire
