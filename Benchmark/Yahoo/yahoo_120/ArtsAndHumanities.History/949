why didn't the allies reverse engineer the german mm gun if the allies feared the wouldn't it make sense to copy a captured example and then deploy it against the germans the german mm proved so devastating to allied tanks that there was indeed debate at the time about reverse engineering it the reasons why that never happened seem to boil down to a the mm at least in its early versions wasn't actually as good an aa gun than the british inch aa nor than the american mm moreover on the few occasions when they were employed in a ground to ground role including at fire against panzers those guns proved very effective indeed b so from an artillery engineering perspective the german mm really wasn't enything special and certainly did not warrant the disruption to allied manufacturing production lines that would have been involved in producing copies of it in reality the mm got its well deserved reputation as an at super gun not because it was so very much better than anything that the allies had but because the wehrmacht used it so much more intelligently as early as in the western desert british tank men began crying out for the deployment of heavy at guns in the same way as the afrika korps was using the mm they even got the ear of winston churchill himself in october churchill stated that auchinleck's th army hoped 'to deploy over heavy mobile anti aircraft guns exclusive of those in tobruk and he wrote a memo to his generals saying every mobile aa gun should carry a plentiful supply of solid armour piercing tracer shot suggesting that they use the in the same way that the germans used the mm all to no avail the horrible truth is that the german army was much more adept at tactical combined arms integration than the allies rommel and others understood very well how to coordinate mobile panzers with much less mobile at guns allied generals ok just possibly excepting patton did not manage to do that effectively even if the allies had exact copies of the mm they would probably have failed to use it effectively for more on this topic i commend the following websites and forums World War II Battle of France Military history of Egypt during World War II M4 Sherman Tank classification Battle of Normandy Armoured warfare Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Polish September Campaign Battle of the Bulge Tiger I Tunisia Campaign Anti-aircraft warfare Panzer I Battle of the Kasserine Pass Tank Panzer II Battle of Gazala Scots Guards (1914) Norwegian Campaign German armoured fighting vehicles of World War II Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein Tank destroyer German 33rd Infantry Division Patton tank Battle of Kursk Operation Barbarossa Operation Market Garden T-34 Ammunition Operation Crusader European Theatre of World War II History of the British Army Richard O'Connor Erich von Manstein British Commandos Trench warfare History of the tank Deutsches Afrikakorps Panther tank Special Air Service United States Marine Corps Panzer 38(t) Irish Guards Operation Torch Technology during World War II Battle of Berlin Operation Battleaxe British Home Guard Artillery Indian Army P-51 Mustang British Army MS-06 Zaku II 2nd Canadian Infantry Division M60 machine gun Ultra Brandenburgers Structure of the British Army Battle of Mokra German Panzer Lehr Division Airborne forces Eastern Front (World War II) Chindits Panzer IV Battlefield 2 Churchill tank Battle of the Somme (1916) Claude Auchinleck Battle of Debrecen Mechanized infantry B-24 Liberator First day on the Somme German Army Luftwaffe Allied invasion of Sicily German Panzer Army Afrika Anti-tank M3 Lee Western Desert Campaign History of Poland (1939-1945) Dieppe Raid North African Campaign Battle of Kock (1939) Mark I (tank) Panzer III V-1 flying bomb Burma Campaign 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend Gulf War Royal Air Force Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign Kamenets-Podolsky Pocket
