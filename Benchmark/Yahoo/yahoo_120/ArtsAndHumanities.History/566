confederate flag i'm curious as to why the confederate flag is equated with slavery and racism slavery only became illegal after the civil war many northern statesmen owned slaves right through the war also the civil war was never fought about slavery look it up it was fought over state's rights and taxation without representation slavery only became an issue towards the end of the war i don't get it any iseas i would tend to agree with you and as an englishman i guess i can be termed as a nuetral party on the subject i don't think the issue is about what the civil war was fought over i just think that many people feel that due to the confederacy's pro slavery stance war or no war the battle flag represents a racist view in the same way as a nazi swastika personally i don't agree i believe that southerners still fly the flag because they still hold a sense of identity and independance and i believe they should have this right just as texas still flies the lonestar flag which represents their status as a republic and the hawaiian flag that still carries a union jack in the upper right canton wasn't the united states founded on among other things a principle of freedom of expression the battle flag should be looked on as an expression of that many a crime has been commited under the british flag and no one thinks twice about it the same with the us flag but for instance many a native american will fly 'old glory' with pride flags represent nations as a whole not the actions of a nation Confederate States of America Slavery Mexican-American War Flags of the Confederate States of America American Civil War Nazism African American Southern United States History of the United States Democratic Party (United States) United States History of slavery in the United States United States Senate Libertarianism Republican Party (United States) History of the Southern United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Union Jack Flag of the United States Civil rights Abolitionism United States House of Representatives Robert E.
