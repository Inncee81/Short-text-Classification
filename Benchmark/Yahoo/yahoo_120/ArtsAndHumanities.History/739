it when bobby is driving back to the castle he is kidnapped by some mysterious people wearing black and is taken to an underground hideout he finds out that they are a secret team called the revivers and that their goal is to save quillan from the control of blok and make it a free territory again nevva is one of them they want bobby to compete in the grand x in order to stir the majority of the people into a revolt against blok to help convince bobby to make this choice they show him to a top secret hidden library they call mr pop which contains the history of quillan bobby finally agrees and is sure that his decision will be the turning point for quillan and will save the territory bobby turns himself in to laberge and veego then immediately starts competing in the grand x against a champion called challenger green during the game bobby learns some astonishing secrets he learns that laberge and veego are from the territory of veelox but were taken here by saint dane he also learns that saint dane has taken them to many different territories including cloral eelong and zadaa and got the ideas for some of their games from those territories in the end bobby wins not only the game but also the hearts of the people and they start revolting against blok just like bobby and the revivers wanted however just when he thinks the territory of quillan is saved he is captured by saint dane and finds out that nevva had been with saint dane all along he then learns that though both of them were blindfolded nevva gave away the location of the huge library since she carried a bug to mr pop which the dados would later incinerate bobby loses the territory of quillan to saint dane he also learns that challenger green was really saint dane in disguise saint dane also mentions something called the convergence which he believes is inevitable nevva reveals that she will probably become the traveller for ibara since remudi is dead nevva and saint dane escape and it is revealed
