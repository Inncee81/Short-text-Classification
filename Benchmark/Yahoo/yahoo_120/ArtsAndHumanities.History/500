did some ancient civilizations have technology in advance to what we have today and is our civilization rediscovering some of this lost technology examples i have read about include models of delta wing aircraft found in the tombs of the pharoahs the mahabarata speaking of great battles in the sky with flying machines the lines at nazca in peru only visible from high heights but nazca is flat with no hills there are people who consider it possible that there have been advanced civilizations which somehow were obliterated from the earth and mankind had to begin all over again not an unreasonable theory in my opinion many years ago when my father was a young man he spent a lot of time in the middle east among the archaeological finds of ancient babylonia was a peculiar item that nobody could figure out my father who was an aeronautical engineer believed that it was an electroplating machine naturally his idea was poo pooed the machine was stored in a basement somewhere it was recently rediscovered and the experts now say that it is an electroplating machine they are at a loss to understand how it fit into the scheme of things but if in fact the babylonians were more advanced than is generally believed it is likely that they had other machinery which unfortunately has not survived plato wrote of the hyperboreans who flew in silver bird like contraptions the birds were fed on a special nectar eventually the nectar ran out and the birds flew no more plato was not considered to be a writer of fiction many ancient texts such as parts of the old testament and the epic of gilgamesh suggest that the writers of those works came into contact with things they did not understand and could not explain and some scholars believe these confusing writings may be the result of someone coming into contact with advanced technological creations you may draw your own conclusions from these things i've always believed that one should keep an open mind everything should be carefully considered evidence may be interpreted in different ways lack of evidence does not mean something did not exist or happen but where there is a lack of evidence we must not jump to conclusions i have studied history for more than years and during that time much history has had to be rewritten as new evidence comes to light i think your question is one of the most thought provoking to have appeared on this site keep studying Unidentified flying object Plato Creationism Origin belief Extraterrestrial hypothesis Historicity of Jesus Socrates Noah's Ark Chronology of the Ancient Near East Book of Mormon Devil God Supernatural Biblical inerrancy History of creationism Flood geology Scientific method Trinity Archaeology Evolution Hipparchus (astronomer) Mythology Troy Religion The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Aristotle Bible Human Atomism Young Earth creationism Philosophy of language Maya civilization Geometry Gospel of Thomas Science Sexual orientation Leo Strauss Library of Alexandria Roswell UFO incident Berossus Nontrinitarianism Immortality Ancient Egypt Elam Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Abduction Phenomenon Urantia Abraham Stone Age History of astrology El (god) Gospel of John Resurrection of Jesus Western philosophy Soul Fermi paradox Bah__'__ Faith and Science Deconstruction Great Pyramid of Giza Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Kabbalah Nazca Lines Aryan invasion theory The Origin of Species Celt Franz Boas Ancient history Solar system Philosophy of mathematics David Hume Sumer Sociocultural evolution Luminiferous aether Anglo-Saxons Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Species New Chronology (Fomenko) Judaism Creation according to Genesis Jacob Neusner Acts of the Apostles Abrahamic religion Yeshu Martin Heidegger Penda of Mercia
