internet and bandwidth when the internet applications etc leave's my companies building does it actually travel through cable to the isp or through t lines how fast are the packers moving dont they crash through cable dont cables have like cables inside for internet for video and for etc i hope i make sense thanks regarding the first question this will all depend on how much bandwidth the company has agreed to pay and what type of isp infrastructure is available in the area such as microwave wireless satellite atm or t t yes if the bandwidth required exceeds that of a t mb s multiple t s can be bundled to equal a fractional t a t has the capacity mb s and regardless of the prefix both ride on the same dedicated physical cable t s are commonly subdivided and leased as fractional t s or as multple t s it is the equipment provided by the isp that throttles the available bandwidth to thier clients another example would be cable internet which a group of houses may share the same physical link for catv telphone and internet access the speed between some links can handle an aggregate load exceeding gb s and they are currently experimenting with gb s when data is sent packets do crash here and there but there are rules in place to reduce this the two most common practices are collision avoidance and collision detection collision avoidance systems either require the sender to have a special ticket to send or before sending ask for clearance to send it will then wait until it receives the special ticket or receives a clear to send response collision detection systems first check the line for activity before sending they do not wait for a clearance response but listen for the line to clear some times it isn't clear when they send and this causes a collision when this happens both ends will back off for a random amount of time before resending lastly it is physically possible to have one cable dedicated for each type of traffic but not always practical there are many cases where all three ride on the same cable common examples used are cable and dsl both generally ride on the same wire that supplies a telephone or catv service you can also bundle audio video and data on the same t all three examples do this by either different encoding or broadcast frequencies that do not interfere this is called multiplexing and that is how a cable or dsl modem work they isolate the data signals from the rest ALOHAnet Radio IEEE 802.11 Internet service provider Voice over IP Bluetooth Integrated Services Digital Network Telegraphy Transmission Control Protocol Telephone Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Frame relay Cable modem Universal Serial Bus Air traffic control Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Antenna (radio) GSM services ITU-T CPU cache Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting WiMAX Internet protocol suite Denial-of-service attack Satellite internet Digital television Web hosting Broadband Optical fiber Power line communication Domain Name System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Code division multiple access IP Multimedia Subsystem Oscilloscope RS-232 Cellular network Internet Amateur radio Musical Instrument Digital Interface Wi-Fi Web crawler High-definition television Password Broadband Networks Radar Transformer Telephone exchange Communications protocol DOCSIS Stopping e-mail abuse Universal Mobile Telecommunications System IS-95 Differentiated services Public transport Computer bus Time-division multiplexing Digital audio broadcasting TGV AppleTalk Speed of light Road-rule enforcement camera Compact disc Router Quality of service Elevator Phase-locked loop Airport Broadcasting Error correction and detection Spam (electronic) Data retention Electric power transmission Netfilter/iptables Floppy disk Alternating current Nintendo GameCube Loudspeaker Morse Code BitTorrent PlayStation Portable Analog-to-digital converter Freeview History of radio
