slow connections speeds i just bought a belkin wireless router since me and my new roommate have laptops i can get a decent signal all the a way to the other size of my apartments wing don't worry i secured it however with the hard line i could get download speeds of kbs but now i be lucky if it was closer to kbs any thoughts or suggestions actually more like kbs i am testing it out he is not using it yet i mean it is just me using the wireless his laptop is broken for the mean time so i don't know most likely your wireless isn't affecting your download speeds if your using b or g you'll have at least x speed on your local connection than you will on your internet connectiivty for instance if you download something your connection from your wireless will be something like mb whereas your internet is only kbs i would say that the problem is that you and your roommate are sharing the connection and he she is using up your bandwidth i'd bet your roommate has a server up and running that's eating up your bandwidth or they are doing some heavy surfing i would have your roommate turn off their laptop s and see what kind of bandwidth you would get at that point i'd bet you would see it go back up to kbps Universal Serial Bus Laptop Modem Wi-Fi Broadband Internet access Wireless LAN IEEE 802.11 Bluetooth Internet Windows XP General Packet Radio Service Internet service provider Wireless access point Differentiated services Ethernet IBM PC compatible PlayStation 3 EMule File sharing Xbox Router Warez Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Wireless mesh network WiMAX Web crawler Skype Streaming media Telegraphy Oscilloscope Transmission Control Protocol Cable television Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Steam (content delivery) World Wide Web Lag IP Multimedia Subsystem USB flash drive Nintendo Revolution Denial-of-service attack Xbox 360 BitTorrent Network address translation Super Nintendo Entertainment System Satellite internet Quality of service Video on demand Morse Code CPU cache Verizon Wireless Surveillance Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Wireless Windows Server 2003 Peer-to-peer PowerBook Digital Subscriber Line Computer bus Speed of light PCI Express Avenue Q ITunes MDAC Apple Macintosh PowerPC Mobile phone Wardriving Opera (web browser) Television Internet Relay Chat Mobile ad-hoc network Newsgroup MAME Friends Computer and video games Poker jargon Power line communication Squid cache ALOHAnet Mach kernel GunZ The Duel Local area network Cisco Systems Supercomputer Freeview Computer Web hosting Musical Instrument Digital Interface Trusted computing Freenet AT&T Server Message Block Federal Standard 1037C Session Initiation Protocol BlackBerry Floppy disk
