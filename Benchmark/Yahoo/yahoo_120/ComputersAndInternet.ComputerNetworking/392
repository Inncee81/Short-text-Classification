what is the difference between regular switch and fabric switch what is the difference between regular switch and fabric switch thanks haven't heard of a 'fabric switch' but i have heard of switched fabric check this out from wiki switched fabric is a computer network topology where many devices connect with each other via switches used in some storage area networks and other high speed interconnects including fibre channel and infiniband switched fabric networks are different from typical hierarchical switched networks e g ethernet in that switched fabric networks naturally support redundant paths between multiple devices forming a mesh network with devices being on the edges of the mesh InfiniBand Storage area network Ethernet Computer bus Redundant array of independent disks Asynchronous Transfer Mode Field-programmable gate array Telephone exchange Scalable Coherent Interconnect Network switch OSI model SCSI Universal Serial Bus Computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer network Fiber distributed data interface Serial communications MOSFET CMOS Oscilloscope Transistor Diode Logic gate ZigBee Secure Digital card Network topology Wi-Fi HyperTransport High-voltage direct current Computer networking device Transmission Control Protocol Integrated circuit Hard disk Host adapter Cisco Systems ISCSI IEEE 802.11 Multiprotocol Label Switching Central processing unit Router GSM services Modem File system Bluetooth Tandem Computers PowerPC Local area network Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Windows 2000 10-gigabit Ethernet Cache General Packet Radio Service Floppy disk Artificial neural network IPod Telephone Communications protocol Textile manufacturing Memory Stick FireWire H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Wireless LAN Windows XP Internet IP Multimedia Subsystem Embedded system Myrinet Wireless access point Time-division multiplexing INMOS Transputer ZX Spectrum PlayStation 2 Textile manufacturing terminology Frame relay Bus network Universal Mobile Telecommunications System MAC address Distributed computing Optical computer Parallel computing USB flash drive PlayStation 3 Broadband Internet access Mattress Link-state routing protocol Digital Subscriber Line Parachute 100BASE-TX Error correction and detection Magnetic core memory PlayStation Portable Packet switching Internet protocol suite Wireless mesh network Electric motor
