how do i change the channel on my wireless router i want to see if it makes any difference to my connection it depends on the router but usually u can get to the setup by typing ur ip address in the address bar of internet explorer you can figure out ur ip address here http www whatismyipaddress com then you may be asked for a username and password my default username and password were both admin so go ahead and try that now u should be on ur routers setup screen look around until u find the settings for wireless and once u r there u can change the channel and then click save or apply or whatever and u should be done i hope that makes sense and helps u out if all else fails then go to ur router manufacturers website or call their tech support Uniform Resource Locator Wi-Fi Router Password Network address translation Phishing Denial-of-service attack Gmail General Packet Radio Service Virtual Network Computing Danger Hiptop MAC address Wireless LAN Mouse (computing) Domain Name System Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Opera (web browser) Telegraphy IEEE 802.11 HyperText Transfer Protocol RuneScape cheats MDAC Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Internet Group Management Protocol Nintendo DS Federal Standard 1037C Windows XP AppleTalk Bluetooth User (computing) GameFAQs Open Shortest Path First Ethernet Differentiated services Wardriving Nintendo Revolution Files-11 Cross site scripting System/34 Common Unix Printing System Streaming media Mozilla Firefox Enhanced 911 PlayStation 3 Communications protocol Internet Relay Chat Telnet Border Gateway Protocol System/36 Cisco Systems Whois Spam (electronic) IPv6 Internet forum File Transfer Protocol IPv4 World Wide Web Modem Internet protocol suite Secure Shell ZigBee Transmission Control Protocol Wireless mesh network Internet protocol spoofing Game Boy Advance OpenVPN Web crawler E-mail spam Spyware Quality of service Digital Subscriber Line Email authentication GSM services Novell NetWare Embedded system PlayStation Portable Mozilla Application Suite Universal Serial Bus Routing Xbox BlackBerry Firewall (networking) Buffer overflow Cisco IOS Cascading Style Sheets America Online Slashdot subculture Slashdot E-mail Password cracking Web browser Netfilter/iptables IP address Internet Protocol Tor (anonymity network) Wireless Application Protocol Something Awful Forums Jumpstart 3rd Grade Internet fraud HyperTransport
