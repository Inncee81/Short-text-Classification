trouble connecting wire dsl modem online all lights are solid green i just bought a wire hg wifi wireless modem router at t dsl after some configuration on the setup page i managed to get all the lights on the modem solid green i am also able to connect my playstation online through the modem but when i try to connect online with my computer it gives me a connecting through wan miniport ppoe message then just stalls i was trying to connect through the same connection i had made from my sbc speedstream modem im wondering if i need to delete that and configure a new network connection and how i would go about doing that help i ran the wire set up wizard and at the end it tells me that the dsl signal ppp login internet address and isp link are all good it gives me a red dot and error on configuaration server link unable to contact the configuaration help it sounds like you were on the right track at the beginning you got the wire modem router set up with your username and password the configuration was correct and the connection was made you were also right about needing to delete the old speedstream connection details or at least don't click them to connect if you're connected to the new wire modem through ethernet you're already all set the changes in the internet explorer version web browser would be as follows tools internet options connections if you see always dial selected that's what's going wrong i've attached a screenshot and outlined the change in red in the past it had to make that sbc connection before the browser would work now the connection will be live all the time through the wire so you won't need to launch that anymore if you pick never dial and close then open the browser again it ought to 'just work' if you're launching the old sbc connection by hand don't do that opening the browser directly should network through the wire modem and go on out to the internet without any other configuration if you're connected to the wire modem using usb instead of ethernet you need to connect the ethernet cable that used to go to the speedstream modem into your new wire modem instead and reboot the pc i suspect however that you've already done that if so you're very close to complete the only network connection needed for the wire is the local area connection which is probably already working if you're still stuck after this write me Modem Wi-Fi Password Voice over IP Broadband Internet access Xbox PlayStation 2 Internet fraud Router Universal Serial Bus Internet service provider Telegraphy Windows XP HTTP cookie Spyware Bluetooth Prodigy (ISP) Common Unix Printing System Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol PlayStation Portable Domain Name System Internet Group Management Protocol Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Computer bus MAC address Denial-of-service attack Windows Server 2003 RS-232 PlayStation 3 Federal Standard 1037C IMac Mouse (computing) America Online Point-to-Point Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Gmail Xbox 360 Computer network Asynchronous Transfer Mode GSM services Phishing Stopping e-mail abuse Opera (web browser) Internet protocol suite Sega Dreamcast Novell NetWare E-mail spam HomePNA Cisco Systems ITU-T Internet Wireless LAN Cable television Linux Telephone exchange Mozilla Firefox Netfilter/iptables Bulletin board system USB flash drive Communications protocol AppleTalk Nintendo Revolution Netscape Communications Corporation Network address translation Dialer IP Multimedia Subsystem E-mail Transmission Control Protocol AirPort Telephone Neopets 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines IEEE 802.11 Integrated Services Digital Network Commodore 64 X Window System Null modem GameFAQs Power line communication Musical Instrument Digital Interface MDAC Control Panel (Windows) Morse Code Computer Streaming media Atari 8-bit family Internet privacy WiMAX Knoppix Nintendo GameCube IP address Windows 2000 Serial port Microsoft
