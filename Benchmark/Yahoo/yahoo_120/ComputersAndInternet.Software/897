if its in a cache folder is it ok to be deleted hello i am a mac user i just went through my computer to clean up things and i noticed a lot of my files for example pictures were saved in so many different folders i had plenty to delete but as i was deleting i started to delete things in the folders i saw title cache everything is in my recycle bin but before i delete them permanently i want to make sure if it's ok to delete anything and everything that is located in a cache folder so am i safe to proceed thank you i also should state that i've came across many different cache folders in different files is it safe to delete items from any cache folder i just don't want to delete something important yanno the cache folder is used to store images locally so that the next time you need to access it it will load quickly from your local hard drive rather than having to download it from a web site or wherever so yes you can delete items in your cache folder the next time you visit the site that the file came from it will just need to be downloaded again a little bit slower to load perhaps but harmless to delete Windows XP Windows Media Player Macromedia Flash ITunes Screenshot Object Desktop Minesweeper (computer game) Spyware IBM PC compatible IPod Computer virus Pretty Good Privacy Blue screen of death Opera (web browser) Microsoft Windows Macintosh Finder Stardock RuneScape cheats Windows 2000 Mouse (computing) Mach kernel Stopping e-mail abuse Internet fraud E-mail spam QuickTime Debugging AmigaOS Hello world program Public-key cryptography MSN Messenger Patch (computing) HyperCard Windows Vista Computer and video games PlayStation 2 Windows 3.x Windows Mobile Virtual memory Super Mario Bros. 3 X Window System Gmail AOL Instant Messenger World of Warcraft Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Musical Instrument Digital Interface GunZ The Duel Windows 95 Phishing Kylie Minogue Doom 3 Computer forensics Steam (content delivery) Enigma machine Prank flash Buffer overflow Jumpstart 3rd Grade Self programming language Dance Dance Revolution SonicStage Common Unix Printing System Embedded system MapleStory Visual Basic .NET Visual Basic Digital rights management Pop'n Music IP (complexity) Mozilla Firefox Pop-up ad The Sims 2: University Server Message Block History of Microsoft Windows Backup Killian documents Bubble Bobble In The Groove (game) Palm OS Poker jargon Computer role-playing game Pump It Up History of the graphical user interface Apple Macintosh L4 microkernel family Hash table System Shock Taskbar Digital photography MDAC Mac OS X Gramophone record Internet Explorer CPU design NX bit Lemmings (computer game) Diablo II Morse Code Betting (poker) E-mail Web design
