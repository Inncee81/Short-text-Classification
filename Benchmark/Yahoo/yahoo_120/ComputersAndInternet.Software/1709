which is the best registry cleaning software the most user friendly i have seen is ccleaner and now a word of caution ask yourself why doesn't microsoft offer one and why do they warn you about the possibility of the system not being able to boot or be repaired if you modify the registry incorrectly also why does every software company that offers registry cleaners make you accept their license that says they are not responsible if anything goes wrong the registry is extremely complex and also very stable under normal use any entry's no longer used are marked and ignored these entry's may amount to a few thousand characters which are processed in nanoseconds so what is there to gain cleaning is really unnecessary and dangerous and unless you really know what you doing and make a backup before you mess with it you may have a real bad day just think about it Windows XP Password Mouse (computing) IPod AmigaOS OpenDocument Macromedia Flash Screenshot Windows 2000 Emacs Object Desktop Trusted computing Gmail Stopping e-mail abuse Opera (web browser) Windows Vista Ebook Microsoft Word Microsoft Windows PaX Mozilla Firefox Floppy disk Copy protection International Phonetic Alphabet System/36 XML Wiki Unicode History of Microsoft Windows Password cracking System/34 Digital rights management Internet Relay Chat Portable Document Format Revision control Computer forensics Cascading Style Sheets Mac OS X v10.4 ZX Spectrum 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Microsoft Excel Phishing AppleScript $ale of the Century Mach kernel Gramophone record GNU Free Documentation License Hello world program RuneScape cheats E-mail C plus plus MDAC HTTP cookie Slot machine Killian documents Jumpstart 3rd Grade File Allocation Table Xbox 360 Yu-Gi-Oh!
