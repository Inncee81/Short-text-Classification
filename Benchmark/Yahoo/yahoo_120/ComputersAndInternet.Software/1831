what is the best lenux for my ibook what is the best lenux for my ibook and where can i get it depending on how old your ibook is this makes no sense in getting linux for the ibook if your system is at least a ghz g w mb ram bought in the last two years apple's macos x is a posix unix operating system linux is itself another posix minix based operating system in fact if you have learned how to use the apple macos unix terminal on your ibook the commands in any linux terminal are excatly the same in several cases with only minor tweaking macos can actually run several of the freeware apps originally created on linux if you have a desktop pc ie dell ibm gateway hp that is where i would install linux if you are a first time linux user then i would look to ubuntu linux with the gnome desktop fiesty fawn ubuntu linux is not the most advanced linux out there but it is nearly as easy to use as both windowsxp and macosx and is very stable and idiot resistant even its installation from dvd is graphical and friendly as i said i would not overwrite your macos x install on your ibook this would be like replacing a mustang from one dealership with mustang from another dealership just because being from a different dealership makes the car different ubuntu linux and macos x are both unix linux distro operating systems i would look at any desktop that you have around you and run ubuntu linux on that system the official website for ubuntu linux is www ubuntu com ubuntu is distributed by canonical inc when at the ubuntu website select download and the most popular version of their linux is the one running the gnome desktop this is usually the first distro available for download and the one with the most support this is also the distro that dell is currently factory installing with their systems the os is free for download but you will need to use an iso dvd disc image expander the one i used personally was my ibook's macos x disk utilities this app comes as a part of os x on your ibook to find this app on your ibook go to spotlight in the top right corner on the os x file bar and click on the magnifying glass icon then type disk utility the top hit on the appearing list should be the app disk utility click on this launching disk utility while making sure that you have a compatible dvd r or cd r disc in your ibook's dvd drive select the saved ubuntu linux disc iso image on your systems hard drive as the image you want burned to disc this process will take several minutes after the disc is burned find an x desktop pc or x intel based imac and you can run the installation of ubuntu linux on either of those machines the powerpc g based ibook cannot run ubuntu linux right now although there are some linux's on the net designed for powerpc macs most are fairly complicated to run and install and many lack basic productivity apps the process i just explained is how to download and burn the ubuntu linux installation cd dvd using your ibook DVD AVI Macromedia Flash Laserdisc Enterprise content management Disk image Video codec Windows XP QuickTime Blu-ray Disc DivX WavPack PlayStation Portable Digital rights management High-definition television Windows Media Video VHS H.264/MPEG-4 AVC AmigaOS Super Audio CD Warez DualDisc Screenshot Quest for Glory Radeon Karaoke DVD player DVD-RAM Nero Wolfe Floppy disk MP3 Movie projector ALGOL 68 Explosive material Compact disc Musical Instrument Digital Interface The Criterion Collection PlayStation 3 Visual Basic Ripping Pioneer Corporation CD recorder DV 8 mm video format Nintendo GameCube Camcorder CD-ROM Nero Digital XML AviSynth Forth programming language Volleyball Comparison of media players Xbox Apple II family Hard disk Winamp Widescreen Copy protection Iriver Sega Dreamcast Enhanced Versatile Disc Baseball Stars Table tennis Knoppix Cue sheet Backup Virtual memory SCSI The Emancipation of Mimi Nero Ebook Digital camera Yu-Gi-Oh!
