can i get yahoo mail updatets through windows live messenger i use windows live messenger the latest version but i use a btinternet co uk email adress for my login email for my live messenger account is it possible that when i get a new email sent to my btinternet co uk account that i can get a pop up in live messenger the same way i would if i was using a hotmail co uk address hope that makes sense yes you can you need to go in to your yahoo mail prefrences and find the pop access this will enable all messages to be forwarded to any email address of your choice that means that you only need to log in to the hotmail to read all your messages there's no need to log into the yahoo each time you get a new message in your hotmail messenger will alert you straight away email me if you need help go to my profile and use the facility there it works believe me thats what i'm doing i've had my yahoo mail address for years but most of my friends use windows live messenger as opposed to yahoo instant messanger Spyware Windows XP Mac OS X Macromedia Flash Windows Vista Macintosh Finder Object Desktop IBM PC compatible Blue screen of death File system Microsoft Windows Gmail MDAC Linux Windows Me Windows 2000 Google Desktop Konqueror History of Microsoft Windows ITunes Btrieve IPod Computer virus Windows Mobile History of the graphical user interface Stardock Mouse (computing) Apple Macintosh Windows Server 2003 NTFS Computer forensics Library (computer science) Control Panel (Windows) SAS System Java programming language File Allocation Table Malware Windows Installer Internet Explorer Outlook Express USB flash drive Apple Open Collaboration Environment System 6 OpenGL Windows API Patch (computing) Minesweeper (computer game) Host file Linspire New.net Windows registry Kazaa NTFS junction point Anti-virus software Mozilla Firefox ZIP (file format) MSN Messenger Perl Mac OS X v10.4 Hello world program Comparison of file systems Common Unix Printing System AmigaOS NeXT Windows Explorer GNOME Windows 3.x The Sims 2 Universal Serial Bus OpenOffice.org WindowBlinds P__li QuickTime Virtual memory ICalendar Visual Basic .NET Mozilla Application Suite NaturallySpeaking Microsoft Office PHP OS/2 AOL Instant Messenger C programming language WordPerfect Stopping e-mail abuse Disk cloning FreeDOS Enterprise content management Computer Xcode File format Start Menu Opera (web browser) Rootkit Filename extension Common criticisms of Microsoft Python programming language MSH (shell) System 7 (Macintosh)
