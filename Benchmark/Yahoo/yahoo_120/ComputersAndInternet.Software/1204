when i use the fraps video recorder with world of warcraft why doesn't my vent voice playback just downloaded fraps today and love it except for one thing when i run ventrilo with it the only voices i hear when playing back the video are other peoples not my own i'd really like to upgrade the trial version of fraps but this dillemma is preventing me from doing so please help thanks using the trial version doesn't have anything to do with this it records what sounds you hear in other words audio that comes through your soundcard and out your speakers or headset it doesn't record your voice or any audio coming from your mic and be careful running fraps and vent at the same time there is a bug between the two where when fraps is recording and you try to talk in vent anyone in that vent channel with you gets tons of loud piercing feedback straight from your sound card it's not always the case but it does happen so if it does make sure to uncheck the box that says record sounds in fraps however i do have frapsed clips where i can hear my voice in them but it's extremely low Opera (web browser) MSN Messenger Gmail Windows XP Web traffic Google Mozilla Firefox HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Microsoft Ajax (programming) Minesweeper (computer game) Phishing PHP MSN Website OpenBSD International Phonetic Alphabet AmigaOS Macromedia Flash Domain Name System Google Desktop GameFAQs MDAC Pretty Good Privacy Konfabulator Windows Server 2003 Spyware Taskbar Mozilla Application Suite Search engine optimization Blue screen of death Google search Common Unix Printing System Cascading Style Sheets E-mail spam Mouse (computing) Comparison of web browsers Whois Internet Explorer Denial-of-service attack Cross site scripting Internet Web browser Homestar Runner Virtual Network Computing E-mail Kazaa History of Microsoft Windows Transmission Control Protocol Object Desktop Windows 2000 Pop-up ad Dialer Internet fraud Wireless Application Protocol Java programming language Aggregator XMLHTTP User agent RuneScape cheats MSN Search Hotmail IPod Web hosting Danger Hiptop AOL Instant Messenger Bluetooth Visual Basic Konqueror Microsoft Windows Knoppix Internet Explorer shell GSM services X Window System Screenshot Wi-Fi Google bomb Unicode and e-mail Spam (electronic) Web crawler World Wide Web NX bit Windows Vista Jabber System 7 (Macintosh) Stuttering Hello world program Stopping e-mail abuse Btrieve Common criticisms of Microsoft On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Avant Browser Intranet Password History of the Internet BitTorrent Captcha File Transfer Protocol
