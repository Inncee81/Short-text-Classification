why cant i open this folder i have a folder on my computer which has movie clips if i try to open up the folder the windows explorer not responding message comes up or it just closes if i try to open it using a different program or anything as soon as i enter the folder the program shuts down why is this happening and how can i fix it how do i go into dos mode and it has gb of free space well movie clips takes up a lot of memory as is so when you go to open it up it takes that much more memory plus cpu and ram so if you have programs running when you try to open the folder close them another and the best thing you need to do is to first delete the folder then re download the files but instead of having them in the same folder create multiple folders to categorize them i e action comedy suspense etc and create sub folders to them to balance the data in each folder finally after you have created and filled all of your folders put them all in a folder called movie clips to save space on the desktop at start up note don't open the files with the internet explorer program even it's a clip from the internet if it is make sure you are connected to the internet and open them with realplayer or windows media player even if it isn't a clip from the internet do the same thing except you don't have to be connected to the internet Windows Vista Portable Document Format Photography Perl Hello world program Mouse (computing) Ebook Common Unix Printing System AppleScript AmigaOS Macromedia Flash Bookbinding Xerox Star Screenshot HTML element BASIC programming language WYSIWYG Cascading Style Sheets WordPerfect Unicode Windows 2000 Xerox OpenDocument Printing press Gmail International Phonetic Alphabet Mac OS X v10.4 File format System 7 (Macintosh) Apple typography Minesweeper (computer game) Killian documents Mozilla Firefox Digital photography XML Windows XP Esperanto orthography Emacs Enterprise content management Computer printer Java programming language SAS System PHP Open access Mac OS X Object-oriented programming Web page Morse Code Opera (web browser) Google TOPS-20 Stereoscopy XHTML Konica Minolta Forth programming language Japanese tea ceremony Inkjet printer Favicon Icon (computing) Document management system Search engine optimization C plus plus LaTeX Antenna (radio) Photocopying P__li Computer virus Google Desktop Mozilla Application Suite Map Double-click (computing) Fractal Internet Relay Chat System 6 Oxford English Dictionary Movie projector Apple Macintosh System/36 Rigging OpenOffice.org Paper IBM PC keyboard Downing Street memo Legal research Start Menu Object Desktop WordStar Flat file database History of the graphical user interface Palm OS Jumpstart 3rd Grade El Lissitzky Webster's Dictionary Book Wikipedia View camera NaturallySpeaking Embedded system Human Genome Project PostScript
