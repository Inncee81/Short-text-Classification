i need some advice regarding a microsoft word document format the document is to be a column layout on a landscape configuration the paper used is x x legal what i am having difficulty doing is getting the columns to be centered exactly after the document is printed and the paper is folded into four equal sizes or quartered as some would say the goal is to get the data within the columns to appear properly centered after the document has been folded into four panels specifically when i move one column into proper position the other margins between the columns re size automatically can that be bypassed in some way i don't have formal training my computer skills are just into intermediate and what i know so far is what i have learned through trial and error plus the good advice from folks that i have asked online if you have any questions you can include them with your answer or you can e mail me i thank you in advance manis i have done that prior to posting the question mountie thank you kindly for your help you can change column spacing individually by removing the check mark underneath 'width and spacing' at 'equal column width' but i don't think this is the way to achieve what you want i think you need to have your column spacings twice the width of your page left and right margins printers have different minimum margin widths mine is half an inch cm so you would need to check this out first file page setup margins reduce your left and right margins equally to their limit and click ok a message will appear if you go outside the printers limits assuming that your left and right margins are half an inch wide you will need to make your column spacing inch wide when folded there should be a half inch each side the same as your margins and your text should be centered Anti-virus software Library (computer science) Windows API Computer virus Dynamic-Link Library Trojan horse (computing) Rootkit Windows XP C Sharp Mydoom Btrieve OS/2 .NET assemblies MDAC DLL hell Component Object Model Computer security Spyware Symbian OS Microsoft Malware C programming language Windows 2000 Virus Blue screen of death Hello world program Portable Executable Master Control Program Objective-C Visual Basic Skype Datatype Emacs Lisp Position independent code Name mangling Game Maker Microsoft Jet Database Engine Internet security Macromedia Flash Python programming language Linker C plus plus Scheme programming language Compiler Source code Java programming language Wine (software) Perl NPAPI PaX Java platform Self-modifying code Lisp programming language Cocoa (API) MinGW Norton AntiVirus AS/400 MUMPS Emacs Ebook Buffer overflow BASIC programming language RPG programming language High Level Assembly Cheating in Counter-Strike Compiler optimization Ruby programming language HyperCard Windows registry Linked list CPU cache AmigaOS Assembly language Visual Basic .NET Stopping e-mail abuse Microsoft Windows Euphoria programming language Delphi programming language Software cracking Self-replication Mach kernel Brainfuck Internet Explorer PHP Java virtual machine Programming language Computer Virtual memory Enterprise content management Thunk Polymorphism (computer science) Windows Vista Computer program
