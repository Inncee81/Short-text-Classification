is there a program to test bootable iso image from within windows i build a lot of custom bootable cds and sometimes they end up not booting the way i want rather than taking the time to burn a disc and waste a disc i would like to build a bootable iso image first and be able to simulate or test boot it in some kind of program before burning an actual cd then if it doesn't work i can make changes etc and try the iso again i am not aware of any programs that exist to do this a possibile idea is to use a usb drive instead of a disc to boot from if your motherboard allows this function not exactly what you asked but it would save cds hth Visual Basic .NET Microsoft .NET Visual Basic Microsoft Microsoft Windows MDAC Microsoft Visual Studio Windows Vista Microsoft Office C Sharp Microsoft SQL Server Visual C Plus Plus QuickBASIC Microsoft BASIC Windows XP Microsoft Excel Microsoft Agent Website BASIC programming language NPAPI Internet Explorer Component Object Model Trillian (instant messenger) Mozilla Firefox Online music store Visual Basic for Applications Delphi programming language ITunes Windows API Xbox Live Windows 2000 Integrated development environment Microsoft Foundation Classes Windows Update WindowBlinds OpenOffice.org HyperCard Xbox 360 StarOffice QBasic Microsoft Jet Database Engine Opera (web browser) System 7 (Macintosh) OpenGL Computer virus Skype Linux distribution Wine (software) MSX Linspire Visual FoxPro BPEL Macro Dialer Stardock Mac OS X v10.4 Visual Studio .NET Windows Communication Foundation Virtual machine GameSpot Microsoft Flight Simulator Open source culture Apple Computer Bungie Studios GW-BASIC User agent Internet Relay Chat Flight simulator Forth programming language Edlin Java programming language Microsoft Train Simulator X Window System Object Desktop MS-DOS Xbox AMD64 Mozilla Application Suite United States v.
