what is the best way to move my itunes music collection from an old computer to a new computer i want to make sure that i retain my playlists and would also like to retain all of my ratings times played and other track information my music collection is way too big to fit on one disc and the itunes built in backup utility is not working i guess you could try to copy itunes and all your music files to an external hard drive a flash drive it could work with a dvd if you have a dvd burner of if you're lucky a bluray or hddvd burner d but seeing as its an old computer i doubt it anyways an external hard drive would be great or a really big flash drive Kazaa Napster File sharing MGM Studios, Inc. v.
