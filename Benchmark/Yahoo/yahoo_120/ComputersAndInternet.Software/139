how do i remove all skipped lines for new paragraphs in an ms word document i have a word document andi would like to remove the skipped lines or double paragraph breaks it is already single spaced so altering those setting will do nothing i would like one line to follow the next uninterrupted i am trying to avoid doing it manually thanks go to edit replace ctrl h put the cursor in 'find what' hit the button at the bottom that says 'more' then the special button at the top of the drop down menu is 'paragraph mark' hit this looks like p in 'find what' repeat this p p in 'find what' then put the cursor in 'replace with' and insert one 'paragraph mark' then hit 'replace all' this should replace all the double lines with single if this does not try 'manual page break' or 'manual line break' both under 'special' button the find ands replace in word is a very useful tool hope this helps Windows Media Player Windows XP ITunes MDAC Spyware IPod SQL AOL Instant Messenger InterBase Computer virus Screenshot Windows 2000 Amstrad CPC Podcasting Computer and video game genres Blue screen of death Macromedia Flash HyperCard Minesweeper (computer game) Microsoft Copy protection Computer and video games 2004-05 NHL lockout MP3 Digital audio broadcasting Apple Macintosh Satellite radio MSN Messenger Final Fantasy XI Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Internet Explorer Computer role-playing game Myst SubSpace (computer game) Opera (web browser) The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Interactive fiction Stardock Microsoft Windows File system QuickTime Gmail Sirius Satellite Radio Mouse (computing) Object Desktop Musical Instrument Digital Interface Database management system Morse Code Visual Basic .NET Kazaa Radio Rick Dees Patch (computing) America Online WFAN (AM) Isolation (computer science) Diablo (computer game) Rootkit Counter-Strike Pinball Foreskin Championship Manager The Elder Scrolls Creative Zen Atari 8-bit family WordPerfect Vorbis DrumMania MS-DOS Marching band Trillian (instant messenger) Phishing Windows Vista Mac OS X Sony Open source culture Winning Streak Howard Stern National Public Radio Game programming CBC Radio One Anti-virus software AmigaOS Encyclopedia Xbox Live Windows Mobile Mydoom FairPlay Radio drama Online music store Computer Microsoft Office Opie and Anthony MSX Windows Me Ebook Nintendo GameCube Commodore 64 Gramophone record WCBS-FM
