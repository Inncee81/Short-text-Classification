software on ibook i am not experienced with macs and i am trying to install openoffice or neooffice but neither seem to work i have installed that x update but has made no difference the two are both listed in applications and are in the dock but when i click on them nothing happens the neooffice icon just bounces around and then does nothing and open office just comes up with a couple of menus at the top but no way to access the individual programs like writer or database etc whats going on i just installed it on my mac mini without any difficulty it did take a minute for the installer to work its magic during which nothing much seemed to happen on the surface so i opened terminal and issued the command top which creates a live updating table of processes running on your machine i saw a number of processes starting and completing and when it was done oo writer opened and worked normally when you're done with the top process monitor type q in the terminal or quit terminal to end the process because it takes a lot of system resources make sure you have the correct installer for your cpu type new macs use the intel version older powerpc macs use the ppc version also ensure you have the java environment installed Windows 2000 Common Unix Printing System Bash Windows registry Python programming language Mozilla Firefox Launchd Screenshot HTML Web browser HyperText Transfer Protocol Comparison of web browsers Hello world program Electric motor Windows XP Windows 3.x Filename extension UBASIC ISBN Gmail C programming language Booting Google System 6 C plus plus Wget Unix Uniform Resource Locator Portable Document Format Ebook Virtual memory OpenOffice.org PostScript CDC 6600 Library (computer science) Blue screen of death Bootstrapping Pipeline (Unix) Expert system Squid cache Files-11 RuneScape cheats MSN Messenger Btrieve XHTML Prolog Commodore 64 Lotus Notes Diablo II: Lord of Destruction ALGOL 68 Database Algorithm Web crawler File format JavaScript Sun Microsystems Domain Name System System 7 (Macintosh) Crossword C Sharp Computer virus XML Master Control Program HTTP cookie Rootkit GIMP Hard disk Extreme Programming Mozilla Application Suite Atari 8-bit family Google search Mach kernel Architecture of Windows 2000 Adobe Acrobat Mac OS X v10.4 E85 MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Trademark Federal Standard 1037C Compiler LR parser Macromedia Flash Dynamic-Link Library Website Scalable Vector Graphics Multiple document interface Object-oriented programming MegaMan NT Warrior Gravitational radiation Windows API Datatype Many-worlds interpretation Uniform Resource Identifier MDAC World Wide Web Adobe Photoshop Paul Graham GNU Screen Web page
