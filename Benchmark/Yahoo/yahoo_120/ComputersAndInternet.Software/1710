vista the worst operating system ever why do so many people like vista i bought a computer with vista premium on it and kept vista for about a month until i got sick of it i recently downgraded upgraded to xp now my computer runs times faster and i can actually run programs and games i have a gig of ram and vista used about half of it just to stay idle i'm just posting this to tell people to stay away from vista it's a resource hogging piece of crap it would sometimes even crash doing something as simple as copying a file if you want your computer's true performance use xp or linux post if you agree or disagree or whatever totaly agree but when i bought my new pc with vista crap on it i tried to down upgrade to xp pro it took just fine but non of my graphics sound and a bunch of other drivers would load i called hp and they said vista was integrated into the pc hardware i would basicly have to buy a new motherboard to make the switch BitTorrent Peer-to-peer Warez File sharing Suprnova.org Azureus EMule Recording Industry Association of America Uploading and downloading Copyright infringement of software File Transfer Protocol Internet Relay Chat DCPlusPlus FastTrack Commodore 64 Open source culture EDonkey2000 Cheating in Counter-Strike Linux distribution Copyright infringement Kazaa Copyright MiniDisc Gnutella IPod Web page Internet 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Bulletin board system Differentiated services E-mail CPAN Download.com Windows XP Bram Cohen Newsgroup Image ROM image Xbox Spyware Friend-to-friend Perl PlayStation Portable Web hosting DVD Secure copy MP3 Musical Instrument Digital Interface PeerGuardian Kademlia Freenet MAME TiVo PlayStation 3 Debian ZX Spectrum 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Adobe Photoshop Patent Wikimedia Commons Doom WAD Compunet Gnutella2 Blue screen of death USB flash drive Digital photography Download manager Grokster General Packet Radio Service MS-DOS Exeem Windows Vista Digital audio player DOS Copy protection Computer virus America Online Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Modem File-sharing program Automator (software) Skype Furcadia Doom Hash tree Mandriva Linux Network address translation Monsanto Symbian OS ITunes IPhoto Time Crisis 3 Floppy disk PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Hardware description language BinHex Modchip Macintosh Finder Pipeline (Unix)
