size and color of desktop ok so i accidentally hit a key on my keyboard but i'm not sure which one i hit and the size of everything got bigger things on webpages so i went to control panel and display and thought if i changed the size then the size would go back to normal but instead the size stayed the same but now the blue task bar that i should have i have windows xp is now gray as if i have windows how do i change it back to blue and how do i change the size back to normal not sure what grayed out your taskbar but i have had the desktop issue before when browsing and changing the font size in the browser settings fixed it in ie you hold down control and to enlarge to reduce hope this helps Opera (web browser) Windows XP Object Desktop Cascading Style Sheets Web design System 7 (Macintosh) Screenshot Control Panel (Windows) Taskbar Mouse (computing) HTML element X Window System Google Desktop Tabbed document interface Blue screen of death Unicode Windows 2000 Windows Vista Apple typography Stardock X Window System protocols and architecture Computer wallpaper Emacs Mozilla Firefox EIA-708 Graphical Environment Manager Windows 95 Apple Computer Konqueror History of the graphical user interface Portable Document Format Atari 8-bit family Macintosh Finder System 6 AmigaOS Microsoft Windows Color Web browser Computer terminal Gmail Browser wars Apple Macintosh Palm OS Hyperlink Sega Dreamcast Mozilla Application Suite Windows Explorer QuickDraw Apollo Guidance Computer Laptop Dash Computer keyboard GIF Color Graphics Adapter PNG History of Microsoft Windows Typeface IMac RISC PostScript TrueType Mac OS X Pixel USB flash drive Euro Pump It Up Function key NeXT Computer accessibility Mac OS history Internet Explorer Microprocessor KDE Konfabulator Mandriva Linux Ebook United States v.
