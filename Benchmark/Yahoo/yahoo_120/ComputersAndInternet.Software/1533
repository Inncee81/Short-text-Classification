mac os x server can't find serial number i just received a g desktop with os x server installed i wanted to add another admin account so i booted in apple s to get command line where i proceeded to erase the applesetupdone file when the computer rebooted it opened the setup assistant which i wanted but it asked for the serial number which i can't find i have all the install discs and the documentation but i don't know where the serial number is any ideas on what to do is there possibly a way to get back to the other admin account on the system i have the username and password for it i solved it i had been at a stage where i wasn't able to boot without going straight to setup so i couldn't start up mac os what i did was reboot into apple s mode command line and open a text editor pico then i rewrote by hand the entire contents of applesetupdone i did this by opening the file on another computer and reading it there i rebooted and all was well thanks for your help not the first dude though he clearly doesn't understand that it's the pc users who are making the mistake click on the apple icon in the menu bar choose about this mac then click on more info on the left you will see hardware click to select that and on the right you will see serial number after you finish the setup program by creating a new admin account you can logout of that and login to your original user in some versions of os x the old user will be changed to a disk image file and placed in a folder called deleted users in that case use the accounts pane in system preferences to create a new admin user with exactly the same short name as the deleted user after that you can mount the disk image and copy files from it to the new user IChat Mac OS X AOL Instant Messenger ICQ Mac OS X v10.4 MSN Messenger Session Initiation Protocol Apple Macintosh QuickTime IPod Mac OS X v10.2 Apple Computer Comparison of instant messengers Bonjour (protocol) ISight Windows Vista Microsoft Office Mac OS X v10.3 Macromedia Flash Internet Relay Chat System 7 (Macintosh) User agent X Window System Mac OS history History of Microsoft Windows IMac ITunes Google Talk IBM PC compatible Opera (web browser) Delphi programming language WordPerfect Mac OS Microsoft Windows Unicode Commodore 64 Windows Server 2003 Logic Pro Timeline of computing 1990-forward LaTeX Peer-to-peer HyperCard QuarkXPress Internet Explorer OpenOffice.org Vorbis Windows XP PowerPC Classic (Mac OS X) PowerBook Mozilla Firefox Mac mini Radeon H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Power Macintosh G3 PHP Mac OS 9 FileMaker TRS-80 Microsoft Trillian (instant messenger) Carbon (API) Internet Explorer for Mac Final Cut Pro Screenshot Address Book (software) Nintendo DS Linux Mouse (computing) Microsoft Word Common Unix Printing System Amiga Common User Access Windows Media Video High-definition television Python programming language Windows 3.x Mac OS X Server Microsoft Messenger for Mac Mac OS 8 Freenet Perl Apple II family MS-DOS WebObjects AppleScript Microsoft Virtual PC Online music store History of the graphical user interface Yahoo!
