windows media player output settings for headphones i can only listen to music at work with one earphone some of the tracks i listen to were recorded with different levels on each channel so i only hear bits of the lead in my right ear whilst the rest of the solo is played on the left channel which isn't in my ear so i don't hear it i would like to know if there is a way that i can maybe set the output to mono or something so i can hear all of the sound from one channel if that makes any sense many thanks if i adjust the balance i'm still only hearing one channel i want to know if the two channels can be merged to one very simple only if you are listening to music set the balance to left right according to your listening side view enhancements graphic equalizer Mouse (computing) WordStar Control key Common User Access Opera (web browser) Combo box Screenshot WordPerfect Windows 2000 Object Desktop Vim (text editor) Gmail Windows XP Emacs Mozilla Firefox Inkscape Mac OS X v10.4 AltGr key Cut and paste System/34 Modifier key Blue screen of death Konqueror IBM PC keyboard Sega Dreamcast Dash AmigaOS Digital photography Phishing Double-click (computing) Warez Internet Relay Chat System/36 Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Control-Alt-Delete Computer keyboard Cascading Style Sheets Cross site scripting Microsoft Windows History of Microsoft Windows Computer Non-breaking space Slashdot subculture Unicode X Window System Amiga Password MAC address Virtual memory Copy protection Photography E-mail Digital video Cmd.exe Taskbar Option key Google Talk Keyboard layout IMac Diacritic Menu (computing) Wormhole Extreme Programming SharpDevelop Stardock Computer and video game genres Copyright Klik P__li Infinite monkey theorem Opticks Computer virus Webcomic Apple Macintosh Apollo Guidance Computer Web accessibility Computing minimalism E-mail spam Autograph Comparison of web browsers Pure Pwnage Macintosh Finder Make money fast Computer and video games Frances the Mute Pok__mon Live!
