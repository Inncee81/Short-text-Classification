can i install word on my laptop i have recently gotten a new laptop with windows vista it came with a trial version of word i already have a desktop with word which i have paid for and have the activation key i do not want to pay for word yet i don't have the money for it can i install word on the laptop with vista without having to uninstall word it depends on what version of microsoft office you have of course word is usually packaged with microsoft office but there are different office packages that are offered office student and home editions each allow installation on up to computers office professional and ultimate allow installation on only one computer first check to make sure you haven't reach the maximum number of installations for whatever version you have unfortunately even with a spare use for your software i don't believe that you can have two different versions of microsoft word on your laptop if you install word your cd will recognize that word is already on your computer and will ask you to either go with the trial version or remove it and install word i'd recommend using the trial version until you are finished with all of its uses and then install word don't worry if you don't have the money to buy word just yet the layout between the two may look vastly different but most of the features are exactly the same Warez World Wide Web BitTorrent Mozilla Firefox Kazaa Web crawler Microsoft Spyware Podcasting Software agent Apple Computer Website Uniform Resource Locator Windows XP HyperCard Sega Dreamcast Charles Ives Macromedia Flash Linux Gnutella Computer virus Domain Name System Jon Lech Johansen Copyleft ITunes Screenshot Apache HTTP Server Software patent Free software File sharing Patent Patch (computing) Wiki Wireless Application Protocol IPod Atari ST Digital rights management H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Internet Mozilla Application Suite Proxy server Freenet Mac OS X v10.4 Representational State Transfer Software engineering Unix Common Unix Printing System Linux distribution Mac OS X Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Firewall (networking) Open access Computational fluid dynamics IBM PC compatible Xbox Numerical analysis Web server Digital audio workstation Computer science Opera (web browser) Session Initiation Protocol Ebook Windows registry Source code Public domain Open-source software Genetic algorithm DVD Windows Vista ILife Filename extension Ajax (programming) Xbox 360 Programming tool KDE SETI@home Adware Comparison of media players Web design MP3 Database management system Amazon.com Service-oriented architecture CPAN Online casino Freeware America Online Commodore 64 Adobe Acrobat Apple II family Online DVD rental Software bloat OpenBSD SUSE Linux Programming language Machinima Computer program Disk image Software cracking
