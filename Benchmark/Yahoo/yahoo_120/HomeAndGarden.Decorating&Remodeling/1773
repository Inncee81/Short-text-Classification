what can be done about my basement closet we have a large basement closet probably about ft long and about ft deep that was never finished as in drywalled there are few sections of it that have the wood studs but the majority of it the entire back wall is a concrete wall with about of it covered in plastic wrapped fiberglass insulation if it had of been studs all around there would be no problem and i could have done the work myself but now i have no clue what can be done due to this concrete wall i cant and don't want to mess with the insulation can drywall be hung over this i'm not bob villa in any shape or form but if i get a contractor to do this i want to know how involved of a job it is before i even start because that will determine cost i'm not sure if this is a common situation or not heeelp please as laura stated you can do this yourself very simply to put it lets go step by step measure your height and cut your x 's i don't know how thck the insulation is but i'll say you need at least long or cement anchor screws not correct name i believe their blue i take it you have a drill ok when your at the lumber yard get a drill bit for wood for the screw to just slide through the get a masonary bit just smaller so the screw will actually bite into it and hold just remember most come with phillip heads if different make sure you have the bit you can predrill the holes in your x 's then holding them against the wall make a mark where your holes are and drill your masonary holes then simply screw them into place now you mentioned this is a closet and an exterior cement wall my suggestion here is not drywall but use x sheets of ceder this will keep the bugs out of your clothes you are storing you sound like you would like to finish this yourself and keep the expensive contractors out and you can if your still skepticle when your at the lumber yard pick up a book on walls it tells all these little secretes and gives them step by step happy building Screw Drywall Seismic retrofit Straw-bale construction Masonry Basement Stairway Woodworking Violin Plastic Casting Textile manufacturing Electrical wiring Light-frame construction Geodesic dome Metalworking Construction Mattress Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Xanadu House Skateboarding trick Insulation Building material Marching band Wire Oil well Social rule Rail tracks Asbestos Drill Radio controlled airplane Naval mine The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Upholstery Drill bit sizes Printed circuit board Boat building Carburetor Guitar Timber framing The Brady Bunch CPU design Knife Bong BS 1363 Pile Glass Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Concrete Equine conformation Panama Canal Locks Glossary of firefighting equipment Cincinnati Bengals Passive solar Aerial (dance move) Solar power Earring Clinker (boat building) Professional wrestling throws Time Out of Mind Harmonica Textile manufacturing terminology Entropy Lathe Swingout Great Pyramid of Giza Items in the Metroid series Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Wire wrap Table saw Transformer Debugging NASCAR Door Bassoon Internal ballistics Glacier Tire Action potential Brewery Air-raid shelter Sento Welding Stud poker Plaster Gramophone record Kitchen Glossary of nautical terms Motility
