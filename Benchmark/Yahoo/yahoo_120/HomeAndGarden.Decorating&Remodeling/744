room design i am years old and i share a room with my year old sister we are looking to redo our room however we have a limited amount of money and a limited amount of space we have two beds two dressers a desk and a book shelf how would it be the best way to put furniture in the room so we can have the maximum amount of space i was thinking about putting the beds into a l shape in a corner but i'm not sure how my sister would react to that any other suggestions ok so we have a new idea and i think its pretty good we have the door to get in on one wall in the corner then on the opposite side we have a window then opening to the window we have our closet i was thinking of the desk and bookcase on the wall with the two doorish things beds each in a corner and then having the dresser inbetween does that sound good we're down to one dresser now i like that l design idea i'd put the dressers next to each other on a wall and i don't know what to do with anything else sorry i suggest cleaning the room before rearranging the furniture because it makes moving it much easier and you can try it out a billion different ways before finally sticking to one that's what i always did good luck with your bedroom Furniture Bedroom Wilton House Milton H.
