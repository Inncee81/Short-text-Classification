how to use a candle snuffer okay i am not completely stupid i do know that you use it to smother the flame and put it out however i am trying to figure out how to do it like on a candle other than a taper such as a pillar or one in a jar or whatever i have never had a snuffer and always just blow out the candles but i just acquired a really neato one because it matches my stuff and i just had to have it you know how girls are anyhow i can't understand how it is going to smother the flame without getting wax all over the bottom of it am i missing something here are they really only supposed to be used to put out tapers should i just keep it for pretty decor what's the scoop on them please fill me in i know that really they are kind of an old fashioned thing but wonder if they are actually useful in this day and age i have a snuffer and use it on all candles especially the votives that are hung on my wall and hard to reach yes the wax does get all over the bottom of it but it washes off just because something was invented for a specific use doesn't mean alternate uses can't be found they're useful because when you blow out a candle you risk embers flying and setting something on fire Candle Wax play Pysanka Fire K' Campfire Bubble Bobble Poker jargon Christmas tree Solomon's Temple Textile manufacturing Fire triangle Top-bar hive Characters in the Smurfs Blood (computer game) Birthday Icon Naval mine Mnemonic Professional wrestling match types Haloalkane Paul Is Dead Year of the Spider Door Beavis and Butt-head Internal ballistics Volleyball Professional wrestling holds Fire extinguisher Slayers Will o' the wisp Skateboarding trick Bernadette Soubirous Sonic Youth Welding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Moloch Eastern Orthodox Church Sperm Whale The Legend of Zelda series enemies Drill bit Casting Fire fighting Wood carving Time Out of Mind Anchor Tennessee Williams Kerosene lamp Angel The Lovely Bones Toilet StarCraft: Uprising Abduction Phenomenon Nirvana Out of Gas R-Type Jewish bereavement Prayer Japanese tea ceremony Piccolo Junior Saga SpongeBob SquarePants Queen (band) Devil Fruit YuYu Hakusho Nunchaku Billboard Hot 100 Syphon Filter Beeswax Glossary of nautical terms Glossary of wildland fire terms Black Comedy Ski wax Jars of Clay Futurama (TV series - season 5) Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Architecture of the California missions Gas lighting BDSM USS Trepang (SS-412) Shit Hartford Circus Fire The Inside Indianapolis 500 Wolfrider Anal masturbation Spontaneous human combustion Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Weaving P-61 Black Widow Purim Kodocha Ram Janmabhoomi ECW One Night Stand The Silence of the Lambs Hell Brush Mummy Firefighter Tenshinhan
