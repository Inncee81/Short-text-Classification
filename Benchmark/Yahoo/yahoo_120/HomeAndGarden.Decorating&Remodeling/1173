how do you make a wine bottle oil lamp i get wine bottle transformers at the craft store they sell a kit which contains a little glass tube with a wick inserted in it that fits over the mouth of the wine bottle there are usually converters in each package and i get mine at michaels i ususally use liquor bottles instead of wine bottles mainly because they do not require as much liquid parafin or citronella oil but when i have used a wine bottle i fill the bottle up at the bottom with floral filler to take up volume and weight the bottom to make it more stable you can find this in the floral section of the craft store or use the tiny little glass marbles with the wine bottles you must make certain that the fuel reaches the bottom of the wick on the converter glass or it won't burn great fun project and when i give them as gifts appreciated Bong Beer Alcoholic beverage Plastic Champagne (beverage) Bottle Kerosene lamp Wine bottle Ceramics Solar power Carbon dioxide Incandescent light bulb Moonshine Energy development Wine Coffee Carburetor Hand grenade Hydrogen economy Explosive material Chinese wine Brewery Radio controlled airplane Breastfeeding Molotov cocktail Siphon Fountain pen Scotch whisky Future energy development E85 Wheat beer Tofu Chocolate Homebrewing Bicycle frame Filling station Sake Naval mine Prohibition Transformer Soldering Uranium Tea Saturn V Fluorescent lamp Vacuum tube Liquor store Tier One Port wine Single malt Scotch Nuclear power Fiberglass Internal ballistics Ship naming and launching Sewage treatment Kerosene Kosher foods Rum Glass Milk Vending machine Mattress Candle Renewable energy Coca-Cola Turquoise Handloading Electrophysiology Spacecraft propulsion Lava lamp Printed circuit board Polyethylene terephthalate Biodiesel Nuclear fuel cycle Bicycle Headlight Petroleum RuneScape skills Absinthe Laser engraving Lantern Wine making Hydrogen peroxide Hydrogen vehicle Boeing 737 Cocaine Carbon Fire dancing Nalgene Bottle opener Thermal power station Rocket fuel 613 mitzvot Strap-on dildo USS Wickes (DD-578) Fugu
