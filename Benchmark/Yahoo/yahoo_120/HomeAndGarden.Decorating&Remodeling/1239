painting inside your home do you start with the trim first what about the windows if you've already got painted walls you'll need to start with a primer otherwise you may end up using a lot more paint than necessary or the paint you have purchased may not even stick to your walls could potentially peel away you can paint in whatever order is easier for you painters tape also helps if you're doing various shades of colors in the same room it also helps eliminate what i like to call cross over you know paint getting on to areas it shouldn't be ex the ceiling some people prefer to cut in the ceilings and corners before the middle of the walls and or the baseboards window sills basically it all comes down to what you believe will be the hardest part of the job do that first since painting is hard work you'll want to get the worst part over first then that way it'll be a smooth transition from beginning to end hope that it helps and good luck Paint Stucco Sistine Chapel Pottery Sundial Doom engine Stave church Xanadu House Fire fighting Volleyball Palazzo Vecchio 2000 Australian Grand Prix Passenger car Stairway Grace Cossington Smith Wallpaper group Fan (implement) Library Castle Wars Knife Molding (decorative) Sento Carl Barks Lighting Trail blazing Skateboarding trick Bubble Bobble Academic art Drawing Carpet Kitchen Bus models used in New York City Transit Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Artemisia Gentileschi Tag Cheating in Counter-Strike Architecture of the California missions Seismic retrofit Wayne Corporation New York Giants Impressionism Wood carving Diamond cut Window Casting Fast bowling Escape from New York Wilton House New York City Subway Handloading Table saw Curling Timber framing Masking tape New York Jets San Francisco Giants Piet Mondrian Basement Great Depression Pittsburgh Steelers Sailing Microsoft Paint Domus Aurea Light-frame construction 2D computer graphics Norbert Wiener Plastic Compiler optimization Eug__ne Delacroix Art Horseshoe Raphael Rooms Fra Angelico Mouse (computing) Tintoretto Christiansborg Palace Professional wrestling match types Stained glass Real tennis Vitreous enamel Wood Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Bassoon L.
