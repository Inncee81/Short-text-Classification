housewarming party or not so i guess this brings me to my next question we've been together and married for years we bought our first house do we have a housewarming party or not we don't want presents or need anything so could it be just a get together type of thing do i just put on the invites presents not needed i fully understand why you dont want presents people bring presents to put around the house and if they dont match you feel bad to throw them away or each time people re vizit they expect to see them around the house i also understand why you want to call it housewarming as everyone will keep asking when is the house warming party so i think you should say to the close friends please do not bring any presents i just want to have fun plus the house is fully decorated and i dont have any room for anything else and do put on the invite guests with presents will not be let in or something like that Abigail Folger Social rule Theory of conduct Mojave people Jennifer Lopez I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Customs and etiquette of Japan Poker jargon Nicomachean Ethics Craps Jumpstart 3rd Grade God Emperor of Dune Wedding Crashers Buckingham Palace Religious Society of Friends Professional wrestling match types Kandersteg International Scout Centre Little Britain Singlish Saturday Night Live Jiddu Krishnamurti Socrates Current teachings of Prem Rawat Avenue Q Past teachings of Prem Rawat Big Brother (USA TV series) Kasparov versus The World Gothic metal The nature of God in Western theology Plastic flamingo Good News Week Glen Jacobs Stanton Macdonald-Wright Scenes from a Memory The writing of Principia Mathematica Sydney Riot of 1879 Pyramid (game show) Friends About a Boy Athrun Zala Bad Wolf The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Contract Polyamory Humphrey Bogart RuneScape Mini-Games Milton H.
