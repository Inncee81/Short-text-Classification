how much would painting two of my walls probably cost i'm redoing my room and i want to paint two of my walls purple my mom says i can spend a maximum of bucks on my room plus i'm getting new furniture and all that my walls are about feet high and i just want to paint two of them it's a pretty much averaged sized room i don't know the width of the room or anything but approximately how much would that cost let's say your room is feet by feet with foot high ceilings each wall would be x square feet in area let's round that up to square feet two walls would then be square feet in area one gallon of paint will cover about to square feet divide that by since you will probably have to use two coats so one gallon of paint will cover about to square feet since we didn't account for windows and doors it would seem that one gallon of paint may be enough you will also need a gallon of primer unless the new paint color is close to the old paint color also since you are going with a dark color then you should get the primer tinted purple too or plan on using three coats of paint and get a second gallon so now we have or gallons of paint and a gallon of primer you will probably need about a quart of trim paint too medium priced paints run about to per gallon or about and the quart of trim paint will run you about so conservatively you are looking at about for paint you will need some rollers a pan roller extension pole and a trim brush and a cut in brush that makes it about through in a few bucks for some plastic drop cloth and you are probably looking at if you are careful with painting so you could get by with only a gallon of paint and choose a less expensive paint and could borrow rollers and brushes from someone then you could get by for under this assumes you are painting it yourself if you hire a painter to do it then it would be x to x or about to Stairway Paint Wood carving Fire fighting Plastic Carpet Brush Roller hockey De Lorean DMC-12 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Colours, standards and guidons Panama Canal Poker jargon Pottery Light-emitting diode Architecture of the California missions Alhambra Internal ballistics Handloading Ford Thunderbird Chatsworth House Disneyland Port Authority Trans-Hudson Dundas Square Wassily Kandinsky Glass Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Cartridge (firearms) Dodge Charger Wood My Little Pony English unit Solar cell Lighting Solar power U.S. customary units Gallon Cadillac Eldorado Primer (paint) Color theory Shotgun shell Equine conformation Fuel efficiency Goldfish Fire extinguisher Rococo Glaze Lake District Sailing Bubble Bobble Gamut RuneScape quests Pontiac Trans Sport Drill bit Social Security debate (United States) Sistine Chapel Solomon's Temple Painter and decorator Wilton House Ammunition IMac Japanese tea ceremony Wallpaper group Volume Painting Glossary of firefighting equipment Fan (implement) Color Wal-Mart Floppy disk Woodworking Library Fluorescent lamp Paintball Manicure Sega Saturn Irish Houses of Parliament Neopets Cooking weights and measures Metrication in Canada Holkham Hall Fuel injection Tag Four square Ford Mustang Chevrolet Camaro Brewery Health insurance Fancy rat Wynn Las Vegas Metrified English unit Piet Mondrian Dice Betting (poker) Totem pole Comanche Titanium
