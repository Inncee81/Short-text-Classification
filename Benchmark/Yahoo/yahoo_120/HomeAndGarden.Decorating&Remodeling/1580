i just painted my bathroom and now it seems small how to make it big again i painted it this soothing mint color with white accents ect but now it seems so small it seems tall of course we have ft ceilings but how to make it wider i agree with joyful spirit give it a few weeks to get used to the change if you still don't like it paint it a soft taupe leave the white accents and try hanging a larger mirror if you have the room adequate lighting can also make a small room appear larger make sure the countertops are free from unnecessary clutter as excessive clutter can make any room look and feel smaller lighter colors on the floor can also help the room feel larger good luck p s it might just be a matter of paint color if you don't like the color the room just won't feel right no matter how much lighting you have and how much you declutter Lighting Sento Wilton House Wallpaper group Kitchen Rococo Glass Radar Wood Stuttering McMansion Color theory Equine conformation Light-emitting diode Sistine Chapel Poker jargon Knife Holkham Hall Detroit Tigers Black Christmas tree Toyota MR2 Xanadu House Plastic Light pollution Color Jon Secada Betting (poker) Panzer I Clinical depression United States dollar Impressionism Paintball Luck Dodge Charger In-N-Out Burger Dormitory Rum Guinea pig Fancy rat Local government in the United Kingdom Lionel Corporation New Orleans Mint Emotions (album) Joel and Ethan Coen Ron Weasley Japanese tea ceremony Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Brett Whiteley Captain Beefheart Hamster Grace Cossington Smith White House Fischer Random Chess Mass Pysanka Ocean's Twelve M16 (rifle) Paint Palazzo Vecchio Bathroom Yellow Buckingham Palace Reservoir Dogs Drawing Upholstery The Haunted Mansion Chevrolet Camaro Winchester Mystery House Arcade cabinet Sicilian Baroque Friends Blood on the Tracks Urban planning The Ersatz Elevator Piet Mondrian National Statuary Hall Leopard Tag The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Electrophysiology Nuclear weapon design Ekadasi Wood carving Germaine Greer Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Gamut TARDIS American and British English differences Stellar evolution Passenger car The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Trish Stratus The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Wassily Kandinsky Michel Henry McFly Leather Paleoclimatology Mario series enemies
