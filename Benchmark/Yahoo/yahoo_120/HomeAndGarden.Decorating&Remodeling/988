where can i find a cheep mattress i agree with debb and you certainly don't want a used mattress not everyone uses a mattress pad and it is filled with dust mites or bed bugs you'd have to get it steam cleaned for sure also if someone is selling their used mattress more than likely there is a reason it has probably lived it's life and the coils may be in bad shape the mattress may dip in the center etc i just recently bought a mattress myself this month actually believe me i know how expensive they are however they last for years i had my last mattress for years divide the average cost of a mattress by years and you really aren't spending too much i decided on a plush pillowtop high profile i still sigh everytime i get in it coupled with the thread count sheets and awesome deal on a satin comforter it feels like luxury and is very satisfying the mattress was around at macy's but i was able to get it for around during a sale plus it came with free pillows if you want my opinion i would wait and purchase a new one at a killer mattress sale make sure you test them out most department or furniture stores will allow you to have days to try out the mattress to make sure it is a good fit if you go cheap on it more than likely big lots or whereever will not give you that luxury of a trial period you also truly don't know what you are getting unfortunately mattresses really aren't something you can get away with skimping on price good luck Mattress Bed (furniture) Upholstery Strap-on dildo House dust mite Futon Supply and demand Waterbed Plastic Bedbug Microeconomics Theory of conduct Pillow My Little Pony The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Gross domestic product Social rule Coir Mutual fund Great Depression Macy's Neopets Kirby Corporation Poker jargon Bulk vending Sport utility vehicle Brewery Changeroom Toyota Land Cruiser $ale of the Century The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Inventory Eaton's Illegal drug trade UK Singles Chart Publicly funded medicine Parasite singles Vacuum mattress Hard disk Wal-Mart Sears Holdings Corporation The Critic Equine conformation PE ratio Tina Turner Mergers and acquisitions Massage Berkshire Hathaway Contract Galactic Civilizations MMORPG Value added tax Economics Amway Digital photography Billboard Hot 100 Luxury good Burning Man Animal Crossing Internet fraud Nintendo Nuclear power The Apprentice 2 Caligula Textile manufacturing terminology FairTax Ford Thunderbird Let's Make a Deal Toyota Camry Pharmaceutical company Cruising (maritime) Jennifer Lopez Best Buy Food and Drug Administration Air New Zealand Canadian and American economies compared Outsourcing ITunes Music Store International response to Hurricane Katrina MAME Hyperinflation Solar power Carpet Frederick & Nelson Surveillance Retailer Prisons in the United States Tosca Minor characters in Morrowind 2004-05 NHL lockout Citigroup Department store Berth Personal luxury car Tire MapleStory Coffee Bicycle lighting
