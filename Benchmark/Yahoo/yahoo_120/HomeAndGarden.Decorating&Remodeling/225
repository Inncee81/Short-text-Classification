decorating with a brown couch we're getting a brown microfiber couch it's called espresso with my current decor i have all black accents black shelf black oriental rug black frames etc is black and brown too dark we're trying to decide on a paints color picture brown couchs and ottoman with black shelves and frames and rug and dark brown wood end table and tv stand first of all is that ok i don't really want to buy all new decorative accents second of all what color would i paint the walls we need two colors since we have a chair rail what a wonderful color for your sofa your sofa and your accents are such that the sky is the limit as far as color choices browns and blues together are very popular try using prints that incorporate these colors robert allen and duralee fabrics have many choices for you pier has many things using this combination as far as the accesories black is a neutral and will work fine throw accents around the room in whatever accent color you use blue vases soft blanket throws great for cuddling at night with your favorit drink and a good movie mat photos with blue and black matting blue candles draperies and pillows in fabrics you have found with the blue and brown prints just because you have a chair rail it is not necessary to paint the wall two colors contrary to belief it is very attractive to use the same color top and bottom this is especially good if the ceiling is low and the room is not large it won't cut the room up so much one thing that i have done for my clients is painted the top in the color with a satin or flat finish and then below the chair rail i have striped the wall using the same color but using a flat finish for the first coat and then on the second coat i mark stripes about apart and stripe the wall with a gloss paint this is a very attrative but suttle way to give contrast the other thing i have done quite often is rather than painting the ceiling white i have painted the ceiling with a very slight blue tint this kind of makes the room feel brighter if you are inclind to use color on the walls use beautiful shades of blue or turquiose the blend with colors in fabrics if you choose to use neutral colors for you walls the benifit would be that you can change your accent color from blue to green pink whatever the mood strikes you if you do want to use two colors for the walls use the color strip from the paint store and the bottom can be painted one or two shades darker then the top color just make sure that you are staying in the same family Wood carving Color theory Lighting Color Billiards Chair Wallpaper group Carpet Colours, standards and guidons Rococo Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Mattress Glass Drawing Snooker Coffee Sunglasses Blue Sento Textile manufacturing terminology Andrea Mantegna Paint Technicolor Textile manufacturing Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Diamond Traditional animation Molding (decorative) Light-emitting diode Door Grace Cossington Smith Cleveland Browns Couch Wood Christmas tree Horse Pottery Discus (fish) Crayola Dodge Charger Sundial My Little Pony Anaglyph image Dragon Booster Black Chatsworth House Stairway Academy Award for Best Art Direction Pysanka Detroit Tigers Satchel Paige Printmaking Chicago White Sox Marilyn Monroe Death rock fashion Bubble Bobble Brush Wassily Kandinsky Time Out of Mind Color blindness Titanic (1997 film) Ca' Rezzonico Wilton House Sari Eye color Equine conformation Fluorescent lamp Cincinnati Bengals Traffic sign Fan (implement) Diamond simulant M.C.
