how can we get the bathroom mirrors we want at a good price we just bought a house and are remodeling i would like to put framed mirrors in the bathrooms but am having a hard time finding the sizes and styles that i want would it be possible to have the mirrors that were on the walls previously cut down a few inchesand framed is there a company that could do that for us we live in the north dallas area as long as the mirrors were not glued to the wall using mastic any mirror company can resize them for you and any frame shop will frame them one potential problem if they have a bevel at the edge you would lose that but you can get exactly what kind of mirror in exactly the size you want simply by calling glass shops telling them the size and bevel you want taking that to a frame shop or even michale's craft stores choosing the frame you desire and they will create the mirror of your dreams Hash table Timber framing Upholstery Glass Mattress Digital photography Door Amateur telescope making Shen Gong Wu Redundant array of independent disks UK Singles Chart Friends Spira Parallax Retailer Wallpaper group Seismic retrofit McMansion Laserdisc CPU cache Yevon Hamster Time dilation Electrophysiology Manila Radio controlled airplane Solar power Sextant Floppy disk Digital single-lens reflex cameras Manifold Bicycle frame Shopping Equine conformation Anamorphic widescreen Quicksort Magic (illusion) Virtual memory John Hancock Tower Scale model Sears Holdings Corporation Sears Catalog Home W.I.T.C.H.
