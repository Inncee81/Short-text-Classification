remodelling a small kitchen is ikea a good place to go for design product and installation they seem to know so much about getting the maximum out of a very small area we are in a very small condo renovated used to be the top floor of a home with bedrooms and a bathroom now it has an office kitchen and an living dining room combo that used to be bedrooms the third floor attic is now the bedroom comments on ikea for everything may help i had a x foot kitchen a typical new york apartment kitchen i bought ikea cabinets i'm very happy with them the real challenge is fitting what you need into a small space i cook every day but still in order to have more in the kitchen i bought a inch wide gas stove i could not cook a big turkey but almost everything else fit the room was inches long and inches wide from the doorway to the back wall here's what i put in the room left side inch wide bosch washing machine inch wide spacemaker dishwasher with a mandatory double sink this is a ge product where the washer is size only on the top rack to accommodate the sink it's hard to find even on the ge website but it does exist the sink is actually on top of the counter and the dw is right underneath inch bosch clothes dryer above this cabinet layout i put in akarum cabinets with aluminium frame frosted glass doors from ikea on the right side a inch wide refrigerator freezer typical apartment size a inch cabinet with one drawer and a slide out thing for trash behind the door underneath the drawer a inch gas stove with oven a inch cabinet with all drawers above these i put in more akarum cabinet with aluminium frosted glass doors i had plenty of counterspace granite but i had to keep extra pans in a box in the hall closet because in the lower area i had very little storage i wanted a washer and dryer more than storage ikea's cabinets look good and wear well they have wonderful inserts for drawers they also have a metallic rod you can put on a backplash to hang utensils nicely if you don't need the w d in the kitchen you would have many more cabinet options the only thing about ikea that is a pain is the assembly of the cabinets it's not hard but you really need two people you could also try home depot as they are also very very helpful if you go to the store on a not busy weekend day good luck small spaces are a challenge do not go to either store without having exact measurements height of ceiling included also exact locations of gas if used pipe outlets plumbing lines make a rough drawing with all elements window door and they will tell you what you can put in this room and where another kitchen i did when i last moved was through home depot and they sent someone to my apartment to actually measure the room for me i bought kraftmaid white cabinets below solid doors and white cabinets above with rippled glass above the thing about really small rooms is to keep it light in this second kitchen i only put top cabinets on one side because i wanted to avoid the tunnel look and for the top cabinets i used a combination of solid doors for foodstuffs and glass doors for dishes glasses this kitchen is very narrow in one part but it is an l shape so it's not too cramped the glass helps to keep the room looking somewhat spacious even though it really isn't everything that can be put away helps to keep the look uncluttered so keep in mind trash receptacles so that the floor space has only floor and not trashcans simple tiling or stone or solid core counters in neutral shades are also space making keep everything simple Refrigerator Stairway Basement The Brady Bunch Frankfurt kitchen McMansion Japanese tea ceremony Upholstery Drill bit Chatsworth House Stove Door Dundas Square Solar power Sento Passenger car Glossary of firefighting equipment Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Floppy disk Tire Lighting Dormitory Textile manufacturing Wilton House Mattress Dishwasher Abbey Hogwarts Floor Directory Japanese toilet Plastic Bus models used in New York City Transit Cuisine of Denmark Flush toilet Bristol Grammar School Casting Chair In-N-Out Burger Dairy Bong Queensbridge Dance Dance Revolution The Time Machine Buckingham Palace Changeroom Portable stove Billiards Kedleston Hall Elevator White House Thermal power station Toilet Brewery Knife Glass Carbon dioxide Bungalow Table saw Dog agility Equine conformation Strap-on dildo Spark plug Fire fighting Marching band Aluminium Screw Mouse (computing) Shotgun house Air-raid shelter The Star Wars Holiday Special Sears Holdings Corporation Combine (Half-Life 2) King Khalid International Airport Electrical wiring Wood carving Window Loudspeaker Microwave oven Apollo Command/Service Module Grand Central Terminal View camera Solar cell Le Corbusier HVAC De Lorean DMC-12 Shaggy dog story House RISC Car handling Dishwashing Rathfarnham Anchor
