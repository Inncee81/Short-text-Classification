are granite countertops that lay over existing counters a good alternative to tearing out existing i have seen a couple websites where they do this and they look pretty good what is the difference in price and durability and would you recommend the difference is that the ones that lay over existing countertops are granite tiles whereas the other option would be replacing the whole countertop with a granite slab the difference in price is astronomical granite tiles run about per tile whereas a granit slab will cost thousands of dollars the tiles look pretty good but you will see grout lines and people will know you cheaped out the slab looks awesome but is it worth the price the tiles will be durable but you may have to clean the grout lines once in a while if you go with dark grout lines it will be better and get the tiles layed close together with very small grout lines and they won't be that noticeable i've seen both looks and they both look great but if you can afford it go with the slab good luck Granite Seismic retrofit Dundas Square Tile Mahjong Microeconomics Plastic Ra (board game) Wallpaper group Pavement (material) Supply and demand Bicycle lighting Kitchen Inflation Asbestos Hydrogen economy Boston and Lowell Railroad Space Shuttle program MMORPG Warhammer 40,000 $ale of the Century Hyperinflation Acquire Gross domestic product Scrabble Autonomous building Goodness and value theory Arbitrage Economics Money Jaipur MTR Masonry United States dollar coin Self-replication Solar power Roof San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Nintendo Entertainment System Sento Toronto-Dominion Centre Taikyoku shogi Broadband Internet access Tai shogi Heinkel He 100 JPEG Euro Discworld gods Coin collecting Future energy development Price Abydos, Egypt Gold as an investment Tessellation Tax Transformation problem Blackjack Inkjet printer Sydney Opera House Hypatia of Alexandria Tulip mania Turquoise Alhambra (board game) Rail tracks Economy of the United States Open cluster Nacre Gold standard London Underground Oscilloscope Heuristic (computer science) Translational symmetry Free trade Labor theory of value Rail transport United States dollar British small press comics The Price Is Right Rathfarnham Maka dai dai shogi Intellectual property Lionel Corporation Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Rummikub Arguments for and against drug prohibition Dominoes Gramophone record Real estate economics Single Transferable Vote Pai Gow St Albans Cathedral E85 Economy of Russia Andes Linux Rapid transit Anchor Plate tectonics
