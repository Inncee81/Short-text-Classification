where can i sell cabinet knobs and pulls i've got hundreds of metal cabinet knobs and pulls i've identified the exact products and they tend to sell for at the cheapest and the msrp is apiece they're opened and they have the screws i'm wondering where i can sell them at least apiece don't say ebay because the weight of the knobs will make the shipping cost just about as much as the knobs i've searched online but found nothing i'm thinking that home depot lowes or maybe even a pawn shop may buy them but i'm not sure about how much they would pay this sounds like flea market material or an ad in a local shopper's guide to me another thought would be to try to sell them to a cabinet or custom furniture maker Bulk vending Bass guitar Retailer Tesco Online marketing Amazon.com Microsoft Office Violin Shopping Electric guitar The Apprentice 2 Electrical wiring Day trading Wal-Mart Fender Telecaster Sears Holdings Corporation Upholstery Online shop Search engine optimization Guitar Drill bit Network effect Pawnbroker Outsourcing Planned obsolescence Illegal drug trade Plastic Berkshire Hathaway Alfred Weber Knife Fountain pen Neopets Airsoft Musical box Online auction business model Insurance Costco Dot-com Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Public transport Price discrimination Philatelic investment Internet fraud Wayne Corporation Manila Cabinet making Monopoly Carburetor Gramophone record Credit card Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Hydrogen economy Gross domestic product Phonograph cylinder Arbitrage PlayStation 2 Public good Vending machine Microeconomics Atari 8-bit family IKEA PowerPC Aldi Diving regulator Tire First-sale doctrine Woodworking Advertising De Lorean DMC-12 Supermarket Economics Uranium Supply and demand Screw Inflation Commodore International Sten Mercedes-Benz S-Class Textbook Red Hot Chili Peppers MMORPG IBM PC compatible Western concert flute IBook O scale Money Lighting Propeller DaimlerChrysler smart Comic book collecting Citigroup GeForce 6 Series Sweatshop Gaia Online Cost accounting MAME Doorknob Short selling M16 (rifle)
