have bought a pc suite from major retailer which all cracked and am unhappy with the repair my suite was months olds at time of complaint which was that all the seat pads and footrests had cracked and split i was told this was cos of the leather being from the belly of the cow they have replaced the seat pads but where my settee is cream the replaced parts look nearly yellow i have refused the settee and told them very clearly i am unhappy with it and that it will not be coming into my house have also threatened to cancel standing order but this will only blacklist me have told them i either want a replacement or refund and will go elsewhere any advice will be welcome as i dont really know where i stand also they did say if the complaint was in first days it would be a straight replacement or money back but cos its npt then they only have to repair it but the colour difference is so different its like different settees these are clearly faulty goods and they cannot refuse you a refund on these or a full replacement consumer rights are on your side and they are taking the michael if goods prove faulty within in a reasonable period and damage is not due to standard wear and tear goods are considered faulty you are completely within your rights to refuse the sofa and if they blacklist you they are breaking the law the day thing is total rubbish this is not a reasonable time the belly of the cow thing is also total rubbish if the leather is properly treated this would not happen no matter where the leather came from and how would they know where it did come from they're just fibbing to try to get you to go away threaten to contact citizens advice or a solicitor and make sure that they are aware that you know your rights and that they are at fault put everything in writing keep records and stand firm you also may want to consider contacting a consumers column in a newspaper or magazine the press can make things move surprisingly swiftly Chair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Poker jargon Plame affair Bob and George Volleyball Warranty Upholstery Dairy Blur Barrister 2005 trial of Michael Jackson SCO-Linux controversies Leather R46 (New York City Subway car) Royal Assent Hard disk Gramophone record Slander and libel Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Politics of Canada Welding Sydney Riot of 1879 Animal rights British nationality law Disc brake Price discrimination George Costanza Contract John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Trigonometric function Equine conformation Appeal Product recall Jackass: The Movie Seismic retrofit M16 (rifle) EastEnders Scots law 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Episodes of Lost (Season 1) U.S. presidential election, 2000 Ernst Z__ndel Rosa Parks President of Ireland Tire Breastfeeding Fair Game (Scientology) AMD Violin Same-sex marriage in Canada Bush Supreme Court candidates Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2005 United States Grand Prix John Kerr Corset Inflation Divorce Freedom of the press Advance Wars: Dual Strike Microeconomics Suplex Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Philosophical skepticism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Trademark Property (ownership right) Knots Landing Buckingham Palace Public good Texas Revolution Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Canadian House of Commons The Yardbirds Status of religious freedom in France Trigonometric identity Heinkel He 112 Octopus card Judicial review Free trade James Hanratty The Amazing Race Draw poker Clothing Henry Cow Lawyer Year 2000 problem Ultimate Spider-Man Best Buy Otakon Oil-for-Food Programme Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Tennis Heinkel He 100 Strap-on dildo
