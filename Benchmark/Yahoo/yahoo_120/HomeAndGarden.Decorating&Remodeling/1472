pool table or home theater i have a l room in the basement and i cant decide weather to make it into a pool room or a home theater both just wont fit what would you rather have i think it depends on what type of socializing you do we have a pool table and a space for a future poker gaming table next to the kegerator and wet bar because we like to have friends over and drink talk socialize and play games if you don't like to talk to people much or are just a fan of movies then i'd say go for the home theater and i think location is everything our stuff is on the main floor where we socialize so it does get used the neighbor teens even come over to play on it too when they come over to visit their dad in our old house we had it in our bonus room upstairs and again it did get used but not as frequently and i will say it was a bummer when we did have a big party and some were up and some were down Basement Draw poker Betting (poker) Ron and Fez Billiards The Brady Bunch Customs and etiquette of Japan Craps Poker Slot machine The Adventures of Pete & Pete Kitchen RuneScape quests President (game) RuneScape locations Bristol Grammar School Grandview, U.S.A.
