what are some good decorating ideas for a church's youth room we have a small budget and youth group and two small rooms to work with and ideas go to lowes walmart or home depot and look for a neutral color in some oops paint the oops paint is paint that someone mixed and the customer wouldn't buy it for whatever reason it typically costs about a gallon find one or two complimentary colors maybe paint each wall a different color then buy several bottles of craft paint from walmart they always have craft paint on clearance and regularly they range in price from cents to get several of those and then let the students paint bible scene murals draw out your scenes on paper first to get everyone on the same page then draw them on the wall in pencil then paint them get some alphabet stamps they come in sheets of plastic that have perforated edges to separate the letters i hot glue golf tees or screws to the back so that i have something to hold on to when stamping out words use the alphabet stamps to put bible verses that corespond with your art on the wall with them or paint the top half of the wall one color and the bottom half another use a long carpenters ruler to measure from the floor all the way around small dots then use the same ruler and a level to draw a straight line connecting the dots that gives you a midway point in the room you can stamp a design on that line to serve as a divider or tape the line with masking tape then measure about four inches away from that line and draw another to tape paint a contrasting color inside the tape or sponge a contrasting color inside the tape to make a chair rail of sorts hot glue strips of thick cork board up to tack bible art that the students make or buy cheap old pictures from yard sales and then take the old art out and place student art inside to really spruce it up spray paint the frames and then buy mats to paint as well to place inside the frame and give the art a nice border or use a long carpenter ruler and a level to draw lines from floor to ceiling about every six to eight inches then tape off the lines with masking tape put in x with tape inside every other line and paint all the others to make stripes then decorate with framed artwork bible verses in calligraphy and so on practice making stripes or stamping words on poster board or walls you will paint over first that way you can perfect your techniques try bhg com or lowes com for more decorating ideas good luck and god bless shannon psalms Drawing Violin Mattress Traditional animation Japanese tea ceremony Billiards Carpet Upholstery Stairway Wood carving Art Casting Wal-Mart Printed circuit board Guitar Plastic Brewery Atari 8-bit family Seismic retrofit Drill bit Wallpaper group Scale model Textile manufacturing terminology Knife Radio controlled airplane Comics Postage stamp Hangul Fire fighting Table tennis Tire Chair Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Typewriter Mosaic Timpani Compact audio cassette Billboard (advertising) Volleyball Bong Calligraphy Bicycle frame Sukkot Timber framing Paper size Mail Lighting Union Pacific Railroad Woodworking Textile manufacturing Sento Door Cello Glass Poker jargon Ship model Gramophone record Floppy disk Drew Struzan Wilton House Professional wrestling slang Wood Supply and demand Slide rule Heraldry Lane Piet Mondrian Redundant array of independent disks Fan (implement) Snooker Tax Leather Professional wrestling throws Bread Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Glossary of American football Surrealist techniques Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Stucco Kitchen Dog agility Eastern Orthodox Church Pencil Graffiti Sega Saturn Christmas tree School bus Rathfarnham Lionel Corporation Professional wrestling match types Screw Wayne Corporation Polymer clay M.C.
