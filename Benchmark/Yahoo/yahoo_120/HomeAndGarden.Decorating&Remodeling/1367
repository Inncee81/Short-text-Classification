what do i do next i just had a deck built and was wondering if i need to treat the lumber or stain it we have a log house and lots of deck we have tried all sorts of seals that would wear off in a year but we finally found the best superdeck you can get it with stain in it i would suggest that you choose a stain a bit lighter than what you want because the elements will darken it sealing it will protect the wood as well as the financial investment that you made in building your deck good luck Upholstery Skateboard Quicksort Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Lumber Star Trek Customizable Card Game Wood Canoe Yu-Gi-Oh!
