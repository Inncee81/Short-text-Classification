can you tell me how to figure proportion to buy artwork i have vaulted ceilings with pretty large walls how do i figure out what size of artwork so that it won't look lost or overpowering thanks for the panel idea i had thought of that too but wasn't sure a friend of mine has a relatively small living room but it has vaulted ceilings the dimensions are probably x as a guess and there's a fireplace on the wall along the center of the house a bay window and the front door on the wall opposite that doorway to kitchen and hall on the third wall and opposite that nothing he hung a panel oriental work separate panels each about ' wide and maybe ' tall on the wall with nothing on it and he hung a large hand woven striped patterned blanket that had colors that matched his couches on the central wall in the large empty area between the fireplace and the nothing wall the blanket would maybe cover a twin bed with some overhang on the sides so it'd be about ' wide and ' long it's hung with the long edges on top and bottom this works well the panels take up all the wall they're on but they are not one huge imposing picture the blanket is large but it's all pattern and it's soft so it's not imposing either Kitchen Wilton House Wood carving Abbey Fan (implement) Molding (decorative) Sento McMansion Chatsworth House Lighting Apollo Command/Service Module Seismic retrofit Chaco Culture National Historical Park Combine (Half-Life 2) Shotgun house Sistine Chapel Volleyball Rococo Irish Houses of Parliament Billboard (advertising) Potton Tudorbethan architecture The Time Machine Mattress Sicilian Baroque Chair Drill bit M.C.
