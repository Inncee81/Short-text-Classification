painting white over blue wall diaster after having my bedroom blue for quite some time i decided to paint it all white thinking it was a simple task i bought some white emulsion and a roller and started to paint over the blue however the blue is showing through in patches even after painting over it several times at this point i searched online for the reason and read some articles about painting over darker paint and some suggested to use a 'primer' what can i do now can i just paint the primer all over the white paint help yes you can paint the primer over the new paint you might want to consider using a primer like kilz which is made to hide everything on a wall before you paint i once covered a streak of red on a white wall with kilz and then painted the wall light blue no problem Paint Color theory Color Primer (paint) Sundial Blue Piet Mondrian Cell (biology) Lighting Computer virus Ultima Online Paul Is Dead Wilton House Alhambra Impressionism Rock and roll Camouflage Iris (anatomy) Internal ballistics Wallpaper group Mouse (computing) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Combine (Half-Life 2) RuneScape quests NX bit Eye Primer (molecular biology) Cartridge (firearms) Grace Cossington Smith Toronto Blue Jays Handloading Chinese character Kirby: Canvas Curse Butterfly Blood on the Tracks Copland Winning Streak Vincent van Gogh CPU design Comanche Computer chess Gmail Color temperature Tag Formula One regulations 2D computer graphics Hubble Deep Field Canadian Armed Forces Union Pacific Railroad Birthmark Wood Abstraction National Library for the Blind Wassily Kandinsky Stone Age Sequencing Autostereogram Wrigley Field Cognitive science Squash (sport) Pink Floyd Burroughs B5000 Thread (computer science) Philosophical Investigations Rayleigh scattering Pigment Mary Cassatt IFK G__teborg Frans Hals Tomb Raider Forth programming language Flag of Denmark White House Gesso Microsoft Windows Penske Racing Sega Saturn Yellow Light-emitting diode Lightning Hip hop culture Bubble Bobble Hand grenade Ultramarine Black Leather Carpet Dynamical system Mona Lisa Dragon Booster I Want to Hold Your Hand Lake District Brett Whiteley Gamut Black body Fluorescent lamp Aliens of London Cryptography Carolina Panthers
