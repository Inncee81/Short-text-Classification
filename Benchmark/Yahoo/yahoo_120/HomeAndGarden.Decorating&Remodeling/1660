pink kitchen i am thinking of painting my kitchen with a pinkish red color is it too juvenile or do you think it would be something fun and different it would be fun if it goes with the rest of your house and if you like it depends on the flooring and cabinetry i have seen a color such as you are describing in a very modern kitchen with modern white cabinets and lots of steel the house had a lot of colorful modern artwork so as a whole it looked very hip however if you are talking about slapping up such a wild color in a house with nothing else going for it i think it would look out of place just make sure the color is complimentary to the surroundings and you should be fine the most important thing is that you personally enjoy it and can live with it Color Rose Pink Kitchen Eight ball Billiards Lighting Stanton Macdonald-Wright Clown Brewery The Emancipation of Mimi Kimi Finster Color theory Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Linear Pottery culture Opportunity rover Grace Cossington Smith Labrador Retriever Arcade cabinet My Little Pony Social rule Art Cabinet Aerial (dance move) House Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Cabinet making Frankfurt kitchen Tag Columbine High School massacre Paint Drew Struzan Scottish country dance Traditional animation Aliens of London Garfield Blood on the Tracks Billy Childish Pottery Brett Whiteley Comics About a Boy Qualia McMansion Yellow Black (people) Wood carving Shaggy dog story Spontaneous human combustion Piet Mondrian Rayleigh scattering Plastic Red Light-emitting diode Blackface Dog Hogwarts Floor Directory Sundial Pittsburgh Steelers Casting Pump It Up Care Bears Mid-levels The Invisibles Xanadu House Theory of conduct Pink Floyd Buffalo Bills The Brady Bunch James McNeill Whistler Iris (anatomy) Pok__mon (video games) Lindy Hop Beavis and Butt-head Little Britain Pig 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chucky Pancamo Bass guitar Human skin color Cabinet of the United Kingdom Double bass In-N-Out Burger Orca Crayola Pac-Man Squidward Tentacles Stove Border Collie Technology Hell's Kitchen (television) Race of Jesus Gamut University of North Dakota Set Fancy rat Academic art Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Bristol Grammar School
