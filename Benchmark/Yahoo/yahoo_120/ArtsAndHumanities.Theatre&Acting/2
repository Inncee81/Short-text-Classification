acting plz answer i really want to become an actress but i am to scared to tell anyone in my family therefore i can't get any advise on how to get into the acting career please if you have any idea on how to get into the profession let me know thanks so much hi speaking as a parent i would be pretty disappointed if my kids felt they couldn't tell me about things that are important to them it might be tough but i would advise you to tell your parents anyway talk about it have a look a the answer i gave to a girl who wrote and said that she was having a difficult time convincing her parents to support her decision to become an actor first i'll give you a couple of free resources on my website for actors and then i will share with you the answer i gave to the girl who is probably around your age if you do a search here on answers you will see other answers to this question as it comes up usually a couple of times each day i answer this question a lot and so instead of writing the same or similar answers over and over again i have created an ebooklet that will give you a lot of intormation as to what you need to do to get started just go to http www actingcareerstartup com acs blog html sign in on the right side of the page and you can download it for free it's called what it takes to become an actor the second resource is about getting an agent although if you have no training yet then i doubt that you are ready but here it is anyway http www actingcareerstartup com how to get an agent html it takes you through a process that i used to get two agents and a personal manager in a short period of time in new york using the same process i also got casting directors to actually start calling me in directly for auditions and now the answer but i'll tell you something in a nutshell what could help you to feel more comfortable about talking to them about it is information here you go hi there what do you think would really make your parents start to take you seriously and support you do they know what actors do really do they know what it's like being an actor do they know what you really have to go through to become an actor do you know the answers to those questions do you know what it's like and what the issues actors face what it's like to work on set what your chances are of just getting work how hard you'll have to work how much you will have to invest of your time and energy to study to do mailings to write cover letters to submit yourself for auditions to prepare for auditions prepare your monologues bone up on your cold reading skills take specialization classes travel etc do you know what the average earnings are of an actor these days do you know how many days on the average an actor works do you know what it takes to become an actor and do you have what it takes have a look at the following links http www actingcareerstartup com to see some of the issues actors face while trying to get work http www actingcareerstartup com working as an actor html to see what it can be like day to day looking for work http www actingcareerstartup com a working actor html to see what it was like for me once on the set of an independent film that s just a start i strongly encourage you to talk to other actors both working and struggling as well it will help you in your education that's a lot of questions i know and i asked them on purpose why because if you can start to answer all those questions maybe you will be more convincing i know you're young but you have to get started sometime some teenagers have someone who is an adult and who supports them in their goals you don't so you can either keep butting heads with your parents or being afraid to approach the subject or you can start to find out things for yourself in other words the more information you have the more informed you are about what you say you want the more you can talk about it intelligently and demonstrate that you know what you are talking about the greater your chances of being able to convince them to support you if they havejust as much information as you do then you are on an equal playing field they are your parents they're bigger they're older they have the money they win at least until you re out of the house or until they no longer foot your bills is that the way you want it no then get a move on and start doing your homework does doing your homework mean that you will get what you want in the end not necessarily your parents are certainly taking into consideration your best interests but even if you don't get them to support you you will know a lot more than you do now about the profession you say you want to pursue good luck tony ceo http www actingcareerstartup com World Wide Web Plame affair Divorce GED Avenue Q Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Scientology beliefs and practices Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Enterprise content management Milton H.
