i think i regret somthing ive done ok im wiccan and this two guys would always start stuff with me like talk crap on me cuz im bi and stuff spread lies around campus we live in jobcorp in longbeach its a school were you live at and get a good education for thos who struggle in life well i was tired of there shit so i cast a spell on them to control there malefactor and i wanted them to get kicked out so badly and yesterday they ended up getting kicked out i kind of feel bad yet i dont am i in the wrong well first off i have been following this path for over years it would be difficult for me to address the bisexuality issue as i am straight i guess the only thing i can say there is to hang in there and be true to yourself high school is tough enough without all the crap you have to put up with if you are different as far as the spell casting and knowing that my path leans more towards paganism i still believe in the threefold rule whatever is done to you will come back to you three times over your spell may or may not have had anything to do with the fact these boys were suspended or expelled it depends on the spell and how when you cast it their own actions caused their expulsion chances are very good that you did not do it call it karma call it fate but you can put the fault on those boys who violated the rule i don't know if you have had much practice spell casting but there is a lot more to it than most believe please continue learning more about your spiritual beliefs and the path you wish to take brightest of blessings to you Wicca Karma Theory of conduct Shit Craps Humphrey Bogart Determinism YuYu Hakusho Scientology beliefs and practices Magic (paranormal) Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Luck Religious Society of Friends Year of the Spider Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Goodness and value theory Fast bowling Jon Secada Karma in Hinduism EastEnders Time Out of Mind Curse Social rule Ten Commandments Simone Weil Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Witchcraft Avenue Q Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Equine conformation Hip hop rivalries Objective-C Wiccan Rede Friends Singlish Boston Public Satanism Religious pluralism Pitaten Human sexual behavior Buddhism True Crime: Streets of LA Kyle Broflovski Dog agility God It's Walky!
