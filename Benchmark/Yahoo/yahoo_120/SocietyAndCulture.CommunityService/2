how can i make my polish accent less noticeable ok so i came over to us over years ago lots of ppl tells me that my english is very good when they find out that i've been here only years i have the same feeling and i'm very proud of that however i have polish accent ppl don't realize that right away when i don't say much but when i say a lot at once they do realize and ask me where i'm from cuz i have an accent this kind of annoy me even though i'm not stupid and know that i won't lose my accent right away or maybe even at all besides i think that ppl treat me less seriously when they find out of my accent my accent isn't hard and ppl understand me quiet well i'm now and will be off to college next year i think that my accent may cause me problems in the future for instance with finding a girlfriend anyways i heard that i could use a help of a speech therapist if so how much would that cost and will it really help understand that my accent isn't a problem in communication but still it kind of throws me off i used to be an accent coach for koreans that came to america to help them lose their accent i charged an hour and i never ran out of customers i have only a germanic languages degree english is a germanic language and i also won a korean national speech contest against native speakers and i am a white guy but other than that i had no linguistics experience that means if you find someone who specializes in accent coaching they could cost a lot more than me the first thing is understanding how you make a sound in polish so you can unlearn it in english unfortunately i don't know polish so i can't tell you that but i can tell you that the n sound in korean and the n sound in english are exactly the same and have the same ipa spelling see the first link however the n sound is slightly different in the two languages because koreans make the n sound by pressing their tongue against their teeth rather than the roof of their mouth since you probably didn't study grade school polish you are going to have to go back and learn some many of my clients could not speak korean without a thick american accent and likewise could not speak english without a thick korean accent so don't feel alone in that feeling stupid treatment you have been getting once they learned exactly how to pronounce a word talking about linguistically ie where you put your tongue how much you open your throat how much breath you should use they found it much easier to mask their korean accents this is what you need to do find a book on linguistics and become familiar with terms that are particular to polish and english pronunciation it should address how you make all the sounds in polish which it would if you address all of the usual phonetic values and other phonetic values on the nd link practice your american accent at a free site i've linked one as the third linke below practice your polish pronunciation even if you can no longer speak polish by finding someone that has professional polish speaking material you can use i can't help too much with that one but you might try a site like my th link only after you can recognize and pronounce all of the sounds in polish even if you can no longer speak the language and after you can recognize and pronounce all of the sounds in english use the ipa notations to recognize different sounds are you ready for an accent coach just google accent coach or put an advertisement in the paper it is an unfortunate state of our society that if we don't speak either proper english with an american accent or ghetto english with a street accent that everyone thinks you are stupid so i agree it will probably cause problems in the future if you don't work on it i hope my post helps you to take steps in
