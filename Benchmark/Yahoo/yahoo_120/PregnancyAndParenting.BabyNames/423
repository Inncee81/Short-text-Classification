what do you think of the boy's name tyde pronouced tide like with the oceans lol my friend is letting me name her baby boy and keeps changing the rules first she wanted the middle name to be ocean then it was hard to find a good name so she said it could be either kai or ocean and that was hard to so she wants something that has something to do with the ocean any other water like names would be appreciated and middle name suggestions for tyde would be great thanks and fyi i'm excited to be naming her baby she's letting me not making me i think its beautiful and dont listen to everyone saying that hes going to be made fun of because first of all we are in a new generation and there are lots of strange and unfamiliar names going around since everyone is trying to pick something original and second of all your child should be raised with enough confidence and pride that he she doesnt fall apart when someone connects their name to a brand name of laundry detergent in fact i think it would be fine if you don't change the i to a y tide on its own is good and people will get used to it as he gets older girls will probably find it sexy lol maybe he'll have a nickname like rip tide or something i liked the suggestion above by roy oz to use dylan as the middle name its a beautiful name for a boy but especially as the middle name since its meaning is connected to the ocean good luck and have fun Atomic Kitten Tide Empire Burlesque Social rule Infidels Little Britain Friends Time Out of Mind Sharon Tate Anchor Frankie Laine The Fairly OddParents Laundry detergent Ecco the Dolphin Love and Theft Joke Norway national football team The Rutles LOL (Internet slang) Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Jon Secada The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Okashina Okashi RuneScape quests Electrophysiology EastEnders Rod Stewart AFI 100 Years series The Beach Boys American girl dolls One Piece minor characters Knife The Fast Show Shaggy dog story Star Ocean: The Second Story Law & Order Winning Streak The Dukes of Hazzard Video game music Sea level rise Jennifer Lopez Cliff Richard Moon Kimi Finster Endless Summer (album) Legal research Sex and the City The Beatles discography Kodocha Infantilism Pitaten Ron and Fez The One With the East German Laundry Detergent Toa Transsexuality Aerial (dance move) Highway 61 Revisited Academy Award for Original Music Score Rocko's Modern Life April Fool's Day Jam (TV series) Cosmo Kramer Urusei Yatsura Indian English Grumpy's Three Wishes Roy Orbison Charles Goodyear Girly Shut Down Volume 2 Teen Girl Squad Spice Girls Rave Master Ray Charles Cruising (maritime) Triple J Hottest 100, 2003 FLCL Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Contender (television series) Termina The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Laundry Pet Sounds Charmed Family name The Cure Avenue Q Kyle Broflovski Sin City Hudson River The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Causality Sand art and play Swingout Timon and Pumbaa Sea level
