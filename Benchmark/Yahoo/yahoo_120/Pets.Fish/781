beta fish and how to care for them we went to wal mart last night and spent about a half an hour filling beta fish bowls with water about of the bowls had maybe an inch of water in them and the fish were practically swimming on there sides not to mention that there were several dead i have no idea how to care for these fish and i am sure that the straight tap water was not the best for them but was better than none can anyone tell me if this is okay for them to not have much water and how to care for them because i am considering going back and saving a few i got my betta from wal mart too it was in this little bitty cup that could have held almost twice as much water as what the walmart people choose to put in it i took it home and it seems to like it's bigger tank a whole lot better than that itty bitty cup you could probably save one's life by taking it home and putting it in a bigger tank but please keep in mind that you can't put more than one betta in a tank unless they're both females also if you put tap water in it's tank don't forget to use a water conditioner to dechlorinate it i feed mine twice a day small amounts each time but please don't overfeed because that could cloud it's tank verry badly or it could get really fat and die one more thing even though alot of people say that you can put a mirror up to your bettas tank just to watch it flare up but i wouldn't do that because it stresses them out and makes them verry mad cya and have lots of fun Sea-Monkey Wal-Mart Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Little Britain Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Theory of conduct Brewery Solar power Cruising (maritime) Characters in the Smurfs About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Axolotl Norway national football team Garfield Blood (computer game) Poker jargon Swimming Vegeta Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Thermal power station Stanley Cup Autonomous building Aquarium Japanese tea ceremony Haibane Renmei Time Out of Mind Customs and etiquette of Japan Menstrual cup The Amber Spyglass Blonde on Blonde Internal ballistics Empire Burlesque Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Conker's Bad Fur Day Diving Craps Sewage treatment Clownfish Crystal Palace F.C.
