live plants in an aquarium my nephew just gave me these two seed pod for some kind of grassy plant that grows quite tall a sword plant or something like that i do not have any live plants in my tank now it is a gallon tank i have had it months and no casualities as of yet and would like to keep it that way he has live plants in his but his water is not that clear is it the plants doing that he tells me that it is good for nitrates etc will plants attribute to making my water more prone to algae should i throw these pods in don't want to screw up my crystal clear water yet he tells me not to obsess over crystal clear water hey i love aquariums i have at the moment a gallon a gallon and a med tank gallon i think a planted aquarium looks much better as per your question no plants do not aid in the production of alge sunlight is the key factor there in lies the conundrum you have to provide adequate light for your plants to grow yet you don't want to provide so much light that you grow alge the key is the position of the tank keep it away from windows or direct sunlight turn your lights off at night when you go to bed this will do two things it will help the fish to relax lowering their stress levels which could cause them to get sick it will reduce the chances of an alge bloom btw your nephew is correct to a certain extent the alge does give nutrients for the fish but an adequate and varied diet is a better way to keep your fish healthy Marine aquarium Eutrophication Autonomous building Illegal drug trade Sea-Monkey Nutrient Carnivorous plant Cannabis cultivation Biodiesel Sewage treatment Solar power Coral reef Photosynthesis Lake Bottlenose Dolphin Chlorophyta Veganism Cyanide E85 Solar panel Orca Soil pH Acorn Hydroponics Reef tank Goldfish Ecology Plant Hydrogen economy Brewery Simone Weil Antarctic krill Coronary heart disease Tilapia Sunlight Shrimp farm Discus (fish) Vegetarianism Pachypodium Milk Renewable energy Chronic fatigue syndrome Diatom Sorghum Hamster Fertilizer Nutrition Flax Fossil fuel power plant Plankton Hemp Algae Organic farming Irrigation Gasoline Thermal power station Prostate cancer Clownfish Vitamin C Jellyfish Carbon dioxide sink Mattress Airport Lake Burley Griffin Fancy rat Weed control T-34 Desert Folic acid Pansy Pebble bed reactor Krill Dairy Social rule Futurama (TV series - season 2) Light pollution Aikido Theory of conduct Vegetarian nutrition Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kelp forest Titanium Orchidaceae Apple Fugu Honey Liquid crystal Fire fighting Future energy development Ecco the Dolphin Breastfeeding Biogeochemical cycle Environmental concerns with electricity generation
