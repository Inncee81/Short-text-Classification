how long to cycle marine tank i have a set up and just put in two damsels how long to cycle the time will vary are you using live rock or live sand inthe tank these will cut the time since they already have the bacteria you're trying to establish you can also shorten the time a little by raising the temperature but how high you can go will depend on what's in the tank if it's just the fish you can probably go up to o or so if you adjust the temperature slowly and have good areation if you have live rock with nice inverts you may not want to go over o in general the process can take from just a week or two with the live rock or sand to weeks without whenever the nitrate is the only product detectable no ammonia or nitrite you're finished note because damsels other than chromis are aggressive and territorial it can be a problem to add other fish to the tank after they've been the only fish in it for a month or so they'll have claimed the entire tank as their territory Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Ammonia Nitrogen Fish farming Hydrogen economy Brewery Water purification Nitric acid Solar variation Eutrophication Polymerase chain reaction Nitrogen cycle Sodium nitrite Shrimp farm Ice core Transformer Hydrogen sulfide Nuclear power Carbon dioxide Explosive material Shark Photosynthesis Dairy Gas turbine Reef tank Fish Fossil fuel power plant Menstrual cycle Uranium Gasoline Thermal power station Water Drill bit PID controller Electrophysiology Tank Nuclear reactor Extreme Programming Curing Town gas Tidal power Ammonium nitrate E85 Fire fighting Omega-3 fatty acid Alternative biochemistry Sake Pottery Jet engine Flood geology Aquarium Cyanide Potassium nitrate Alternative fuel Titanium Biodiesel Operation Barbarossa Coral reef Brewing Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Soil pH Earth's atmosphere Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Yom Kippur War Ceramics Ham Dry cleaning Plankton Tank locomotive Alkane Nuclear fusion Methanol Keynesian economics Oxyacetylene Phase (matter) CPU cache Cellular respiration Tofu Rebreather Food preservation Iron Hubble Space Telescope Pebble bed reactor Anchor Hebrew calendar Desert Soil life Internal ballistics Patton tank Ecology Bacon Compost Sun History of the tank Battle of Kursk Refrigerator
