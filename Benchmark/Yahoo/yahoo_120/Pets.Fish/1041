i just got a few more fish tanks one tank has a mirrored background that is starting to come off i would like to remove the whole background of the mirrored tank i have used a blade which takes off the gray part but there is still a gold tint after that any suggestions that have been tried and true would be great thanks using very fine steel wool and some warm soapy water you may be able to get it off goo gone is another good bet but it may be that the glass or plastic was made with the gold tinting in it and it may not be removable there is a trick that is used to remove car tinting that may also be useful here you need a warm place preferably direct sunlight undiluted ammonia a garbage bag big enough to fit over the tinted area and fine steel wool lay the tank on its front tinted side up and in direct sunlight spray the ammonia over the tinted area and cover with the garbage bag so the ammonia doesn't dry out let it sit for about an hour and then scrub a small part with the steel wool if the gold comes up then you can do that to the entire thing just make sure you do it bit by bit with the garbage bag still over the undone parts so the ammonia doesn't dry out if it doesn't come up then i'd say that the tint is part of the glass Textile manufacturing Dialysis Bong Lake District Sunglasses Solar power Autonomous building Ammonia Dundas Square Dinghy Casting Bedbug Energy development Wok Mattress Marine aquarium Brewery Fossil fuel power plant Knife Space habitat Confidence trick Characters in the Smurfs Lighting Woodworking Hamster Tire Soap Hydrogen economy Poker jargon Garbage truck Cannabis cultivation Thermal power station Drill bit Glass Genericized trademark Pontiac Trans Sport Dishwasher Airbag Gilding Dishwashing M16 (rifle) Dairy De Lorean DMC-12 Titanium Cyanide Cruising (maritime) Manicure Palace of Westminster Screw Oldsmobile Silhouette Geodesic dome Cocaine Cochineal Japanese tea ceremony Fish farming U.S. ten-dollar bill The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Upholstery Solar panel Knitting Aluminium Yohoho!
