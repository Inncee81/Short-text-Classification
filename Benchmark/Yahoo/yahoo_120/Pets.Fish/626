mixing fish experts or personal experience only please thanks ok so i broke my gallon tank the other night i am upgrading now to a gallon i already have a couple sharks a couple dwarf tiger barbs dwarf guarami catfish and a chinese i think algae eater yes i know thats probably too many fish already ive been told many times anyway my questions is is it possible for my current fish to live in harmony with a few oranda goldfish the only reason i ask is becasue my girlfriends father is giving me the gallon tank the fish filter stand ect for my broken tank and he is using the broken tank for his trantulas i do not want to get rid of these goldfish it would probably be only for a couple of weeks i would appreciate a quick answer as i am getting this tank tomorrow around noon please help thank you ok thanks everyone but im not so much worried that the gold fish will get eaten because they are bigger than my fish my biggest fish is my silver shark wich is about the length of my index finger i am basically worried about the differences in temperatures ph etc that my sharks like compared to what the goldfish like i asked the people at the petstore but i got different answers from everyone i asked all my fish i have right now like each other they play around and they are doing very well except i have my girlfriends fish thier babies and my fish all in a gallon tank and i have more coming tomoroow lol its alot of fish they are all pretty small though i just need to get them out of that small tank the only potential problem you may have would be from the tiger barbs they can be very nippy and may pester the goldfish other than that you should be fine for a few weeks mm Goldfish Marine aquarium Aquarium Biodiesel Shark Brewery RuneScape quests Danio Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hydrogen economy RuneScape skills Extreme Programming Jaws (film) Color E85 Reef tank Tilapia P-47 Thunderbolt Autonomous building Tiger Great White Shark Fire extinguisher Card Sharks Kodocha Alcohol fuel Battle of the Bulge Sin City Basking Shark One Tree Hill (TV series) Koi Conker's Bad Fur Day Avenue Q USS Yorktown (CV-5) Big Brother UK series 6 Viz (comic) Fish Sea-Monkey Dairy Gar Little Britain Phaedo Chopsticks Professional wrestling match types Nile crocodile The Strangerhood Mercury Atlas 6 Krill Shen Gong Wu Social rule Xenomorph Radio Yerevan Space Shuttle program Electrophysiology Tiger Woods Ayyavazhi mythology EastEnders Meaning of life God Emperor of Dune The Empty Child Southeast Asia Chinese Basketball Association The Ashlee Simpson Show Coffee RuneScape Random Events Characters in the Smurfs F-16 Fighting Falcon Finding Nemo AFI 100 Years series Breastfeeding Blur Memorial Stadium, Clemson Sexual orientation Taikyoku shogi Fishing Samuel Goldwyn Game show Mnemonic Knife Transformer Operation Market Garden Creatures in Bionicle YuYu Hakusho M4 Sherman Oily fish Babe Ruth Coming of Age (TNG episode) Churchill tank Sewage treatment The Wildhearts USS Tunny (SS-282) Piccolo Junior Saga Weekly World News Naruto jutsu Inflation Carp Russian joke Night (book) Joke
