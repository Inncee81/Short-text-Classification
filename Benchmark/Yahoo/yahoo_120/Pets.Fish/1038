do the legs on little crabs grow back i got my son little crabs for his fish tank and noticed the female was missing of her legs on one side i feel kinda bad for her and don't have the heart to take her back where she'll die in a fight by losing her other legs on that side and become immobile or walk in circles she only has one long leg on that side the other is her short one in the front kind of like the hand would be she already walks crazy enough will those legs grow back or is she doomed to be a legged crab should i maybe take the males with the big claws back so she stays safe or are they more likely to keep her company or eat our african dwarf frog he stays at the top of the tank and even the placostomus isn't afraid to be right next to a crab but i'd hate for my almost year old to wake up and find bits and pieces of his fish and frogs scattered in the bottom of the tank the guy at the pet store said everything in the tank should go together fine but he also seemed more interested on hitting on a girl with a baby on her hip and a little boy watching too so you never know i would separate the crabs until the legs grow back and yes they will grow back but your right in thinking that he is vulnerable right now with fewer legs set up a small tank for the injured crab most people who keep fish as a hobby will have a hospital tank for situations like this its always better to remove any sick or injured creatures from the community tank just give him a month in the hospital tank and after he molts he will have at least a couple new small legs don't make fun of him i'm sure he will feel awkward lol anyway at that point you can put him back in a hospital tank needs only be a small affair you don't need to go spending a bunch of money on it a gallon tank is usually like bucks and you can buy a simple charcoal filter for another that is fine for one crab for a short time be sure to give him access to land and water and a hiding place he will be all set good luck Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling holds Coconut crab Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Poker jargon Equine conformation American lobster Swingout Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Creatures in Bionicle Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Crab Characters in the Smurfs The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Professional wrestling slang Marine aquarium About a Boy Arthropod Professional wrestling throws The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Humphrey Bogart Rocko's Modern Life Sea-Monkey Conker's Bad Fur Day Craps Vegeta Piccolo Junior Saga Tank Hamster Breaststroke Cruising (maritime) Eddie Guerrero Professional wrestling aerial techniques Avenue Q Paragliding Combine (Half-Life 2) Fishing Mattress Swimming YuYu Hakusho Doom enemies GunBound The Amazing Race One Tree Hill (TV series) Satchel Paige Pitaten Cliff Richard Jon Secada W.I.T.C.H.
