help last week i bought goldfish for my kids i got a gal tank rocks filter plastic plants about days ago we noticed that one of the fish started laying on it's side but it was still able to swim during feeding time now it is haveing a hard time swimming properly and the other fish is getting little black spots on it's face i called the pet store were we pershed the fish and tank and they told me it was because it was a new tank and it did not have the bacteria nessery for healthy fish are our new little pet doomed if that is what they told you they are a poor excuse for a pet store no your new pets are not doomed bacteria is not what keeps fish healthy water changes are what keep fish healthy the bacteria helps to keep the water quality better for the fish and actually lives by eating the ammonia produced by the fish waste and uneaten food that decays in the tank the bacteria produce nitrites and nitrates which are also toxic to your fish weekly fresh water changes to remove the ammonia nitrite and nitrate build up are what is needed with goldfish they are dirty little guys but can be great teaching tools for young children do not feed the fish more than once a day and only as much as they can eat in about minutes if they do not eat it all in minutes you have given them too much you should immediately do a water change be sure to dechlorinate the fresh water some goldfish are prone to swim bladder infections and other problems that cause them to either float to the surface or sink to the bottom they are usually not fatal many can live a full life with this problem as far as the black spots this could be the fish's coloration that is starting to develop don't let any moron tell you it is ich Sewage treatment Goldfish Marine aquarium Aquarium Sea-Monkey Fish farming Biogeochemical cycle Dairy Hydrogen sulfide Water Fancy rat Shrimp farm Discus (fish) Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Koi Water purification Carnivorous plant Tooth Tooth enamel Foodborne illness Nitrogen Great Lakes Ecology Escherichia coli O157:H7 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Swimming pool Iron Bladderwort Potassium Ammonia Sodium nitrite Carbon dioxide Urinary incontinence Fishing Biodiesel Nutrition Cyanide Axolotl Tlingit Refrigerator Factory farming Autonomous building Urine Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Livestock Salmon Dry cleaning Albatross Bong Japanese tea ceremony Hydrogen economy Diseases of the honeybee Nutrient Brewery Vitamin C Curing Chlorine Rebreather Fire fighting Cheese Veganism Plankton Silver Laserdisc Compost Food preservation Environmental concerns with electricity generation Soil pH Diving Drill bit Scuba set Vitamin Aluminium Milk Seine (fishing) Dialysis Fossil fuel power plant Chronic fatigue syndrome Clownfish Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Creatures in Bionicle Osmoregulation Cetacea Krill Copper American Dad!
