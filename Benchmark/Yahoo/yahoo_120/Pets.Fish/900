whats wrong with my goldfish just recently my all gold goldfish has developed a reddish pink colour on its back next to its fin is there something wong with it ok yup i had suffered from the same problem but it had happend to my tropical fish and my frieds goldfish it usually happens when you have added to many fish at once to your fish tank or when the bad bacteria levels are too high this sometimes happens if you put too much food in the tank and alot is left over also the reason for the reddish pink is because of the bacteria to resolve this problem you have to change about of the water and if you have a filter do not clean it when you are changing of the water because all of the good bacteria will be gone if this problem continues try a few more times to change most of the water but if it does not help go to your pet dealer and ask for advice hope this helps Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Acne Koi Fish farming Shrimp farm Water purification Kissing gourami Whaling Dairy Discus (fish) Water Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Foodborne illness Gar Crohn's disease Cyanide Color Omega-3 fatty acid Tooth enamel El-Fish Zebra Danio Poker jargon Fish Sea-Monkey Clownfish Sake Murray Cod Tooth Ecco the Dolphin Halitosis Final Fantasy XI Carnivorous plant Swimming pool Ecology Gram staining Tilapia Clown loach Seabird Red Craps Whale Samuel Goldwyn Bacteria Hydrogen sulfide Biology Thermal power station Kosher foods Great Salt Lake Snooker Chronic fatigue syndrome American Dad!
