ammonia just recently got a gal tank my bf has previously owned fish and said we had to have the tank running for at least weeks before we got fish it was running for about days and he said it should be ok so we picked up german blue rams swordtail koi bala sharks danios and sucker fish i cannot remember the specific name on those well the fish were doing ok for the first couple of days tomorrow will be week since we have had them but he said it was looking like they had ick we started treating the water with some tablets from petsmart and it wasn't helping last night he did a test on the water and said the ammonia is at i'm almost positive he said i know this is really bad this morning one blue ram and koi were dead are the rest of my fish going to die as well and how do i get the ammonia down is there anything i can do to save my other fish you need to do a partial water change asap i'll write more later but you need to start on this when you add the new water try to get it as close in temperature to what's in the tank now and remember to add the dechlorinator your tank has way too many fish at the moment the fish produce wastes including ammonia which is toxic to them in relatively small amounts the more fish or larger they are the more ammonia that's produced in an established tank there are bacteria that will convert the ammonia to nitrite also toxic then to nitrate but in a new tank you don't have any of the bacteria yet and it will take weeks to get it established until then you should only have hardy fish in the tank you also have fish that aren't a good mix rams are very sensitive to water quality so that's why they were among the first to die bala sharks will grow to inches and require a lot more space than a gallon to keep i think the swordtail koi you're talking about are swordtails with orange and white coloring not actual koi which get to around feet long so these would be okay but like to have a little salt added to their water about tablespoon per gallons danios are schooling fish and should be in larger groups the suckers could be plecostomous will get if the common pleco but there are varieties like rubbernose and bristlenose that only get to around you might be able to keep one pleco in the tank but the adults are territorial so you should only have one if it's an otocinclus these are small only about inches as an adult but should be in groups of they're also sensitive to water quality and shouldn't be added for about months after starting your tank if these are chinese algae eaters these will grow to around and only eat algae as juveniles as adults they're aggressive and they eat the slime coat off other fish in the tank leaving them open to infections or killing them from the stress imo these shouldn't be in any tank for now i would recommend returning any survivors other than the danios you'll probably need another water change tomorrow and changes for the next few days until you can get the ammonia level under is where fish begin to be stressed keep these in the tank to provide the ammonia for the bacteria to establish once the water tests show zero ammonia and nitrites you can add fish per week until you have the tank stocked again please read the following links http freshaquarium about com cs disease p ammoniapoison htm http www fishlore com nitrogencycle htm http www fishlore com cloudywater htm Sewage treatment Fish farming Eutrophication Hydrogen economy Danio Biodiesel Ammonia Shark Sea-Monkey Aquarium Shrimp farm Discus (fish) Goldfish Koi Biogeochemical cycle Nitrogen Bacteria Water purification Autonomous building Hamster Pneumonia Zebra Danio Axolotl Nutrient Hydrogen sulfide Bread Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Brewery Foodborne illness Carbon dioxide Ecology Tocopherol Halitosis Fish E85 Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Acne Agriculture Dairy Lake Explosive material Rebreather Fossil fuel power plant Helicobacter pylori Carp Houseplant Photosynthesis Dog Duesberg hypothesis Urea Hypoglycemia Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Livestock Biochemistry Dead Sea Terraforming HIV test Sake Food preservation Aluminium Guinea pig Fancy rat Refrigerator Iron Urinary incontinence Omega-3 fatty acid Hydroponics USS Tunny (SS-282) Cat Nutrition Lake Burley Griffin Orca Disinfection Veganism Gasoline Spacecraft propulsion Chinook salmon Great White Shark Thermal power station Water Milk Fire fighting Folic acid Beer
