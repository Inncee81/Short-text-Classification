what is actinic lighting a couple days ago i recently bought this for my freshwater planted community tank http www petco com product coralife mini compact fluorescent or bulb aspx and i wondered what actinic lighting is also would it benefit freshwater plant growth in order to begin to understand the available spectrums of bulbs we must first analyze how light naturally penetrates water red light is the first to be filtered out and can only penetrate a short distance as light waves penetrate deeper into the water orange and yellow are lost next of all the colors of the spectrum blue light penetrates the deepest light spectrum is measured by the kelvin scale natural sunlight on a clear day registers at kelvin degrees kelvin temperatures less than become more red and yellow and the higher the kelvin temperature the more blue the light is photosynthetic invertebrates should be kept under lamps rated at or near the kelvin temperature where the invertebrate was collected shallow water species should be kept under k lamps while deep water species would prefer k lighting longer photoperiods can not compensate for incorrect light spectrum or intensity actinic lighting peaks in the nanometer range and emits a fluorescent blue light and is usually used as supplemental lighting not only is actinic lighting beneficial to photosynthetic invertebrates it is also aesthetically pleasing to the eye when used to supplement daylight lighting freshwater aquarium plants benefit from lighting with a kelvin temperature in the range of degrees freshwater plants prefer light with more red and yellow in the spectrum the context with which i believe the statement that actinics are for nothing more than aesthetics is that it isn't that important what the composition of the spectrum of the bulb is as long as there is enough light of the appropriate wavelengths for photosynthesis to occur so as long as you satisfy the needs of photosynthesis beyond that it doesn't matter what bulbs you use actinic day light etc the spectrum from actinic lights are important because of the fact it is important for photosynthesis so on this basis saying actinic lights is for aesthetics is incorrect it can be very important if it is the important dominant source of light of the right spectrum for photosynthesis to occur whether actinics is important depends on how the tank is set up and the amount of light that the actinics contribute to the total photosynthetic available radiation for example if you are running a w k mh with w of no then the no contribution to the par is pretty insignificant and whether you use actinic or daylight is of no real consequence to the photosynthetic organisms in the tank but your choice of no will make a difference in how the tank appears to the human eye now what happens when you turn around and are just running no or vho over a tank half daylight and half actinic are the actinics now there just for the look of the tank of course not now it is making up a significant amount of the par http www aquarium lighting guide com aquarium lighting guide so to answer your question a bit more directly yes actinic may aid photosynthisis in yout freshwater tank however it depends on what other light sources you have available and what their spectrium range is it also depends on what type of plants you are trying to grow if the plants are not normaly deep water plants and you have other full spectrum bulbs or grow bulbs on your tank it is unlikely that actinic lighting would have much affect on your tanks photosynthitic potential if you are growing algae the actinics could be more important genneraly i associate actinics with salt water tanks and corals the blue color could be very pleasing in a fresh water tank though hope that this helps good luck Sun Marine aquarium Black body Stage lighting Light Light pollution Lighting Compact fluorescent lamp Sewage treatment Plant Aquarium Renewable energy Fish farming Carnivorous plant Solar power Sunlight Plasma (physics) Future energy development Carbon dioxide Houseplant Spectroscopy Eutrophication Coral reef Laser Leaf Lake Biodiesel Ionizing radiation Bicycle lighting Algae Optical fiber Diode Wind power Chlorophyta Eye Species Global warming and agriculture CIE 1931 color space Hydrogen economy Speed of light Ozone depletion Mercury-vapor lamp Headlight Gamut Spectrophotometry Polarization Dead Sea Diamond Electromagnetic spectroscopy Krill Photometry (optics) Solar cell Microscopy Microeconomics Ozone hole Welding X-ray Nuclear fallout Brewery Big Bang Tooth enamel Monochromator Energy development Electrodeless lamp Traffic light Observational astronomy Sea-Monkey Cassini-Huygens Deforestation Milk Carbon dioxide sink Nuclear power Chlorophyll Oxygen Cell (biology) Fermi paradox Uranium Discus (fish) Infrared
