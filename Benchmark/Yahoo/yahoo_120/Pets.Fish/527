male and female betta i just bought a male and am thinking of putting in a female as well as i'm told that males are only aggressive against other males however the woman at the aquarium store told me that if there is only one female then they probably won't mate and i don't want them to is this true don't believe what you hear in stores although technically what you were told is true if you put a male and female together when they're not prepared to mate there's a good chance one will kill the other and females are just as likely to kill males they need to be conditioned for spawning before they should be put together and after the eggs are laid the female has to be removed from the tank males will fish with males or with females if you want to keep multiple bettas in a tank you can keep females together as long as you have at least gallons of water per fish so they aren't overcrowed you have at least females although would be better you introduce them at the same time or at least the first three and any following in groups of amd you give them plants or other hiding spots females are somewhat aggressive but not as much as males usually they will develop a pecking order among themselves but once this is established most will only flare or nip if if another female gets out of line there is an occasional female that can't be kept with others so you should monitor their interactions for the first week or so Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Clownfish Discus (fish) Kakapo American lobster Goldfish Marine aquarium Platypus Social rule Tarantula Fugu Tilapia Dwarf gourami Chicken Ostrich Hermaphrodite Parthenogenesis Spider Orca Bird Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sexual reproduction Sex Poker jargon God Emperor of Dune Leatherback Sea Turtle Mountain Gorilla Bottlenose Dolphin Sea-Monkey Halfbeak Reef tank Dragons (Pern) Lodge Committee AMD Life in the Freezer Sexual dimorphism Non-human animal sexuality Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Live-bearing aquarium fish Zebra Danio Frog Danio Windows XP RuneScape skills Camel Fish farming Aphid Lion House Mouse Polygyny Grunion Dairy Ammunition Red Squirrel Nerpa The Dalek Invasion of Earth Ocean's Twelve Chess strategy and tactics Gar Swinging Combine (Half-Life 2) Sexual selection Shaggy dog story Rail terminology Aye-aye USS Amberjack (SS-219) Ruy Lopez Ra (board game) Infertility Tenshinhan Monogamy Nile crocodile Great White Shark Anopheles RuneScape Random Events Pysanka Animal communication Seabird Paper wasp Shark Big Brother (USA TV series) Final Fantasy magic Fossil fuel power plant Kiwi Seahorse Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Yusuf al-Qaradawi In vitro fertilisation X86 assembly language Cruising (maritime) StarCraft: Uprising Baboon Fish Anglerfish Jennifer Lopez Clown loach Rei Ayanami Mark I (tank)
