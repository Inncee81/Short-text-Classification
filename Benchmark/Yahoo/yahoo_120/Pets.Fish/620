need some more betta help i resuced another betta today half dead in a filthy bowl at the lps he's in clean water w some aquarium salt and a heating pad to help warm it up anything else i can do he's now down at the bottom not looking so good he looks a little skinny but he won't eat yet other than that his color looks pretty good considering any suggestions that might help him out a little more than i've done already i just couldn't leave him at the pet store he was upside down in the bowl i actually thought he was dead but he moved i don't really expect him to make it but i'm gonna do my best to help him so if you have any helpful advice other than ending his misery i'm willing to give it a try thanks i think you have done at that is reasonable at this point many people suggest such things as bettafix etc to be added tot he water but i don t i would suggest that clean water is the best thing at this point and if you add enough salt it will act as a better preventative than the various chemical additives add tablespoon per gallons of water but add it slowly by scooping out some water and dissolving the salt in it then pouring back a little of that water every hour or so until it's all added over the course of hours also he has had one sudden change in his water chemistry already adding other chemicals would only make for more changes and therefore more stress you will of course want to watch carefully for any signs of disease and be ready to treat accordingly a peaceful spot for the bowl would also be a good idea so that he can adjust to his new environment more easily best of luck with him and if i can help further feel free to email me mm Textile manufacturing Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Coffee Aquarium Hamster Opportunity rover Water (molecule) Water Bong Fire extinguisher Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sea-Monkey Pottery Ammonia Japanese tea ceremony Goldfish Poker jargon Corrosion Diseases of the honeybee First aid Idli Soldering Bread Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Carburetor Asthma Taxi Driver Water purification Cryonics Motor oil Olive oil Hydrogen peroxide Pittsburgh Steelers Solvent Mattress Mouth ulcer Fossil fuel power plant Microeconomics Brewery Thermal power station Sodium sulfate Clinical depression 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Anchor Decompression sickness The Apprentice 2 Vinegar Eutrophication The Ashlee Simpson Show Book of Isaiah Nuclear reactor Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Wine making Nuclear power Inflation Sauna Sulfur Urinary incontinence Milton H.
