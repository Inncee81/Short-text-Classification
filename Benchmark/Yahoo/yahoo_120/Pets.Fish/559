how do you get rid off blue green algue from my fish tank i have a four foot tank with good air good filtration and the lighting is right but i just carnt get rid of the blue green algue ok assuming that the tank was allowed to age before the fish were introduced then your problem more that likely is overfeeding and or insufficient water changes the fish should only be fed once a day and only what they will eat in two to three minutes if food falls to the bottom then it is to much as for the water changes you should change weekly preferably with a shiphon tube that you stick into the gravel so that you can remove the mulem uneaten food and fish excrement that collects on the bottom speaking of the bottom of the tank you should have about two inches of gravel and sand so that the biological filter will have enough room to grow important organisms to convert no to no the filter system that you have would idealy turn the tank over twice in one hour ie gal tank gal per hour pump i know that this sounds like alot but it really is not just remember not to feed to much and change the water oh yes one last thing if your tank receives natural light then try to move it from the light source as it will give you fits with alage a healthy tank with strong fish can be left up to two weeks with out food or water changes when you are on vacation i hope this helps i have worked in breeding shops for many years Sewage treatment Aquarium Marine aquarium Brewery Fish farming Thermal power station Discus (fish) Goldfish Water purification Bong Hamster Antarctic krill Irrigation Fossil fuel power plant Cannabis cultivation Fugu Dairy Refrigerator Solar power Shark Space Shuttle external tank Carbon dioxide Reef tank Coffee Fume hood Breastfeeding USS Tunny (SS-282) Dry cleaning Hydroponics Kidney Autonomous building Apollo Command/Service Module Koi Axolotl Seabird Insulin Sea star Fancy rat Flush toilet Tank Domestic rabbit Domesticated turkey Stock car (rail) Fluorescent lamp Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma American lobster Omega-3 fatty acid Chinook salmon USS Vestal (AR-4) Ecology Salmon Novelty (locomotive) Hydrogen economy Light-emitting diode Tofu Stomach cancer Dialysis Motorcycle Carburetor Whaling Sears Holdings Corporation Drainage Biodiesel Cat Hydraulic machinery Seismic retrofit Water pollution Sugar E85 Tooth Livestock Vermicompost Honey Tilapia Cantonese cuisine Chicken Water supply Krill Nuclear fallout Dredge Photosynthesis USS Thresher (SS-200) Textile manufacturing Veganism Atlantic herring Equine conformation Myxobolus cerebralis Airport M16 (rifle) Wave power Slow sand filter bed USS Trigger (SS-237) Mnemonic Albatross Roman eating and drinking
