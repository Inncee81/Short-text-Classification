gouramis and bettas new take on it i have a female dwarf gourami yes i am sure she's a female and an overly placid male betta they're currently relaxing in a heavily planted gallon tank with a few danio some cories and a small school of tetra this male betta is so relaxed he won't flare at himself he won't flare at all actually the same with the female gourami docile as ever i've seen no problems out of them and they generally seem to enjoy one another's company now here's the question i've heard good and bad about keeping dwarf gouramis and bettas together do these two sound likely to suddenly snap and tear each other apart or do i just have freak fish again you could try it but both being labyrnith fish you may run into problems i know what you mean though i have a very placid male betta who was so non aggressive i think he was raised by guppies o i had him with all kinds of different fish but never any gouramis the best thing to do is to try it and watch them both carefully for any signs of aggression if the the tank is planted heavily enough i don't think you would have any problems Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dwarf gourami Gourami Kissing gourami Hamster Danio Urinary incontinence Aquarium The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Fish farming Anal sex Zebra Danio Tank USS Tunny (SS-282) Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Ty Cobb Dragon Booster Marine aquarium Tarantula Social rule Pearl Danio Domestic rabbit Perciformes Fish Discus (fish) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Basement Tapes New York Giants Hardcore punk Neon tetra Hydrogen economy Intelligent design Kender Ron and Fez Warrior (World of Warcraft) Milton H.
