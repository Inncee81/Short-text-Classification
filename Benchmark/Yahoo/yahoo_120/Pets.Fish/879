my water became dull what do i do i bought a new filter and now my water is dull i don't know what to do please help me if you replaced an old filter without preserving the old media then you've virtually destroyed your bacterial colonies you may be experiencing bacterial bloom as if in a new tank test for ammonia and nitrite if there are signs of either then the tank is going through a new cycle and you need to do water changes to keep the levels down and try to get your hands on filter media or gravel from a mature tank to put into your own filter to re introduce bacteria directly if you don't measure any toxins then your tank is probably going through a harmless type bacterial bloom and will clear up on its own you can do water changes to help speed it up Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Eutrophication Bacteria Agar plate Tank Algal bloom Dialysis Water purification Tank classification Fish farming Shrimp farm Cyanide Honey Thermal power station Motorcycle Tooth enamel Ammonia Dairy Foodborne illness Brewery Ultraviolet Cirrhosis Fountain Pneumonia Diseases of the honeybee Botulism Water pollution Conjunctivitis Anthrax Ozone Carbon dioxide PID controller Sterilization (microbiology) Water Propaganda model Escherichia coli O157:H7 Cell (biology) Biogeochemical cycle Slow sand filter bed Common cold Refrigerator Sake E85 Biological warfare Hydrogen sulfide Sea-Monkey Mitsubishi Zero Phage Land mine T-34 Nitrogen Flagellum Gas mask Toxin Halitosis Aquarium Gastroparesis MS-09 Dom Acetic acid Ice core Sun Nutrition Chlorophyta Diatom Water supply Meningitis Hydrogen economy RuneScape cheats Rum Carbon dioxide sink Food preservation Neutrino Helicobacter pylori Menstrual cycle Circuit breaker Galileo spacecraft Cholera Hawker Hurricane Photosynthesis Maser Digital photography Biological pest control GunBound Directed-energy weapon Swimming pool Seabird Think tank Light pollution MS-06 Zaku II Specified complexity Life Technicolor Electrophysiology Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Humidifier Zerg Nitrogen cycle Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2
