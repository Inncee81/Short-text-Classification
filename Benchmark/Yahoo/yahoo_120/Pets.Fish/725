how many times should you change the water in your saltwater tank in a month if i am breeding my clownfish should i get an algae eater honestly i dont think your gonna have great sucess with your breeding project not to say it isnt possible but you have a lot of research to do on your own where yahoo answers isnt gonna get you the info you need if you arent even aware of how often to clean the tank then you have much to learn i am willing to offer any help i can but you just dont seem willing to do the research and just expect the answers to come to you many people have different methods the work for them and you have to figure out what method works for you try just keeping clownfish for months happy and healthy then worry about attempting to breed them i have much more expierence propagating corals than i do with breeding clownfish being that your tank is very new the chance of clownfish breeding in your system is very small since i read one of your last posts saying that the tank has only been setup for a max of weeks you havent even cycled your tank yet for now i assume you already jumped into adding the clownfish into your systme so you just made your job harder you must monitor you ph but more importantly amonia nitrite and nitrates once you notice your amonia reaching dangerous levels where you will see the fish be unhappy that is when you should do a water change clownfish are hardy fish but not in comparison to damsels or green chromis which are also damsels just a more peaceful damsel so when you do water changes now you are prolonging the nitrogen cycle but if the clowns are already in the tank you have to do it to keep them alive once the tank has completed the cycle you should do weekly water changes if there is one thing you have to learn with keeping saltwater fish is patience and i cant stress that enough copperhead or magicman will be able to better help you as far as breeding goes for i have never even attempted to breed any marine fish as far as algae eaters go you should probobaly add a few nassarius snails and some mexican turbo snails i dont know if having those will have any affect on the fish breeding but i assume it shouldnt hope this helps and good luck Marine aquarium Clownfish Fish farming Shrimp farm Eutrophication Aquarium Sewage treatment Biology Percula Clownfish Coral reef Marine biology Extreme Programming Reef tank Algae Fugu Insulin Tank Nutrient A Course In Miracles Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dog Biodiesel Biogeochemical cycle Ozone depletion Baseball Stars Prostate cancer RuneScape Mini-Games Discus (fish) Cyanide God Emperor of Dune Diatom Ozone hole Hydrogen sulfide Ammonia EastEnders Explosive material Software engineering Fauna of Australia Goldfish Fox hunting Breastfeeding Microeconomics Social rule Zerg $ale of the Century Clinical depression Tilapia Organic farming Brewery Rebreather Photosynthesis Species Albatross 2000 Australian Grand Prix Carbon dioxide Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scientology beliefs and practices Angling Ecology Terraforming E85 Coral Fly fishing Friends Chlorophyta Algal bloom Nuclear power 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Toyota Prius Advance Wars: Dual Strike Sea level rise Shark Fancy rat City of Heroes Octopus Swimming pool Infantilism Tidal power Atomic Kitten Chinook salmon Singlish Diving Veganism Gas metal arc welding Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Lake Burley Griffin Myxobolus cerebralis Axolotl Fertility awareness Pitaten Fishing Knife Ginny Weasley Diseases of the honeybee Sea anemone ALGOL 68 Gray Wolf Green Revolution
