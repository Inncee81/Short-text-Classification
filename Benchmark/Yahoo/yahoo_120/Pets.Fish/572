why does my goldfish have a bulge on one of its sides im thinking he is dead but he might not be he is floating around not breathing thats why i think he might be dead and has a black bulge on one of its sides near the bottom of the fish is this bad because i have another goldfish in the same tank and show i go out and immediately buy another one sounds like a severe internal infection scoop the goldfish out asap if he flops around he's still alive put him in another container although it's probably too late to save him at this point do not buy another until you are sure the tank water is safe i'd buy some bacterial meds you can find them at any petstore don't add new fish for at least a month Goldfish Samuel Goldwyn Aquarium Poker jargon Conker's Bad Fur Day Koi Sewage treatment Sea-Monkey Seine (fishing) USS Yorktown (CV-5) Gar Halitosis First aid The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Pneumonia Asthma Fugu Myxobolus cerebralis Dead Sea Paul Is Dead Cruising (maritime) Meat Loaf USS Tunny (SS-282) Battle of Kursk Shrimp farm Avalanche Fishing Brewery Water garden Equine conformation Breath of Fire III Bacteria Axolotl Discus (fish) Drowning Valles Marineris Queen (band) Bottlenose Dolphin Loch Ness Monster Battle of Tarawa Clownfish Neighbours Scuba set Gram staining Eastern Front (World War II) Legionellosis Battle of the Bulge Ecco the Dolphin Marine aquarium Foodborne illness Resident Evil: Apocalypse Gaia Online Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Iron SS Andrea Doria AIDS Guinea pig Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Tank locomotive Waterworld Wheel of Fortune Virus Monk (TV series) Hemp Fish farming Diseases of the honeybee Elephant Shark Tide Anchor P-61 Black Widow Great Lakes Sodium chloride Heinrich M__ller Professional wrestling throws Japanese tea ceremony Rebreather Seismic retrofit Young adult literature Moon Paramount Pictures Heinkel He 112 Agar plate Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Herpes simplex virus Otitis externa Thermal power station Acute respiratory distress syndrome Battle of France Naval mine Bombing of Dresden in World War II STS-51-L Bon Jovi Ivory-billed Woodpecker USS Waters (DD-115) Breastfeeding Messerschmitt Bf 109 Brent Spar HMS Ramillies (07)
