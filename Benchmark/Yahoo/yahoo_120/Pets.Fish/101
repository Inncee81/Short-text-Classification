cloudy betta water one of my bettas just had a water change days ago it's extremely cloudy i did add a new decoration it's like a cave in the tank but i rinsed it off with hot water really well before i put it in his tank should i change is water again or will he be ok he's building a bubble nest so he doesn't seem to mind but i don't want him to get sick or anything my other betta's water is fine though he's in a gallon unfiltered tank and i do full water changes every days are you changing your water like you would in a bowl changing out the entire contents or just a partial change what is the size of the tank i don't think this is really a cycling effect just yet though typically cloudiness in the water is probably the hot water heated up the cave and has interacted with your tank water is what i think or you overfed him betta's are very very hardy fish and unless you get extremely toxic readings he should be ok i have a biowheel gallon set up at work i change out a gallon once a week when i first populated it with the betta white clouds and zebra danios the water never really got cloudy and the ammonia soard up to almost ppm and noone died from that i did do a partial water change but it stayed pretty high for about five days check your ammonia levels just to be sure if he is building up his bubble nest i'd say odds are he's quite a happy betta right now and nothing to worry about you can learn more at fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv follow up this particular case wouldn't likely be associated with a bacterial bloom this sounds like water not dechlorinated or too much feeding being that you don't have the tank filtered i think you should get a really small filter and that will assist you in keeping the water quality a little better but i don't think he's stressed if he's building his bubble nest i think he's quite happy actually Brewery Sewage treatment Aquarium Marine aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Carbon dioxide Bong Fish farming Dishwasher Sun Tea Solar power Carburetor Ammonia E85 Water (molecule) Cocaine Cider Zebra Danio Sake Danio CPU cache Water Cloud Goldfish Hard water The Amber Spyglass Sea-Monkey Axolotl Dairy Biodiesel Autonomous building Diseases of the honeybee Fossil fuel power plant Water purification Rebreather Shrimp farm Hydrogen economy Hydrogen Sugar beet Fire fighting Refrigerator Eutrophication Polychlorinated biphenyl Climate of the United Kingdom Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Coffee Global climate model Decompression sickness Champagne (beverage) Electrophysiology Tank Bread Vinegar Dialysis Sento Nutrition Japanese tea ceremony Singlish Fire extinguisher Theory of conduct Dwarf gourami Houseplant Hydrogen sulfide Solar variation Chocolate Explosive material Drowning Common cold RuneScape quests Discus (fish) Portland cement Apollo 8 Electronic amplifier Climate change Hydroponics Motor oil Loudspeaker Supply and demand Ecology Sonoluminescence STS-59 Analog-to-digital converter Hamster Microeconomics Swimming pool Town gas Natural gas Lighting Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Nuclear power StarCraft: Uprising Cannabis cultivation Gasoline Seismic retrofit
