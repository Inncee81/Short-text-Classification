salt water tank problem need advice i have a galloon tank for about months now and i got black and white stripe damselfish then i got clown fish and today i got a hippo tang fish small the damselfish are attacking the tang fish and now the tang is just hiding in the tank the damsals bothered the clown fish in the begining also and now there ok and the clown fish know not to go near the liverock is there anything i should do will they work it out and if not what can i do with the damselfish pet stores wont usually take them thanks most good pet stores should take them back and are mostly only sold to cycle the tank expectinmg to get them back once the tank has cycled if they wont take them back then you should find a store that is specifically an aquarium store and tell them you have these damsels and the people who sold them to you wont take them back and im sure they would be happy to take them off your hands this is the reason i always advise people to stay away from cycling with damsels next time if you use fish to cycle a tank than use green chromis they are much more peaceful fish and still very hardy for use to cycle a tank with they also dont bother any new fish that you might add and in fact they seem to aid shy fish to come out of hiding and explore the tank hope this helps and good luck finding a store who will take the damsels off your hands and good luck catching them you may need to buy a trap or make one yourself in order to catch them if you have any other questions id be happy to help and feel free to email me good luck with the tank and hope it all works out for the best Marine aquarium Clownfish Discus (fish) Hamster Finding Nemo Clown loach Goldfish Sea-Monkey Fish Atomic Kitten Animal Crossing Knife Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Sodium chloride Aquarium A Course In Miracles The Dalek Invasion of Earth Tlingit 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fishing Minor characters in Morrowind Shaggy dog story Zebra Danio Gar Crayfish Neopets God Emperor of Dune Poker jargon First Battle of the Atlantic The Curse of Fenric Gaia Online Pet store Thermal power station RuneScape quests Koi Final Fantasy XI Garfield Ragnarok Online Toilet The Death Gate Cycle Care Bears Punk ideology Seine (fishing) Salmon Live 8 Myxobolus cerebralis Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Squirrel Pysanka Password Electrophysiology Tag Chinatown Fish and chips Internet troll Cube (film) RISC Sicilian Expedition Phoebe Halliwell Angling Today I am A Clown Hunter (World of Warcraft) Dog training StarCraft: Uprising Phishing Tilapia Pretty Good Privacy Weezer Fugu RuneScape economy Tunisia Campaign Polish September Campaign Numerology Infantilism Changeroom Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chu-Han contention Striped bass Insomnia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Autonomous building Fancy rat Galactic Civilizations Frontier in Space CPU cache USS Tang (SS-306) Pet skunk Operation Market Garden Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Fish farming RuneScape skills W.I.T.C.H.
