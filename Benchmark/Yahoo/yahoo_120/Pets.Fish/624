my oranda developed sores or cuts on it's mouth now they've healed but he lost part of his bottom lip help i bought goldfish about a month ago an oranda and a ryukin a few days later the oranda developed sores or maybe cuts on his mouth i wonder if he cut himself on one of the plastic plants he liked to chew them they healed pretty quickly a couple of days but he lost part of his bottom lip from it and can't eat very well and spends a lot of time at the bottom of the aquarium the ryukin never suffered any illness or injury and is very healthy has this happened to anyone else out there what else could have caused it and how do i help my poor oranda fish gallon tank weekly water changes all numbers are good no more plastic plants goldfish love to pick up gravel and move it about and they also love to nibble on plants of course preferably alive but they're not going to learn that the plants aren't edible until they've tried it once yes goldfish can get cut on plastic plants that's why i always run my fingers over every piece of anything that goes into my tank if it feels even the least bit rough or sharp i smooth it out he's healing and that's good you may want to peak his interest in food by feeding special treats like brineshrimp krill bloodworms etc yes these are rich treats only to be given once or twice a week but if he isn't eating then it's a better alternative unfortunately his lip won't grow back and there really isn't anything you can do about it other than to make sure he eats even if it requires personal hand feedings Goldfish Hamster Equine conformation Breastfeeding Aquarium YuYu Hakusho Sea-Monkey Chopsticks Koi Drill bit Bong Stomach cancer Tooth Domestic rabbit Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fancy rat Fugu Axolotl Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Elephant Bread Textile manufacturing Dairy Massage Guinea pig Mouth ulcer Garfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Oral sex Cocaine Clarinet Theory of conduct Sewage treatment Shark Kodocha Discus (fish) Cliff Richard Billboard Hot 100 Halfbeak Tilapia Urinary incontinence Salmon Mattress Adjustable gastric band Marathon (sport) Body piercing RuneScape economy Piccolo Junior Saga Samuel Goldwyn The Amber Spyglass Kissing gourami Terri Schiavo Peanut Poker jargon Negima Natural health Mushroom hunting Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Antarctic krill Knife 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cleft Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dog training Humphrey Bogart Gar Albatross Chocolate Traditional Chinese medicine Nile crocodile Comfrey Whaling Eating First aid Aztec Tomato Fast bowling Houseplant Krill Tobacco Chicken Swimming RuneScape skills Japanese tea ceremony Naruto jutsu Skateboarding trick 613 mitzvot Final Fantasy: Unlimited Hydroponics Veganism About a Boy Medicine El-Fish Harmonica Hydrogen economy Church of Christ, Scientist Hip fracture Atlantic herring Elis Prefecture
