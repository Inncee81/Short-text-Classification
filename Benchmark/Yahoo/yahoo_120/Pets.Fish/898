my minnow is twitching two years ago i won a gold fish bought more and frogs both frogs died then two of the fish we bought one new fishand found a mineow in the delaware river last summer we put him in with the goldefish and he was fine a few weeks ago of the remaining goldfish died we bought a new one and that one killed the other fish then that one died we bought a feeder goldfish and put it in the tank i just came back from a crusie and the feeder fish is fine water is too but the mineow is lying at the bottom and hidding behind plants and twitching what should i do hi sorry to hear about all your fish and frogs that died are you sure that the environment you're provided for them is adequate do you have at least a gallon tank with a filter rated for a gallon tank or better an air pump rated for a gallon tank or better a heater rated for a gallon tank or better and of course a tank lid light combination you need all those plus your gravel and airstones to provide an adequate home for your fishy friends and the most important part is that you have to take care of them all why well they're your pets and you have the responsibility for their continued health and existence you have to feed them you have to partially change the tank's water each week and make sure the new water is dechlorinated if you introduce any new fish they should be quarantined for three weeks in a separate tank before being introduced into your main tank the reason for this is that many fish especially the so called feeder fish aren't properly cared for so they'll contain diseases and parasites so if you put those fish immediately into your main tank you run the risk of having those sick fish infect all your healthy fish you don't want that now you said your one goldfish killed another that's kind of odd why do i say that well goldfish aren't the kind of fish that go around killing each other but if the new one was sick or infected with a parasite well their parasite or disease could have killed off the new one and your minnow the one you got from the delaware river first you should never ever take any fish or plant from the natural ecosystem and put it into your aquarium the main reason again it is probably infected with some weird disease or crazy strange parasite why bring that into your house and main tank also in most states it's illegal to take a fish or plant from it's native habitat to place elsewhere you're fooling with mother nature here and you could inadvertantly be introducing a virus or disease or parasite to another area of the country we have that same problem when people want to dispose of their old fish they don't want to euthanize them so they dump them in a native stream and let them swim away that's the most terrible thing you can do especially to a minnow that grew up in one area and you want to let go in another area why again introduction of diseases and parasites that the native fishies have never been exposed to can kill them by the millions also by introducing a new fish into the environment can wreak havock with the native fish stock remember reading about the snakehead fish a few years ago or what about the asian carp now the asian carp are a nasty fish these lb fish get spooked when your boat goes by and can jump straight up out of the water a lot of people have been injured by them hitting them in their faces as their boat goes by these asian carp have been eating everything that our native fish stock eat and they've caused our native fishes to have problems they're a good example of a good fish gone bad if you want to see them in action and see the strangest videos ever go to youtube com and do a search on asian carp you'll be amazed and horrified by what you see now you're minnow on the bottom twitching it's probably got some sort of parasite and it's probably all through your tank you really should have the fish all your fish euthanized then clean your tank thoroughly go to a good aquarium site online and they'll give you instructions just don't use any household chemicals use what's specified for euthanizing fish get some oil of cloves you can buy some at your local health store they usually carry it once you get it put your fish in a bowl of water put about drops of the oil of clove in a small jar of water close the jar and shake then pour the contents of the jar oil and water into the bowl with the fish you are euthanizing stir the water quickly and the fish should slowly go asleep leave the fish in there for about minutes then check it watch it's gills for about minutes if they don't move the fish had died in its sleep if the gills are still moving let the fish stay in the water for another minutes then check again if it's still breathing you may need to add a bit more oil of clove to the water do as before add it to the small jar of water first close the lid shake then pour the shaken contents into the big bowl this does work good luck ken Marine aquarium
