aquarium evaporation i have a litre gallon fish tank that is heated to degc degf and because it s been so cold here there evaporation seems to have sped up dramatically i used to loose less than ml a week now i m loosing close to ml a week what effect does this have on the water chemistry my kh and thus ph fall quite steadily regardless of the kh treatment i use could evaporation cause this i m currently doing a water change ever days or so should i be doing smaller water changes like ever week instead i'm using the liquid tests i forget the brand name but they're the ones that you fill the test tube with water and drip the test chemicals in my kh and ph are falling from kh and ph to just under kh and just under ph in days good to know the evaporation isn't to huge it's just freaky to watch the water level drop a cm or two lol actually kh rises because of the evaporation the water evaporates but calcium stays in your tank how do you measure kh and ph btw ml a week is not much my main tank loses this amount of water every hours comment on additional details do you have many plants in your tank the plants need carbon dioxide for their growth and when they eat up all carbon dioxide in the tank and no additional carbon dioxide is added the calcium carbonate which is solved in the water crystallizes and falls out also snails need calcium for their shells Carbon dioxide Marine aquarium Water purification Gasoline Explosive material Sewage treatment Lake Water (molecule) Thermal power station Desert Rain Aquarium Carbon Calcium carbonate Fire extinguisher Hydrogen economy Ocean thermal energy conversion Water Automobile emissions control Fuel injection Insulin Heat exchanger Effects of global warming Calcium Sugar beet Hydroponics Biodiesel Cannabis cultivation Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Carburetor Photosynthesis Brewery Ecology Titanium Weathering Hard water Sugar Phase (matter) Pebble bed reactor Earth's atmosphere Homeostasis Rebreather Alum Tofu Iron Sulfur Renewable energy Soil pH Mineral Energy development Global warming and agriculture Sugarcane Carbon dioxide sink Drowning Acetic acid Hydrogen Portland cement Hydropower Coffee Food preservation Nuclear power Concentration Autonomous building STS-50 Casting Fossil fuel power plant Helium Haloalkane Water vapor Hydrochloric acid Sea-Monkey Gaia theory (science) Methane E85 Mercury (element) Xenon Carbon cycle Sulfuric acid Global warming Salt Concrete Speleothem Dry cleaning Volcano Disinfection Carnivorous plant Carbonic acid Mole (unit) Uranium Internal combustion engine Lithium Technetium
