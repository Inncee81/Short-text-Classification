fish keep dying i received a gallon fish tank last christmas and soon after bought some fish and they died i was told htey died becasue i have too many in there there were i then proceded to buy more fish only one at a time and within hours they die please help i don't want to keep killing fish first a tank needs to be cycled so the good bacteria will keep the nitrite and ammonia which the fish make in their excrements level low nitrites and ammonia will kill fish fast and fish in a gal tank will contribute an amazing amount of those two products your tank will also go through what is known as new tank syndrome developing brown or blackish algae spots sometimes having the water chemistry spike and then drop you should buy test kits for ammonia nitrite at a minimum get the ones using reagent not the test strips the older test strips get the more off their results and you can't tell how old the kits are sitting on the shelf and test your water you'll need a dechlorinator unless you're using bottle spring water and then you'll need to always use the same brand since not all spring waters are the same research your fish to make sure they are appropriate for your tank all need to live in the same temperature get a good submersible heater you can adjust it's easier if they all eat the same thing they have to get along some fish only do well in schools others are super territorial and won't get along with any of their own kind some won't get along with any other fish get a good filter before adding fish make sure everything is working propertly heater is maintaining the set temperature filter is filtering and the tank is set up as you wish it to be trying to do changes later can disturb the ecological balance in the tank sending your tank into another dreaded cycling if you are going to cycle using fish which can be hard on the fish pick hardy fish that don't cost a fortune in case they die test your tank water at least twice daily more if possible and do water changes if the levels are above the recommended kits come with levels or normalcy for you to compare your water to if you're doing fishless cycling do a search for how to do that using ammonia and or fish food the beneficial bacteria eat ammonia decomposing fish food creates ammonia you might be able to get a product called bio spira by marineland small pouch which is enough for a g tank costs about and needs to be kept cool which eliminates the need to cycle your tank when you're tank is all set up and ready for fish just open and dump the pouch contents into your tank i usually dump it into the filter to make sure the bacteria starts going in there and then put in your fish continue to test the water twice daily to make sure things nitrites ammonia levels are staying close to zero also make sure the fish you buy are healthy look at each closely and the other fish in the tank since many fish ailments are highly contagious to make sure there aren't little white dots on them no fuzzy places no parasites that the fish look healthy and undamages and are active the link below is barely minimal for setting up a new tank if your local fish store is a good one that is if the clerks there are fishmaniacs they should be able to answer all your questions and even help you with testing give you advice kind of mentor you through the process Sewage treatment Ammonia Biogeochemical cycle Eutrophication Ecology Fish farming Autonomous building Water purification Fugu Hydrogen economy Shrimp farm Thermal power station Fossil fuel power plant E85 Sea-Monkey Refrigerator Aquarium Cyanide Water Dairy Nutrition Poker jargon Diseases of the honeybee Ocean thermal energy conversion Explosive material Energy development Bong Water (molecule) Fire fighting Hypoglycemia Polychlorinated biphenyl Nutrient Veganism Chocolate Environmental concerns with electricity generation Swimming pool B-47 Stratojet Coffee Biology Antarctic krill Electrophysiology Menstrual cycle Cocaine Photosynthesis RuneScape skills Nuclear power Tofu Haloalkane Microeconomics Healthy eating Motorcycle Extreme Programming GunBound Dead Sea Alcohol fuel Cannabis cultivation Ozone depletion PID controller Iron Origin of life Stomach cancer Diesel engine Hard disk Illegal drug trade Nitric acid Vitamin C Hydrogen Nitrogen cycle Transformer Diabetes mellitus Nuclear reactor Mooney M20 Beer Halitosis Ozone Solar variation Hydrogen peroxide Motor oil Expert system Cruising (maritime) STS-62 Town gas God Emperor of Dune
