my koi isn't eating we've had our kois for about months now they usually ate these small goldfish pellets that sank down slowly we just got some new koi food some tetra pond thing the waters pretty cool but the food stays at top and the kois arent eating it i just dont know if their not seeing it or they dont want it how do you get them to eat the little pellets i fed them before are too small for the fish now go to a farm store and get some floating catfish food koi love it and it makes them grow really fast it's a larger pellet floats and if it's too big for some it will soften as it floats and they can eat it just fine it might take them a little while to get used to it but mine have been on it for years now and are about inches long they were inches when i got them also try tossing them some small hunks of bread it will take them to minutes to smell it but they will go after it like pigs toss some of it on top of lily pads and hang around for a while after they have eaten the rest of it they will climb out on to the lily pads to get the bread on top get your camera ready for that i have several pictures of mine doing that enjoy Koi Shark Guinea pig Bengali cuisine Domestic rabbit Fish farming Water garden Shotgun Bread Tilapia Roman eating and drinking Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Pig Aquarium Spider Hamburger Family farm hog pen American lobster Kitchen Smelt Fancy rat Axolotl Gar Conker's Bad Fur Day Frog RuneScape skills Cuisine of Laos Sea-Monkey Carbon dioxide Maize Naval mine Whaling Chicken First Battle of the Atlantic Bladderwort Elephant Mattress Dairy Food Acorn Garfield Nine Inch Nails Shrimp farm Pizza Taboo food and drink Carp Coconut crab RuneScape Mini-Games Torpedo Breakfast Japanese tea ceremony Nile crocodile Deluge (mythology) Iron Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans European Kingfisher Cuisine of the Southern United States Air gun Herring Tlingit Singlish Capercaillie Textile manufacturing Cuisine of Malaysia Jewish cuisine Vegetarianism Firework Mercury 4 Discus (fish) Squidward Tentacles Bong Pea soup Paragliding Ant Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Climbing equipment Sushi Japanese cuisine Fish and chips Aquaculture Nuclear reactor Plastic Pond Knife Fugu Egg (food) Passover Table tennis Comanche Tetrodotoxin Potato Soul food Age of Mythology Thermal power station Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wood
