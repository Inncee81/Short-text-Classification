fish recommendations for a gallon tank i just bought a gallon tank i assembled it this evening added the rocks an ornament the filter and a small pump for bubbles it looks lovely enough and i'd love to keep it just like this but alas we bought it for fish haha can you tell i'm not a fish person i have young children which is why i bought the tank for them i know i likely can only buy one or two fish with such a small tank but i was curious what exactly i should buy to put in there i am admittedly not great with fish several years ago i remember buying betas because they were pretty but one killed all the others but this time im hoping will be different i am hoping to buy hopefully two low maintenance fish recommendations please a betta is very easy to take care of but you must not put more than two of them in the same tank this is one of the most fundamental rules about betta keeping without meaning to offend i do suggest you research the breed of fish you want to keep before buying one before you bite off more than you can chew too many people buy little plecos thinking they'll fit in their gallon tanks not knowing that plecos can grow huge and require gallon tanks i would definitely recommend a betta particularly because you are buying the tank for your children keeping a small fish tank is a fun and effective way of teaching a child responsibility but fishkeeping isn't as easy as it looks and very often fish die from beginner's mistakes bettas are extremely hardy and will put up with most of these mistakes note that i said most in a gallon tank you could even fit in a tankmate like a snail an african dwarf frog or a small school of fish like tetras as long as a tankmate doesn't resemble a betta in any way the betta will not harm it other than bettas you could get a few guppies maybe about four since you have a filter you can also get about six or seven harlequin rasboras some of which i have recently acquired and rather fallen in love with please do not get a goldfish i don't know if you know this but when kept in small tanks goldfish release hormones that stunt their internal organs and deform them so they are unable to grow any larger so it's not like they only grow to the size of their container like many think one goldfish needs about gallons of water minimum however regardless of which fish you decide to get please be aware that you must cycle your tank first before you put in any fish this can take up to a month here are some links on cycling http www fishlore com nitrogencycle htm http www aquamaniacs net forum cms view article php aid Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goldfish Marine aquarium Aquarium Discus (fish) Fish farming Carbon dioxide Hydrogen economy Tank Tilapia Carnivorous plant Reef tank PHP Violin Milk Autonomous building Biodiesel Sewage treatment Domestic rabbit Microeconomics Axolotl Hamster Dairy Omega-3 fatty acid Brewery Social rule Theory of conduct Insulin Kender Mosquito Swimming pool F-16 Fighting Falcon Koi Hypoglycemia Poker jargon Organic farming Zerg Fertility awareness Dwarf gourami Water garden Breastfeeding Fishing Children of God Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Solar variation Depleted uranium GunBound A Course In Miracles E85 Equine conformation Ajax (programming) Fugu Phishing RuneScape quests Surveillance Motion picture rating system Hash table Transsexuality Stuttering Humpback Whale Infantilism Energy development Capital punishment YuYu Hakusho Whaling Ferret Fire extinguisher Toyota Prius Controversies in autism Cancer Team Fortress Classic Shrimp farm Drug abuse Cruising (maritime) BZFlag Breast cancer Blog Terminal ballistics Motorcycle XML Tank locomotive Veganism Panama Canal Shark CPU design Dog
