what fish would be a good tank mates for goldfish and a plec i was wondering what would be a good tank mate s for them im fairly new to fishkeeping myself so something on the easier side that is hardy and obviously a community fish im in a hard water area not sure of the ph though and have a foot tank ok so do you have a coldwater tank or tropical for a coldwater tank i'd suggest white cloud minnows they are extremely hardy fish but they are rly small as well and they love to live in shoals of around so you could make the population of your tank increase by adding they are really cool and quite cute too for a tropical tank i'd go to some tetra's they are just like the white cloud minnows but a tropical water version they are small and come in different colours so again you could put a shoal of in and they will add colour to your tank without over running it again they are hardy fish and get along with everything good luck with finding the right fish Marine aquarium White Cloud Mountain Minnow Goldfish Danio Characiformes USS Tunny (SS-282) Cruising (maritime) Aquarium Cloud Tank locomotive Seabird Tank Corydoras Sea-Monkey Swarm Gar Discus (fish) Sonar Koi Rail terminology Bottlenose Dolphin Platypus Tag M4 Sherman Albedo Aquatic ape hypothesis Water garden Zebra Danio Brewery Clownfish Messerschmitt Bf 109 Unreal Yacht Fish BZFlag Walleye Fish farming Tilapia Geography of Japan M16 (rifle) Sailfin Molly Peafowl Hamster Cardinal tetra Gilligan's Island Butterflyfish Autonomous building Neon tetra Seismic retrofit Cyprinid Bryce Canyon National Park Precipitation (meteorology) Humpback Whale Halfbeak Hydrogen economy Mosquito Thermal power station Shark Pok__mon Abilities BMW 801 Panama Canal Taikyoku shogi Panzer II Leopard Isetta Grunion USS Ray (SS-271) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Shrimp farm Stock car (rail) Seine (fishing) Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) El Ni__o Whale song National Weather Service Tiger I Smelt Trolling for fish Battle of Tarawa Bird Gal__pagos Islands Spratly Islands Hurricane Rita Kingdom Hearts P-38 Lightning USS Aaron Ward (DD-483) Carnivorous plant Leopard tank French Frigate Shoals Climate of the United Kingdom Centurion tank Houseplant Ammunition Yerba mate Pottery Elis Prefecture Carp Norway national football team Global Liberation Army Hardy-Weinberg principle
