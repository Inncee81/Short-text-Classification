was it wrong to spaz on my bf for almost killing my fish i asked my boyfriend to feed my fish and later on that day i saw lola's bowl full of food pellets like a human handful that you would give a child if it was cereal i started freaking out and screamed on him about how stupid he could be and why would a tiny fish need that much food my fish only needs or pellets or at the most i told him a little bit but did not specify an exact amount because just weeks ago he almost killed my father's group of fish that he has in an outdoor pond that was when i explained to him how much food fish need to be given so i thought he would've remembered from that incident he acted like it was no big deal but i've had lola since october and he's grown on me yes it's a he he's purple and has a slight swish to his stroke is my attachment to my fish crazy or does anyone else feel the same way about their fish was it wrong for me to scream on him wouldn't it have been just as bad as if lola was a dog a pet is a pet regardless of species and everyone who's a good pet owner gets attached to their pet i got a goldfish when i was about years old for free when a pet store in my neighborhood opened when the goldfish died years later i cried i'd say your attachment to your fish is just fine and being protective of it is also just natural the fact that this has happened before with your boyfriend with him feeding your dad's fish and since it seems that he doesn't care he did wrong i'd say the reprimanding from your end was certainly justified it should be common sense that a tiny fish doesn't need a handful of pellets if he didn't remember the incident that happened before chances are that he just doesn't care or perhaps he did it on purpose of course that's just speculation nobody knows but him either way though i'd say to never trust him to feed another animal of yours fish dog whatever Goldfish Garfield Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Kodocha Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Ferret Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Guinea pig Badly Drawn Kitties Ranma __ characters Shark Social rule Poker jargon Dog Ron Weasley Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Fancy rat The Amber Spyglass Humphrey Bogart The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist RuneScape quests Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kim Possible Hamster W.I.T.C.H.
