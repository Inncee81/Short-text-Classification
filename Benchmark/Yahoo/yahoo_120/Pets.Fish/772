why have my pond goldfish lost their colour started red gold and are now white ish all over some just faded and others' colour went in patches other goldfish in pond not affected except one koi which started off navy blue all over he's about years old he started losing colour round his scales on his back and now his back is totally white silver while his lower scales are blue black and still gradually turning white he's otherwise very healthy same as the goldfish help water conditions temperature what you feed them age genetics and color of background all can have an effect on color of koi there is an excellent article in aquarium fish magazine this month on why koi change colors the fish is not ill and there is likely nothing you can do but wait and see what color it turns out to be some will retain vivid color and many will loose color as they age warm water can retract color where cold water makes color expand ph also has a simular effect green water or a pond with lots of algae can make colors deeper hope this helps many experts are apparantly trying to scientifically figure out what exactly causes a koi to loose color what i've read its a combination of things but mostly breeding or genetics of the fish Koi Color Aquarium Color blindness Iris (anatomy) Discus (fish) Colours, standards and guidons Hair color Lake Paleoclimatology Tilapia Water garden Eye color Ecology Horse Color theory Wassily Kandinsky Dog Human skin color Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sea-Monkey Fish farming Coral reef Pond Traffic sign Cheetah Algae Water (molecule) Salmon Dragon Booster Color temperature Cyanide Roan (color) Geologic time scale Silver Alhambra Lake Burley Griffin Frog Zebra Danio Cat coat genetics Solar variation Clownfish Color Graphics Adapter Dobermann Myxobolus cerebralis German car number plates Effects of global warming Diamond Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Extinction Camouflage Cloud Species Water Toronto Blue Jays Bipolar disorder Turkish Van Shrimp farm Goldeen Thermoregulation Opportunity rover Blue Hubble Deep Field Mercury (element) Hydropower Carburetor CMYK color model Marine aquarium Diamond simulant Global warming and agriculture Vitamin C Cannabis (drug) Titanium Collectibles in Bionicle Krill Power Rangers CIE 1931 color space Multiple sclerosis Factory farming El Ni__o Guinea pig Technicolor Turquoise Hydrogen Light-emitting diode Bird migration Biology Harp Poker jargon Carp Red Original Amiga chipset Atari 8-bit family Pimp My Ride Parrotfish Los Angeles Kings Carbon dioxide Border Collie
