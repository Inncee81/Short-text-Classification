i had an agressive male beta who just died and i'm a college student looking for a fish friend any help i had an agressive male beta and he just died and i'm sad and don't want a beta really anymore i have a gallon tank and was wondering if mollies or guppies would be okay with an hour an a half drive and less frequent feedings or if i should really just get another beta i think you should just get another betta fish since you have experience with them also since your a college student a betta fish is really easy to take care of and if you forget to feed him once in a while that's ok also a betta fish would go perfect in a gallon tank capp Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fish farming Goldfish Alpha Phi Marine aquarium Dwarf gourami Hydrogen economy Phi Beta Kappa Society Sailfin Molly Gmail Clownfish Insulin Sea-Monkey Cessna T-37 Live-bearing aquarium fish Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Blog Education in the United States Technetium The Amber Spyglass Stock car (rail) Brewery Japanese tea ceremony Biodiesel University of California, Santa Barbara Aquarium Saturn V Alzheimer's disease Dairy BitTorrent E85 Honor society Richard Feynman Guild Wars Neutrino Hamster Tilapia Salmon Fire fighting Fugu Axolotl 2004 Republican National Convention Anderson Cooper Mark I (tank) El-Fish RuneScape quests Kenny McCormick Windows Vista Elephant P-47 Thunderbolt Bayesian probability Little Britain Swarthmore College Alcohol fuel Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends Discus (fish) RuneScape Mini-Games Breastfeeding Gourami Nickname Gar M4 Sherman Georgia Institute of Technology Fraternities and sororities Timeline of alternative rock Gaia Online Carrie Jacobs-Bond College of William and Mary Sugar beet Monterey Bay Aquarium Poeciliidae Mid-levels Whitman College Education in the People's Republic of China Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Hybrid vehicle Culture of the United States Shaggy dog story Alpha Phi Omega Social rule STS-51-L Street Canadian slang Time Out of Mind Betamax Mozilla Firefox Enrico Fermi Jon Secada Object Desktop Thomas the Tank Engine Autonomous building Layla Josip Plemelj Terri Schiavo Bocas del Toro Province Homer Simpson University of Houston Reef tank Battle of Inchon Buckminster Fuller
