do fish scales grow back my goldfish became caught between the filter and the wall of the fish tank i managed to free him but now all the scales under his belly have fallen off or been scraped off i have added some antibiotics to the tank to help protect the area but will they ever grow back and if so do you know how long it usually takes thanx hi psycgirl yes the scales on your goldfish will grow back but as he has lost a large number in addition to the antibiotic salt treatment you must ensure his tank water is absolutely perfect by regular partial water changes keep a close eye on your parameters the scales should all have regrown in a few weeks but the new growth may appear lighter than the old at first gradually darken to match his main colour now you are fixing is scales you need to ensure this doesn't happen again by re sighting the filter so the gap behind it is either way too small for any fish to get through or far enough away from the glass so they can pass behind it with ease if it is one of the internal type secured with suckers they function perfectly well simply stood on a solid surface such as a rock in the tank if this is not possible cut a piece of filter sponge to fit securely behind your filter blocking off access you can buy blocks of this for sponge filters from aquarium stores Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Thermal power station Color Electrophysiology Filter (optics) Fish farming Low-pass filter Shrimp farm Dialysis Firearm Discus (fish) Brewery Firewall (networking) Sponge Wood Space Shuttle program Password Temperature Perl Biodiesel T-72 Combine (Half-Life 2) Knife Seismic retrofit Agar plate Circuit design Common cold Hydrogen economy Volleyball Hydroponics Polarization Reef tank Rigging The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Water purification Loudspeaker Transformer Floppy disk ALGOL 68 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Pointer Internal ballistics Color blindness Sunglasses Bretton Woods system Liquid crystal X86 assembly language Hamster Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Syphon Filter Airport Liquid crystal display Antarctic krill Hydraulic machinery Siphon Compiler optimization Poker jargon CPU cache GunBound Glass Electronic amplifier Hardware random number generator Autonomous building Items in the Metroid series Archery Trapping Cell (biology) Campfire Memoir '44 Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Diatom Light-emitting diode Digital photography Hemp Energy development Fancy rat PHP Glasses Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Flowering plant Stopping e-mail abuse Fishing Traffic light Menstrual cup Stereoscopy F-16 Fighting Falcon Clownfish Analog-to-digital converter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sodium chloride
