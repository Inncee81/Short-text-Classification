is there anything wrong with this combination of fish ram green tiger barb betta blond guppy patrizi killifish sailfin molly celebes rainbow splashing tetra and true rummy nose tetra i'm buying a larger tank and i have been looking at fish i have read about all of them and i think that all the temperments on them were peaceful and maybe a couple semi aggressive ones is that a bad combination it really depends a lot on how big the tank is and how you decorate it bettas and rams are both territorial and won't live peacefully together it can work only if it's a large enough tank and well planted but for the most part the safest thing to do is choose one type or the other and run with it as mentioned barbs can be feisty and are also extremely active and can cause problems for your betta or your ram again if the tank is big and well decorated and the barbs kept in a good sized group it might work i don't know this for certain but you need to be careful with the killifish as well it very well may draw aggression from a betta and possibly the ram too so be careful if it were me i'd make it either a ram betta or killifish tank i'm partial to cichlids skip the barbs altogether and then go with the rest of the plan making sure to keep the rainbow and tetras in appropriate schools instead of the barbs i'd go with a school of corydora catfish or other bottom dweller since your tank already has an abundance of open water schoolers Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Poker jargon Sailfin Molly Livestock Shen Gong Wu Brewery Neon tetra Nickname Oscar (fish) Nuclear power Professional wrestling match types Carnivorous plant Pysanka Japanese tea ceremony Link (Legend of Zelda) Dairy Cichlid USS Tunny (SS-282) Hydrogen economy Fast bowling Gar Aquarium Live-bearing aquarium fish Theory of conduct Diving Eastern Front (World War II) Ammonite Marine aquarium Fishing Leopard Fish farming Professional wrestling attacks Tank CPU cache Equine conformation History of the tank Plant St. Louis Rams First-person shooter Extreme Programming Cardinal tetra Social rule Semi-trailer Barbed wire Freshwater angelfish BZFlag Redundant array of independent disks Dr. Seuss Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stairway Professional wrestling slang Dwarf gourami Shrimp farm Laptop Naval mine Princess Zelda Taikyoku shogi Stingray Mosquito Seine (fishing) Rainbow Islands USS Thresher (SS-200) Solar power Atlantic herring Green Day Creatures in Bionicle The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Jet engine The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sewage treatment Lake Malawi Color Strap-on dildo World Championship Wrestling Energy development Autonomous building Malachite green 21st Century Fox Arab-Israeli conflict USS Barb (SS-220) Brotherhood of Nod Theodicy Tank classification Zambezi Glossary of firefighting equipment Sea-Monkey RuneScape skills Thermal power station GunBound Super Bowl XXXVI Floppy disk Gin rummy Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Craps Homeschooling
