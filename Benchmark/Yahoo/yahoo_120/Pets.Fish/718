dark of light substrate my friend gave me a gallon tank that's already cycled but doesn't have much substrate i have a few question what are the advantages and disadvantages of using light and or dark substrate should i just get some ugly substrate and then buy some carpeting plant so that it will cover the every inch of the tank's bottom is there an advantage of doing this beside it looking really awesome as a carpeting plant is java moss the most undemanding and easy to take care of dark substrate will show off your fish's colors better food that falls to the bottom will show up better but fish waste won't show up very well light substrate will drain the color from your fish fish waste will show up better and that's all i can think of now i wouldn't recommend it because you'll need good lighting and co fertilization to maintain that plant ztm Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Aquarium Houseplant Autonomous building Tilapia Biodiesel Fish farming Moss Discus (fish) Carnivorous plant Kissing gourami Dwarf gourami Hydrogen economy Toyota Prius Vitreous enamel Lake Reef tank Shrimp farm Light-emitting diode Eutrophication Goldfish Nuclear power Inkjet printer Thermal power station Dairy Printed circuit board Hemp Flush toilet Color space Pachypodium ambongense Fossil fuel power plant Sea-Monkey Agriculture Stairway Basement Vermicompost Pachypodium baronii Poker jargon Dragon Booster Cannabis cultivation Transistor Fish Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Pachypodium Axolotl Potato The Amazing Race Environmental concerns with electricity generation Kasparov versus The World Coffee RuBisCO Nuclear power plant Carpet Brewery Nutrition Photosynthesis Yohoho!
