a question about facial hair im going to try to make this understandable well heres the problem on the left side of my face my facial hair grows normal down but on the other side it starts down but by the ear it goes back it seems to grow back just turns also the left side seems to grow more than the right of my face and im trying to figure out how to make both sides of my face grow the same way they have told me to shave it in upward position sh t did not have any effect thenks in advanced well common knowledge is that the more frequently u shave the more hair growth u will see also the direction in which u shave will provoke the hair growing direction ur told to shave in upward position but how much time have u given for the hair to start growing in that direction u'd not c the results in just to shavings but u'll need to harbour patience and wait for atleast more shaves also other alternative is try using a trimmer instead of smooth shave use the trimmer more on the left side since it grows more u can thus try balancing the hair growth i think u need to consult a doctor for teh hair growth problem as it's genetic and u truly can't do anything about it as such not all the similar body parts are alike for eg some have their right feet longer or shorter then the left or vice versa lean or thicker this is applicable to ears hands so the problem ur facing is from within ur body all u can do is just try to balance it out u have either shaving daily option or trimming to balance out the growth problem as far as the direction of hair growth try to shave in a single direction and if at all u do shave in the opposite direction try and c to it that u maintain the same direction on the other side of ur face all u need to do is have a bit of patience for the direction to work out i know this coz something bit similar happened with my brother and all he had to do was shave everyday coz he wanted to shave everyday but he tried maintaining the same direction i hope it helps and cheer up it's a petty thing don't worry bout it at all be happy and all will be fine Baldness Puberty Haircut Hair Depilation Prostate cancer Pubic hair Shaving Social rule Swingout Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drill bit Cat Equine conformation Species Professional wrestling holds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Waxing Shaggy dog story Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Mouse (computing) Cephalic disorder Milton H.
