why do people get into a relationship i mean not every couple marriage is going to be perfect and longlasting but then again why are people getting into in a relationship or a marriage then just to have someone hang around them and make them feel good or important or sexy or have a sex buddy or what don't you think people take you dunno whats out there unless you try thing in dating too far like having the you keep trying dating until you find the one attitude won't that process actually cause a lot more hurt and pain and make things complicated look at the amount of divorces nowadays jeeze louize and its like dating and breaking up prepares us for that yo sport people get into relationships for literally thousands of reasons you have people who get involved because they are driven to have someone at any and all costs yet others simply because they think that that is just the way that it is yet others get involved in relationships because they want to prove something to the world that they are what ever they think that that means a validation of their manhood or female prowse that they are desirable that they are accepted a lot of the reason that love falls apart on people is the fact that a lot of love isn't love at all a major chunk of the love relationships that exist today are based in two people showing one another their absolute best side and nothing more through a dating ritual that includes the two of them pushing a scam on one another hiding all their true selves and showing nothing but the best they have to offer and a lot of these people are hunting for someone to fullfill their dreams not thinking for a moment about what part they play in the fulfillment of the other person's dreams guys marry for someone to have their children and to make them feel great sexually and take care of their envoirnment for them normally there are variations here as well gals marry to have a father for their offspring that is reliable and a good provider someone to provide security and the things that they see as essential to a good life here too there are many variations but people have a tendency to be so anxious to have that one big something happen in their life they work double hard at making that happen even to the point of turning blind eyes toward major problems within the relationship while the dating thing is going on and making all kinds of concessions simply to make it happen for the two of them they create relationships a good deal of the time where no real basis for relationships exists then when the day to day life starts to drone on through months and years of being with this person that is so different than they remember them to be while dating it becomes apparent that the individual that they are tied to is not the person they thought they were and it becomes apparent quite rapidly in these types of relationships that this person is not nearly so interested in providing them with their dreams as they are of having their dreams fulfilled dating should be two people getting to know one another on a gradually deepening term where both people learn of one another through many life experiences and there should be break ups when these terms are seen to not be working this is the only way that people can find the combination with a particular individual that does work when you find that one someone whose happiness means more to you than your own you have found love at least for that person now the hard part is do they feel this for you if that is what it is then you are very lucky indeed for now you have something to base a mutual future on otherwise it is simply two people getting together with their own gratifications in mind and two greedy self centered individuals do not form a bright future on any level at all Infantilism Theory of conduct Human sexual behavior Goodness and value theory A Course In Miracles Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Happiness Social rule Sexual orientation Theodicy Narcissism One Tree Hill (TV series) The nature of God in Western theology Summa Theologiae Microeconomics S__ren Kierkegaard Friedrich Schleiermacher Scientology beliefs and practices Sex and the City Supply and demand Philosophical skepticism Time Out of Mind Abortion debate Meaning of life Eastern Orthodox Church About a Boy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Fathers' rights Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show Same-sex marriage Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Economic inequality Sexual abstinence Utilitarianism Alcoholics Anonymous Sex Predestination Nicomachean Ethics Jon Secada Anarchism and society Ontological argument Human Contract Sant Thakar Singh Days of our Lives Love Law of value Philosophy of language Milton H.
