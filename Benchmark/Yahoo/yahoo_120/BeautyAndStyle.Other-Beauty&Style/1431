what is the best outfit for a baby pageant my baby is months old and im gonna sing her in for a baby pageant but can you tell me what should be a good outfit for her she has a light brown hair dark brown eyes ligth skin color like a peach why because i like baby pageants and after two boys this is my little baby girl well i don't want her to look like a clown i just want to dress her cute no make up or anything im gonna sign no sing it depends if it's for a state fair or county fair most contests will tell you that you have to dress the baby in a onesie and a diaper that's it the reason they do this is so judges aren't distracted by a frilly costume giving a parent who can afford a nice dress an advantage over another parent who may not be able to afford 'pageant wear' if it's a real pageant the baby will be expected to wear the frilly pageant dress like here http www universalroyalty com pageantclothes htm i think it's a shame that we can't enjoy our baby girls for just being babies and instead we load their little faces with makeup and put frilly dresses on them and parade them around to be judged it starts way too early edit i think with your baby's coloring a yellow or peach dress or emerald green would look stunning good luck it's not my place to judge what you as a parent decide to do i might do the same thing if i had a daughter but i only had one and he's a boy The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Beauty contest Sharon Tate Mario Teen Girl Squad My Little Pony Clown Black Paul Is Dead Negima Physical attractiveness Joker (comics) The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Dragon Booster Frankie Laine Boy band The Amazing Race Drag queen Infantilism Diaper Triple J Hottest 100, 2003 Comanche Gothic Lolita Miss America Totally Spies!
