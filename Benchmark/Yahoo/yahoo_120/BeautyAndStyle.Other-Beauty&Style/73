i need to find a new perfume whats your fav i need a new perfume and i cant decide what to get anybody have any suggestions i love perfume too my suggestion is to look at some of your current favorites try and put them in a category if possible do you like flowery scents musky scents spicy scents clean light scents if you can categorize them try going to a department store and tell them that you prefer a certain type of scent and ask them what they recommend many stores will give you samples if they don't offer it to you go ahead and ask them take the sample home and wear it for a few days i m sure you know that perfumes work with your natural oils and body scents so what may smell great on you may not work as nicely on me also don't be afraid to change scents during the seasons i know someone that wears the best spring perfume it's something i can't afford but it is still fun for the season i really only switch between two or three scents during the year i am a big fan of lancome cosmetics i've gotten numerous perfume samples when i've purchased makeup that is how i've grown to like tresor miracle and poeme for a clean scent i like cool water from davidoff good luck Aromatherapy Olfaction Teen Girl Squad Paris Hilton Sage Rose Flower Jennifer Lopez Odor Fancy rat Natural gas Clothing Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Guerlain Domestic goat Japanese tea ceremony Essential oil Kurt Cobain Britney Spears Roxette The Amazing Race Tour de France Indole Sears Holdings Corporation Social rule Mattress Menstrual cycle Motor oil Japanese toilet Incense Cinnamon Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Physical attractiveness Cedar Rapids, Iowa AFI 100 Years series Body piercing Heinkel He 100 Caving American lobster Trademark Sento Microeconomics Beer Africanized bee Non-conventional trademark Ginny Weasley Foot odor New York Giants Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 The Adventures of Pete & Pete Marilyn Monroe Oolong Nuclear power Animal Crossing The Emancipation of Mimi Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Gucci Angel One (TNG episode) Water Cliff Richard Pet skunk Multiple chemical sensitivity Patchouli Sexual attraction The Beach Boys Soap Christmas tree Sulfur Tattoo Olive oil Flatulence Breastfeeding Scarface (1983 film) Frankie Laine Radio controlled car St. Louis Cardinals Avenue Q The Drew Carey Show Fancy Crane Cosmo Kramer Muskellunge Coffin Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur Rei Ayanami Daylight saving time Rocko's Modern Life Cantonese cuisine Aroma compound American Black Bear L'Or__al Effeminacy Shot of Love Musk Paul Is Dead House music Roman eating and drinking Black pepper Sharon Tate Timon and Pumbaa
