modelling i wanna be a model do i have to pay to get in a portfolio modeling is over rated my daughter is ' and has been modeling for the last couple of years she is also going to college the modeling industry is not a good one unless you feel comfortable with undressing in the nude with others watching you can expect that if you do runway my daughter chose to do bridal runway shows and even when she had her own room it really made her wonder to start off you have to have a professional photo shoot then create comp and face cards and then locate an agent that knows what they're doing many of the agency's are not as they claim they get at leat of all your earnings you do the work and they get the profits by the time anyone gets a first look it can be in the thousands and that is not including any job another thing to think about is the fact that once your face is out there you can have stalkers as my daughter did who was able to locate her it is not a safe career for a young woman to be in and i would advise you have a body guard if your serious about it way too much trouble please think it over well Modelling agency America's Next Top Model Economic inequality Striptease Model (art) Blue Heelers Sin City EastEnders Nudity Friends Economics Page Falkenberg Trish Stratus Insurance National Football League Credit card Blackjack On Her Majesty's Secret Service The Devil Wears Prada Citigroup The Apprentice 2 candidates God Emperor of Dune Bond Internet fraud Apple Computer GoldenEye 007 Life insurance Principal-agent problem Jam (TV series) Progressive tax Barbie The Critic Tyra Banks Montgomery Burns Airline Spice Girls Lewis Carroll Computer and video game industry Boris Becker Labor theory of value Eddie Guerrero Haven (TNG episode) The Shining (film) Minimum wage United Kingdom corporation tax Brian Jones (musician) Humphrey Bogart Swimming pool Sharon Tate Trade union Student loan G-Man (Half-Life) Graduate school Fred A.
