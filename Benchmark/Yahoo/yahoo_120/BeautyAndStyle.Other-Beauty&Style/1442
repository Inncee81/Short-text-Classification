belly piercing my little girl is about three months now after she was born i put my barbell back in and never had a problem one day while cradling her before bed she seemed to discover the barbell poking out due to a tighter shirt on and she went for it and needless to say it hurt fairly bad is there any small belly rings out there on the market i can buy that she won't be able to pull out i tried a barbell rather than a ring and she still wants to go for it i'd rather keep something in the piercing so that i don't lose it thanks so much i had the opposite problem with a ring on it would be caught in stuff so i went to a barbell go to a piercing place and they can change it for you it might be that the flattest thing against your skin might be best and make sure it has nothing protuding or dangling like charms Earring Barbell (piercing) Suplex Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Powerlifting Body piercing USS Barbel (SS-316) The Shining (film) Professional wrestling throws Piledriver (professional wrestling) Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Poker jargon The Fairly OddParents Phoebe Halliwell One Tree Hill (TV series) Franklin Pierce Kurt Angle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Vampire Violin Archery Tongue piercing Comanche Professional wrestling attacks 1957 World Series Electrophysiology Battle of Vicksburg Die Another Day Prince Albert piercing Weight training Social rule Condom Professional wrestling slang Snake Mars Exploration Rover One Ring Theory of conduct Knots Landing Lip piercing Diving Craps Treehouse of Horror XV Empire Burlesque Sydney Riot of 1879 Mattress Meat Loaf Professional wrestling match types Ayyavazhi mythology Fish anatomy World Championship Wrestling Phoebe Buffay's songs Lindy Basic EastEnders Conker's Bad Fur Day Equine conformation Nose piercing Sin City Danio Shit Shrek 2 Ric Flair Great Teacher Onizuka Bart Simpson M60 machine gun Garfield Highway 61 Revisited Extreme Dodgeball Red Hot Chili Peppers Ear piercing instrument Undergarment Barbie The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Marilyn Monroe Nile crocodile Beavis and Butt-head Vegeta Shark Trapping Skateboarding trick The Lord of the Rings Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shawn Michaels Doomtown James T.
