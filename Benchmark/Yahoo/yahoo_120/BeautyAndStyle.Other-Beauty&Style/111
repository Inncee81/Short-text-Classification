i hate my eyebrows please help i have thick ugly bushy eyebrows i got them waxed before and they were still bushy people even made fun of my eyebrows i really want to get them done so they are not bushy do you have any pics of someone with really nice eyebrows thanks steps get them waxed if you want remember waxing is one big ouch whereas tweezing is lots of little ouches and it takes longer if you have decided to tweeze make sure you know what you are doing get a tweezer and carefully pinch the hair close to the skin you are trying to take out pull the hair up or straight out never pull the hair down you will just break the hair try not to tweeze on top of your eyebrow pluck after a shower so the hairs are soft another option is threading which is used mostly in the indian culture and takes a little longer but the eyebrows can be shaped more precise and hurts less then waxing if you're still not satisfied with the shape or you think your eyebrows are messy take a preferably new toothbrush spray it with hairspray and then rub the brush over your eyebrows to shape them as you want them this also keeps the hairs down tips if the tweezing hurts too much rub an ice cube or hot washcloth over your brows when you're done moisturize your eyebrows so you don't get all those annoying little bumps get a mirror with good magnification tweezing underneath your brows hurts more than in the middle be prepared warnings do not use a razor on your brows they will just grow in quicker and it's not as precise do not overpluck they don't always grow back in don' t pinch your skin it really hurts hope this helps Casting Pubic hair Knife Dreadlocks Textile manufacturing Hair Manicure Aerial (dance move) Social rule Violin Customs and etiquette of Japan Leather Drill bit Cross-country skiing Waxing Volleyball Equine conformation Characters in the Smurfs Shaving Strap-on dildo Dragon Booster Cruising (maritime) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Double bass Comanche Internal ballistics Cheese Shaggy dog story Mummy Guitar Unibrow Kodocha Bass guitar Piccolo Junior Saga Towel Hip hop rivalries Moustache 1957 World Series RuneScape quests Psoriasis Pitaten Acne Weaving Leaf Cannabis cultivation Sento Cosmetics Happy Tree Friends Diving Spidey Super Stories Tofu Brush Minor Harry Potter Beasts Drawing Baldness Skin Brewery Wood carving Dodge Charger Breastfeeding Amateur telescope making Razor Physical attractiveness Massage Physical characteristics of the Buddha Head Slayers Sperm Whale Hip hop collaborations Vulcan (Star Trek) Upholstery Little Britain Toothbrush Fast bowling Mattress Tattoo Cape Feare Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wax play Columbine High School massacre 2000 Australian Grand Prix Salute Sin City Internet troll Futurama (TV series - season 3) Alkane Elephant The Adventures of Pete & Pete Tick Beard Drag racing Three Stooges Sundial
