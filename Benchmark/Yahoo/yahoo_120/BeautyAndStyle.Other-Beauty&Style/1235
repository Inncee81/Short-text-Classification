i want to start modeling i really want to get into modeling but for an year old girl what weight do you have to be if your ' remember for an year old girl im not worrying about it i love my body and im not overweight at all i was just wondering me and my mother were both models before it looks like alot of fun but really requires alot of work sometimes they make you drive hours away and you dont even get picked to be in an advertisement sometimes you wait around for hours just to get interviewed and sent home its an empty buisness if u really want to though have a photographer take pictures of you and send them to an agency if you have what there looking for they will probably call you and set up an interview and maybe you can get into some photoshoots and commercials but then again you have to be photogenic with alot of confidence your weight doesnt matter it all depends on what the agency is looking for good luck Social rule Atomic Kitten Modelling agency Patricia Ford Jennifer Lopez The Ashlee Simpson Show Marilyn Monroe Sharon Tate Photography Advertising Anorexia nervosa The Inside Super Size Me Sony Menstrual cup Piccolo Junior Saga Mnemonic Surveillance Milton H.
