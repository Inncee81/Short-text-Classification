i found my sister smoking today i saw my sister smoking a cigarette shes and ever since then i have lost respect for her should i be a good sister and not tell my parents or should i just tell my parents i already told her face to face and my sister said she would do anything to not tell my parents and i dont want her to bribe me and i'm just confuse right now help she said she feels bad and that she is embarassed and she would stop smoking but what shall i do i'm a year younger then her it's your sister's desicion on whether to smoke or not it's not your place to tell your parents trust me they'll find out talk to her about it but realize you cannot change her mind on smoking it's all up to her don't lose respect for her she's your sister i'm sure she'll always be there for you and you for her she's making a mistake i say that being a smoker myself but respect her regardless of whether or not you support her decision Cigarette Smoking Man Saint Nicholas The Smoking Room Sub-Zero Milton H.
