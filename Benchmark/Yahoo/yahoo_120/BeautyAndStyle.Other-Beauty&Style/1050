hollister aero abercrombie ae unfair why do people always obsess about the prices or the just clothing at these stores okay because they are not expensive you would pay just as much at oldnavy or jcpennys or macys they say you are paying for the label not the quality hello tommy hilfiger ralph lauren dior chanel oldnavy and lacoste they have their label all over there clothes tommy hilfiger even has their colors all over it yet people dont talk crap about them they dont sayy ohh well you're just payin for that rich old mans label and not how good or how long its gonna last why do they attack abercrombie soo much soo what if people like its comfortable why are people hating soo much on a f hollister ae not so much aeropostale but its gets it fair share how come people dont talk about the other labels but talk soo much shit about the ones i listed and i know some people might say oh well its the culture well what about tommy hilfiger it has a culture to you know its mostly black people and other just like a f mostly white other i adore abercromibe and hollister and ae they have the cutest clothes and i don't think they're pricey i mean nothing that i've ever gotten at abercrombie or hollister has ever ripped and i've been shopping there since i was like now i'm and when i grow out of my clothes my sister picks out what she wants and we give the rest away and they are still in perfect condition i mean the only reason they should rip is if you got too small of a size and it stretched too much and made a hole in it but that would happen with any brand not just abercrombie and people are always saying that people who shop at abercrombie are anorexic or unhealthy but there are different types of body types and some people are naturally skinny like me and others who shop at abercrombie hollister and some people are naturally fat so why don't the fat people just go to a plus sized store instead of complaining about the price quality image that abercrombie is putting out and people say that everyone wears those clothes and you should have your own style but if you like the clothes it is your style it's just a more popular style than like hot topic or some other store and i agree that you can get the same price for a shirt on clearance at hollister that is regular price at like macy's so just look in clearance if you're tight on money and if it weren't for abercrombie or hollister i'd be wearing like an xs in some other store and it would still be too big for me so i think people should just get over it cuz everyone has different body types and different styles and abercrombie hollister ae are made for the preppy slim people so don't get mad cuz you can't fit into the clothes sorry i wrote so much but there's alot to say so i hope this helped and keep wearing a f and the other stores u listed no matter what anyone says Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
