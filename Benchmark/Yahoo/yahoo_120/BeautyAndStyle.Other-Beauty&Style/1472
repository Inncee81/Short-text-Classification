silk wrap fiberglass are they better for your nails can you see the silk under the nail or does it look the same as acrylic if you could explain what they are or have some pics that would be great unfortunatly i have no pics of silk wraps but i can describe it to you and explain it to you as simply as i can it is silk that is usually peeled off a peice of paper cut to fit the size of your nail either your natural nail or your nail with a tip on it this is where you get the strength to keep your nails some of the silk is thinner than others some looks on the thicker side sometimes you can see it yes it really depends on how well your nail tech can do it and you should not touch it with your finger as you will get oils from your finger on it as your placeing it on your nail it may cause your glue to not stick well or cause it to lift it away fiberglass is done the same way then there is a resin dripped on top of the silk or fiberglass and then a spray is sprayed on top of that to cause the resin glue to harden now there are other ways of doing the silks and fiberglass some use products that they can simply polish on with a brush and use a ultraviolet light to cure it to harden to answer you next question about are they better for your nails i have been a nail tech for years and i am retired now i have been wearing acrylics all this time yes 'i have tried fiberglass and silk but they just do not stay on me as well as acrylics do so i have worn the acrylics of my time i will tell you my theory on it i do not think that anything you put on your nails is good for them other than strengthening products polishes oils etc as over a period of time your natural nails will get thin from fileing buffing and be more seseptable sp to hurting when you bump them or they will be more easily to feel heat or cold when in water so you may want to outweigh the good or bad for me it's too late as i have to continue to wear them to protect my natural nails now from soreness when i bump them or pain from hot water and my cuticals will dry out very badly to the point of peeling and sores the fiberglass and silks lift the same way that acrylics do and you will need to have fills balances done on them the same way one thing i would like to pled with you to do or rather not do is do not go to the asian shops to have your nails done go to a regular salon and talk to the nail tech ask what she he reccomends for you and why ask what the name of the product they will be useing on you is make sure they have clean instruments and they wash their hands or disinfect them before they touch you and disinfect yours as well or allow you to wash them if they do not tell you what product they use on you then you need to leave so many asian shops use a product in their nail system called methol methocrylate which is a dental bonding agent so the product literly adheirs to your nail bed this means it is not good for your nails and they have to literly file off the product they cannot soak it off with pure acetone as it should be they cause pain by nippin up the old nailtip which pulls off a layer of natural nail with it i can tell you loads more well good luck and hope you make the right decision Upholstery Paint Mattress Nail (anatomy) Textile manufacturing Printed circuit board Fiberglass Knife Boat building Violin Menstrual cup Pottery Tattoo Carbon fiber Tire Pedicure Guqin Drill bit Organic peroxide Leather Polymethyl methacrylate Fly fishing Textile manufacturing terminology Timpani Radio controlled airplane Lacquer Equine conformation Tofu Hair Dairy Thermal power station Wood Brewery Ultraviolet Adhesive Cello Milton H.
