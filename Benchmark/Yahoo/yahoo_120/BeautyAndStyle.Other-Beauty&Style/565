what age is it okay to get rid of the hair down there not like a wax but shaving and stuff serious answers please when did you if you wanna share that i know i'm going to probably get slammed for saying this but you asked for opinions there really isn't a good reason for teenagers to shave their pubic area and i would be highly angered if i found out my teenager had been doing it there shouldn't be anyone down there that one would have to try and impress someone with shaved out designs or to give easier access to it's just a kind of slutty thing to do pubic hair is one of the many ways that mother nature signals to men that a female has reached puberty and is ready for mating breeding by shaving off this hair a female is mimicking the pre pubescent body form it would make a really interesting research project to try and correlate the rise of pubic shaving rising in the s s with the decline of status for the mature female or any rises in child molestation pedophilia if you have to say hair down there instead of pubic hair then you re most likely still too immature and don t really need to worry about it no one every mentions the downsides of pubic hair removal extreme itching when it grows back do you really want people to see you with your hand down your pants and itching your pubes like mad for a week you often break out in small little pimples due to the removal of the hair shaft from sebaceous glands and build up of oils and sweats and shaving is more likely to give you painful ingrown hairs where the hair gets stuck beneath the skin as it grows back and forms an ugly nasty pimple looking thing that can cause scarring if you re of a lighter complexion on top of all of these nasty things shaving is only good for a few hours to a day and a half before the hair starts to grow back in and you re scratching away at your privates like a monkey at the zoo at heck even girls are too young to be worried about shaving away all of their pubic hair i guess i can see how this new hair can be viewed as being sick and gross by young girls but they should really take pride in their developing bodies if you need to do something for purely hygienic reasons try trimming with scissors just be sure you don t get too close to the skin you risk cutting yourself Puberty Hair Depilation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Acne Crab louse Vulva Baldness Pedophilia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Thermoregulation Haircut Shaving Beard Kodocha Social rule Delayed puberty Adolescence Sento Cat Tarantula Skin Female genital cutting Prostate cancer Penis Menstrual cup Child sexuality Pseudofolliculitis barbae Adrenarche Phoebe Buffay's songs Waxing Skinhead Dandruff Comanche Radiation therapy Dilbert Sebaceous gland Physical attractiveness Theory of conduct Friends Guinea pig Head louse Gray Wolf AFI 100 Years series Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Piccolo Junior Saga Hypertrichosis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kender Teen Girl Squad Professional wrestling match types Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dragon Booster 613 mitzvot Megan Griffin Menstrual cycle Humphrey Bogart Black (people) Wound healing phases The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Eczema Ren and Stimpy House Mouse Sperm Whale Pornography Scar Pitaten Avenue Q Aqua Teen Hunger Force Acomoclitism Law of value Anorexia nervosa Dog Asperger syndrome Kim Possible Sweating Testosterone Platypus Callus Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Herpes simplex virus Jon Secada The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Baldness treatments Ron and Fez Mountain Gorilla Scarification Sexual orientation Human Circumcision
