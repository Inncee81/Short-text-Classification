smokey eyes i'm a yr old freshman and i was wondering if that's too young to do the smokey eye i reeally love it and i think it looks great but my friend said it was too much is it i'm a year old freshman too well normally i would say go natural but if you really want to here first use brown soft color eyeliner and start lining your eye don't be too harsh because the next step is smudging it with a sponge or q tip then you brush your eye crease with some coffee eye shadow do the lower lash line too okay do it lightly go for a more softer smokey eye it'll look great The Miracles Cosmetics Smokey Robinson Coffee Drawing Diamond R.E.M.
