i go into the salon and ask for gels i think they give me acrylic with a layer of gel on top i've been to several salons in my area and i'm suspicious of this i was just reading about how gels are applied in layers well i've been getting the powder dipped in liquid put on the last step is painting one coat of thick shiny stuff that has to be cured under the light am i getting ripped off also my nails are always coming up at the sides and they insist on redoing them that really hurts yes you are getting ripped off powder plus liquid is acrylic the clear stuff that has to cure under the light is uv gell if you want a full set of uv gel then expect to pay a little more but they will last longer look clearer and more natural find a new salon and be specific about what service you want they may try to tell you that it is gel blah blah blah but a good salon will show you the different products and services they have available so go around and ask questions Paint Manicure Casting Acrylic paint Psoriasis Plastic Deck (ship) Explosive material Epoxy Nail (anatomy) Polymethyl methacrylate Western blot Pottery Impressionism Gelatin Polymerase chain reaction Glaze The Legend of Zelda series enemies Brewery Tofu Little Britain Compact disc Keynesian economics Printed circuit board Gel Agarose gel electrophoresis Sento Fire extinguisher Socrates Sol gel Opportunity rover Aluminium Mass spectrometry Brazing Vitreous enamel Powder metallurgy Food preservation Cosmetics Solar cell Shroud of Turin Shampoo Lacquer Tobacco Titanium Sewage treatment Gel electrophoresis Acne Milk Drill bit Glass Stage lighting Krusty Gets Busted Liquid crystal Polyelectrolyte Stucco Eye Deodorant Nuclear magnetic resonance Vacutainer Staining (biology) Iggy Pop Handloading Pok__mon Abilities Ultraviolet Brush Ammunition Amateur telescope making Japanese cuisine Textile manufacturing terminology Hair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Traditional animation Breast implant Silicon Illegal drug trade Japanese tea ceremony Tissue engineering Winter Fluoride therapy Light-emitting diode Great Depression Optical coating Table tennis Photolithography Bulk vending Petroleum Nine Inch Nails Gesso Leaf Mouth ulcer Heck reaction Column chromatography Yerba mate Phosphoric acid Photography Stereoscopy Normal distribution Dairy
