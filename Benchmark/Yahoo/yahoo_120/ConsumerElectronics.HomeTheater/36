i have a p dlp and i am wondering whether or not to get a hd player i have an upscaling dvd player and so far the dvds look fantastic but i was wondering if an hd dvd or blu ray player would be much of a step into the hd world over upscaling to p also if it is worth it which hd dvd or blu ray player would you recomend i had my eye on the toshiba hd a due to the price even up converted dvds carry only sdtv resolution lines and the picture quality is limited to that hd dvd and bluray players will upscale regular dvds but aren't necessarily any better than what you have you main benefit will come when you get hd or bluray dvds a well made hd dvd or bluray will provide lines of resolution down scaled from and give you much more detail in your pictures High-definition television Blu-ray Disc DVD Laserdisc Television MPEG-2 Video Video CD Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital television Handheld game console Xbox 360 Camcorder H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Digital cinema Anamorphic widescreen 8 mm video format Telecine Machinima MP3 NTSC Nablus Volleyball Movie projector Manga ATSC DualDisc Super Video CD Galactic Civilizations Video codec S-VHS Stereoscopy Endgame PlayStation Portable S__CAM Karaoke Xbox Sport utility vehicle The Criterion Collection Analog-to-digital converter Ayumi Hamasaki Digital photography Pok__mon Chronicles GamePark Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX PAL Laptop Regional lockout DLP TiVo Rush (band) O scale Color depth SCART HD DVD Widescreen Plasma display Digital rights management Civilization III In The Groove (game) Game theory Blu Cantrell VHS Bish__jo game Beavis and Butt-head Run Length Limited Macrovision Screenshot Tag Dubbing (filmmaking) Major League Baseball Neiman Marcus Adventure Game Studio Blockbuster Video World Poker Tour The Apprentice 2 Homestar Runner Motion picture rating system Comparison of media players DVD-Audio Videocassette recorder Quantum Leap Invader Zim Color Eye color Airsoft CPU design 1080p Moir__ pattern Money in Harry Potter Missingno.
