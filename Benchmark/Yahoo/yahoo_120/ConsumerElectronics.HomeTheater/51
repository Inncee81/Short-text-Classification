whats a good tv projector for under and is good for gamming and has built in speakers and if you know any stores that have it please tell me thanks there are some projectors in that price range but to be honest none of them are good for tv or gaming here's why most of the projectors in that range are built for one specific purpose and that is to display static images for presentations similar to a computer monitor there is little to no attention paid to the overall picture quality contrast ratio aspect ratio even hookups because the only thing they typically display is spreadsheets and graphs the fans in these units are generally very noisy thus making them inappropriate for a theaer like environment and they are really not meant to be used for extended amounts of time also in this price range you can forget about having support for hd which is yet another reason these those projectors are available at such a low cost for a real projector or at least one that will give you the quality presentation that you should be looking for in a projector that you will use for serious movie watching and game playing i suggest looking for a projector that is made specifically for home theater use expect projectors of this caliber to start around i highly recommend the panasonic pt ax u it retails for and has a native x display and supports hd sources it may sound more expensive than you're wanting to spend but i guarantee you'll be much happier with the performance of the unit in the long run if is too much take a look at some of panasonic's older models you can probably still find them online refurbished or used like the pt ae u or the pt ae u both of these units perform very well also and could probably be had for closer to or much less any projector you purchase will usually have one built in speaker but it won't have more than watts going to it projectors are really supposed to be display devices only meaning i would never recommend using them for true speaker amplifier replacements also i would suggest not slouching on the screen either most people overlook the importance of the screen but it can truely make or break a projectors picture quality i know it's a lot of info but i hope it helps you make an informed buying decision Digital photography Microeconomics Loudspeaker Motion picture rating system Computer Economics High-definition television Atari 8-bit family Anamorphic widescreen Supply and demand IBM PC compatible Amstrad CPC Television Management information system Insurance Sound Blaster MP3 Projection screen Atari ST Gramophone record Inflation Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Gamut Home cinema Movie theater Widescreen Mutual fund Gross domestic product Laptop 35 mm film Transformer FairTax IMAX Solar cell Atari 2600 Tax Xbox 360 Photography Hard disk Embedded system Audiophile A Course In Miracles Surveillance Commodore International MMORPG Cinerama Light-emitting diode Nintendo Revolution High fidelity Slot machine Commodore 64 Digital projector Bicycle lighting Internet fraud Video Windows Vista Neopets Opportunity cost Laserdisc PlayStation 3 Personal computer Outsourcing Labor theory of value Capitalism Electronic amplifier ZX Spectrum NTSC Operational amplifier Amiga SCART Decibel Film Transistor ITunes Portable Document Format Computer and video games Library (computer science) Bluetooth Subwoofer Demoscene Expert system Final Fantasy XI Windows 2000 Magnetic resonance imaging Consensus decision-making Circuit design Nintendo DS Sonar Pixel PLATO NeXT
