surround sound i just bought a pioneer surround sound system for the xbox it sounds great on the but i got directv hooked up yesterday and when i watch tv with the surround sound on there is a delay in the sound ex when people talk on the tv their mouths move and a second later the sound comes out of the surround sound speakers now with the surround sound off and the audio just out of the tv its perfect any suggestions on how to hook up the directv to the surround sound without any audio delay we have had two or three similar questions in this section recently each time the questioner had the audio sent to the tv first and then to the surround sound system this shouldn't be a problem unless you have the tv's audio set to some kind of artificial surround mode surround on a tv is for people who have no external surround sound system still it seems that some model or models of tvs must have a defect of some kind in their audio outputs try sending the audio directly from the satellite receiver to the surround sound system if you still have this problem after doing so then you have a problem with the pioneer system i have heard of substandard chips in receivers causing an audio delay if the problem is with the receiver i would return the whole system and get an onkyo surround sound system Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Laserdisc Television Xbox 360 Modem Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis SCART Atari 8-bit family Super Nintendo Entertainment System Subwoofer Radar Pirate decryption Hearing impairment MP3 DirecTV X Window System Nintendo Entertainment System Communications satellite Speech synthesis Video game music Oscilloscope ZX Spectrum Sega Dreamcast Original Amiga chipset Apple IIGS Urinary incontinence TiVo High-definition television Vorbis XM Satellite Radio PlayStation Portable IPod IBM PC compatible Cable television Computer Super Audio CD Mixing console Digital television Atari ST Amstrad CPC Central processing unit Satellite television Digital audio broadcasting Audio system measurements MiniDisc Surround sound Musical Instrument Digital Interface DVD Speed of light Sound effect Radio Electronic amplifier PlayStation 3 Phonograph Voice over IP Floppy disk S__CAM Stereophonic sound Bose Corporation Hard disk Home cinema TurboGrafx 16 Gramophone record Artificial neural network Amiga Sound card Microphone GunZ The Duel AmigaOS Radiation hardening Solar system Acorn Electron MOS Technology SID CPU cache Citigroup Timeline of computing 1990-forward Cyberspace Stuttering RISC MIPS architecture Dolby Digital Commodore 64 Sega Saturn Reel-to-reel audio tape recording Speech recognition Dolby Pro Logic Logic Second language acquisition Nintendo Revolution Direct broadcast satellite Audiophile General relativity International Phonetic Alphabet PC Engine
