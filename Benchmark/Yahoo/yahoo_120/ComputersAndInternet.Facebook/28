what's this facebook website all about it's what the people above have stated but it's also a more private version of sites like myspace you basically have to know the person to add them you can't just view anyone's profile and it's based on being connected by a network or networks my network is my city and when i get my new college email address i will have that college's network as well you can also add a job network if you want but that doesn't mean you can't add people in other networks if you personally know of someone they can give you their link and you can see friends of friends and send them an add request also you can look up people's names and you can see what people from your aim buddy list or email address book are already on facebook basically it's to keep in touch with people you actually know and if you want to meet new people it's usually going to be people in your network or friends of friends so it's supposedly a little safer and less random also it's based more on actually getting to know people and not just adding a ton of random people you won't see anyone like tila tequila or forbidden on facebook at least i haven't so far people don't get famous by going onto facebook it's less pretentious in my opinion depends on what you want if you want to join a social network site to stay in touch with people and meet quality people quality over quantity then facebook might be for you if you're trying to get your name out there and add tons of people to get big such as being a model being in a band or being a comedian then maybe facebook isn't your first choice Facebook (website) E-mail Friend-to-friend Social software Surveillance Make money fast Bluetooth Computer Plame affair Denial-of-service attack Internet fraud Social network Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act AppleTalk Gmail EMule Internet privacy Blog Domain Name System Advance fee fraud Transmission Control Protocol Spam (electronic) Stopping e-mail abuse Common Unix Printing System Game show Internet Group Management Protocol Sender Policy Framework Password Pretty Good Privacy Database management system Web crawler Extreme Programming Anonymous remailer MySpace Theory of conduct Phishing Cross site scripting Anonymous P2P Alcoholics Anonymous AOL Instant Messenger Friends IP address Voice over IP IP Multimedia Subsystem GameFAQs The Best Page in the Universe Freenet Novell NetWare The Price Is Right Search engine optimization X Window System Arianne Mozilla Application Suite Ethernet AmigaOS PNG Communications protocol Philosophical skepticism Cable television LiveJournal Internet Relay Chat Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Computer virus Open mail relay Live 8 Mafia (game) America Online Universal Plug and Play WebSphere Virtual hosting GunBound Prisoner's dilemma Viral marketing Social rule Small world phenomenon Web traffic Ajax (programming) PowerPC Software engineering Redundant array of independent disks Kazaa Network address translation Let's Make a Deal Randomness Spam Prevention Early Warning System MP3 Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
