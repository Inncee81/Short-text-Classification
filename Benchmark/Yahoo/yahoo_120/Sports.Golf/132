is it a rule of golf that when playing ball matchplay of the difference in handicap is used no it's not a rule of golf though used to be the almost universal formula in match play we often get confused with the term a rule of golf which only covers those rules instituted by and regulated by the royal and ancient r a which governs golf in this country as far as i know the r a don't issue rules on things like stroke allowance but they did a few years ago suggest or recommend that the former be replaced by full allowance of the difference in handicap if they felt was wrong why they didn't go to as an experiment is beyond me as what they were saying in effect was that what they had been recommending for years or more was totally wrong it's only my opinion but as a middle handicapper with no bias matchplay comps tend to be won by low handicappers owing to their greater consistency over the round and over the competition the higher handicapper often gets stage fright receiving many shots and doesn't perform i had no problem receiving only of my shots in terms of it being fair the result in many cases now is that lower handicappers are discouraged from entering matchplay events as they have little chance of giving lots of shots if their opponent just plays his her game without boring everyone further this is because a handcap is issued based on a medal strokeplay round where matchplay shots are allowed on a hole by hole basis i e on hole you may beat your opponent by shots but you are only one hole up he can have a but he only loses the hole most of the clubs i know now use full allowance Golf ELO rating system Snooker Golf handicap Match play Ryder Cup Lottie Dod Golf club (equipment) Badminton HSBC World Match Play Championship PGA Championship Golf glossary Go ranks and ratings Football (soccer) The Big Break Croquet Professional wrestling match types M16 (rifle) Ultimate (sport) The Open Championship Handicapping Abortion debate Michael Campbell Squash (sport) Volleyball Caddy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internal ballistics Tiger Woods Betting (poker) U.S. Open (golf) Inflation Laws of cricket Mixed martial arts Michelle Wie Fast bowling Sport Rugby union Playoff Firearm Drag racing Boxing U.S. Amateur Championship PGA European Tour Ice hockey Appeal 1896 Summer Olympics Gambling Norway national football team Football Drifting (motorsport) Slot machine National Football League Chess terminology Cricket FC Rostov Graduate school Baseball Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Divorce Hot Shots Golf (series) Stopping power Theory of conduct Abortion Ra (board game) Mahjong Hazeltine National Golf Club Ernie Els Sudden death Go (board game) Texas hold 'em Water polo American football FairTax Pinball Randomness Billiards Eight ball Quizbowl Australian rules football World Series Microeconomics RuneScape Backgammon Andre Agassi Paintball Simon Commission Racquetball Bowl Championship Series Draw poker
