why are three of golfs majors played in the usa tennis has grand slams played in four different countries aren't there any good enough courses in spain france australia etc even the unofficial ' th' major sawgrass is in america i know probably a silly question but just something that bugs me the american majors are unique and special enough to be highly respected and coveted the us open was created at the turn of the century by the snobbish upper class united states golf association which is not so different from the snobbish upper class of great britain's royal and ancient golf club but both of these organizations possessed enough respect to be able to call their tournaments national open championships with real authority the pga championship the rd major received high acclaim as the championship of the best professional golf association in the world the american pga has always been the best pro golf organization simply because americans made heroes of its pro golfers while other countries in the early th century considered a pursuit such as professional golf as befitting only nd class citizens other pro tours didn't receive near the respect until the latter half of the th century so the american pga has much more tradition going for it lastly the masters the th major is so highly respected worldwide because of it's heroic founder bobby jones and the incredibly unique and beautiful course it is played on augusta national it also certainly helps that all american majors have the vast financial backing of corporate america to ensure they are always played on the best golf courses money can buy the best evidence of how much money can play a factor is by comparing the men's and women's tours the women don't have near the corporate backing and therefore are constantly needing to replace a tournament that used to be considered a major the majors are not set in stone it's a matter of current public opinion believe it or not the british open and the pga have both suffered less respect for long stretches of time during the last years or so until arnold palmer began playing the british open early in his career most american pro's and the american media had written off that championship as too big a hassle to worry about the great ben hogan only played in one british open in his entire career which he won of course for years the pro's had to choose between the pga and british because they were played too close together to play both modern aviation eventually made traveling to europe much more plausible and eventually the tradition of the british open drew all of the great american pro's back to playing in it each year the british is here to stay now it will never lose its place as the co equal to the us open however the pga has lost its luster on several occasions especially since the pga of america hasn't been the parent of the american pro tour for nearly years now even now it is definitely viewed at a slightly lower level than the other majors within the next years it is possible another great tournament will gain notariety and shove itself in among the top the players is a possible choice maybe an unbelievable new course will be built by tiger woods that everyone falls in love with and he'll begin building a st rate tournament america loves it's heroes Vijay Singh Greg Norman Official World Golf Rankings Senior PGA Championship Nick Faldo Ernie Els Professional golf tours The Masters Tournament Lee Trevino PGA Grand Slam of Golf Michelle Wie Sports timeline WGC-World Cup Norway national football team United States Golf Association Roger Federer The PLAYERS Championship Tom Lehman Sport in the United Kingdom HSBC World Match Play Championship Tiger Woods PGA Tour WGC-NEC Invitational John McEnroe Andre Agassi Severiano Ballesteros Association of Tennis Professionals Ian Woosnam Pete Sampras Phil Mickelson U.S. Amateur Championship ELO rating system Golf glossary Fred Couples Michael Campbell Gustavo Kuerten Western Open Bj__rn Borg Baltusrol Golf Club Leon White Sergio Garc__a World Championship Wrestling Padraig Harrington Ryder Cup Jos__ Mar__a Olaz__bal Sudden death Hazeltine National Golf Club Golf club (equipment) Mark O'Meara Scottsdale, Arizona The Big Break Rugby union Firestone Country Club Tom Watson (golfer) Playoff format Steffi Graf Ivan Lendl John Daly (golfer) Sport in Ireland Wales national rugby union team Raymond Floyd U.S. Open (tennis) Mark McNulty Kurt Angle Larry Nelson England national rugby union team Hale Irwin Hulk Hogan Jimmy Connors Eddie Guerrero Table tennis New York Giants The Golf Channel Mercedes Championships Florida State University Shawn Michaels Kim Clijsters
