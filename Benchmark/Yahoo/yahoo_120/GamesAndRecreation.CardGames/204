help me with my yu gi oh deck i'm going back to playing yu gi oh and i've never been good at making a good deck i've made one just now but i'm not sure if its good or not look over it and tell me what you think be completely honest tell me what cards i should get what should i remove etc monsters newdoria spirit reaper elemental hero wildheart gear golem the moving fortress mad dog of darkness golem sentry poison mummy mask of darkness blindly loyal goblin kelbek regenerating mummy penguin soldier ancient gear golem summoned skull vampire lord spells last will premature burial axe of despair enemy controller tribute to the doomed gravekeeper's servant poison of the old man magical mallet wave motion cannon swords of revealing light scapegoat mystical space typhoon nobleman of crossout pot of avarice heavy storm traps a hero emerges waboku magic jammer trap hole shadow spell seven tools of the bandit call of the haunted sakuretsu armor remember to tell me what you think of my deck as well as what to put in and or take out remember to tell me what you think of my deck as well as what to put in and or take out and also i'm using the forbidden list to make my deck so i won't be using any forbidden cards in this deck i also want to stay in the card minimum one more thing i forgot that last will was forbidden my bad you are making a mistake that most people make when they put together a deck you don't have a really good strategy it looks like you are trying for a defensive zombie deck that just doesn't work too well the zombie monsters started out with usually little to no defense and even though they have been gaining more defense as time goes on there still isn't a huge amount of defensive zombies you also seem to have several earth monsters what i'm saying is that you don't have an overall goal to make you win as you know the object of the game is to win by making your opponents life points to go to zero or using exodia ect so you should ask yourself what is the best way to go about doing it you can sit back and let them come at you and destroy them with traps flip effects ect but would you be able to hold them long enough to put your master plan in motion assuming you have a master plan without one sitting back on defense would be suicide or you could go on the offensive and try to kill them with your monsters but can you kill their monsters and still be able to get past their traps you have to choose which one you do and you have to build a deck around that strategy lets say you go on the offensive as i think that's the best idea what cards go together best you need to make sure that your cards don't hurt the overall strategy like having a cyber jar in an exodia deck they need to all flow together smoothly helping each other what if you had your shadow spell holding an opponents strongest monster then you used your heavy storm it would release their monster and possibly make you lose that is the main thing to watch out for inconsistencies between the cards once you get all those eliminated you will be able to start carefully adding better cards and making your overall strategy better but be carefull don't add too many cards i make it a rule to never go above fifty cards in a deck i hope that i've helped you Waking the Dragons Poker jargon RuneScape quests Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
