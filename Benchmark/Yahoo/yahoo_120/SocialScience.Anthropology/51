what would happen if we discovered a homo sapiens fossil that was million years old first off we'd have to verify the dates scientists aren't perfect so if anyone got a date that old the first assumption would be that something got messed up along the way if you did the tests again and got them verified there'd probably be a lot of arguing it happened with meadowcroft a site in pennsylvania that pushed back the earliest human settlement dates in the us the archaeologist who dug up that was super careful and took a lot more samples than necessary because the dates he got were too old for then current theories even now there are those who will continue to argue that his dates are wrong however due to the care with which samples were pulled and due to other sites that also have early dates most scientists accept that meadowcroft was settled a thousand or two years earlier than previously thought possible so then the next step would be to get some more samples one million year old h sapiens skeleton is startling but you're still going to get people arguing with you because you can't take human error out completely two or three skeletons or fragments of skeletons and you've really got something and somewhere starting around you publishing your million year old skeleton people are going to start having to rethink human evolution theory this is probably not going to destroy evolution theory as a whole the flu bug still changes every year and the descent for other animals hasn't changed but we'd have to completely revamp how we think about the ways in which humans evolved and the rapidity with which we did so it'd be interesting and give lots of grad students plenty of things to write papers on Human Homo floresiensis Neanderthal Evolution Human evolution Age of the Earth Archaeology Cradle of Humanity Race Creation science Neolithic Europe Human migration Dinosaur Fermi paradox Homo erectus Creation-evolution controversy Olduwan Scientific method Creationism Anthropology Debugging Death Intelligent design End of civilization Species Origin of life Stone Age Prehistoric Britain Biodiversity Human extinction Macroevolution History of evolutionary thought Evolutionism Prehistoric Europe Science Extraterrestrial life Origin of language Allan Wilson Theory of conduct Meaning of life Religion Doomsday argument Darwin from Orchids to Variation Extreme Programming Marvel Universe Supernatural Exploration of Mars Spanish flu Young Earth creationism Atomism Karl Popper RuneScape quests Teleological argument Sociocultural evolution Multiregional hypothesis Tetrapod Mathematics Human skin color Culture Single-origin hypothesis Hominidae Civilization Milford H.
