why won't the evolutionist recognized the creation as god handed work the old theory was that the first and oldest species in our family tree homo habilis evolved into homo erectus which then became us homo sapiens but those two earlier species lived side by side about million years ago in parts of kenya for at least half a million years leakey and colleagues report in a paper published in thursday s issue of the journal nature well its not new we should have expect that but did not get clear evidences it was the case actually even dinosaurs evolved side by side for millions of years before being overun by the largest dino actually its not really individuals that are evolving but whole population group so it is quite normal that overlapse between different species happens in the case of habilis and erectus it happens that they were sharing a common ancestor a third unidentified specie that would have give birth to habilis in first place and erectus in second place which is kinds of odd as we are still looking for this one evolution still have a lot of secrets to uncover and science don t claim to know it all but in so far it answers many things and its much better than thinking magic as it doesn t make intelligent peoples to think that everything happen because a superior being has decided it it would be like admiting that our race don t need to think as somebody higher will do in our places this is kind of silly for me Human evolution Homo habilis Human Species Origin of language Stone Age Extinction Neanderthal Evolution Paranthropus Single-origin hypothesis Homo (genus) Dinosaur Mary Leakey Multiregional hypothesis The Origin of Species Creation science Intelligent design Ape Created kind The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Milford H.
