a question about cro magnon and hunter gatherer tribes if cro magnon became the modern man because of the transition from hunter gatherer to farmer then why arent the tribes that stayed hunter gatherers still cro magnon or something similar dukefenton well they were bigger alot stronger and there heads were bigger and a different shape cro magnon is just a name that was applied to one group of european homo sapiens but they are homo sapiens none the less and there is absolutely no physical distinction between hunter gathering homo sapiens to pastoral or agricultural homo sapiens that is why when comparing modern hunter gatherers to modern pastoral or agricultural societies that there is absolutely no significant difference either cro magnon homo sapiens were no bulkier or stronger then homo sapiens are today but this suggestion that they were somehow different which they were not seems to have guided your second answerer astray into somehow concluding that their was some kind of physical advantage to being a cro magnon it seems to me however that he is confusing cro magnon with homo neanderthalensis which cro magnon definitely was not neanderthal was a completely separate hunter gathering species which was competing with the cro magnon european homo sapiens and this competition resulted in these bulkier stronger neanderthals eventually becoming extinct as to why neanderthal was out competed is a completely different topic anyways prehistoric hunter gatherers were homo sapiens and modern hunter gatherers are also homo sapiens some homo sapiens became pastoralists and agriculturalists but they are all still the same homo sapiens Neanderthal Human Homo (genus) Prehistoric Britain Homo erectus Homo floresiensis Species Hunter-gatherer Stone Age Hominidae Homo heidelbergensis Race Cro-Magnon man Neolithic Europe Human migration Extinction Single-origin hypothesis Scientific classification Olduwan Mutant (fictional) Nephilim Bigfoot Indo-Aryan migration Multiregional hypothesis Origin of language Prehistoric Spain Human extinction Homo habilis Homophobia Anthropology South Africa Carolus Linnaeus Gender The Neanderthal Parallax Created kind Gender-neutral language Ape Cradle of Humanity Linnaean taxonomy History of Africa Mixed martial arts Subspecies Guns, Germs, and Steel Primate Fermi paradox Neolithic Revolution Free trade Anthroposophy Tetrapod Working animal Autism Human sexual behavior Pre-historic art Nietzschean History of the World Sexual selection Australopithecine Homo economicus Johann Friedrich Blumenbach Physics Orc Race (historical definitions) History of South Africa Archaeology Sexual dimorphism Croatia Known Space Heterosexuality Homosexuality and transgender Indigenous peoples Robert A.
