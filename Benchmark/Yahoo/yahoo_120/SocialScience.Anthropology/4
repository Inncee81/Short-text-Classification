which historical civilisation do you think would have been the best influence in human societal development we undoubtedly have advanced technologically but that was always a given to happen in my view it's open to question whether we have developed in any area as quickly and efficiently as would have been possible if western nations hadn't been so influenced by feudal roman christian dominance even today most western govts pay mere lip service to true democracy there were several ancient civilisations that i would say were more progressive than our current model many developed early versions of complex technology too who knows what they'd have achieved by now sadly i must debug and reformat my pc won't be around much over the next couple of days looking forward to reading any replies tho heh think we may share similar values bill progressive societies to me are egalatarian promoting fairness availabitity of real opportunities for all knowledge seeking don't live unsustainable lifestyles at the expense of the pain and suffering of others don't tolerate preemptive wars i could go on any society is only as good as the treatment of it's poorest inhabitant shows yes the indus civilisation is one i value very highly too must stop being distracted and sort out my pc many excellent answers on this post the answers from the bill monarch butterfly pataodelamuerte and civis romanus really stood out to me love the sn monarch butterfly and excellent choice of civilisations our main knowledge of the indus is from archaeological evidence but it is considerable enough to be considered pretty accurate i'll check out which informative links i have are generally accessible and post them in the near future the celts were not a particularly bloodthirsty people and were highly progressive i like them very much you might want to check out a couple of my previous posts the sumerians fascinate me too pataodelamuerte they certainly do seem to have had defensive fortifications but unlikely they were a militaristic people great answer your answer shows a lovely way of thinking civus romanus but so many of those achievements were made at the expense of pain and suffering in so many most seem unaware that greek civilisation was heavily influenced by the far more progressive and egalitarian minoan palace civilisation democracy love of art and culture etc is likely to have it's roots in minoan ideas and spread into mainland greece via the mycenaeans the ancient indus civilisation of around bc an advanced urban culture with town planning local government public baths hygiene and sanitation systems sewage wells courtyards laid out towns but unlike its contemporary cultures of mesopotamia and ancient egypt there is no evidence of large monumental structures no evidence of kings armies or priests these indus civilisation cities were notable for their apparent egalitarianism the people seem to have lived together in harmony with one another to a far greater extent than their neighbours so how do you measure progressive Sociocultural evolution Minoan civilization Ancient Greece Celt Conservatism History of the World Art in Ancient Greece Western world Capitalism Ancient warfare Ancient Egypt Byzantine Empire Democracy Liberalism Anthroposophy Indo-Aryan migration History of technology State History of India Human Architectural history Archaeology Education Architecture Public policy History of Europe Maya civilization Meaning of life China Technology Coercion Republicanism Sacrifice John Wycliffe History of medicine Brave New World Prehistoric Europe History of British society Europe Primitive accumulation of capital Culture Afrocentrism Taoism Microeconomics Bosniaks Persian Empire Karl Popper Religion Military history of the Roman Empire History of the Levant Writing Philosophy Greek language Indigenous peoples Sassanid dynasty Goodness and value theory Academia Republic Roman law Prehistoric Britain Numerology Rudolf Steiner Economy of India Wealth British monarchy Jacobo Arenas Objectivist philosophy Pharisees City Mycenae Social justice World government American Conservatism Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Black (people) Head of state Medicine History of Athens Chariot Separation of church and state Opus Dei Libertarian socialism Roman Empire Stone Age Law of value Young Earth creationism The Culture Left-wing politics
