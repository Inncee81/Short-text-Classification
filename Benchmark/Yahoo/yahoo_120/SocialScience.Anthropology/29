when did the first people settle in what is now the united states i am just curious as to how long people have been here and when the first people lived in what is now north america i realize that there have been native americans for a long time but are there any records of cro magnon men in the united states canada area what about south america first of all cro magnon is a site name that resulted in some european homo sapiens being called cro magnon cro magnon however is just another name for homo sapiens aka modern man aka humans seeing as cro magnon specifically were european homo sapiens however they really have nothing to do with migration to north america until more recent times vikings at approximately ad and then european colonialism ad previous to this european colonialism the major migration to north america occurred from north central asia during the last major ice age when the bearing straight became a land bridge this ice age period was between years ago and it was this migration that eventually radiated to fill the americas to become the dominant genealogical expression of the native american tribes some argue purely because of ethnocentrism that the clovis technology that was the major stone tool technology in the americas came from europe and show it s similarity to a french stone culture that dates back to around years ago these same scientists if i can call them that search the eastern seaboard with great zeal looking for signs of clovis technology to prove their non point the reason why i call this a non point is because the empirical evidence that is available that being the y dna mt dna evidence clearly demonstrates that the year ago migration did come form north central asia here are some links that clearly show the spread of y dna and the resulting pre colonial y dna frequencies in the americas http jewsandjoes com images ftdna migration map jpg http notavalidname files wordpress com w map gif if the migration of the clovis technology from west europe were true then the american y dna mt dna haplogroups should show at least a little of the western european haplogroup s influence yet none of the western european s predominantly r b haplogroup is represented anywhere in the pre colonial american natives the year ago migration however was not the first there have been a few archaeological sites that predate the year ago beginning of the major migration from asia or else are differential enough that have offered some clues as to there being multiple migrations into the americas one such site was that of kennewick man who s facial reconstruction offered a look at a man who looked distinctively caucasian http files blog city com files a p f kennewick man jpg http www pbs org wgbh nova first images kennewick jpg thus this initially fueled the fire of early european migration supporters the best hypothesis so far is that kennewick man is actually a relative of the ainu people of northern japan who are an ethnic group with caucasian like features much like those of kennewick many sites that have fueled these debates plus the questionable origins of clovis technology are shown on this map http www laputanlogic com images y r j jpg the evidence is not enough to predict whether all of these pre migrations and their ancestors like kennewick man are all bearing straight migrations or if some of the south american sites could even have been migrations from the south pacific oceania what is clear from the genealogical evidence however is that as the major migration of years ago spread across the americas is that they did a wholesale replacement of the previous migratory populations because the y dna and mt dna is quite purely that of this migration and not similar to either that of the ainu nor any other south pacific or asian groups that may have been a part of these earlier migrations the original dates of these earlier migrations coming to the americas is not fully know but it is suggested to be somewhere in the vicinity of years ago although sometimes you can see some obscure figures in the years thrown into the discussion i personally do not find the year ago range credible because that type of time frame would not be consistent with the spread of archaeological evidence radiating through asia and down into oceania Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact Human
