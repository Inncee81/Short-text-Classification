whats so special about naruto i give up theres 's of questions about this show daily the one episode i saw i couldn't really get into because i hate anime i watched it for minutes and got sick is it violent funny you only watched five minutes of one episode you need to give it more time than that the storyline moves extremely slow in the series which is one major drawback but if you watch enough episodes you'll like it especially after seeing some of the fights in that show the fights are awesome and intelligently done even though most of them go at a slow pace they once spent like six or seven episodes in that series just fighting one bad guy and most of the time was taken up by each of the characters having flashbacks about their childhood so you should probably only watch it if you have nothing better to do Beavis and Butt-head Jumping the shark Clip show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Family Guy Teen Girl Squad Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Teen Titans (animated series) Fictional crossover Star Trek Undergrads The Fairly OddParents Meta-reference Bob and George Negima The Young Ones (TV series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Mike Alfonso The Simpsons Whose Line Is It Anyway?
