heat exhaustion i'm going to be a freshman and today was the first day of volleyball tryouts when i got there i felt fine and ready to work but as the tryouts progressed i started to feel sicker and sicker about minutes into the tryouts i started to have a little trouble breathing but that was just because i was working my body harder than i usually do and then i started to feel tired and a little dizzy lightheaded i think there the same thing eventually i started feeling like i was going to throw up and so i asked to go to the bathroom and i almost threw up but i didn't so i went to the bathroom and sat on the floor for a few minutes and i started to feel better i went to the bathroom because i didn't want to make a big deal out of it and ruin my chances i started feeling bad again so i asked my coach if i could sit and he asked if i felt dizzy lightheaded and i said no because again i didn't want to make a big deal out of it but i did say that my stomach sort of hurt and he said to just stand because that would be better than standing he also said to drink water but the water made me feel sick because it was warm i also forgot my water bottle and i was really thirsty so maybe i was dehydrated what do you think was wrong it was also hot and i was sweating alot i also have a sunburn but i don't know if that had anything to do with it except for the fact that it may have made me hotter warmer same thing this actually happened last night and i was just wondering so that the same thing doesn't happen at the nd day of practice tonight i've suffered heat exhaustion twice and it sounds like you might have had the early symptoms as long as you can sweat it isn't heat stroke my doctor told me that since i had it twice i will be more likely to suffer it again and that turned out to be true just remember what the symptoms felt like and if you ever feel like that again remove yourself from that environment drink water and cool off you are young so take care of yourself and you should be fine from now on it could happen to anyone before any physical activity hydrate yourself as much as possible and keep water nearby Hyperthermia The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Avenue Q Sauna Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Dialysis Chronic fatigue syndrome Sandy Koufax Water First aid Traumatic brain injury Panic attack Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Stomach cancer One Tree Hill (TV series) Aerial (dance move) Marilyn Monroe 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Humphrey Bogart Thermoregulation Jam (TV series) Blood on the Tracks Fecal incontinence Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jackass: The Movie Ex-gay Pitaten Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Sin City Breastfeeding God Emperor of Dune Satchel Paige AFI 100 Years series Diving Survival skills Hypothermia The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Stroke Ebola Balance disorder Friends Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cancer Poker jargon Futurama (TV series - season 2) Drowning YuYu Hakusho The Contender (television series) Conspiracy (TNG episode) Babe Ruth K' Ben Johnson (athlete) Prostate cancer Bong Caving Good Morning, Vietnam Coffee Decompression sickness Anxiety Charles Darwin's illness 2000 Australian Grand Prix Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders The Catcher in the Rye Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Douglas Adams Hiberno-English Kitchen Kodocha Cigarette Smoking Man Dundas Square Paul Is Dead Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Symbiosis (TNG episode) Solar power The Ashlee Simpson Show Cardiac arrhythmia Fiddler on the Roof Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Syphon Filter Sento Extreme Programming
