why won't my heel pain go away on my right foot only i have a very bad heel pain just on the bottom of my heel it is worse in the mornings when i wake up depending on the shoes i wear the pain comes and goes sometimes it is sharp other times just a dull throbbing type pain the pain has been present now for over a month without any signs of real healing i realize my best bet is to go to the doctor but without insurance that is very unlikely i simply can't afford a doctor visit right now i'm hoping someone can help me out a little thanks in advance sounds like plantar fasciitis most people with plantar fasciitis have pain when they take their first steps after they get out of bed or sit for a long time you may have less stiffness and pain after you take a few steps but your foot may hurt more as the day goes on it may hurt the most when you climb stairs or after you stand for a long period if you have foot pain at night you may have a different problem such as tarsal tunnel syndrome how is plantar fasciitis diagnosed your doctor will check your feet and watch you stand and walk he or she will also ask questions about your past health including what illnesses or injuries you have had your symptoms such as where the pain is and what time of day your foot hurts most how active you are and what types of physical activity you do your doctor may take an x ray of your foot if he or she suspects a problem with the bones of your foot such as a stress fracture how is it treated no single treatment works best for everyone with plantar fasciitis but there are many things you can try to help your foot get better give your feet a rest cut back on activities that make your foot hurt try not to walk or run on hard surfaces to reduce pain and swelling try putting ice on your heel or take an over the counter pain reliever like ibuprofen such as advil or motrin naproxen such as aleve or aspirin do calf stretches and towel stretches several times a day especially when you first get up in the morning get a new pair of shoes pick shoes with good arch support and a cushioned sole or try heel cups or shoe inserts orthotics use them in both shoes even if only one foot hurts if these treatments do not help your doctor may give you splints that you wear at night shots of steroid medicine in your heel or other treatments you probably will not need surgery doctors only suggest it for people who still have pain after trying other treatments for to months how long will it take for the pain to go away plantar fasciitis most often occurs because of injuries that have happened over time with treatment you will have less pain within a few weeks but it may take time for the pain to go away completely from a few months to a year stick with your treatment if you don't you may have constant pain when you stand or walk the sooner you start treatment the sooner your feet will stop hurting Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Traumatic brain injury Osteoarthritis Iliotibial band syndrome High-heeled shoe Medicine Hip fracture Group A streptococcal infection Urinary incontinence Childbirth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Cancer 1957 World Series Callus Massage Acupuncture Decompression sickness Shoe Traditional Chinese medicine Asthma Pain Pneumonia Fecal incontinence Migraine Alternative medicine Stress fracture Sleep apnea First aid Milton H.
