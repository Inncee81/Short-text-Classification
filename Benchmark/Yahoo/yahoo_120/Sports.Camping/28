what are some ways to stay cool while camping in the summer my kids insist on camping this summe before school starts back the only problem is that it is degrees go to a river you can't beat a cool flowing river for staying cool you could rent an rv with ac and go to a place with electric hookups but you ought to be doing stuff with your kids even when you are not in the water many river valleys are ten to twenty degrees cooler than the rest of the countryside your kids will enjoy the water a lot as well and you will not have trouble entertaining them or getting them to sleep at night the rv might not be a bad idea anyway if you are not skilled with open fire meals and you do not have a camp stove it also eliminates the need to go buy about other things you have to have for camping and will not know you needed till after dark the first night some of the things you might forget that are important for camping sun block bug spray toilet paper for tent camping extra blankets they can realy make for a better nights sleep and i have had a sleeping bag taken in the river before lighting i recommend a couple flashlights for trips to the potty or exploration and two train lanterns that will burn all night on one tank of oil don t forget the oil and batteries plenty of ice and plenty of water put all the blankets on top of your coolers during the day pack meat in a separate cooler from drinks and snacks if you can or in a plastic container buried under everything else freeze everything you can before you pack ecept your first meal plan a uncooked meal at lunch time and start fires half an hour or more before you plan to cook a large laundry soap jug is best for keeping hand wash water on the outskirts of camp one with a spigot works the absolute best just refill with river water lawn chairs and fun noodles are a good idea you do not need a chair for everyone but at least one per adult and one more is a good idea fun noodles are cheap and they do not leak like blow up water toys last but not least time out at the river is ten thousand times better than time out any place else Cruising (maritime) Kitchen Textile manufacturing Autonomous building Solar power Portable stove Dairy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cha chaan teng Thermal power station Coffee Emergency preparedness Ice cream Japanese tea ceremony Breakfast Ramen Water Community emergency response team Korean cuisine Social rule Genericized trademark Plastic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Customs and etiquette of Japan Cuisine of Denmark Fire fighting Mercury Atlas 6 Avenue Q Carburetor Japanese toilet Milk Tea John McDouall Stuart Daylight saving time Bong International response to Hurricane Katrina Carbon dioxide Ocean's Twelve Blood (computer game) The Suffering (game) Knots Landing 2003 North America blackout Fecal incontinence Fire extinguisher Siphon Hamster Hydrogen economy Futurama (TV series - season 2) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Poker jargon 613 mitzvot In-N-Out Burger The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fuel cell Philmont Scout Ranch Sewage treatment Sento Dundas Square Mattress EastEnders Camp Lazlo Hiking The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items P-47 Thunderbolt The Fairly OddParents E85 The Contender (television series) Death Valley National Park The Amber Spyglass Fishing RuneScape quests Pitaten Meat Loaf Tank The Life and Times of Juniper Lee German cuisine Blankets (graphic novel) USS Tunny (SS-282) Urban beach Fossil fuel power plant Urinary incontinence Renewable energy Climate of the United Kingdom Insomnia Meal Sauna 2005 Iditarod Hamburger Bicycle lighting Shawn Michaels Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve
