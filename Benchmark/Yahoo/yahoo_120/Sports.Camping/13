how do you start a fire by rubbing two sticks together is their certain materials that i may need to start the fire without matches or a lighter only sticks and tinder making a fire with a stick is as much art as science and a dash of luck there are types of wood traditionally used for making fire with a stick i'm only remember one of them however and that wood is willow these woods are soft and that is important what you do is to make a sort of bowl in a bit of wood pressing the stick into the bowl you rub the stick against the part on the gound to create a little dust collect that dust and then start rubbing the sticks in the back and forth also known as a drill until the friction ignites some of the new dust you have created put that spark onto the dust you created first and slowly blow on the spark to get it to grow into a flame reality check unless you are going to practice a lot a lot this is not a functional way of making fire if you are going to impress someone they will be more impressed if you actually have a fire so have a back up the flint and steel mentioned previously has the same drawbacks you need the partially burned cloth to catch the spark or else you are wasting your time the use of a magnifying glass is also very difficult to do and it is easier to use a plant that has a wood exterior and soft interior that easily breaks with little pressure the use of the bottom of a coke can is more effective for fire making than the magnifying glass and you will need to use chocolate or butter as a polishing compound before attempting to start the fire it is an excellant parabolic reflector and you need only get the distance right to get a good heating to combustion hope this helps i prefer willie pete hydrogen peroxide and other things to rubbing two sticks together Campfire Internal ballistics Explosive material Survival skills Fire Drill bit Casting Bong Pottery Spark plug Thermal power station Internal combustion engine Plastic Textile manufacturing Knife Diesel engine Naval mine Glass Hand grenade Fire extinguisher Coal Nuclear weapon design Welding Brewery Fire fighting Firearm Barbecue Coffee Wood Amateur telescope making Titanium Motor oil Mattress Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Alkane Tank Solar power Organic peroxide Incandescent light bulb Equine conformation Hydrogen peroxide Strap-on dildo Lathe Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Table saw Hydrogen Microeconomics Cartridge (firearms) Energy development Petroleum Oxyacetylene Spontaneous human combustion Rocket fuel Robot Master Volcano Weapon Hydrogen economy Ammonia Firework Magnesium Cocaine Stage lighting Hindenburg disaster Violin Tinder Two-stroke cycle Nuclear explosion Wood fuel Cleveland Browns RuneScape skills Carbon dioxide Alcohol fuel Fusion power Cannabis (drug) Bullet Seismic retrofit Plaster Glossary of wildland fire terms Furnace Haloalkane Carburetor Ammonium nitrate Jet engine Passenger car Timpani Billiards Upholstery Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Steam engine Bicycle brake systems Shoe
