i am uncircumsized and my foreskin is sow tight that it would not retract can i remove it manually i am yrs old and i am a virgin and i was wondering if theres any way i could retract the foreskin manually or will having sexual relationships help it retract some may say that circumcision will fix it but circumcision's risks include reduction in sensitivity and pleasure and making masturbation more difficult according to studies including a few new ones from a few months ago oddly enough that's how it was promoted in the usa since masturbation was bad haha there's a reason why the usa is the last remaining advanced nation still doing it and even so it's getting a lot less popular it's now as low as in some states save that as a last resort as you're doing that's only one of the few risks there's more listed here in addition to the studies and statistics http forums govteen com showpost php p postcount i was the same when i was younger and now it slides fine with no problems whatsoever just pull back your foreskin when you shower the most you can without forcing it and rub the head that should encourage it to separate from the head this is probably all you have to do since this is common especially with teens you just haven't 'used' it enough as in masturbation and washing it the same goes for sensitivity the more your rub it the less sensitive it'll get start using water when you shower then rub a little more each day and if its rather tight you can get a cream that works in almost of cases it's betamethasone or betamethasone dipropionate and unlike circumcision it is very cheap in the usa painless and you don't risk decreasing sensitivity pleasure and making masturbation more difficult here's the study that you can even print and give to the doctor http www scielo br scielo php pid s script sci arttext tlng en http www drugstore com pharmacy prices drugprice asp ndc trx z try that cream it works doctors often just mention circumcision since its a surgery that brings a lot of money to them especially in the usa if you have questions e mail me from my profile since i've gone through this i'll be happy to answer any questions Foreskin Medical analysis of circumcision Circumcision PHP Penis Female genital cutting History of male circumcision Breastfeeding Foreskin restoration Circumcision advocacy Human sexual behavior Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Prostate cancer Human sexuality Strap-on dildo Acne Brit milah Plastic surgery Penile cancer Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infant baptism Psoriasis Condom Digital photography Safe sex Colorectal cancer Cross site scripting Ajax (programming) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Theory of conduct Floppy disk Sento Coffee Deflation (economics) Abortion Radiation therapy Orgasm Surveillance Hyperinflation Gmail Sexual arousal Smegma Brewery Monetary policy Apache HTTP Server Domain Name System Mesothelioma Slashdot trolling phenomena Sexual abstinence Cervical cancer Dairy Sex education Web server Social rule Erection Childbirth Charles Darwin's illness Tattoo The Sims 2 Cat Gay slang Anal sex GameFAQs Menstrual cup Domestic violence The Apprentice 2 Babe Ruth World Wide Web Atkins Nutritional Approach Gender identity Androgen insensitivity syndrome Glans penis Child sexual abuse Sharia Mutual masturbation Frenulum Plame affair Wget Nocturnal emission Anal masturbation Solar variation HTML Pubic hair AIDS in Africa
