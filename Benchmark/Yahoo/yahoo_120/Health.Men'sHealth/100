my husband is having a really hard time he has to shave everyday for his job but he is getting really bad bumps that eventually bleed when he has to shave the next day we have tried bikini zone a girls razor etc any suggestions i have very sensitive skin and used to get razor bumps and ingrown hairs from shaving it was embarassing quite frankly i went to a barber shop and had them teach me how to do the perfect shave so here you go first of all you always shave after you shower in the shower you should wash your face thoroughly with an actual face soap such as that made by neutrogena it will soften your beard and won't dry out your skin then follow these steps apply a hot wash cloth to your face and keep it there for at least seconds this opens the pores and softens the beard even further do not dry the face afterward apply a pre shave oil just a few drops will coat the entire beard area apply a thin layer of shave cream preferably a gel meant for sensitive skin using a clean razor with sharp blades shave with the grain for most men this means downward strokes on the cheeks and around the mouth and upward strokes for the throat area rinse the face with very cold water this will remove all remaining oil and shave cream while sealing the pores back up apply a non alcohol based moisturizer alcohol based aftershaves dry out the skin shaving is pretty traumatic for skin so you need moisture at this time so it can heal use moisturizer as needed throughout the day your husband might complain about the act of applying moisturizer but he'll thank you in years when his friends look like old men and he doesn't if this doesn't significantly help your husband's situation you might consider visiting a facial specialist at a spa for more advice but i think you'll notice a difference in just a short while good luck Razor Sento Beard Pubic hair Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Barber Psoriasis Depilation Knife Global Gillette Fecal incontinence Skin Soap Eczema Tofu Tattoo Hair Shampoo Hard water Wound Acne Wood Coffee Upholstery Pseudofolliculitis barbae Gay bathhouse Cleanser Leather Glycerin Haircut Baldness Aloe 613 mitzvot Body piercing Violin Moisturizer Leaf Strap-on dildo Urinary incontinence Volleyball Hyperthermia Leg shaving Drowning Puberty Kurt Angle Social rule Textile manufacturing Physical attractiveness Equine conformation Urticaria Breastfeeding Corrosion Woodworking Massage Menstrual cup Hair conditioner Genericized trademark Fluoride therapy Tanning Car washing techniques Moustache Three Stooges Swimming Dry cleaning Internal ballistics Comanche Table tennis Waxing Mummy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Britain Dishwasher Head shaving Casting Embalming Professional wrestling slang Sauna Kodocha Malignant melanoma Wok Paint Poker jargon Dairy Steam engine Mattress Face Hypothermia Brewery Hangul Scabies Professional wrestling throws Hard disk Wolfrider Water
