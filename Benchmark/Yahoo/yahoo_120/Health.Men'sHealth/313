zit like thing on shaft i just realized a zit like thing on the my penis im not sure what it is but i know i havent been exposed to sex or any std so i really doubt thats what it is anyone got any ideas it's probably just an ingrown hair follicle if it's on the shaft put a warm compress on it or soak in a warm tub to open up the pores and then see if you can pluck it out with tweezers once it gets a white head on it be careful though if you dig around or pick at it you can make it more infected also try washing just that area with salcylic acid facial wash i wouldn't wash the whole penis because it could dry out the skin but it might help the ingrown hair Acne Textile manufacturing Skin Oral sex Boil Penis Strap-on dildo Puberty Pubic hair Pseudofolliculitis barbae Condom Medical analysis of circumcision Genital wart Body piercing Psoriasis Tattoo Herpes simplex virus Gay slang Safe sex Leather Penis enlargement White phosphorus incendiary Wound Tanning Shaving Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Anal sex Dandruff Intersex surgery First aid Sexual differentiation Pilonidal cyst Sex toy Transmission (medicine) Manicure The Inside Polar Bear Glans penis Tofu Jock itch Sauna Baldness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Rice Bleeding Dildo Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Conjunctivitis Toilet humour Secondary sex characteristic Wood Collecting fossils Dairy Cleanser Grigori Rasputin Shampoo Escherichia coli O157:H7 Vulva Jute Mange Sexual intercourse Wudu Customs and etiquette of Japan Erogenous zone Aloe Smegma Masturbation Pneumonia Dishwashing Azelaic acid Hypospadias Head Hidradenitis suppurativa 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Jackass: The Movie Crab louse Diving suit Hypertrichosis Hair color Gay bathhouse Pornographic movie Testosterone Razor Marilyn Monroe Penis envy Balanitis Cannabis cultivation Nail disease Laundry Gelatin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Circumcision HIV test Gender role Gliding action Amber The Dalek Invasion of Earth
