how do i cure phimosis without surgery i have heard of stretching i have also heard of using topical steroids with stretching but my urologist won't prescribe me any and insists i get a full circumcision or partial one i have also recently purchased a glansie and was wondering if any men our there have used it with success some may say that circumcision will fix it but circumcision's risks include reduction in sensitivity and pleasure and making masturbation more difficult according to studies including a few new ones from a few months ago oddly enough that's how it was promoted in the usa since masturbation was bad haha there's a reason why the usa is the last remaining advanced nation still doing it and even so it's getting a lot less popular it's now as low as in some states save that as a last resort as you're doing that's only one of the few risks there's more listed here in addition to the studies and statistics http forums govteen com showpost php p postcount i was the same when i was younger and now it slides fine with no problems whatsoever just pull back your foreskin when you shower the most you can without forcing it and rub the head that should encourage it to separate from the head this is probably all you have to do since this is common especially with teens you just haven't 'used' it enough as in masturbation and washing it the same goes for sensitivity the more your rub it the less sensitive it'll get start using water when you shower then rub a little more each day and if its rather tight you can get a cream that works in almost of cases it's betamethasone or betamethasone dipropionate and unlike circumcision it is very cheap in the usa painless and you don't risk decreasing sensitivity pleasure and making masturbation more difficult here's the study that you can even print and give to the doctor http www scielo br scielo php pid s script sci arttext tlng en http www drugstore com pharmacy prices drugprice asp ndc trx z try that cream it works doctors often just mention circumcision since its a surgery that brings a lot of money to them especially in the usa if you have questions e mail me from my profile since i've gone through this i'll be happy to answer any questions Phimosis Medical analysis of circumcision Circumcision Foreskin Masturbation PHP Female genital cutting Prostate cancer History of male circumcision Circumcision advocacy Penis Breastfeeding Psoriasis Foreskin restoration Acne Fecal incontinence Strap-on dildo Child sexuality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Radiation therapy Balanitis xerotica obliterans Brit milah Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Androgen insensitivity syndrome Deflation (economics) Ajax (programming) Sento Orgasm Colorectal cancer Penile cancer Gender identity Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infant baptism Lung cancer Growth hormone treatment Equine conformation Cross site scripting I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue GameFAQs Digital photography Social rule Chronic fatigue syndrome Jam (TV series) Ulcerative colitis Multiple sclerosis Cryptorchidism Gonorrhoea Surveillance Obesity Crohn's disease The Apprentice 2 Charles Darwin's illness History of intersex surgery Monetary policy Dairy Plame affair Tocopherol Babe Ruth Apache HTTP Server Slashdot trolling phenomena Hypospadias Kyle Broflovski Atkins Nutritional Approach Coffee Web server Goodness and value theory Safe sex Homosexuality and Islam Mesothelioma Folic acid The Ashlee Simpson Show Divorce Eczema Abortion Inflation Ozone depletion Chinese University of Hong Kong Sudoku Smegma Arbitrage Economics The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
