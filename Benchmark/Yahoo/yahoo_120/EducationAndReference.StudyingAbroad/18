is it possible for me to obtain a scholarship to study art overseas by just showing using my artworks i'm years old and am currently studying in one of the top public universities in malaysia i am doing a course that doesn't really suit me well my course has nothing to do with art i've always loved art and i have passion for it i can say that i'm pretty good at drawing and painting plus i have deep interest in art history i know i shouldn't have entered this university in the first place but i got offered and i pitied still do my parents if they were to follow what i wanted which is sending me to a private college just to study art plus the fees would be too high so i didn't want to burden them a year has passed by and i am not doing so well in my studies i am currently repeating papers and i always feel dumb inside class i also have little time to draw and paint nowadays and i hate it i want to quit studying there but i can already imagine the look on my parents' faces they won't approve it back to my question is it possible cos i do hv sum nice artworks i do not have any suggested sites to tell you but i think we have the same interest in arts i enjoy photography and i would want to take a short course in photography abroad and looking for a possible scholarship i just want to tell you that you should never lose hope keep on trying to search for websites or anything that would be helpful for you i believe there are scholarships out there but you still need to pay for some fees plus you need to pay for your plane ticket visa and passport i wish you luck Passport Education in the United States Art Graduate school Photography The Amazing Race Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Poker jargon Mail-order bride Education in Germany Scholarship Singlish Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Aesthetic Realism The Contender (television series) Shaggy dog story Brett Whiteley Education in Malaysia Traditional animation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Independent school (UK) National Junior College University of Central Florida H-1B visa Tuition Georgia O'Keeffe Sharon Tate National Kidney Foundation Singapore Credit card Mid-levels The Fairly OddParents Education in Australia Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus British nationality law Theory of conduct Education in New Zealand Artemisia Gentileschi Henri Cartier-Bresson Denis Law Education in Portugal Plame affair Caulfield Grammar School Tertiary education fees in Australia The Critic Microeconomics Korean art Sampling (music) National Certificate of Educational Achievement Totally Spies!
