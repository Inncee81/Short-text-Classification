how is instant coffee really made how do they do it bascially instant coffee is just regularly brewed coffee with nearly all the water removed it's not that mysterious a process at all there is no strange chemical adulteration that goes on instant coffee is still pure coffee there are two methods for producing instant coffee crystals freeze drying and spray drying the freeze drying method preserved the most 'coffee flavour' but it's a more involved procedure first the coffee is allowed to sit so the water evaporates naturally leaving a concentrated coffee solution this concentrate is then frozen to around celsius the remaining water freezes into ice crystals sublimation a natural process similar to evaporation is used to remove the ice what's left is dry grains of coffee the second method is spray drying the water is again allowed to evaporate forming a concentrate the concentrated coffee is sprayed from a high tower in a large hot air chamber as the droplets fall the remaining water evaporates dry crystals of coffee fall to the bottom of the chamber the high temperatures involved in this method do tend to effect the oils of the coffee and more flavour is lost Instant coffee Coffee Water (molecule) Carbon dioxide Tofu Brewery Evaporation Food preservation Water Desert Freeze drying Ice cream Lake Tea Explosive material Water vapor Fog Casting Sugar beet Weathering Micro-encapsulation Fire fighting Acetic acid Cloud Phase (matter) Thermal power station Solvent Decaffeination Cryonics Chocolate Caffeine Steam engine Air conditioning Cider Gilding Soy protein Dishwasher Flue gas desulfurization Sugarcane Dry cleaning Rice Solar power Vacuum Titanium Hydrogen Ice Hydrogen peroxide Opportunity rover Honey Swamp cooler White phosphorus incendiary Beer Hydrogen sulfide Gas metal arc welding Ice core Yerba mate Fire extinguisher Common cold Thermoregulation Isotope separation Water purification Collodion process Powder metallurgy Contrail Brewing Sedimentary rock Renewable energy Smoke-screen Sodium chloride Freeze distillation Methamphetamine Edible salt Sugar Bread Haloalkane Cha chaan teng Energy development Ozone depletion Copper extraction Hard water Tissue engineering Vanilla Diseases of the honeybee Pottery Paint Dairy product Incandescent light bulb Concentration Thunderstorm Alcoholic beverage Cookware and bakeware Ozone hole
