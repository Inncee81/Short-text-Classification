have you ever tried energy drinks such as red bull if so how did you react to them i see many brands of energy drinks i have never tried any of them i was thinking of doing so but i am concerned these drinks will have an adverse effect on me such as making me over stimulated or causing rapid heartbeat i would appreciate your input please and thank you the basis of the majority of energy drinks is caffeine for example a can of red bull is about the same amount of caffeine as two cans of coke you can think of it like alcohol hard liquor is more expensive but it will get you drunker quicker but beer is cheaper and will bring on the buzz a lot slower and make you pee more wikipedia's page on energy drinks is great tons of info i'm linking that in the source so you can check out the info and decide if you'd like to try one yourself i think red bull is an acquired taste i didn't like it the first time i drank it but i had about cans given to me for free and when i had nothing to drink but that or water i wanted some kind of flavor so in forcing myself to drink them i started to enjoy them but then i've done the same with beer x some people just don't like the taste of energy drinks i have always enjoyed trying different types of sodas so i don't notice any flavor or weirdness that is consistent throughout all energy drinks if you like orange soda you would probably enjoy the full throttle fury brand it's in a red can tastes like orange soda full throttle blue demon is in a blue can and it's got a very berry type flavor to it i enjoy both the biggest drawback to energy drinks is their price but if you drink one energy drink to every two or three sodas to get the same effect it's really about the same price a pack of red bull costs about in my neck of the woods you'll never know if you like it till you try it Coffee Soft drink Caffeine Mountain Dew Chocolate Energy drink The Coca-Cola Company Red Bull Coca-Cola OK Soda Diet soda Alcoholic beverage Shasta (soft drink) Tea Beer Wine Miller Brewing Rum Yerba mate Fanta Gatorade Cider New Coke Gin Microeconomics Ramen Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.
