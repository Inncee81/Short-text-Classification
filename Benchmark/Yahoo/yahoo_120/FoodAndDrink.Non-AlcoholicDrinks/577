is it difficult if i wanted to start my own beverage company is it difficult if i wanted to start my own beverage company any other related comments or suggestions it's pretty easy to start a beverage company you can start off small which is pretty difficult for say a steel mill you also have high margins to work with which is not true for say a steel mill you turn your product over pretty quickly which is not true for say a steel mill however if you think you can get shelf space in supermarkets and have an instant hit you're crazy you have to rent the space on supermarket shelves and you have to work hard to get consumers to try your product out fifty years ago most soft drink bottlers had a major brand and a minor brand the pepsi bottler would have another brand say suncrest or nehi that made fruit flavored drinks in the s and s the variety of brands that pepsi and coke offered really blossomed and what happened was that cherry and grape and orange pop in these minor brand was replaced with diet and caffeine free colas fifty years ago most drug stores had a soda fountain as well it's hard to find anyplace that you can get a soda these days i think someone could open up a soda fountain store and do well make your own premium ice cream in the back much like graeter's does very successfully in cincinnati set up a soda fountain that offers lots of fruit flavors the minor pop brands mostly sold out to monarch nugrape and you wouldn't have to develop your own flavors you could buy the syrups from them then you set up a bottling plant and sell pop to your customers by the case as well as by the glass the idea isn't to be the cheapest pop in town but when the convenience store across the street cuts their price on ounce pack of pepsi to for you match their price exactly you don't want to get in any price wars you're not going to sell a million bottles of pop out of that store initially but it gets your name before the community when you open five more fountains around the city you won't need to buy any more ice cream freezers or bottling equipment because the mother store will have enough capacity to handle it once you get the city saturated with your fountains you start approaching all the convenience stores to sell your pop this isn't as great a stretch as you might think here in lancaster pennsylvania the leading convenience store is turkey hill but most of the other convenience stores have big signs out front this week offering turkey hill ice cream at for if they aren't offering deals on th ice cream it's th drinks in gallons convenience stores are not religious mosques they are happy to sell what consumers are eager to buy you can approach the warehouse stores like costco as well they aren't pushovers by any means but they are very open to new manufacturers much more so than supermarkets generally you start off sampling your product if consumers like it and buy it then you may have a permanent place in their stores coast to coast the important thing to remember is that you're out to maximize profit not maximize gallonage and not to maximize the profits of companies selling advertising giving away samples is a good way to get people to try your product maybe it makes sense to buy an ice cream truck and load it full of coolers instead ice cream and drive around neighborhoods slowly with the tune running selling your drink just so you get some free publicity on tv put the truck in every parade in the area and have some kids in distinctive outfits pass out some ice cold drinks to people along the parade route partly as sampling and partly for the wow factor they better be ice cold though warm drinks are going to go over like a thud work out a deal with some popular charity so they man the truck at a street fair selling pop for c or for either very cheap or very high so people notice with signs pointing out that of the money goes to that charity there are good margins in beverages and there is good demand and it's far far easier to do this today in an era when people expect plastic bottles than it was when pop came in cans or in glass bottles will pepsi and coke notice sure will they compete with you sure will they drop their prices below cost in order to kill you off well they didn't do that when jolt snapple vitamin water and other new companies appeared be aware that a successful beverage company is going to be valuable and you will end up investing a lot of money and a lot of effort to make your new company succeed but if you have a good idea and the energy and skills to make a small business succeed it could be a very good investment The Apprentice 2 Bulk vending Diet soda Wine Tesco Illegal drug trade Gatorade Fanta Costco Inca Kola Wal-Mart McDonald's
