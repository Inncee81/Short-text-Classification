sill cock or hose bibb faucet we have an outdoor faucet whose innards need replacing we can't remove it ourselves because it's soldered onto the pipe we are uncertain if this is a sill cock faucet or hosebibb i have found a picture of each and they look identical to me any thoughts thank you by the way the censored word is the male rooster i guess the site is getting extra careful for what its worth the two items serve a similar function the difference is in the angle of the connector for the hose on a hose bib the connection is perpendicular to the supply pipe on a sillcock the connection is cocked usually about degrees off perpendicular to make connecting the hose a bit easier the terms of often incorrectly used interchangeably so you may see either type called by either name in either case this should be repairable by removing the large nut that the valve stem goes through once you take it off the valve stem should come out a good plumbing store will have parts for repair but they are becoming more rare it is usually cheaper to replace than repair Siphon Glossary of firefighting equipment Tap (valve) Hydraulic machinery Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Bong Plumbing fixture Diving regulator Scuba set Seismic retrofit Irrigation Wrench Universal Serial Bus Sento Flush toilet Samovar Home repair Screw Solder Radio controlled car Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Oscilloscope Japanese toilet Violin Plastic Gas metal arc welding Glossary of firefighting terms Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Electrophysiology Cock (chicken) Tire Internal ballistics Rebreather Trombone Thermal power station Ethernet Novelty (locomotive) Toilet paper Strap-on dildo Laptop Anchor Welding Knife D-subminiature Mouse (computing) Password RS-232 Wallpaper group Carburetor Androgen insensitivity syndrome Drill bit Stave church Microphone Two-stroke cycle Combine (Half-Life 2) USB flash drive Vacuum tube Computer Gender Rail terminology Airsoft Trademark Antenna (radio) Electronic amplifier Chopper (motorcycle) Vacuum cleaner Jack plug Portable stove View camera Redundant array of independent disks Fire hydrant William Murdoch Glossary of climbing terms Mosquito Bidet Digital photography Central processing unit Nintendo Entertainment System Polarization Atari ST Profanity Domestic water system Euclidean plane isometry Pipe organ Fire engine Chevrolet Corvair engine Printed circuit board Elevator CPU cache Tai shogi Dodge Neon Air brake (rail) Diacritic Textile manufacturing Radar Orthogonal matrix DVD Taikyoku shogi
