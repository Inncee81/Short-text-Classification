how can i make my roof into a deck we have a single family house with a walk out flat roof there's actually a sliding glass door it has no railing the roof is currently tar covered with some kind of silver patches i'm getting it ready to sell and we're considering changing it into a deck someone suggested i just paint the roof white and attach a white wrought iron railing is this a good idea or is there a better way to do this without spending a lot of money i would recommend having a fiber glass deck installed a professional would have to be hired and proper permits attained a fiberglass deck would be the best solution and provide the best protection of future leaks railing systems can easily be installed over these types of decks if you want something less expensive i would just say put down an ice shield base over the existing roof and then lay a wood deck system over it eventually water problems will develop and the deck will have to be removed for the repair i would hate to recommend this if the house is being sold and a problem is being left for someone else to deal with Roof Seismic retrofit Deck (ship) Mattress Poker jargon Asbestos Naval mine Bay Area Rapid Transit Plastic Skateboard Drill bit Glossary of climbing terms Windows XP Casting Rail terminology Boat building Home repair Elevator Autorack Radio controlled airplane Solar power Wayne Corporation Skateboarding trick Dinghy Jute Welding Nuclear power Door Porsche 993 Tarot Light-frame construction Glossary of nautical terms Yu-Gi-Oh!
