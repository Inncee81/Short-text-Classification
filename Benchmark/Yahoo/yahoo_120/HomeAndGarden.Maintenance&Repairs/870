pvc won't stay connected we're laying a septic line and for some reason i can't get my second pipe to bond it's pvc so it's a bit heavy and hard to work with i line it up to the fitting and my husband pushes it in while turning is there a better way we're not pros but we're not novices either we've done this many times with smaller pvc help as i've already said we've done this many times before with smaller pvc the first one bonded it should go without saying we know how to use the primer glue we know how to do this we just don't know why this one isn't bonding zonerider thank you so much it's very humid here today raining off and on also we didn't clean it enough after the first try so it's no wonder it didn't work after subsequent tries hello what schedule of pipe are you using schedule usually if you don't get a bond on the first try it's best to pull the sections apart and reclean them depending on the bonding agent you are using you may have to use naptha or paint thinner or something else a cleaner should be listed on the adhesive container when i want to be sure only to have to make the repair one time i pull the parts apart wipe up all of the adhesive i can use a cleaner safe for plastic goo gone works well once the both pieces of pipe have been cleaned and dried take a good piece of fine grit sandpaper and go over both pipes make sure your get all of the way into the receiving pipe now coat both pipes with purple primer go an inch beyond the area that will be covered when the pipes are assembled and let it dry recoat both pipes with purple make sure you don't see lighter streakes through the top coat if you do continue coating until even apply liberal amounts of adhesive to the male pipe and a thin coat of adhesive to the female section use a continuous circular motion and make the coat even don't let it goop up or puddle rotate the pipes as you apply if necessary after both sections are evenly coated push and twist you should feel the two pieces wanting to seperate smaller diameter pipes are usually held for appx seconds but be prepared to hold a pipe to seconds you may have to hold an additional amount of time depending on humidity if you have high humidity it is very important to apply the adhesive quickly and seat the pipes as quickly as a final precaution make sure that the adhesive you are using doesn't require you to allow it to set up for a minute or longer before you make the connection there are products on the market that require either making quick connection or need to set up before connecting i hope this helps i'm in the middle of reblumbing my parents house Drill bit Domestic water system Strap-on dildo Plastic Screw Internal ballistics Floppy disk Bong Violin Seismic retrofit M16 (rifle) Aluminium Amateur telescope making Friction Table tennis Thermal power station Sandpaper Mouse (computing) Bicycle frame Epoxy Light-emitting diode Knife Dog agility Carburetor Radio controlled airplane Car handling Poker jargon Handloading Wood Table saw Tire Printed circuit board Brazing Mattress Paint Brewery Hand grenade Ammunition Irrigation Glossary of firefighting equipment Adhesive Pottery Drag racing Airsoft Wind turbine Soldering Wire Diving suit Manifold Tobacco Lionel Corporation Laserdisc Gramophone record Guitar Vacuum cleaner Clarinet Equine conformation Bulk vending Cello Upholstery Turbocharger Harp Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Bicycle Rolling-element bearing Solar cell Japanese tea ceremony Explosive material Wok Carbon dioxide Compact disc Rail terminology Paintball Terminal ballistics Woodworking Energy development Cartridge (firearms) Drainage Sewage treatment Transformer Circuit design 24 Hours of Le Mans Aerial (dance move) Hamster Primer (paint) Glass Carpet Titanium Apollo Command/Service Module Menstrual cup Cocaine Anchor Manicure
