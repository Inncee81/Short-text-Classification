furnace water i had a new furnace put in in november of last year over the past week or so i have noticed that the water line running to the vent is on every time i walk past it and there is a lot of condensation on the outside of it i can also hear it running through the vents upstairs every time i listen it is spraying whether the furnace is running or not i have my a c turned on is this a problem if so do i need to call the person that put it in or is there something i can do the pipe that i believe is spraying is usually frosted over now every time i look at it even if the a c is not running the a c is running perfectly fine i did have to replace a blown fuse and i only noticed this happening after i did that could that have something to do with it you should always trust your instincts i would suggest that you do call the contractor back what it sounds like from how you have described it is that they are your refrigerant lines the large refrigerant line should have insulation wrapped around it because it will condensate when the ac is on now the noise is concerning it is usually indicative of a leak in the system is the ac performing well enough or have you noticed a drop off in the performance the noise is indicative of air mixing with the refrigerant and creating the noise under normal operation when the refrigerant level is set to manufacturer's specifications and the system is sealed then it should be relatively quiet again trust your instincts call a qualified contractor for more information go to http www howellsac com Thermal power station Air conditioning HVAC Refrigerator Furnace Carburetor Fossil fuel power plant Haloalkane Cray-1 Town gas Casting Microphone Basement Ice cream Insulation Brewery Autonomous building Loudspeaker Spark plug Gramophone record Mercury Atlas 6 M16 (rifle) Transformer Ocean thermal energy conversion Containment building USS Tunny (SS-282) ITV Fire fighting Solar power Heat exchanger Gas absorption refrigerator Ammonia Dairy Capacitor plague Bong Drag racing Sonic boom Suppressor Three Mile Island Refrigeration Space Shuttle program Modem A Day in the Life Asbestos Thermostat Vacuum tube Jet engine Carbon dioxide Overclocking Air pollution 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines E85 Engine cooling Computer cooling Tofu Siphon Baby bottle Fiberglass Surtsey Rebreather Babe Ruth Ecco the Dolphin Blast furnace Newcomen steam engine Trans-Alaska Pipeline System The Long Game Glass Mitsubishi 3000GT Hearing aid Noise music Cold fusion Irrigation RuneScape Mini-Games Glossary of firefighting equipment Mercury 4 Refrigerant Superconductivity HyperText Transfer Protocol Dog training Diving suit The Midnight Sun Kitchen Swamp cooler Nintendo Entertainment System Hard disk Diseases of the honeybee Fuse (electrical) Social rule Airport Copper extraction Redundant array of independent disks Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Glider Water vapor Railway signalling Fume hood Mouse (computing)
