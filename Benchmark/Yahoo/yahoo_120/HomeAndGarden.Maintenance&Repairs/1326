can i put used motor oil in my lawnmower i know that obvioulsy i can but will it do damage the oil i'm wondering about is a used high quality synthetic that came out of my roommate's last oil change i wouldn't think it would but could it hurt the lawnmower at all it's a regular push mower just looking for a way to recyle and save a buck all info will be great oil breaks down over time it absorbs all the impurities in a motor with synthetics im not sure how that works how clean does it look if its all black and dirty dont use it if its reletively clean id filter it out with like a cloth pour it into another container you can see thru and see if any impurities are left most mower engines are a 'sling' type meaning oil pretty much just gets 'thrown' at the vital parts berings normally i wouldnt say 'use used oil' but with synthetic i dont know i think filtering the synthetic would keep the fragments there will be some out but still you dont know how degraded it is might not have as many lubricating properties as new its up to you if you want to try it it could work fine it could wreck the motor over time i wouldnt take the chance kidd Motor oil Lawn mower Carburetor Diesel Two-stroke cycle Plastic Synthetic oil Transmission (mechanics) E85 Internal combustion engine Brewery Diesel engine Biodiesel Hemp Diamond Cocaine Water Synthetic diamond 613 mitzvot ExxonMobil Ultramarine Mobil Material properties of diamond Model aircraft Soap Textile manufacturing Glass Handloading Lionel Corporation Sewage treatment Chainsaw Lapis lazuli Atomic Kitten Radio controlled car Electronic filter Dry cleaning Manual transmission Strap-on dildo Briggs & Stratton Turquoise Oil refinery Cotton Alkane Locomotive Motorcycle Sulfuric acid Rubber Attack on Pearl Harbor Battery electric vehicle Hydraulic machinery Petroleum Ceramics Radio controlled airplane Gasoline Tocopherol Drill bit Tofu Texaco Fire extinguisher Earwax USS Arizona (BB-39) Billiards Olive oil Industrial wastewater treatment Bong Tissue engineering Town gas Gramophone record Continuously variable transmission Cast iron Kevlar Traffic light Lubricant Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Gothic metal Hydrogen economy Textile manufacturing terminology Ownership Carbon RuneScape Mini-Games Polychlorinated biphenyl Urinary incontinence Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Porsche 911 Alcohol fuel Naruto jutsu Insulin Final Fantasy IX Tank Dialysis Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Stage lighting Diode Indianapolis 500 Diamond color Cannabis (drug) Water purification
