i had a huge puddle of water coming from underneath my refridgerator this morning what is wrong with it the drip pan is probably overflowing the drip pan is a shallow flat pan that slides in under the bottom and is used to catch condensation every time you open the door it lets warm humid air in and the refrigeration condenses this humidity and it runs down and collects in a large flat pan underneath normally the water just evaporates but if you have had a lot of very humid days and were opening the doors a lot it might cause excessive condensation to overflow the pan you can slide the pan out to empty and clean it usually collects dust also if you have an ice maker check in the back to see that the plastic hose it's small about in diameter is not leaking somewhere this hose will connect to a water line somewhere and there might be a problem with a clamp coupling Irrigation Bong Heat exchanger Air conditioning Thermal power station Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Dairy Brewery Coffee Carbon dioxide Carburetor Rain Flush toilet Water vapor Glacier Movie projector Intravenous therapy Severe weather terminology (United States) Rebreather Aerial (dance move) Solar power Glossary of firefighting equipment Electrophysiology Autonomous building HVAC Fossil fuel power plant Ocean thermal energy conversion Vacuum cleaner Cruising (maritime) Diving regulator Steam engine Relative humidity Cookware and bakeware Refrigerator Town gas Carnivorous plant Drill bit Phase (matter) Water Humidity Floppy disk Violin Hydroponics Steam locomotive nomenclature Canal lock Capacitor Swamp cooler Siphon Scuba set Seismic retrofit Glossary of firefighting terms Furnace Nuclear fallout Motor oil Menstrual cup Ice cream Fujian tea ceremony Dialysis Opportunity rover Desert Cyclone Wok Equine conformation Fire fighting Basement Urinary incontinence Clarinet Fishing Houseplant Weather lore Hydraulic machinery The Amber Spyglass Energy development Solar system Poker jargon Trapping E85 Amateur telescope making GLOCK Plastic Condensed milk Microphone Cloud Ice core 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Kitchen Suppressor Skateboarding trick Mars Dam Wine making Blood Simple Pachypodium Glossary of wildland fire terms Gas absorption refrigerator Climate of Salt Lake City Circuit design Elevator
