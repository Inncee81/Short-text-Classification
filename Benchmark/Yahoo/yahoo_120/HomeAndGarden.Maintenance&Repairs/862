just bought a pool and just can't seem to get the alkalinity down i lower the ph every day it's not helping bring down the allkalinity though what else can i do normally the total alkalinity would have to be extremely high for ph lowering chemicals not to have much effect on the ph usually ppm or higher how high is yours and what type of pool do you have total alk ranges vary if it's really bad there are two ways of lowering it pouring a high concentration of the acid solution in one area of the pool will destroy more of the total alkalinity in that area a process referred to as slug feeding if i remember correctly pouring it evenly around the pool will take longer to show results on the total alk but it is the way you'd want to do it to lower ph as one of the other answers touched on this can take a long time although i would probably recommend trying it daily and do it away from skimmers and returns if you have an inground you can probably do it in the deep end with the pump off for a little while don't think i'd recommend that in an above ground pool because of the acid sinking and damaging the liner before its gets diluted the other way is to drain and partially refill provided your fill water is not too high in total alkalinity also in most area rain will eventually bring the total alkalinity on its own unless you're also having a problem with a consistently high ph which it sounds like you may you might just let it come down on its own if it's not creating other problems cloudy water etc if it's not outrageously high any idea how it got so high usually it's either from the fill water or using baking soda sodium bicarbonate to raise ph Soil pH Hydrochloric acid Water purification Ammonia Fire extinguisher Hydrogen peroxide Base (chemistry) Water (molecule) Alkali Motor oil Sulfuric acid Solar power Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina PH Marine aquarium Sodium carbonate Internal ballistics Hydrogen sulfide Tooth enamel Flue gas desulfurization Hard water Tooth Cocaine Battery (electricity) Hydrogen chloride Bread Swimming pool Rebreather Dishwasher Sodium hypochlorite Carburetor Brewery Siphon Nickel-cadmium battery Concentration Action potential Electrolyte Vinegar Aspartame Naval mine Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Sodium hydroxide Gas metal arc welding Chlorine Diving Cyanide Carnivorous plant Hydrogen economy Climate of the United Kingdom E85 Vitamin C Illegal drug trade Drowning Houseplant Fluoride therapy Renewable energy Hypoglycemia Fluoride Sewage treatment Prostate cancer Welding Nutrition Mount Pinatubo Vacuum Corrosion Helium Potassium hydroxide Nitroglycerin Decompression sickness Smoke-screen Breastfeeding Cookware and bakeware Sugar beet Water Fire fighting Airbag Soap Gastric acid Fertility awareness Chocolate Customs and etiquette of Japan Renal physiology Transformer Portland cement Drill bit Enzyme Concrete Acid mine drainage Mattress Ultramarine Tofu Solar cell Solvay process E number
