is my condo board creating a monopoly with this rule there is a rule in place that says air conditioners must be hoisted by crane onto the roof i cannot find any mention of heating air conditioning appliances installation or otherwise mentioned in my copy of the association rules i have spoken to several board members who all seem to know matter of factly that taking anything up through the third floor opening is a finable offense many have explained to me that someone dropped a unit thereby cracking a tile the time expense inconvenience replacing this tile was so great that we collectively vowed to never ever let it happen again recently i attempted to get competitive pricing to have my ac fixed or replaced these heating ac people are not in the business of arranging cranes they will do this to honor the association but all acknowledge that it is really un necessary they are quick to point out that they are fully bonded insured etc in the event of a broken tile in the end they are priced out of the market to me it sounds like b s they just dont wont that hassle of having to get contractors or what not in their to fix it if it breaks their is a board like i think its the housing development or something like that you can ask them but if you have a rule book to the condo and its not in their they can not stop you from doing it the way you want it done Ra (board game) Solar power Monopoly (game) Mahjong Autonomous building Volleyball Microeconomics Kitchen Gambling Annuity Monopoly Insurance Lloyd's of London Scrabble Windows XP Intellectual property Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Furnace Dominoes Supply and demand Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game New York Stock Exchange The Apprentice 2 ITV Acquire Poker jargon IBM PC compatible Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Ultimate (sport) Football (soccer) CPU cache Seismic retrofit Deflation (economics) Gold as an investment Wal-Mart United States Postal Service Ryanair Air conditioning Asbestos Economy of Russia Public domain Solar cell Paintball Nintendo Entertainment System Tennis Consensus decision-making Circuit breaker Pan American World Airways Housing cooperative Drill bit American individualist anarchism The Curse of Fenric Life insurance Keynesian economics FairTax Arbitrage Fight Club Debate Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Glossary of firefighting terms Plastic Whose Line Is It Anyway?
