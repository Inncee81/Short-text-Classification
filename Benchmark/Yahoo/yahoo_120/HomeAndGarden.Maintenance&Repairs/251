how to remove calcium build up from the inside of my hot tub spa i have tried everything i can think of it cannot be anything that will scratch the surface it may be too late for the mytee mitt but if you haven't tried one then that might do it it's made for pools and spas i've not had good luck with clr on thicker build ups but it is great on the typical mineral deposits on glassware sinks toilets tubs etc definitely worth a try there is a white pumice stone like block that i get at walmart in the cleaning products area that i have used to remove mineral and scum buildup on fiberglass tubs try one of those and see if it works but you will probably need several for the whole hot tub if you are careful then you may want to start by using a single edge razor blade scraper to scrape off the thickest of the mineral buildup Knife Dishwasher Swimming pool Hard water Drill bit Pottery Dishwashing Sento Soap Motor oil Hot tub 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Textile manufacturing Brewery Woodworking Diamond Shaving Gay bathhouse Hot spring Eifel Aqueduct Top-bar hive Tuff Geology of the Moon Hand scraper Desert Glossary of wildland fire terms Gilding Customs and etiquette of Japan Opportunity rover Mount Mazama Olduwan Genericized trademark Onsen Diamond simulant Sauna Mineral Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Kenny McCormick Residual-current device Fiberglass Coriolis effect Menstrual cup Weathering Geyser Surface mining Long Valley Caldera Tooth Aluminium Tooth enamel Eolian Sea ice Cubic zirconia Card scraper Spark plug Razor Plumbing fixture Radio controlled airplane Marble sculpture Asbestos Mineral County, West Virginia Bulldozer Limestone Water (molecule) Mount St. Helens Halitosis Internal ballistics Dymaxion house Bathing Goaltender Hard disk Masonry Printmaking Table saw Milk Oceanic trench Crater Lake National Park Toilet paper Transformer Caliche Sewage treatment Bone Gramophone record Obsidian Diseases of the honeybee Shampoo Ammolite Sulfuric acid Mattress Fecal incontinence Atlantic Ocean Derbyshire lead mining history Hot rod Carnivorous plant Wal-Mart Typewriter Red Hot Chili Peppers
