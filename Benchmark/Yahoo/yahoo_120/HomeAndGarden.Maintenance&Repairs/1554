mouse mouse i woke up this morning and there was a mouse sitting to the right of me then it ran into my closet i ran to my sisters room to tell her theres a mouse in my room and we checked around my closet and couldn't find it she didnt believe me then we were in our parents room and my sister screamed because a mouse ran out of my parents closet and then back into their closet my mom said she saw the mouse in the kitchen this morning i dont think these are seperate mice i think they're the same one we've set up traps all over the house but cant catch it we have the electronic ones with peanut butter and the normal ones we have like i cant get a cat because im allergic what do we do the mouse doesn't like peanut butter it sticks to the roof of his her mouth and he she cannot eat for days until the stickiness is gone mice these days have grown smarter they don't eat fattening foods like cheese anymore because they know that once they get plump they are bigger more tempting targets for predators such as owls cats and humans they are also very observant and aware that human's tend to use cheese as bait so they know not to go near cheese and the accompanying mouse trap of death it would be best to get a professional to catch the mouse because it could spread germs and who knows what kind of rabies diseases etc in the meantime keep your closets and rooms clean because they love to hide in clutter if you smell something stinky or notice droppings most likely they are nearby i would try using sweet foods on the mouse trap instead of salty or sticky ones maybe the mice these days have changed their preferences and like not so sticky sugar filled candy or cookies good luck Peanut butter Hamster Breakfast The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Garfield Cat Tooth Japanese cuisine Cheese Food Shaggy dog story Peanut The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Fancy rat Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Toilet humour Ed, Edd n Eddy Shen Gong Wu Chicken Kenny McCormick Fecal incontinence Ferret Recurring South Park characters Dairy The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Mouse Vegetarianism Animal Codename: Kids Next Door Butter Trailer Park Boys Chocolate Mouse (computing) Hey Arnold!
