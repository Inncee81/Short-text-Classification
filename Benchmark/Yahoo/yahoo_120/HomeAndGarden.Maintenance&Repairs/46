white leather sofa i took delivery of a white leather sofa today a two seater and a three seater the two seater is fine but when you sit on the white sofa and get up all of the leather is wrinkled and you have to smooth it with your hand even then its a bit dented the two seater just springs back up the lady at customer services says it just needs plumping but surely i dont have to do this every time i get up what do you think the problem is and how do i get it sorted thanks i dont have any kids im worried that the leather will crack leather does not come in a uniform way like fabric does it comes from hides which are all different and the panels are all cut from different areas you may have a sofa that has had the panel cut from the belly area where the leather is more 'stretchy' than on other areas the leather should be fine and will only crack if it is not looked after in the correct way however if you are not happy with the item and it does seem that there is a marked difference between the two then ask for it to be replaced if you want to know what your rights are and you are in the uk ring the association of master upholsterers whoc will advise you as you have a white suite it is imperative that you look after it otherwise you will regret the decision pale leathers can suffer from dye transfer from clothing and the use of a quality leather protector ltt is the most effective on the market wil help to resist this and make cleaning easier if you do this while it is new you will be helping a great deal to clean either use lazy leather in cleaner and protector or leather shampoo and your white leather should stay looking white good luck with the other issue Upholstery Leather Clothing Mattress Chair Knife Textile manufacturing terminology Strap-on dildo Plastic Textile manufacturing Violin Theory of conduct Wood Undergarment Dry cleaning Pottery Fencing Welding Kimono De Lorean DMC-12 Drill bit Casting Timpani Diamond Breastfeeding Woodworking Brewery Sento Camouflage Softball Enterprise content management Economy of the United States Knitting Gucci Gramophone record Hakama Combine (Half-Life 2) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Vulcanization Hemp Bulk vending Warez CPU cache Jute The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Climbing equipment Trade union Psoriasis Comanche Couch Hubble Space Telescope Motorcycle Darth Vader Table tennis Chicago White Sox Bong Glass Status of Forces Agreement Sonic the Hedgehog Coin collecting Inflation Sin City Functional programming Shark Chevrolet Camaro Airsoft Utilitarianism Dog training Poker jargon Volleyball Air New Zealand BMW M5 Flag of Hong Kong Heavy metal fashion Externality Social rule Suplex Kilt Items in the Metroid series Information Services Procurement Library Copy protection Paragliding Snooker Lighting Quicksort Hamster Equine conformation Goaltender Geodesic dome Sewing machine Rigging Illegal drug trade Carburetor Service Compact disc High-heeled shoe Niddah Henri Murger
