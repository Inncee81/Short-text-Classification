home inspection we are a first time home buyer recently we did home inspection found some problems like high amount of carbonmonoxide when the oven is turned on seller says he will fix the problem also gutter needed cleaning so my question is how can we believe that seller has fixed the problems since we don't have carbon monoxide detector or we don't know how to check the gutter need some advice on this please or do you guys suggest us to do reinspection only for this i would have it reinspected carbon monoxide is nothing to play around with you should buy a carbonmonoxide detector if you do buy the home it can be bought at home depot or hardware store for about if it is not fixed by the seller tell your agent to put an allowance in the contract to pay for a new stove Real estate broker Option Supply and demand Betting (poker) Microeconomics Carbon monoxide Oil-for-Food Programme Carbon dioxide Economics Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Stock Fire extinguisher Gasification Short selling Poker jargon Futures contract Inventory Carbon monoxide poisoning Call option Gold as an investment Carburetor Islamic banking Atari ST Sun ITunes Music Store Put option Internet fraud Breathing gas Hard disk CPU cache Keynesian economics Illegal drug trade Security (finance) Wok Solar power Carbon Contract Alcoholic beverage Gold standard Kitchen Neutrino Glossary of firefighting equipment Slot machine Conveyancing Monopsony Renewable energy Mutual fund Warranty Mortgage Something Awful Forums IBM PC compatible Hydrogen economy Emissions trading Bulk vending NeXT Babylonian law Alcohol fuel Rational pricing Steam (content delivery) Nuclear power phase-out Diamond SETI Windows XP Tax Air pollution Space Shuttle program Surplus value Trading Places Publishing Hemoglobin Retailer Inflation Circuit design Final Fantasy XI Hyperinflation Debugging Derivative (finance) Wal-Mart Town gas Option style Hire purchase Automobile emissions control Redox Ashton-Tate Credit derivative Land reform Enron Corporation Expert system Carbon dioxide sink Advance fee fraud Nickel Kyoto Protocol Craps Burglar alarm One-time pad Gasoline MMORPG Computer virus FairTax
