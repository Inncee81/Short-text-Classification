i have a water overflow from my hw header tank can water be forced back into this tank from the hw cylinder the water overflows when hot or cold it seems that water is being forced back into the header from the bottom outlet the ball cock and valve is ok the water stops overflowing when i turn on the hot water tap we have mixer taps in the house could these be passing so your saying that when the taps are turned off the cold water pressure is some how forcing its way into the hot pipe system and flooding the hw tank making it over flow to find out whats going on i would go to your hw tank and jam the ballco k in the up position so when the water laval drops the ballco k stays up drain off all the hot water by running the hot water tap then see what happens if the water is coming from your cold tap it will fill up from your tap up to the tank so if you try the down stairs tap and nothing comes out but it does out of the up stairs bath then you know its the washer on the bath or vice versa i hope this helps Tap (valve) Thermal power station Domestic water system Flush toilet Siphon Sewage treatment Carburetor Plumbing fixture Brewery Irrigation Hydraulic machinery Dam Space shuttle main engine Two-stroke cycle Rebreather Autonomous building Glossary of firefighting equipment Internal ballistics Fountain Seismic retrofit Central heating Spark plug Scuba set Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Motor oil Pump Newcomen steam engine Solar power Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Furnace Professional wrestling aerial techniques Glossary of firefighting terms USS S-5 (SS-110) Basement Thermostat Air brake (rail) Cruising (maritime) Water hammer Sento Water Novelty (locomotive) Fossil fuel power plant Tap water Transformer Canal lock Exhaust system Coriolis effect Diving cylinder Septic tank Internal combustion engine Home repair Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Safety engineering Bong Heat Revolver Turbocharger Ocean thermal energy conversion Deluge (prehistoric) Fire hydrant Boiler Stirling engine Kerosene lamp Renewable energy Water heater Fire fighting Manifold vacuum Indianapolis 500 HVAC Hot air balloon Screw Snorkel Wave power Uilleann pipes Japanese toilet Floodgate Water (molecule) Drowning Lake Nyos Punt (boat) Maple syrup Chevrolet Corvair engine Electrophysiology Reef tank Diesel engine Flamethrower Happy Tree Friends Aerial (dance move) Nitrous Hydropower Sewer Expansion chamber Lindy Hop Combine harvester Flood Automobile emissions control
