what is wrong with my pool pump filter it seems like i can't run it for more than an hour or so without having to stop and backflush it to get some power it is a plenty powerful unit and works really well after i do this but only for a short period of time even if i just pump the lever for a while that helps but why won't it work longer i don't know how old it is i bought the house about months ago and it looks pretty new it might not be related but i have a hard time vacuuming as well due to a lack of suction after a few minutes so if i need to clean my filter how do i do that i tried once to open all the valves and do a lot of pumping on that lever and it worked for a little longer than usual but not for long is there a part in there i need to take out and clean you probably need to clean your filter you don't mention what kind of filter it is the steps are different for each kind of filter but i do know the longest it will take you is about hours if you have all the parts before hand and a couple of things go wrong they are not that hard to clean just do a little research and you will be fine Carburetor Thermal power station Brewery Vacuum cleaner Dairy Borehole Glossary of firefighting equipment Dialysis Hydraulic machinery Hard disk Vacuum Thermostat 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dry cleaning Pump It Up Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Motor oil Motorcycle Trombone Textile manufacturing Bladderwort Shaggy dog story Siphon Poker jargon Water purification Bong Social rule Knife Central processing unit Manifold vacuum Vacuum tube Two-stroke cycle Floppy disk Three Mile Island Unreal Abortion Solar power Circuit breaker Equine conformation Newcomen steam engine Speed of light Diving Cavitation The Price Is Right John Edwards Time Electrophysiology Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Nuclear fallout Fossil fuel power plant Shark Incandescent light bulb Humphrey Bogart PID controller Steam (content delivery) Diving regulator Hebrew calendar Treehouse of Horror V Breastfeeding Antarctic krill Energy development Diode Mattress Vacuum mattress Coffee Laserdisc Harp Manual transmission Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Apprentice 2 Theory of conduct Four-stroke cycle Stirling engine The Beatles discography Sea-Monkey Year of the Spider Autonomous building Diesel engine Diatom Hash table Vacuum pump In The Groove (game) Dead Sea Steam locomotive nomenclature Menstrual cup Pneumatics Craps Suction Rail terminology Apollo 8 Athenian democracy Liquid crystal display Aerial (dance move) Synthesizer Novelty (locomotive) Marathon (sport) Low-pass filter Rocket fuel Baroque chess
