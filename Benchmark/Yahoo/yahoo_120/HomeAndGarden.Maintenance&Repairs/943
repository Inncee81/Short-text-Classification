how to remove marks from a wooden floor i have a lot of marks on my floor from the plastic wheels on my sofa i have tried warn soapy water but doesn't work anyone got any ideas of best solution to remove these i recently had a similar problem with a wooden end table i had a friend over to my apartment and instead of using the coasters i had provided she put her drinking glass on a folded paper napking thinking that this would prevent damage to the wood well upon picking up the glass there was a noticeable water mark on the wood as soon as i saw the damage i rubbed some liquid gold a wood preservative available in man stores and fortunately it did the trick i believe part of the success was due to the fact that i caught the problem with a relatively short period of time how long ago did the problem appear p s water damages wood unless you use a wood soap such as murphy's oil soap try an oil soap and then the liquid gold and let us know whether you were successful Textile manufacturing Drill bit Sento Hamster Mattress Water Chair Woodworking The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Solar power Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Manicure Kitchen Sodium chloride Plastic Seismic retrofit Cryonics Dishwashing Glycerin Beer Shaggy dog story Carbon dioxide Fire Fancy rat Knoebels Naval mine Wood Sewage treatment Tattoo Corrosion Milk Fecal incontinence Genericized trademark Confidence trick Nuclear power The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Poker jargon Characters in the Smurfs Knife Gold standard Hydrochloric acid Soap bubble Combine (Half-Life 2) Sodium Door Deforestation Roller coaster Renewable energy The Inside Shampoo Japanese tea ceremony Violin Cha chaan teng Chopsticks Cruising (maritime) Water purification About a Boy Ultraviolet Computer virus EastEnders Solvent Tire Firefighter Soap opera Wok Transformation problem Solution Inflation Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Rum Escalator Urinary incontinence Olive oil Hand washing Glasses Floppy disk The Time Machine Pottery Vinegar The X-Files (season 1) Nunchaku RuneScape skills Neighbours Hash table Kayak Skateboarding trick Geodesic dome Lathe Thief (computer game) Coffee Golf Sulfuric acid Acne Brewery Philosophy of space and time Keynesian economics
