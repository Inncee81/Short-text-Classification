does anyone know anything about electrical wiring in a home we own a fairly new home years old and several months ago the master bedroom lights all weren't working the outlets etc the other week i forgot about the outlets and plugged in a vacuum cleaner in the room and low and behold all the outlets started working again sadly yesterday when i got home they were out again and so i thought hmmm i wonder if i could bring it back sure enough i plugged in the vacuum cleaner and the electricity started working again but this time it only came back for no more than a minute ugh we bought this house thinking it was new and perfect boy have we been wrong please give me any info or thoughts that you have on this moronic problem hi lynn hope i can help yes electrical problems can be maddening unfortunately they can also be quite dangerous fire being one of the dangers if you have any doubts about whether or not you can handle the problem yourself please hire a licensed electrician to help i am not one nor do i work for any electrical concern but i have wired several of my own houses and have dealt with such homeowner problems for over forty years that said let's see if i can help you locate and fix the problem form the descriptiion of your actions i suspect that one of the wires probaly a white one has come loose inside the box that that holds the recepticle you plugged your vacuum into there could be several sets of wires behind the actual plug in in that box each set is tied together with a plastic twist on gadget called a wire nut chances are that one or more of the wires have come loose to check it you first will have to go to your main electric panel and flip off the circuit breaker that feeds electridity to the set of outlets where the trouble is located if you can't find it you should get a neighbor of friend to help reaching into the outlet box without the breaker being off could lead to electrical shock and or a damaging short circuit okay assuming you have switched the correct breaker to the off position you can now handle the wires behind the outlet where the trouble seems to be located check the wires that enter each of the wire nuts white wires go together with the exposed copper tip of each touching the others the wire nut is designed to make that happen it just trwists on the black wires do the same but these are the hot ones be careful the green ones twist onto a bare copper one they are safe do not connect unmatching colors to each other if you find what looks like might have fixed the problem put the socket back in leave the cover off and switch the electricity back on at the breaker panel next check to see if the circuit works by plugging in a lamp or some other appliance if it still does not work do the drill again with the next non working plug in good luck and once again if you do not feel competent to attempt this get some professional help one source might be the builder who built the house he might me interested in seeing what the sub contractor who did the wiring did wrong cheers del Residual-current device BS 1363 Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring (UK) Poker jargon Distribution board Spark plug Vacuum tube Electrical wiring Electrician Light switch Switch Printed circuit board Thermal power station Incandescent light bulb Fan (implement) Electric motor Circuit breaker Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Solar power Three-phase electric power Solar cell Ring circuit Lighting Telephone exchange Oscilloscope National Electrical Code (US) Ground and neutral Transformer Gas metal arc welding Tesla coil Fluorescent lamp Mattress Circuit design Fire alarm control panel Drill bit Universal Serial Bus Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Jack plug Futurama (TV series - season 5) Ethernet Power strip Ignition system Rail terminology Cathode ray tube Internal ballistics Big Brother (USA TV series) Welding Soldering Knife Apollo Guidance Computer Scientology beliefs and practices Integrated circuit Professional wrestling slang Electrophysiology Kitchen Battery (electricity) Transistor Enigma machine New York Giants Lightning rod Mains electricity Debugging Nuclear power Tire Professional wrestling throws Thermostat Light-emitting diode Strap-on dildo Vacuum Alternating current Floppy disk Space disaster Fireworks X10 (industry standard) Terminal ballistics Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Electrical engineering Vacuum cleaner Dimmer D-subminiature Burglar alarm Jumpstart 3rd Grade Heinkel He 112 Digital circuit The Apprentice 2 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Screw Aluminium Christmas tree
