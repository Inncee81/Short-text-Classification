do most homes have some amount of settlement my home is years i have seen tiny verticle cracks we dwell on a living planet yes most houses settle after construction and they continue to rise and fall with the expansion of the ground they are built on depending on soil types differing soil clay rock mixtures and of course the amount of moisture water they contain if you experience a drought dry then the soil clay shrinks causing the buildings foundations to sink with the ground if you have heavy rain then the soil clay swells and the building rises also when and if you have uneven moisture in the location of the buildings foundations then rise and fall are uneven and great stress is placed on the foundations which sometimes crack and subsiquently cause disturbance in the structure cracks are the stress signs of this occurrance nearly always this is the result of uneven moisture in the sub soil some ways of limitting this are not to have garden beds at or near the perimeter of the building near the foundation as watering these can cause uneven soil moisture not to let damaged gutters downpipes persist get them repaired asap do not grow large rooted trees adjacent to buildings the root system can cause major foundation faults drainage and water pipes if leaking are also bad news what a great number of buildings lack is a correctly formed and constructed drainage system that is ground water drainage this is a major consideration in construction and it is quite often overlooked especially by owner builders hope this is useful later jim contract builder for years Seismic retrofit Desert Drainage Soil Erosion Wood Basement Foundation (architecture) Houseplant Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Desertification Zuiderzee Works Natural disaster Carnivorous plant Deforestation Dam The Fens Gypsy moth Equine conformation Portland cement Straw-bale construction Disaster Bonsai Weathering Midlothian, Virginia Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Construction Pachypodium habitats Welding Glacier Erie Canal Vegetation Tire Fast bowling Rain Caliche Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Vertisol Civil engineering Global warming and agriculture Geography of China Pachypodium Old growth forest Electrical wiring Autonomous building Sorghum Urinary incontinence Great Lakes Glossary of firefighting terms Air-raid shelter Soil salination Physiological plant disorders Road Geography of Russia Home repair Rail tracks 2005 Maharashtra floods Masonry Garden Strawberry A151 road 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Yosemite National Park Geography of Africa Shipwreck Prosopis cineraria Water Amazon River Great Mosque of Djenn__ Disc brake Tofu Western United States Geography of Brazil Ecohydrology Aluminium Climate of the United Kingdom Thunderstorm Pile Architecture of the California missions Geography of India Aquifer Corrosion Death Valley National Park Geology of the Moon Eutrophication Hydroponics Root Lake Sulfur Moss Chaco Culture National Historical Park Flood
