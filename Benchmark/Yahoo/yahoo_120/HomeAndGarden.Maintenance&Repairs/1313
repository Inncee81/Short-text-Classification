i really need help with my central air unit any advice would be truly appreciated thanks i'll try my best to be as detailed as possible i have a goodman central air unit it was working great and then one day the air suddenly wasnt flowing through the vents like it should i mean its like a cool low pressure air where the cool air is being felt somewhat through the vents but not at a force like before to cool the house i thought at first it was my coils that needed to be cleaned so i cleaned the coils on the compressor really well and even changed my fliter which that was strange too because i use to have to slide my fliter in and this time as i was sliding my filter in it was like something just sucked it right in like a vacume well i then flipped the breaker from on to off and then back on and still cant get the air to come through enough now my fan on my compressor is blowing out cool air instead of hot air and its not even blowing it out at a higher pressure someone told me that it sounds like my ducts could be clog could that be it and if so how do i check it it sounds like you have a blower restriction or dirty coil letting the system run like that can cause the compressor to fail your best bet is to call a serviceman Air conditioning Jet engine Thermostat HVAC Axial compressor Thermal power station Two-stroke cycle Turbocharger Turbojet Gas compressor Turbofan Bass guitar Carburetor Supercharger Bong Fan (implement) Mattress SR-71 Blackbird Furnace Solar power Motor oil Fossil fuel power plant Fume hood Swamp cooler Refrigerator Circuit breaker Diesel engine Ocean thermal energy conversion Heinkel He 100 Engine cooling Tesla coil Diving air compressor Novelty (locomotive) Pebble bed reactor Aerial (dance move) Stirling engine Propeller 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Audio level compression Gas turbine Phase change heat pump Trumpet Loudspeaker Skateboarding trick Vacuum Dodge Neon Bicycle brake systems Monsoon Electric motor Spacecraft propulsion Three-phase electric power Centrifugal compressor Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Diving cylinder Internal combustion engine Wind Fluorescent lamp Intercooler Operation Petticoat Rebreather Climate of the United Kingdom Futurama (TV series - season 5) Equine conformation Gas absorption refrigerator Computer cooling Heat Siphon Blown flap Brewery Movie projector Hyperthermia Mount Pinatubo Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Respiratory system Scramjet Soldering Casting Heat exchanger Hot air balloon Flute USS Trigger (SS-237) Hydraulic machinery Bypass ratio Chevrolet Corvair engine Windscale fire Residual-current device Diode Diving regulator Capacitor plague SpongeBob SquarePants Autonomous building Adiabatic process Aircraft Hard disk E85 Magnet Stall (flight) Space shuttle main engine
