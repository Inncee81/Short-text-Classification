i have an evo he boiler need confirmation that installed properly dont know who installed can i find out if you want this checked properly then the flue gassas have to be analyzed the water ph quality tested the installation should be checked for adherance to regulations the condensate and gas rates in particular if you can get all that done for i will have their number please they can do some of mine in my experience of 'installers' do not own crucial items a gas analyser a power flushing machine and a ph or tds meter and of those who do several don't know how to use them most will not test the temperatures to and from the boiler and will not test the hot water output they should but they don't if you are having this checked ask the engineer which analyser he has and if he tests ph or tds and if he does which machine he uses this will cost and will take at least an hour and you should receive a comprehensive report stating the findings and comparisons to manufacturers data good luck Thermal power station Furnace Explosive material Fossil fuel power plant Ocean thermal energy conversion Biodiesel Digital circuit Horsepower Nuclear reactor Brewery Alcohol fuel M16 (rifle) Wind power Stirling engine Autonomous building Novelty (locomotive) Coal Incandescent light bulb Nuclear power Iowa class battleship Boiler Model (economics) Renewable energy Software testing William Murdoch Water Hydrogen economy Casting E85 Engineering Killian documents Gasoline Hubble Space Telescope Power station Manitoba Hydro Carburetor Dishwasher Air conditioning Overclocking Industrial engineering Embedded system Welding Optical fiber Refrigerator CPU cache Lighting Requirements analysis Fuel injection Rail terminology Hard disk Hydropower Huygens probe Flue gas desulfurization Turbocharger Solar variation Fuel cell Town gas Quality control Carbon dioxide Energy development Ice core Printed circuit board Electrical generator Gas turbine-electric locomotive Gas turbine Spark plug Amateur radio Water turbine Glossary of firefighting terms Information Services Procurement Library Propeller Economy of the United States Mach kernel Coffee Product Lifecycle Management Hydrogen vehicle Automated analyser Wankel engine Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Timeline of steam power Gas metal arc welding Mobile phone radiation and health Temperature Debugging Heinkel He 100 Rainhill Trials Porsche 911 Perl DVD Bell test experiments Aquifer test Exploration of Mars Scramjet Hot air balloon RISC Environmental concerns with electricity generation
