trying to update old honeywell thermostat want to install newer hunter t stat i am updating a honeywell q l thermostat to a hunter the problem is the old unit had an l wire connection it was a brown wire searching online it seems to be the l is a systems monitoring huh line but i still don't know where to connect it the new t stat has r y w w g o b e a and c terminals also the old unit had a jumper line between e and y do i do that with the new one as well and finally the old unit had a w connection but no w connection do i keep it this way on the new t stat thanks st turn off the breakers marked furnace a c and or air handler heat do you have gas or electric heat if electric heat do you have a heat pump is your new t stat battery powered or is it volt ok from your wall you should have wires going to your t stat they are colored coded red green yellow white blue orange brown and or black red is for low voltage power it goes to the r terminal on your tstat green is to the indoor blower relay and goes to the g terminal y is the same as y on your old tstat and it is for the yellow wire w is the same as w and it goes to the wire and that is what energizes your heat be it elec or gas blue or black are usually common and will go to the c terminal as for the o b terminal if you do have a heat pump connect the orange wire to this terminal do not worry about the a terminal also on your tstat terminal board there may be a switch that says b o this is for a heat pump application if after wiring your unit and turning the breakers back on the unit blows hot air move this switch from b to o or revers o to b if you will let me know what type of heatr you have and if it is a heat pump i will tell you exactly what to do Three-phase electric power Circuit breaker Transformer Switch Thermal power station Solar power Circuit design Relay Electrical wiring Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Furnace Resistor Spark plug Light-emitting diode Fuse (electrical) Electrical generator Incandescent light bulb Electric motor George Westinghouse Rail terminology Two-stroke cycle Tesla coil Vacuum tube High-voltage hazards Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster RS-232 Wind power Air conditioning HVAC Central processing unit Electricity meter Fan (implement) Diode Fossil fuel power plant Apollo 13 Electrical breakdown Distribution board Residual-current device Welding Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Capacitor Potentiometer Stirling engine Transistor Thermocouple TGV Renewable energy Lighting Electric power transmission High-voltage direct current Internal combustion engine Fluorescent lamp Burglar alarm Energy development Power station Volt Hybrid vehicle Electrical wiring (UK) X10 (industry standard) Battery (electricity) Spark gap Heat Alternating current Gas metal arc welding Oscilloscope Autonomous building TIA-568A/B Carburetor Impedance matching Color Steam engine Oxygen sensor Windows XP Supercharger Diesel engine MOSFET Railgun Wind turbine Refrigerator Hydrogen economy Fire alarm control panel Aircraft engine controls CityRail BS 1363 Action potential Logic gate Peltier-Seebeck effect Electrical element Lightning Glossary of firefighting terms Telephone exchange Loudspeaker 2003 North America blackout Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Uninterruptible power supply
