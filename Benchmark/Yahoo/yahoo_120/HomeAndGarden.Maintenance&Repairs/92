one side of my house the electric is out i had the breakers checked there fine what could it be none of the walloutlets work or wall switches however one of the wall out lets that dont work showing its getting juice the other ones are dead all plugs and switches have been changed its a older house about s older houses used less circuits than more current ones causing the loss of one circuit to kill power to ''half of the house'' if you had lost power on one leg from the utility you would notice loss of power to v appliances such as electric ranges electric water heaters a c condensers etc the circuit needs to be traced by an electrician Residual-current device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Three-phase electric power BS 1363 Circuit breaker Thermal power station Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring (UK) Electrician Distribution board Solar power Alternating current X10 (industry standard) Thermostat Ring circuit Tesla coil Vacuum tube Power strip Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Electric power Transformer High-voltage direct current Central processing unit Ground and neutral Furnace National Electrical Code (US) Electrical generator Spark plug Electric motor Electrical network Hall effect Split phase Bathroom Electrical engineering Transistor Diode Carburetor Refrigerator Volt Electronic amplifier Capacitor Relay Oscilloscope Switch Ground (electricity) Logic gate Circuit design Programmable logic controller Fan (implement) Antenna (radio) Ignition system Fire alarm control panel Autonomous building Coffee Lineman (occupation) Appliance classes Mains electricity Switched-mode power supply 2003 North America blackout STS-61 Battery (electricity) Power line communication Light switch Electricity meter Electricity distribution Electrophysiology Decibel Apollo Command/Service Module Seismic retrofit Fossil fuel power plant Alcohol fuel Printed circuit board Jack plug Ultraviolet Embedded system Voltage drop Transmitter Electric power transmission Electrical breakdown Superconductivity Short circuit Spark gap Air conditioning Contact breaker Electronics Wind power Semiconductor device Digital circuit Battery electric vehicle Radiation hardening Impedance Transmission line Direct current Gas metal arc welding War of Currents HVAC Audiophile Telephone exchange Major appliance
