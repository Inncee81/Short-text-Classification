there's thick frost in my freezer around ice maker wall fridge is not cool enough it's a yr old kenmore model top area in refrigerator is not as cool as the bottom shelf temperature is set according to factory recommendation the usual culprits for frost build up at that location are a leak in the water inlet line for the ice maker or a bad seal on the freezer door when i say bad seal you have to check the condition of the seal check to see if anything inside the freezer keeps the door from closing freely and completely and check to see that the door closes on it's own by turning the front two levelers up a bit will help the door swing closed with minimal help deice the freezer i put all of my food into ice chests when having to do this kind of repair dry out the interior and carefully watch for a leak if you suspect a leak you can shut off the water supply to the ice maker and watch for further ice formation if you don't get ice build up turn the water back on and observe again if you get ice build up then you have a leak in the supply system or the ice maker it's self replace as necessary if you shut the water supple off and still get build up a leaking door seal is usally the problem now if the door seal is not at fault then it's time to look at the refrigerant tank and lines icing can be the result of a low coolant level most modern systems don't leak after a few years i have two fridges and two deep freezers all more than years old and working without problems check to see your model has a split cooling system for top and bottom probably not but it's ok to find out if the coolant is low then have a professional leak test the system repair and refill the coolant this however is the least likely unless your fridge gets moved or has been moved since installation if you have moved homes recently it may have been damaged in transit which means it's time for a repairman i hope this helps Tire Thermal power station Ice Carburetor Nuclear power Ice cream Black Mesa Research Facility Air conditioning Dairy Three Mile Island Solar power Equine conformation Pebble bed reactor Carbon dioxide Basement Home repair Space shuttle main engine Seismic retrofit Water (molecule) Sento Dam Containment building STS-61 Stirling engine Nuclear reactor Chernobyl accident Loudspeaker Coffee Thermostat Toyota Prius Kitchen Rebreather Ice core Fire fighting Autonomous building Enceladus (moon) Hard disk Ozone depletion CPU cache E85 Urinary incontinence Volleyball Poker jargon Turbocharger Helium Brewery Refrigeration Frost Door Transformer Vacuum Planet of the Daleks Vacuum tube Tofu Car handling Cruising (maritime) Bong Refrigerator car Ozone hole Motor oil Steam engine Sea ice The Tomb of the Cybermen Haloalkane Traumatic brain injury Armored Core Water Diseases of the honeybee Freezer Menstrual cup Overclocking Cryonics Heat Lake Bassoon Mars Digital circuit Capacitor plague Elevator RuneScape quests Flood geology Dialysis Food storage Windows Vista Climate of the United Kingdom Severe weather terminology (United States) Diving suit Glossary of firefighting equipment Ammonia Fast bowling Heinkel He 112 Embedded system
