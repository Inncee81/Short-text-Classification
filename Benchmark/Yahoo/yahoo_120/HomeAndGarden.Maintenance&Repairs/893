is it normal for my window a c unit to have water pooling in a pan the water is about a half an inch deep in a pan that the actual unit sits in should this drip somewhere or is it o k for it to be there help it is quite normal as the moisture condenses on the evaperator coils itruns down into the pan at the bottom of the unit some of the units were designed for the fan to dip into the water and spray it on the condenser coils to help cool them and tncrease efficiency nothing to worry about so long as pan is in good repair so it will not leak inside or on the window area there should be a slight tilt toward the outside for overflow drainage but is very rarely needed because of the fan action Thermal power station Air conditioning Refrigerator Tesla coil Autonomous building Transformer HVAC Solar power Dundas Square Houseplant Fire fighting Fluorescent lamp Electric motor Fog Fossil fuel power plant Equine conformation Coffee Brewery Urinary incontinence Mattress Thermostat Timeline of steam power Swimming Steam engine Bass guitar Ocean thermal energy conversion Basement Irrigation Precipitation (meteorology) Hard disk Casting Dehumidifier Drill bit Soldering Suppressor Ice Furnace Textile manufacturing Heat exchanger Flush toilet Containment building Home repair Headlight Siphon Stage lighting M16 (rifle) Desert Geography of Africa Dam Bicycle Carnivorous plant Fractional distillation Lake Windows XP Seismometer Internal ballistics Mouse (computing) Naval mine Passive solar Nine Inch Nails Phase (matter) Watt steam engine Pebble bed reactor Geodesic dome Diving suit Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Screw Cartridge (firearms) Ship Severe weather terminology (United States) Magnetic cartridge Bacon Water (molecule) Poker jargon Comet Floppy disk Fire extinguisher Death Valley National Park Tofu Natural gas Water vapor Karst topography Stove Mercury 4 Virtual memory Newcomen steam engine Fountain Spark plug Tire Drainage Sento Carbon dioxide Window Torpedo Comanche Printed circuit board Cloud Rope Microphone Chair
