should the gang plate screws be hot if not what causes this and what should i do to correct it we are finishing our basement and have a dimmer switch wired to recessed lights the screws that connect the gang plate to the dimmer are hot after only a short time with the power on the dimmer switches have a solid state component that controlls the voltage to the lights to cause dimming it needs a heat sink to stay cool enough usually the front plate of the switch is made of aluminum and serves this purpose it is normal for this aluminum plate to be warm but i've never seen them get alarmingly hot since the plate screws go into this aluminum plate they will get hot if the plate is hot these switches are rated for a certian amount of wattage if you exceed the rating it will overheat and probably fail lights sounds like a lot for one dimmer but it depends on what wattage bulbs are being used i think the average dimmers are good for about watts or so add up the total wattage of all the bulbs and compare it with the switch ratings usually stamped on the switch you might have to use dimmers with lights on each or use lower wattage bulbs Dimmer Incandescent light bulb Transformer Stage lighting Transistor Lighting Light-emitting diode Gas metal arc welding Oscilloscope Diode Welding Fluorescent lamp Light switch Vacuum tube Thermostat Solar cell Circuit design Screw Brewery Capacitor Carburetor Compact fluorescent lamp Electric motor Electrical wiring Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Battery (electricity) Electronic amplifier Fuse (electrical) Engine cooling Electrical element X10 (industry standard) High-voltage direct current Series and parallel circuits Tesla coil Pulse-width modulation Tire Oceanic trench Fire Central processing unit Drill bit Mercury Atlas 6 Circuit breaker Seismic retrofit Thermal power station Potentiometer Jet engine Armored Core Relay Gas tungsten arc welding Renewable energy Propeller Casting Wind turbine M16 (rifle) Heat Loudspeaker Sun Fan (implement) CPU design Temperature Solar variation Spark plug Three-phase electric power Disc brake Motor oil Residual-current device Hydraulic machinery Solar power Glass Resistor Steel Switched-mode power supply Alcohol fuel Spacecraft propulsion Liquid crystal display Heat sink MOSFET Carbon dioxide Wire George Westinghouse Thyristor Hydrogen economy Red Hot Chili Peppers Sewage treatment Spark gap Ocean thermal energy conversion Lightning E85 Fender Telecaster Air conditioning Inflation
