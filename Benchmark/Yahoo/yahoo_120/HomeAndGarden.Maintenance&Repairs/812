mold in my town home what should we do my husband and i moved into a town home last sept and got our place inspected by an inspector last july how we discovered this was we had a leak in our kitchen and right above it is the shower so we knew it coming from the show from the bathroom we had a plummer come out to look at the problem and he cut the cieling in the kitchen and their was mold pretty much all over we called our insector and he said to call our home insurance company and he had nothing to do with it the plummer said the home insurance does not cover the mold because it was there before we purchase the town home who should we go after the home inspector the people who sold us the town home any suggestions would help should we get an attorney if so what time of an attorney should we look for i am sorry for your situation the only way to get rid of mold is to have a professional come in a re mediate it it is not something that you can just bleach you may have to gut the source it sounds to me like it was a slow water leak that over time progressed mold grows very quickly and spreads unfortunately homeowners insurance does not cover mold but you need to be clever in how you describe the event to them i would say there is a water leak but the source is unknown at this time water damage is throughout the area and it is imperative to get this taken care of before mold mildew develops i would start a claim for water damage make sure you get the adjuster's name contact information etc and write letter out the wazoo phone calls don't always work but letter via email or fax do it never hurts i wouldnt get an attorney involved until the claim is denied by your insurance company call and write letters and bug the heck out of them Insurance Plame affair Plame affair timeline Karl Rove Surveillance SCO-Linux controversies Downing Street memo Life insurance Judith Miller (journalist) Pretty Good Privacy Killian documents Wal-Mart Health insurance 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Advance fee fraud Home repair Katelyn Faber Kitchen Mediation David Kelly Mortgage W.
