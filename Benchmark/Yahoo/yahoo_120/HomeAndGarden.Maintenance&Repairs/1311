what is the acrylic bar called in the bath tub where can i buy a new one help in my bathtub the acrylic bar in the tub you can use it to help get up out of the tub or you can hang a wash cloth over it i have googled it and cannot find it broke and we need a new one please help it isn't a grab bar or handicap bar it is plastic or acrylic and it comes standard in many showers it is a part of the shower encloser its call a grab bar or a handicap bar its usually made of metal though there are some acrylic you can find them in the bath section of home improvement over by toiletpaper holders and shower heads i understand what you mean now you mean the plastic rod that is molded into the tub surround itself well i never had to actually replace this however i called around to some plumbing supply places and they said whatever brand it was you can call the company directly but you may not know that most surrounds dont' have the name stamped on them or for that matter know the model number used my suggestion is to go to measure the lenght and the diameter needed go to homedepot and look in the bath isle where the tp holders and the towel bars are and look for the closest one you can find you may have to cut it down they can probably do it for you as well if you can't find an plastic or acrylic one your best bet may go to the wood trim section and they have wood dowels there you can easily cut this and just primer and paint with good waterproof paint now the real question is getting it to go in there when surrounds are installed they are flexible so you can bend back the surround and fit in it but with it already glued you may have trouble my suggestion is take and cut it to where you can stick one end as far in the hole as possible mark the other side tight as you can then cut it take some good silcone caulk and caulk both the holes insert one end fully into the hole then insert the other one making both sides equally distanced caulk around the dowel Drill bit Plastic Casting Upholstery Textile manufacturing Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Genericized trademark Gramophone record Bong Textile manufacturing terminology Strap-on dildo Knife Floppy disk Boat building Table saw View camera Internal ballistics Brush Domestic water system Guitar Violin Scale model Customs and etiquette of Japan Golf Professional wrestling match types Epoxy Laser engraving Deck (ship) Sundial Tire Pottery Manicure M16 (rifle) Slide rule Timpani Mattress Harmonica Sento Polymethyl methacrylate Dymaxion house Toilet paper Poker jargon Shoe Professional wrestling throws Hamster Japanese toilet Explosive material Diving regulator Menstrual cup The Inside Toilet Top-bar hive Optical fiber Swimming pool Acrylic paint Geodesic dome Billiards Cartridge (firearms) Glossary of nautical terms Hearing aid Glossary of American football Black hole United States Postal Service Stairway Canoe Bathing Swimming De Lorean DMC-12 Nudity Sauna Mouse (computing) Plumbing fixture Intraocular lens Dialysis Dinghy Bassoon Electrical wiring English longbow Door Firearm Go (board game) Professional wrestling holds Hot tub Nail (anatomy) Transformer Clarinet BS 1363 Non-native pronunciations of English Rigging Dice Glass
