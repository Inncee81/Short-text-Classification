how long does it take to paint a house or perhaps my question is am i being jerked around i hired a painting company and the crew manager said they would come out and powerwash on a friday and then start to paint on a monday jul no one showed up so he said wed then thurs then fri finally after complaining someone comes out to powerwash on jul painters come monday and work thru thurs the painters on his crew quit and it's now aug and my house is partially painted of course he says they are coming out tomorrow or the next day is this a typical housepainting experience i've never had a house painted before so i have no idea the contract only indicates the job to be completed in the summer but i find the drawing out the dates like that to be not very professional it's a national company by the way that hires college kids i'm a painting contractor and no this is not normal business practices most good contractors show up when they say they will weather permitting the weather can push the start time back also the weather can affect the start date after the pressure washing you normally need at least business days to let things thoroughly dry if your contract does not have a specific start and finish date then you might be at their will no matter how much you approve or disapprove of their business tactics if you haven't paid in full you could try to negoiate with them to finish quickly or drop them and hire somone else to finish the work did you get references Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina ITV Outsourcing New York Giants Efficiency wages Norway national football team Academic art Article One of the United States Constitution National Health Service Unemployment Oakland Athletics Calculating the day of the week Crew Exploration Vehicle Keynesian economics National Football League Wal-Mart Extreme Programming Carl Barks Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Ontological argument North Staffordshire Railway Michael D.
