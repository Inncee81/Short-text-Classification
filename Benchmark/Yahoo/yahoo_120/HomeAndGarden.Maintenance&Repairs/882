why don't my window air conditioners have any water vapor exhaust i installed window ac units throughout the house and none of them drain water out of the back of the units why i made sure that they were tilted back lower than front when i installed them they seem to be cooling fine and i can look through the vents in the rear outside the house and i see water accumulating on the bottom of the units but the water does not drip out two of the units are new what am i doing wrong thanks in advance there's absolutely nothing wrong the new higher efficiency units use the water that condenses on the inside coil to increase the efficiency by evaporating it on the outside coil a small change that increases efficiency and reduces that annoying drip unless it is very humid Air conditioning Thermal power station Autonomous building Solar power HVAC Dehumidifier Ocean thermal energy conversion Carburetor Swamp cooler Relative humidity Water vapor Brewery Furnace Heat exchanger Fog Evaporation Humidity Automobile emissions control Transformer Loudspeaker Automobile Steam engine Phase change heat pump Coffee Internal combustion engine Tesla coil Refrigerator Thermostat Turbocharger Irrigation Motor oil Spacecraft propulsion Water (molecule) Wind turbine Honda Prelude Pebble bed reactor Phase (matter) Mattress Bong Equine conformation Solar cell Fossil fuel power plant Suppressor Rocket fuel Hydroponics Radon Fire fighting Dodge Neon Jet engine Motorcycle Hydropower Town gas Cannabis cultivation Hyperthermia M16 (rifle) Heinkel He 100 Propeller Houseplant Rain Spark plug Tank Wind power Cloud Timeline of steam power Basement Ice Toyota Prius Axial compressor Electric motor Boiling point Adiabatic lapse rate Stoma Microphone Bicycle Casting Headlight SR-71 Blackbird Dry cleaning Fluorescent lamp Nuclear reactor Severe weather terminology (United States) Weather lore Computer cooling Greenhouse effect Environmental concerns with electricity generation Siphon Water Solar panel Volcano Alkane Helicopter Climate of the United Kingdom Tidal power Nuclear fallout Gas compressor King Khalid International Airport Alternating current
