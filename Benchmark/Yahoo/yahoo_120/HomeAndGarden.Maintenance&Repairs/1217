are circuit breakers safe breakers are as safe as fuses it is when people over load and over size wires and breakers fuses that a problems happen awg american wire gage is the size of wire the amp rating on wires is where the over loads come in wire amp wire amp wire amp etc however because a fuse or breaker trips you must not over sized the protection for the circuit wire it may very well be easier to put a wire on a amp fuse or breaker to make everything work however when you are watching the house burn down or holding a dead baby you will understand the reason for code and safety inspections try to be safe Fuse (electrical) BS 1363 Circuit breaker Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electrical wiring (UK) Residual-current device National Electrical Code (US) Distribution board Electrical wiring Operational amplifier Circuit design Ring circuit Alternating current Switch Short circuit Earthing system Relay Ampere Electrophysiology Voltage drop Transformer Electrician Hand grenade Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Three-phase electric power Lineman (occupation) Resistor Fuse (explosives) X10 (industry standard) American wire gauge Cruising (maritime) Thermal power station Capacitor Wire wrap Fireworks Europlug Power strip Space disaster Gas metal arc welding Ethernet Electrical breakdown Ground (electricity) Lightning rod Naval mine Oplan Bojinka Appliance classes Welding Handloading Printed circuit board Spark plug 2003 North America blackout Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Solar cell Rail terminology Electric motor Burglar alarm Apollo Guidance Computer Electronic amplifier Loudspeaker Battles of Lexington and Concord Overhead lines Nuclear fusion RS-232 Light switch Vacuum tube Incandescent light bulb Antenna (radio) CPU design Wire Tesla coil Current (electricity) Conductor (material) Cryptanalysis Seismic retrofit High-voltage hazards Swissair Flight 111 Pebble bed reactor Professional wrestling throws Firearm Computer Space Shuttle program Apollo 13 RISC Wildfire Embedded system CPU cache Telephone numbering plan Lac operon M60 machine gun Fire extinguisher Split phase Bass guitar Ignition system Aluminium Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Parachute Character encodings in HTML Compiler optimization
