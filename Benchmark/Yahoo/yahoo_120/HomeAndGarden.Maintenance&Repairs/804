clothes dryer runs but no heat everyone keeps telling me that a fuse may be blown in my dryer which is why it doesn't heat up the only fuse i'm aware of in a clothes dryer is a thermal fuse but people say to check the fuse panel and or circuit breaker i believe they're talking about the circuit breaker in my home but the power to the dryer is obviously fine a single outlet it's only the heating element that will not work i guess i'm asking if there are other fuses or if there's an internal circuit breaker inside a clothes dryer that i'm not seeing when i pull off the back panel the dryer is a whirlpool washer dryer combo lte d you have to first check the power getting or not getting to the dryer its uses two legs of v but they are out of phase with one another if one is not getting power to the dryer it will still run on the other leg but no heat the thermofuse is located on the heater element housing but may not be the problem dont guess just go to http appliancequickfix com and it will tell you how to check where the problem lies Fuse (electrical) Circuit breaker Residual-current device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Vacuum tube BS 1363 Three-phase electric power Transformer Ring circuit Thermal power station Solar power Spark plug Electrical wiring Washing machine Apollo Command/Service Module Heat Glossary of firefighting equipment Circuit design Nuclear weapon design Oplan Bojinka Fan (implement) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Armored Core Upholstery Carburetor Apollo 13 Oscilloscope Diode Power strip Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets National Electrical Code (US) Cruising (maritime) Nuclear fusion Relay Ford Ranger EV Glass Inertial confinement fusion Short circuit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Escape from New York Nuclear fission Little Britain Electrophysiology Sun Stirling engine Brewery Discovery One Japanese toilet Dishwasher Seismic retrofit Fire alarm control panel Fecal incontinence Basement Items in the Metroid series Loudspeaker Insulation Figure skating Diving suit Electrical wiring (UK) Solar collector Transistor Fire extinguisher Solar panel Electrical breakdown Autonomous building Ground and neutral The Isley Brothers Gliding Central processing unit Thermodynamic equilibrium Quantum computer Alternating current Earthing system Fossil fuel power plant Stellar evolution Ground (electricity) Hydraulic machinery Cold fusion Capacitor Space Shuttle external tank Professional wrestling throws Electric motor Carbon dioxide Late Night with Conan O'Brien Mars Exploration Rover Ceramics Tank Ohm's law Pottery Manhattan Project Vegeta Furnace Renewable energy Steam engine Hot air balloon Conductor (material) Paragliding Hemp
