we need our landlord to upgrade fix some stuff can he charge us for them our carpet was never replaced before we moved in we have a screen door that has been broken forever and we want to ask our landlord to put in a new working screen door and new carpeting we've been here for more than years and the carpets are so worn out and have a bunch of stains from the old tenant but can he charge us to get these done your landlord doesn't have to do anything for you and in fact this is one way to get rid of a tenant unless you have something in your lease that specifies that he has to change your carpet there's nothing you can do about it there's no such thing as a time limit anywhere that i know of usually when a new tenant moves in the carpets are cleaned that's it unless you specifically have something noted in the lease before moving in remember that magic words moving in and before usually the landlord can and will promise you certain things but can also keep you on a string by holding you off for sometimes years after all what should he go through the cost of a new carpet maintenance is another thing but if it's not life threatening you could wait for this too Leasehold estate Leasing Rental agreement Estoppel Carpet Waste (law) Manorialism Real property Sin City Eviction Serfdom Apartment Aladdin (1992 film) Housing cooperative Home repair Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Hubert H.
