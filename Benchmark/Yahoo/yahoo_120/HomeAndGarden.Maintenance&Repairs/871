what is the easiest way to figure out mark and cut a long radius on ceramic tile you will want to clamp the tile down on a piece of plywood then just use a string tied to a pencil that is nailed down to the plywood you can find the radius the same way just use something heavy to pin the end of the string and keep moving it around and adjusting the length of the string to match the radius of the object to be avoided is it concave or convex concave means you will cut from the center of the tile convex means that you will cut the corners away from the tile convex it the easiest because you simply cut relief cuts to the line cut little lines from the outside of the tile to the arc line these reduce the chance of breaking the tile and make cutting the arc possible for concave you will have to make a ton of relief cuts you will want to use a pair of nips to break away the extra without nipping too far towards the arc line then use the blade to smooth out the arc be careful and take your time on this one Tile Knife Collision detection Ulna Woodworking Glossary of graph theory Radius (bone) Drill bit Seismic retrofit Humerus Scapula Carpus Equine conformation Mattress Textile manufacturing Regular polytope Mandible Dominoes Sternum Polygon Tibia Lens (optics) Stairway Table tennis Amateur telescope making Manifold Welding Screw Convex Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry Avalanche Grind Geodesic dome Lawn mower Dinghy Circle Sword Space Shuttle program Mahjong B__zier curve TGV Parallax Eyepiece Sextant Temporal bone Violin Table saw Drawing Snooker Antenna (radio) Wallpaper group Plough Ra (board game) Tessellation Stage lighting Boat building Reflecting telescope Cissoid of Diocles M.C.
