how to keep food from burning on gas stove i have a very small gas stove inches wide the grates are very close to the flame i burn everything i cooked sauce tonight and i had the flame as low as i could get it before it went out the flame was the size of a baby pea even smaller it still burned and stuck to the bottom and this was only after min i also cannot use the flame on high becuase it will start to melt the handle of my small saucepans granted water boils in less than minutes hahahahaa the oven and broiler are great tho hmmm i love cooking with gas but you have to have the right cookware sorry to say but you might just have to go out and invest in better cookware you need something really heavy like cast to do a good job i use titanium it's horribly expensive but i only needed items a frypan small and large and two pots nothing will burn it them unless you are trying too hard have you tried a double boiler at least for sauces that would give you the added protection of the water don't even think about cooking on high stinky burnt handles aren't the answer i seem to recall my grandmother using a simmer ring perhaps one of those would help if nothing else it would move stuff up away from your grates lots of people don't like cast because of the weight check out your local salvation army you just might pick up some heavier cook ware at a low cost Cookware and bakeware Stove Portable stove Barbecue Wok Tofu Titanium Internal ballistics Kitchen Beverage can stove Fire fighting Thermal power station Gas metal arc welding Chili con carne Cuisine of Brazil Hand grenade Jet engine Cantonese cuisine Campfire Hot dog Hydrogen economy Cuisine of Denmark Fire extinguisher Steam engine Brewery Idli Welding Risotto M16 (rifle) Nabemono Magnesium French fries Knife Turbocharger Coffee Food preservation Ramen Casting Pottery Carbon dioxide Egg (food) Chopsticks French cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cooking Amateur telescope making Bengali cuisine Town gas Poker jargon Bicycle frame Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Food Diving cylinder Cuisine of the Philippines Cast iron RuneScape skills Pebble bed reactor Hot pot Stock (food) Equine conformation Mattress Haggis Two-stroke cycle Jewish cuisine Fondue Pressure cooking Japanese tea ceremony Hydrogen Illegal drug trade Yoghurt Water (molecule) Alcohol fuel Roux MRE Carburetor Microwave oven Pasta Pancake Team Fortress Classic Floppy disk Rocket fuel Japanese cuisine Handloading Firework Bullet Plastic Iron Glossary of firefighting equipment Roman eating and drinking Grill Turbojet Helium Ammonia Novelty (locomotive) Sauce
