year old standup freezer small crack in tube inside hello and thank you in advance just for reviewing this question i was defrosting my freezer when i noticed a crack in the aluminum tube that runs inside my freezer i've still got frost ice around it but i'm concerned and would like to repair it if possible i'm very handing and do most home repairs any thoughts you could find some epoxy glue that works best on aluminum at a hardware store but don't count on it that it will last forever the next crack or pinhole will develop possibly at a spot where you cannot get to it after years these appliances are pretty much finished that's why we see so many on the scrapyards everywhere when copper tubing was used in old refrigerators this problem didn't exist i've seen so many that are years old and still run like new and have never been repaired the factories would go bankrupt if the old reliable technology would still be used good luck with this Refrigerator Freezer Welding Printed circuit board Aluminium Integrated circuit Vacuum tube Major appliance Electric motor History of computing hardware 24 Hours of Le Mans Plastic Floppy disk M16 (rifle) Wind turbine Ice Epoxy Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Embedded system Kitchen Home repair Digital circuit Autonomous building Tofu CPU design Gas metal arc welding Central processing unit Bicycle frame Thermal power station Bong Electrical wiring Solar power Cryptanalysis Refrigeration Commodore 64 Windows XP Computer Heinkel He 112 Seismic retrofit RISC 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Casting Second Battle of the Atlantic Space elevator Heinkel He 100 Tank Brewery Dairy The Time Machine Combine (Half-Life 2) Screw Horseshoe Nuclear power Basement Glossary of climbing terms Windows 2000 Cruising (maritime) Linux Password cracking Cray-1 Extreme Programming Homebuilt aircraft Hard disk Debugging Self-replication Charles Goodyear Hydrogen economy Steam (content delivery) R46 (New York City Subway car) Carbon nanotube Atari ST Cookware and bakeware Computer virus Energy development Professional wrestling match types Scientology beliefs and practices Ko__ Holding Knife Moore's law Irrigation Unemployment Billboard Hot 100 Bluetooth PowerBook G4 Laserdisc Copy protection OS/2 Radio controlled airplane Reliability engineering Transistor IBM PC compatible Traser Ice core Bicycle lighting Internal ballistics Carnivorous plant X86
