why do the special needs get builled a lot i have a slight autism and always get bullied a lot at school it's like some people are going to make fun of the thing what i do on the class i hate the class i hate the lunch break too since it's the high time to get beaten or get cheated i've even ever get smashed some chows into my face when they noticed it was way too gross looks like they do consider the special needs as the disturbs who are just crazy and can't do every stuffs i can't also do sort of things so quick as everyone does and it looks like making them so mad and things sometimes go really bad it'll just cause to the discrimination i can see the special needs are pretty easy to get builled or ignored because of their unique ways of thinking or doing please help me out from under so i can be little positive i'm years old i'm in japan where do you live and how old are you i'm actually asking those two questions out of curiosity and i apologize for that but our local schools don't even let the children talk literally for the first half of their lunch period anyway talking to a counselor is probably a good idea but i'm not sure that will do too much good the hardest and most important thing for you to understand and remember is that some people have so little self confidence or self worth that they have to bully and insult others to give themselves a false sense of worth the only way they have to make themselves feel better about who they are is unfortunately to put someone else down understanding that they are the one with the problem not you may help you deal with the situation but most likely won't make it stop hurting good luck Social rule Kodocha Theory of conduct Great Teacher Onizuka Asperger syndrome The nature of God in Western theology Boston Public Spidey Super Stories 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shit Hip hop rivalries Time Out of Mind Poker jargon Autism Autism rights movement Pitaten Socrates The Ashlee Simpson Show The Fairly OddParents Goodness and value theory Microeconomics K' About a Boy Little Britain The Adventures of Pete & Pete Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ethics Cheating in Counter-Strike Columbine High School massacre Teen Girl Squad Bully Cheating in poker Political correctness Sydney Riot of 1879 Stuttering Domestic violence Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Recurring South Park characters Hey Jude Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Drama Bat Lash Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Avenue Q The Emancipation of Mimi 1957 World Series Shaggy dog story Craps The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Computer chess Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Scientology beliefs and practices Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters God Emperor of Dune Tenshinhan Current teachings of Prem Rawat Theodicy The Shining (film) Chess Logic Stanton Macdonald-Wright Atheism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Atomism Beat generation Garfield Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Full Metal Panic?
