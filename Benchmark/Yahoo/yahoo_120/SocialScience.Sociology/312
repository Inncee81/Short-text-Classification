why do many people confuse confidence w being snobbish everyone who meets me eventually tell me i thought you were a snob until i met you but you are one the nicest people i have ever met it makes me wonder what why and how i am projecting this imagine queenboudica was a queen of the brythonic celtic iceni people of norfolk in eastern britain who led a major uprising of the tribes against the occupying forces of the roman empire the nick only means i admire the queen and i enjoy history because they do not have confidence themselves so they have to assume that no one else does either keep your confidence and let people fall where they may in the end you are the only person who will determine the way of your life besides even if you are a bit of a snob there is nothing wrong with that unless you are belittling people who have simply not had the same chances you have i am a snob but only in the sense that i deplore people who do not make the most of their lives with whatever opportunities they see before them Iceni Brythonic languages Boudicca Celtic mythology History of Scotland Celt Snob Roman Britain Anglo-Saxons Britain History of England British Isles Bosniaks Vortigern Roman conquest of Britain Publius Ostorius Scapula Romano-British Chariot Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Welsh people Three Kingdoms Religious Society of Friends Valens Picts New York Knicks Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule Goodness and value theory Axis Powers Dumnonii Scouting Western Roman Empire Doomsday argument Slavic peoples President of Germany Canadian House of Commons Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Consensus decision-making Emperor Gengshi of Han UK National Government Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change British monarchy John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough History of Modern Greece Prehistoric Britain Battle of Watling Street Surrey Fallacy History of Germany Drama Celtic languages Aristotle History of Slovakia Transcendental argument for the existence of God Proto-Celtic language Margin of error Charles Dickens Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead Military history of Germany Head of state Theory of conduct King Arthur (film) History of Europe NBA Finals Timeline of ancient Rome Numerology Singidunum History of Wales Dark Ages Gaul Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II History of Palestine Mongol Empire Hungary Extreme Programming History of the Balkans Suffolk Greeks George III of the United Kingdom The African Queen Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism War of the Austrian Succession Mau Mau Uprising State Origin of Romanians Franks African American Vernacular English Christian eschatology Old King Cole Names of the Greeks Doug Simon Commission War of the Spanish Succession European dragon Tiberius Francis Crick Immanuel Kant
