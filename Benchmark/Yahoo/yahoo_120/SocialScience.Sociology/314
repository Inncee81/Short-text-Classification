am i the only one that gets misunderstood here for example if i ask what's a fun and safe way for a dog to ride in a vehicle several people mistook fun as romping around the vehicle well i looked at fun in this situation pleasant and enjoyable or if i ask about feminine products someone thinks that i use them when it's not that time of the month or if i ask about kids and toddlers they automatically think i have a kid it's gets very annoying to type in i don't have kids or if i ask about how to not be sensitive because my family hates it someone accused me of being a drama queen when that wasn't even true she thought that it's the way i react in that situation i do nothing when they insult me is that a drama queen why do people automatically assume and judge on here especially with me they're usually wrong suggestions on how to not get misunderstood anymore am i the only one i guess i don't know how to word my questions on here to prevent misunderstandings and unnecessary accusations take it easy darling don't take each answer comments seriously if you find the comment annoying just rate it td ignore the offensive comments and laugh at it there are so many people here on y a just to past their time and not being sensitive to the feeling of the asker i'm sure there are few answerer who will give you sensible answers Internet troll EastEnders Little Britain The Apprentice 2 Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct John Titor I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue The Catcher in the Rye Have I Got News For You Asperger syndrome The Smoking Room God Emperor of Dune Zhao Yun Plame affair Springfield Elementary School Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Jon Secada Friends Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Late Night with Conan O'Brien Fair use Whose Line Is It Anyway?
