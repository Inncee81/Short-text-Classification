is there any info on cultural religious and racial implications of patient care in the prehospital setting you need to be looking in the right places for this information i can only speak from experience in the uk but the health service is very aware that there are certain social cultural groups who shy away from medical treatment it is especially so in the asian community in britain this is sometimes due to language barriers sometimes down to religion muslim women not wanting to see male doctors etc and sometimes lack of education some ethnicities are more susceptible to certain illnesses than others for example west indians are more susceptible to high blood pressure and diabetes this should therefore be checked at every routine visit to a doctor to identify a problem early and medicate accordingly many social clubs groups etc for people of a certain ethnicity will have information displayed in relevant languages on posters and in leaflets at the community centre or wherever they meet sometimes social workers visit the homes of people they feel aren't getting the right medical care obviously this helps if the social worker can speak the same language as the client or has an interpreter present the family often offer to interpret but then we can't be sure the client has actually been given the correct facts it's an incredibly complicated issue and you need to research it thoroughly http www sciencedaily com releases htm http www kcl ac uk depsta ccm ccm stroke html http www rethink org about mental illness who does it affect black minority ethnic groups index html those will get you going it's very easy to research if you use the right keywords and look for different cultural centres where you live then when you find the local african american community centre or whatever sorry us uk language barrier try calling or visiting and ask ask what's done now to assist that particular ethnicity with medical care what could be improved how have things changed have they changed for better or worse speaking to people who devote their lives to helping people can only enrich yours best of luck Medicine Stroke World Wide Web Mental illness AIDS Bipolar disorder Coeliac disease Transsexuality Divorce Cross site scripting Race in biomedicine Autism Affirmative action Reparative therapy Sexual orientation HTML Traumatic brain injury Psychoanalysis Medical record Alcoholics Anonymous Chinese University of Hong Kong National Health Service Publicly funded medicine Hindu Chronic fatigue syndrome Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hearing impairment Insulin Nurse Crohn's disease Scientology beliefs and practices Prostate cancer Anorexia nervosa White (people) Jew Obesity Psychology Dissociative identity disorder Autism rights movement Aphasia Pneumonia Sigmund Freud Childbirth Hypoglycemia Social work Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Internet Chiropractic American Red Cross Psychiatry Hypnosis Diabetes mellitus Nationalism Clinical depression Stomach cancer Magical thinking Cornelia Rau Traditional Chinese medicine Health insurance Alzheimer's disease HyperText Transfer Protocol Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hypertension Education in the United States Baldness South Africa Asperger syndrome Cytomegalovirus Franz Boas Anti-psychiatry Adoption Hispanic Hikikomori Schizophrenia Religion Fecal incontinence Palliative care Who is a Jew?
