do you like this quote they say the worst cynics are frustrated idealist i got it from a book i just finished reading its called the kill clause by gregg hurwitz great book if you like action thriller's anyway that quote really stroke a cord with me i like it a lot what do you think of it i wanted to check out why that might be a quote used in that particular book so i looked the book up and i assume this was a quote believed by the vigilantes in the book i agree with the quote the justice system itself is not idealistic the belief of just punishment applied in a fair and balanced manner does not always occur as we see everyday in life if the justice system knows there is a strong possibility as in the case with tim rackley's daughter that the person is guilty how can a technicality set the person free an idealistic person who views the justice system favorably could defiantly become cynical under these circumstances that's when i make a collation between the words idealism and conformity in this complex world with complex minds to think that conformity and an idealistic view will placate things is defiantly a downfall many variants in the world impede idealistic thinking being an idealistic person in a broad sense will defiantly make you frustrated which breed s negativity this is quite obvious in many aspects in life and is felt by many in law enforcement many become alcoholics when their idealistic views are shattered those in law enforcement battle with wanting to uphold the law of the land the courts will prevail but they see that many crimes and conditions of individual people allow for an unjust outcome an outcome that doesn't mirror their idealistic thinking such as all criminals will go to jail only in a idealistic world will that happen or any judge can see a criminals guilt again only in an idealistic world this book sounds really interesting i think i will check it out i love suspenseful action crime thrillers i just read a wonderful book before and after by rosellen brown it's quite similar it's from the perspective of the family members involved they seem to live an idealistic life and that's shattered when they must battle with wanting to protect their son who is accused of murdering his girlfriend or turning him over to the justice system Social justice Capital punishment Due process Goodness and value theory Supreme Court of the United States Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Murder Slander and libel Predestination A Course In Miracles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Objectivist philosophy Appeal Civil rights Liberalism Plame affair Scientology beliefs and practices Coercion Originalism First Amendment to the United States Constitution Socrates Jury trial Unlawful combatant Fathers' rights Contract Crime International Criminal Court Capital punishment in the United States Property (ownership right) Patriotism Abortion debate Rape Alignment (role-playing games) Sin Epistemology Intellectual property Crime fiction Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Guilt Hugo Black Estoppel Domestic violence Ethics Ten Commandments EastEnders Freedom of speech Capitalism Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution Lawrence v.
