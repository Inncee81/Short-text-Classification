are doctors now lazy and don't care about patients hello doctor i've been having pain and discomfort in my entire body daily for about years now and some days it gets so bad that i can't get out of bed i have my good days but most of the time it's hard for me to function in daily life and i can't do all the things i want to do i also get headaches severe period cramps lightheadedness and fatigue i get sharp pains in my stomach and back that sometimes bring me to my knees i'm a pretty tough year old but have cried several times from the pain and feeling helpless also over the counter meds like tylenol and midol don t help me at all berry here's some paxil doc hello doctor i've had serious stomach problems for about years including sharp pains discomfort frequent gas diarrhea and constipation i eat healthy most of the time and don't eat fast food i think my stomach problems have resulted from my teenage partying phase where i drank and did drugs i have quit these bad habits but have continued to have problems berry here's some imodium ad doc i feel these doctors don t take me seriously and they just hand me a useless prescription without running tests asking me questions or even giving advice about diet and exercise or what could be causing my problems at such a young age are my problems too complicated and they don t want to deal with them do they think i m lying or imagining it where can i find good healthcare with a caring doctor who will take me seriously and actually try to help in the meantime i ve been self medicating with loritabs for over a year because it s the only thing i ve found that has eased my pain and made it so i can function and have a normal life this is a great question i once took a class from a social scientist edward shorter who mid career went to medical school got his m d and studied the doctor patient relationship he has a books out see below but one titled called doctors and their patients is particularly interesting it's a short rather quick read it is amazing what he finds to be true throughout the history of medicine western medicine the stuff you're talking about the history of medicine begins with the history of wealthy or at least high status white men though this is changing now trying to find out what is 'wrong' with white women though this is changing recently now that non white women are gaining access to medical care it only gets more interesting as i understand the history of medicine as presented in sociology of history courses the answers to your questions are likely to be as follows doctors often don't know how to take you seriously they are educated traditionally in chemistry and knowledge of pharmaceuticals but not in the doctor patient relationship or bedside manner most doctors are caught off gaurd at their first dealings with actual human beings because medical school has prepared them not for these social interactions but for finding pathogens so your doctor may be a caring person but may not actually be able to meet your complete needs as a patient and this is a large problem you are correct about the useless prescription these are used to calm patients down if you get very curious about this go to the library and compare dsm to dsm dsm is diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders the manual doctors use to diagnose different mental health problems the symptoms of a condition in dsm may be symptoms of an entirely new or different condition listed in dsm dsm is the more recent manual what these changes mean is that these mental disorders are at best constructed by modern medicine and are at worst made up compare these two things yourself what once was called hystrionic personality is now borderline personality disorder the histories of anorexia and hypogycemia are also very interesting according to another health researcher michael marmot diet and exercise are common unhelpful explanations of people's health as i see this explanation it is easy to blame a patient's health on the patient when focus is on diet and exercise i e it gets the doctor and anyone else off of the hook according to shorter at the time of his lecture in doctors will sometimes diagnose patients with 'somatization disorders' meaning that their ill health is all in their head it could be that your doctor thinks that you are creating this situation for yourself to find a doctor who takes you seriously call local clinics and tell the receptionist that you are 'looking to establish' with a doctor ask who is currently accepting patients and then ask to set an appointment with the doctors who are accepting patients you should not be charged for these appointments they take place in the doctor's office not the examining room keep in mind that this is not the time to share your medical history unless you are asked it is not the time to get an opinion or be diagnosed it is a chance for you to interview the doctor and find out about his her bedside manner how they intend to treat you make it clear to each doctor you visit with that you absolutely must be taken seriously and that you require attention to detail and elimination of all reasonable explanations as to your pain this means running tests these interviews will be very brief maybe minutes remember it's not an exam so let the doctor explain his her philosophy and bedside manner fyi according to shorter dizzy lightheaded and fatigued are red flags to doctors they really don't know what to do with this information and they are likely to diagnose a somatization disorder again see dsm and dsm for these interesting explanations if your symptoms are stemming from a depressing situation or condition a holistic psychologist or counselor might help you get a handle on greater causes of the conditions whew sorry so long but i hope it helps the books by shorter should be very enlightening i recommend them over the book by marmot but it's not bad either extemely sociological while the other two are historical A Course In Miracles Crohn's disease Insomnia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dieting Social psychology
