debate in society are writers and artists more important than the business people and mechanics this is more of an 'open debate' question in a functioning society nation do you think the writers painters and poets the arty intellectuals who humor and entertain are more important compared to the down to earth mechanical business people mechanics and engineers who actually build a nation or is it the other way round please try to avoid the both are equally important answer my two cents early man could indulge in the singing and painting only when he was safe secure had a roof cave over his head and had a full stomach with time to spare after hunting farming in a hypothetical scenario society would collapse without engineers and business people on the other hand life would be stable just a bit dry without artists and poets to the engineers feel free to express your views source of question www politicalcompass org test thanks for the answers and opinions everybody keep more coming in artists are definitely needed and help greatly with business and mechanics could an engineer really get away with not designing an illustration for his machine how would he communicate it sure he could show it but drawing a complex sketch with numbers and figures could greatly benefit whoever is trying to learn and others across long distances designing things is an art i little box with buttons drawn on a piece of paper won't help anyone also defining art would be good as for business people you could probably get along with a lot of math and statistical analyzing but in all fields of business you'd have to write things and communicate things which the average person could understand whether or not the business person can do this he'd still need a professional or his most unwanted pathetic skills you'd probably still need an editor for articles on business and new efficient ideas for the big businesses how would business need artists well i'd say that if a business centered around magazines you'd definitely need some kind of artist oh and remember that a painting is worth a thousand words answer society could not function one without the other Software engineering Intelligent design Microeconomics Software testing Mathematics Goodness and value theory Sexual orientation Computer Art Modernism Science Copyleft Photography Requirements analysis Thermodynamics Graphics W.
