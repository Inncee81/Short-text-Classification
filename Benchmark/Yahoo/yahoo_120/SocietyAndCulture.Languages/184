proper way to get a japanese name for an english person so a couple of friends of mine and myself are teaching ourselves japanese support group kinda thing and have people to talk to we've got cds books websites videos in japanese all kinds of stuff the question came up on what to call each other well we've all got quite western names shawn chris and david after short looking we found these two sites http www japanesetranslator co uk your name in japanese http www yournameinjapanese com one creates phonetic versions of the names in katakana another attempts to create the name in kanji as we are practicing our writing as well as speaking and reading we want to have accurate versions of our names to practice with are the outputs of these generators accurate also would it be proper socially to pick a more japanese sounding name what would be the best process for that like somebody moving to america and picking the name john smith your name would never ever be in kanji you're foreigners your name is foreign so it would be in katakana which is what the first link does and accurately too it's just proper to stick to your own name if you went to japan and introduced yourself with a japanese name you would cause a bit of confusion as to why you a westerner with probably no asian heritage has that name Japanese name Katakana Kanji Furigana Chinese character R__maji Japanese writing system Hanja Chinese language Transcribing English to Japanese Hepburn romanization Mahjong Kana Pok__mon (anime) World Wide Web Ideogram Chinese calligraphy HyperText Transfer Protocol Japan International Phonetic Alphabet Hangul Otaku Ruby character Okurigana Cross site scripting Crossword Aikido Culture of Japan Diacritic English plural Hiragana Compact disc Rich Mullins Negima Finnish language Haiku History of Japan Toyo kanji Karaoke Vietnamese language Non-native pronunciations of English Wget Japanese mobile phone culture Confucius Chinese written language Super Nintendo Entertainment System Uniform Resource Locator Learning kanji Speech synthesis Languages of Hong Kong Punctuation Hebrew language Yu-Gi-Oh!
