what about hockey makes you love the game so much i know there's so much to love i'm a young guy and i read this somewhere and thought it was perfect most people just see the outside but i wrote this as i really thought about what i wanted a lot of people wonder why i do what i do its because of days spent on the ice crazy parties i missed weekend hang outs blown hours of hard work tons of sweat never ending plane rides late night bus trips not getting the girl because you didnt have enought time to spend with her at times wanting to give it all up being on the road for your birthday leaving the day after christmas for some tournament missing school vacations and summer break to try out for teams moving to a different state just because the teams better tears blood shed broken bones snapped twigs trying to explain your game to your friends at school who have no idea what youre talking about losing friends because u have practice the day of their birthday would i change any of it no way why because theres no better feeling in the world than when u come back to the bench and your family not your parents and sister but your brothers who r there to congratulate u after a sweet dangle then a snipe or a sick dish hangin out with your buddies in the locker room hotel or just chillin at the rink sharing let downs and set backs with your teammates because the reward for that big win will be so much better lookin forward to tournaments so you can see some of your best friends who live thousands of miles away and then beat the shit out of them in the corners for a loose puck to set up your teammate in front of the net for the game winner in overtime you can tell these guys anything because you know they feel the same way and wont tell anyone people wonder why we do it its because when youre at the rink thats the time when nothing else matters the only thing you think about is how to beat the defenseman or what your coach is yelling at you to do but all of this is done so that one day we might be able to lift that trophy maybe the national championship four nations cup a gold medal at the olympics or maybe that dream of one day being handed the stanley cup after you've battled for games and then game playoff set after another thats why i do it it's kinda long but worth it to read sidney crosby of the pittsburgh penguins he might just break some of wayne gretzk'y records think of gretzky's goals in one season is that an achievable goal maybe not how about his assists in a season quite possible if evgeni malkin plays with him on the same shift all the time gretzky's points is a very realistic goal only if the penguins can run up the score like those oilers did it's highly unlikely the penguins will ever score goals in season like the oilers did in but if crosby's ice time increases to say something like minutes a game and plays the pk then yes its quite possible that some of gretzky's records are in jeopardy thats what i love about sid the kid we are living through history right now don't miss it other things i love about hockey bodychecks and wizardry with the puck gotta love the finesse combined with the bone rattling hits overtime in playoff hockey especially double triple or even quadruple overtime those games are fun hot dogs and beer at the game i know they are expensive but big deal if you go to the game why not enjoy yourself and eat something special and i don't mean munching on peanuts lol beer and hot dogs are perfect for any hockey game women dancing showing pierced belly button at the game and their boobs jumping up and down now that is appealing especially when your team is up and the girls are gone wild lightens up the atmosphere Pittsburgh Steelers FA Cup New York Islanders Cincinnati Bengals Miracle on Ice World Series Cleveland Browns Buffalo Sabres Edmonton Oilers St. Louis Blues (hockey) Overtime (ice hockey) Mark Messier 1987-88 NHL season Playoff National Hockey League rivalries Sports timeline Norway national football team Washington Capitals NBA Finals Calgary Flames Gordie Howe Hartford Whalers Poker jargon Philadelphia Flyers Miami Dolphins Jarom__r J__gr New England Patriots Art Ross Memorial Trophy 1988-89 NHL season Goal (ice hockey) Playoff format International League Michael Jordan Vancouver Canucks National Football League Colorado Avalanche Carolina Panthers Raymond Bourque December 2004 in sports October 2005 in sports Ty Cobb Atlanta Flames Jari Kurri ESPN25 Al Michaels January 2005 in sports Volleyball National Hockey League All-Star Game Alex Ferguson Super Bowl XXVII Shawn Michaels Rugby union San Jose Sharks 2002-03 NHL season Blackburn Rovers F.C.
