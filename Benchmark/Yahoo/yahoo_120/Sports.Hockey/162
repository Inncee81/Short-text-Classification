more inter conference rivalries what do you think this seems like a moving target and thousands of opinions but either way i say that the current schedule is setup too heavily in favoring playing teams in one's division too many times what if played every team in opposite conference twice h a games play every team in own conference but not division times h a games play every team in division times games total of i know your first argument is that there wouldn t be enough rivalries within the division but you d breed a better playoff team wouldn t you first the game series within a division would make it easier to determine a tie breaker plus you d have a better gauge gage for how healthy a team is because they ve played a nice robust slice of the other nhl teams the standings would speak for themselves you wouldn t be caught up in arguments about who s better a team would be measured against its success against a better representative slice of the entire nhl not just its division besides i m sick of always seeing the same teams times a year while we don t get to even see some of the best teams in the nhl at all for any given year what do you think you'd also standardize and protect against paper division champions who get stomped on during the playoffs and you d also justify w the seed may have a lower point total than the seed because they were the best of their division in playing the whole nhl sgoldperson reminds me of something that i had forgotten to write it would also help balance the difference between the east s and west s travel schedule the east has the luxury of staying within their own time zone and traveling relatively less thus one could argue that their endurance is not tested as much great idea i like it i think there are too many games within the division it's meant to drive ticket sales the odd number of home and away games within the division can be influenced by the season record between the teams or it could alternate from year to year nice job Playoff National Hockey League National Football League Playoff format National Basketball Association New York Giants Boston Bruins Los Angeles Kings 2002-03 NHL season Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Bengals 2003-04 NHL season New York Knicks 1987-88 NHL season Montreal Canadiens New York Rangers San Jose Sharks Cleveland Browns National Hockey League All-Star Game Detroit Red Wings 2005-06 NHL season Mario Lemieux Wild card Chicago Blackhawks Calgary Flames San Francisco Giants New York Americans Toronto Maple Leafs Miami Dolphins Ottawa Senators International League National Hockey League rivalries Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Kansas City Chiefs 2004-05 NHL lockout Philadelphia Flyers New York Yankees St. Louis Cardinals New England Patriots Buffalo Bills Houston Astros Hartford Whalers 1988-89 NHL season Bowl Championship Series Chinese Basketball Association Edmonton Oilers NBA Finals Oakland Athletics St. Louis Rams Carolina Hurricanes Wayne Gretzky Ice hockey Houston Rockets Philadelphia Eagles Washington Capitals New York Jets Super Bowl XXXI Bundesliga (football) Atlantic Coast Conference The Football League Indiana Pacers American football Indianapolis Colts New York Islanders Super Bowl Qu__bec Nordiques Buffalo Sabres Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXII Monday Night Football Donovan McNabb College football Super Bowl XXVII Nashville Predators New Jersey Nets Baseball 1924-25 NHL season 1918-19 NHL season Oakland Raiders Tampa Bay Lightning American Football League Chicago Bulls Sudden death Boston Red Sox 1992-93 NHL season 2005 World Series Atlanta Flames Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.
