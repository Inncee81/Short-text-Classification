my hockey try outs are coming up how to get in shape ok well hockey season is coming up and i dont play any summer sports andi didnt take any camps o great i just dont wanna be stuck on the c team cus i was out of shape during the tryouts what should i do to get ready a good way to exercise is through running and jumping rope running increases your stamina endurance and agility while jumping rope helps build up your leg muscle shoulders and it gets your breath going a good exercise program is jumping rope fast and till you get to and then putting it down and doing suicides if you don't know what suicides are they are when you start at point a run to point b back to a to point c to a to point d and finally back to point a again this will really get your blood going if you can it will also be a good idea to lift some weights of course any on ice time you can get really helps go to a public skate and do sprints or something your usually allowed to skate backwards and do sprints at center ice away from everyone else hope this helped and good luck Ice hockey Figure skating Weight training 1957 World Series Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling throws Roller hockey Baseball Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling holds Winter Olympic Games Professional wrestling aerial techniques Sprint (race) Dog agility Swingout Breaststroke Butterfly stroke Suplex Professional wrestling attacks Swimming Tour de France Sailing Triathlon Volleyball Roller skating Glossary of climbing terms Germany at the 2004 Summer Olympics Horse Vancouver Canucks Pole vault DDT (professional wrestling) Baseball Stars Wayne Gretzky Sport Sports timeline New York Giants National Hockey League Powerbomb Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Inline speed skating Playoff Field hockey Suicide methods Miracle on Ice Diving Goaltender Sport rowing National Hockey League All-Star Game Stanley Cup Boxing Marching band Mario Lemieux Mark Messier Adventure racing American football Naruto jutsu Rink hockey SM-liiga Speed skating Professional wrestling slang Pittsburgh Steelers Fanny Blankers-Koen Floorball Athletics 1988 Winter Olympics Rugby union positions Artistic roller skating Olympic Flame Netherlands at the 2004 Summer Olympics Al Michaels Ice skating Climbing equipment FC Rostov Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Front crawl Indian Oil Cup 2005 Knife Skateboarding Canoe Goal (ice hockey) Gymnastics Muscle Grand Forks, North Dakota Los Angeles Kings Backstroke Clean and jerk Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Archery Ski 1896 Summer Olympics Curling Rugby union Anchor Cleveland Browns English cricket team
