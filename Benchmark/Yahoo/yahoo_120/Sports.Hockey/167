what's your opinion how many more years does brodeur have please give when he leaves who will be the perennial fav for the vezina since he seems to be in the top every year um patrick roy has already retired not sure what you meant you can't have s last time i checked my math i give him more years the loss of his marriage and the legal troubles his family had seemed to have weighed on him this year you saw flashes of the old brodeur with shutouts but at times he looked withdrawn and human i think the year off wasn't enough for him but roy is still all time i see roberto luongo and mikka kippursoff battling for that vez maybe budaj and fukufuji battling for darkhorse Vezina Trophy William M.
