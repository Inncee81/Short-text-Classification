is it ok to use in oil to lube a road bike chain some say it attracts a lot of dirt i would prefer to use a lube specially designed for bike chains myself but you can use a in most likely it will attract some more dirt then the actual bike lube depending on what where you're riding a buddy of mine used wd one day because he needed some lube and didn't have anything else handy he went on a ride through the dusty socal mountains and his chain was gummed up pretty good by the time the ride was over i used some actual bike chain oil and just had a light coating of dust on my chain if you're roading it and dirt dust grime isn't really a concern well go for it just make sure you let it dry up pretty good before you ride so it's not so sticky for crap to get on the chain Mountain bike Bicycle Mountain biking Motorcycle Bicycle frame Strap-on dildo Bicycle lighting Recumbent bicycle Bike lane debate Thermal power station Plastic Cycling Snowboarding Derailleur gears Single-speed bicycle Motor oil Time Out of Mind Charles Goodyear BMX 2-stroke power valve system All-terrain vehicle Wok Segregated cycle facilities Six Flags Over Texas Motorcycle racing Izzy Stradlin Lance Armstrong Racing bicycle Burning Man Trail Timeline of alternative rock Tour de France Whistler-Blackcomb Utility cycling Tobacco Motocross Vehicular cycling Vulcanization 1989 Tour de France Cosmic dust Road Rash Bicycle touring Road The Haunted Mansion Dust Mountain bike racing Eyepiece Chewing gum Lighting Dawson Creek, British Columbia Carbon fiber Cycle path debate Calgary, Alberta Beverly Hills, California Energy development Henry W.
