what is the best type of bike for city riding and what kind of bike would you recommend i buy i don't really have the money to replace my bike but i will be using it every day soon and i want to have something road worthy i may start looking for used but i need help deciding what to look for i like need a comfort saddle like the kind you find on specialized comfort bikes i like to lean forward a bit not ride in upright position i ride in the city on pavement that is smooth but for they occasional crack or bump sometimes i ride hard and i desire performance i use my bike for exercise and less often transportation though that may be changing i enjoy my current ride a cheap specialized hybrid comfort mountain but it's kind of boring not enough balls i might say specific models would be great but keep the msrp under not enough balls i might say then you are looking for a road bike if your tendency to lean forward over the bars is pronounced enough then you will find the 'drop' racing type handlebars should suit your riding better than the more upright hybrid style which are in essence much like those for touring and commuting be sure to determine what your correct frame size is for a road bike there is no substitute for going to a bicycle shop and having some hands on help for this if you are in the process of shopping around you can ask for this sort of assistance without the obligation to buy be sure to engage them fully and give them a chance to show you their bikes they deserve your attention even if you are sure that you are not quite yet ready to buy you will learn from all of this so don't shortchange yourself here your budget may require looking for a deal on a quality used road bike as is usually slightly below a good new entry level model and the parts from your current bicycle cannot simply be switched over onto a new or used road frame however there are several models of new bicycles available at this level also ride quality is a consideration aluminum frames are lighter but undeniably a bit harsher and less forgiving of road shock if you are not serious about racing you may find that a good steel framed bicycle suits you better after all even for exercise discomfort will affect motivation and make your riding less enjoyable you did not mention whether you prefer to keep your current bicycle if you can sell your current bike and add the proceeds to your budget then at to some decent road bicycle models become feasible also in one month many dealers will start looking to clear out inventory as the peak summer season ends don't overlook this you can save to if you buy at the right time that said for a basic road bicycle with a good ride and a price that can't be beat from a good manufacturer try the jamis ventura sport which at msrp 'street' is the lowest price for a decent road bicycle that isn't no name when buying a bicycle keep in mind that while you can upgrade the components over time replacing a frame usually means replacing a bike so your wisest purchase is for a better frame with lesser components as opposed to the other way around there are 'overstock' discounted prices a bit cheaper that can be dug up on deals which you can find on the 'net for 'off brand' bikes but not where you can go into a shop and test ride one spending a bit more does get you more you should at least try test riding a steel bike to feel how it rides one bicycle that has received glowing reviews for ride quality is the jamis satellite msrp 'street' price bianchi's brava is worth mentioning here with a steel frame and msrp of sorry it's those exchange rates pushing this one up a bit 'street' price will be less in aluminum framed bicycles examples of good models to look for include the jamis ventura comp msrp 'street' and the specialized allez msrp 'street' the basic not the elite or sport a good deal will bring this one down into your price range trek's entry in this range is the an alpha model msrp 'street' a good bicycle purchase will remind you of how good or bad it is every ride for years the time and effort expended here is well worth it Mountain biking Microeconomics Bicycle lighting Poker jargon Equine
