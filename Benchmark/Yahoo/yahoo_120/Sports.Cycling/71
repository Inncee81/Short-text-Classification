how do i turn my mountain bike into a road ready bike i have a mountain bike which i used to use off road but lately i've been doing more and more distance road biking i know road bikes are lighter and easier to ride on streets than mountain bikes but i'm on a budget and can't afford a whole new bike at the moment are there any adjustments i can make to my mountain bike to make it more road efficient i e certain tires new seat etc or am i better off forking up the cash for a new road bike st answer is absolutely correct you can get to road tires for your mtb if you want to ride both dirt and street often get a second set of wheels tubes and cassette get light weight wheels and use for your road wheels since weight etc can't be changed without a lot of the only other major improvement would be to lock out any suspension you have most forks don't have lock outs but some do if your mtb is set up for racing or high performance riding then seat pedals etc should be good to go if you change out lots of stuff you might as well buy a another bike personally i have road and mtb i still have road wheels for the mtb for when i putz around the 'hood with my kids or run up to the store etc Mountain bike Bicycle Bicycle frame Mountain biking Racing bicycle Recumbent bicycle Bicycle brake systems Tire Bicycle lighting Car handling Drag racing Drifting (motorsport) Cycling Bicycle wheel Radio controlled car Single-speed bicycle Triathlon Mazda RX-7 Chopper (motorcycle) Bike lane debate Cyclo-cross Suspension (vehicle) Automobile Honda CX series BMX Chevrolet Corvair De Lorean DMC-12 Fixed-gear bicycle Snowboarding Bike trials riding Sport utility vehicle Tractor Transportation of Los Angeles Dodge Neon Wheelbase Cannondale Bicycle Corporation Skateboarding trick Derailleur gears Caterpillar track Porsche 928 Tour de France Handloading Bulk vending Personal rapid transit Shock absorber Equine conformation Lance Armstrong Manual transmission BMW motorcycles Mountain unicycling Penny-farthing Utility cycling Lincoln LS Bicycle pedal Tank Formula One cars Car safety Truck Passenger car Sports car Dodge Charger Binoculars Solar car Time Out of Mind Wheel of Fortune Panzer I Honda Prelude Segregated cycle facilities Mountain bike racing Paragliding Valentino Rossi Rail terminology M16 (rifle) Shimano Hydrogen economy Mitsubishi 3000GT Grand Forks, North Dakota Semi-trailer Formula One regulations Timpani NASCAR Anti-lock braking system Lamborghini Diablo Road Track bicycle Hybrid vehicle Four wheel drive Skateboard Specialized Bicycle Components Stryker Graeme Obree Mercedes-Benz A-Class
