anyone who knows about tireflys can i put them on my bike and ride on the sidewalk because i know they're not street legal but are they sidewalk legal put them on your bike ride on the street the package does say that they are not for street use which is ridiculous i own a pair for my mountain bike and use them both on off road i figure that anything i can do to make myself more visible to drivers is a very good thing they actually alternate red white blue so they are quite patriotic and if a cop has the audacity to ticket a person for having lights on his tires then there's a real problem make sure you get a good bright tail light for your bike as well as a headlight don't do anything stupid and you'll be fine have fun Transportation of Los Angeles Bicycle lighting Mountain bike Bike lane debate Vehicular cycling Bicycle Motorcycle Street light Mountain biking Drag racing Milpitas, California Bicycle frame Lane Bogot__ Bike trials riding Headlight Recumbent bicycle Lighting Racing bicycle Jaywalking Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Honda CX series Curb extension Cycling Street Mountain bike racing Paul Is Dead Critical Mass Segregated cycle facilities Traffic light Bicycle brake systems Light-emitting diode The Beatles discography Public transport Automatic number plate recognition Utility cycling Docklands Light Railway Parallax Color Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Transportation in Portland Road safety Triathlon Escalator Dodge Charger Police car Automotive lighting Montgomery Bus Boycott Surveillance Canadian slang Cyclo-cross Tag Bicycle helmet Driver's license Reservoir Dogs Cambridge, Massachusetts School bus Ocean Beach, New York Honda Ascot Australian words Mazda Miata CIE 1931 color space Burning Man Sport utility vehicle Joke Automobile Level crossing Sin City Pedestrian crossing Lance Armstrong Car handling Russian joke Transport in Hong Kong Dragon Booster Freeway Calvin and Hobbes Snowboarding Volkswagen Golf Bicycle messenger John Hancock Tower Motocross Ford Thunderbird New Zealand at the 2004 Summer Olympics Burrard Street Bridge Lechaina Light pollution Microeconomics Driving Whistler-Blackcomb West Side Highway Ottawa O-Train Bocas del Toro Province Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Social rule Vancouver Anamorphic widescreen Skateboarding trick Rosa Parks Sonic the Hedgehog Streets of SimCity
