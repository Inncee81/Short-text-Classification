what is the difference between a fitness and bike and a road bike i am a regular mountain biker but like to road ride too however my full suspension is way too much drama for the pavement and even my hardtail is too heavy for efficient road travel i want something lighter and better suited the problem is i am not super fond of the feel of road bikes i saw that trek my fave had fitness bikes and urban bikes and i am wondering if anyone can tell me what are the advantages disadvantages to choosing a fitness or urban bike over a road bike thanks just to add a fitness bike is not a stationary bike it is an actual style of bicycle like urban road mountain triathalon etc i was just hoping that someone had some info on what might be better suited for me thanks to anyone who can help okay here goes a road bike is a race inspired design it has you in an attack position the whole time regardless of how you place your hands on the bars the frames are much lighter than mtbs and the tires are much thinner as well obvious what is not completely obvious is the change in the riding position the seatpost is higher and the stems hb is positioned so that you are more erect but arched forward as well the hybrids aka fitness bikes urban bikes are basically a mixture of mtb and road bikes they are using the geometry of mtb but the concepts ideals of a road bike the wheels on a hybrid are cc which is similar to a road bike but the tire size is actually a little bit wider and thicker instead of it is the riding position is similar to that of a mtb with a little more relaxed feeling and not an attack position the components actually go both ways some models have mtb components while some have road bike components that depends however on how high of a model you get some also have carbon fiber distributed throughout the frame fork while others are fully rigid sometimes you'll find a suspension seatpost but on fitness bikes it is usually a rigid fork weight wise the hybrids range from lbs but are actually surprisingly fast trek giant specialized cannondale and a couple others all offer hybrids now pros hybrids are cheaper and have the same basic concept of getting from point a to point b quickly but comfortably but still a nice ride to work out with the geometry is very similar to a mtb faster than mtb not much maintenance required if you take care of it cons not as light as a road bike components can be cheapy if not purchasing a good model can be as expensive as road bikes if purchasing a good model i have both mtb's and road bikes and i love both i just love to ride regardless of what bike it is however there is a huge difference between the two if you just want to get from point a to point b i say get a hybrid if you want a cardio work out and get huge legs get a road bike it took me a while to break down and buy a road bike i owned only mtbs for years but decided to finally give it a shot after starting to work at a bike shop i like both but nothing beats mtbs go to a dealer and try them both out hybrids and road bikes ride it for a while and see if you can see yourself getting comfortable on a road bike if not your choice is pretty much made up if so well questions questions questions and price price price good luck mate Bicycle brake systems Bicycle lighting Cycling Recumbent bicycle Sport utility vehicle Car handling Tire Utility cycling Cannondale Bicycle Corporation Jet engine Equine conformation Mattress M16 (rifle) Single-speed bicycle Strap-on dildo Dodge Charger Tank Loudspeaker Microeconomics Schwinn Bicycle Company Honda CX series Toyota MR2 Space elevator Chopper (motorcycle) Bike lane debate Cyclo-cross Triathlon Bicycle helmet Carbon fiber Automobile Radio controlled airplane Hybrid vehicle Toyota Camry Bicycle wheel Drill bit 24 Hours of Le Mans Floppy disk Wind turbine Chevrolet Corvette Floyd Rose Porsche 911 CPU design Diesel engine Public transport Aluminium Anchor Specialized Bicycle Components Turbocharger Toyota Prius M4 Sherman Gas metal arc welding Vehicular cycling Golf club (equipment) Trail Personal rapid transit Badminton Airsoft Luminiferous aether Pickup truck Mitsubishi 3000GT Douglas DC-8 Motocross Chevrolet Corvair Panzer II Ford Thunderbird Ford Ranger EV Heinkel He 112 Guitar Battery electric vehicle BMW Digital photography Tiger I Rear wheel drive Radio controlled car Laserdisc Pebble bed reactor T-72 Species Segregated cycle facilities
