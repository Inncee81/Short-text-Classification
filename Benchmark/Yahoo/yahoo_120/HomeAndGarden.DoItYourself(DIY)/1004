hvac converting a r ac over to new r freon can it be done by changing out orifice in the m coil i have a yr old rheem ton central air the m coil is leaking and needs to be replaced can i put in a new coil with a r orifice and convert it over while still using the same compressor i would prefer a licensed hvac tech answer who has done it before thanks debbie thanks for the compliment john always good to hear from other trade people i gave the best answer to orak since he had some info on the queston i found out that the new freon is a instead of c carrier calls it puron i wanted to get an idea if i could get away wothout replacing the whole unit the ac guys that i deal with wanted to completely replace everything including the two lines that connect the compressor and condenser i wanted to find out if they were jerking my chain finallly thanks for all the answers and taking time out to say hi i do appreciate it the next time this happens with the ac then i'll just change it out myself and get a vacuum pump and evacuate the system put in a whole new system with the new freon thanks again from the gentron distributor of refrigerants site http www honeywell com sites sm chemicals genetron refrigeration cat b fb a ddc e e ab a c a e fdc e d htm b fb b a a e e ab a c a e fdc e d htm relative to r there is little to no capacity decrease with genetron c making it easy to use in r equipment designs however some loss of efficiency may occur and some equipment modifications will be required when retrofitting these systems to genetron c for retrofitting r systems the equipment manufacturer should be consulted for their specific guidelines for r c genetron c has been designed as a substitute for r but it is not a drop in replacement mineral oils used with r are immiscible with genetron c service technicians should consult the original equipment manufacturer for the recommended lubricants and retrofit guidelines genetron c is a blend of hfc hfc and hfc a should always be charged in liquid phase and reclaimed r c should be tested for proper composition before use why can't you replace the id coil with an r coil you will need to contact the original equipment manufacturer to see what size piston and indoor coil will be compatible with the new refrigerant and if your existing od unit is compatible with the retrofit to be frank whenever i approach a machine and see rheem ruud on the label my heart sinks and i think p o s they're cheaply assembled poorly engineered and prone to problems and when problems do occur they are incredibly difficult to remedy if it weren't for intertherm and coleman r r would be the worst product available call your distributor and ask if they have a freight damaged carrier they can sell for less if you have to go chlorine free go with the a fractionated refrigerants are a royal pain when leaks occur keep kool Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Residual-current device Three-phase electric power Vacuum cleaner BS 1363 Electrician Apartment Lineman (occupation) Thermal power station Upholstery Carbon dioxide Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program National Electrical Code (US) Kitchen The Brady Bunch Pimp My Ride Cheating in poker SOS Flush toilet Power line communication Banjo-Tooie Mitsubishi 3000GT Japanese toilet Chevrolet Corvair Department store Hitchhiking Sears Holdings Corporation Knife Solar power Prostitution in Germany Starbucks Electrical wiring (UK) Drywall Bad Wolf Gay bathhouse Outlet mall Dimmer Hydrogen economy Sento Wallpaper group Central heating Renewable energy Paper Cruising (maritime) Transformer Irrigation Electrical wiring Basement Nuclear power Sonic the Hedgehog 2 F-104 Starfighter Beachwear Breathing gas Tasmania In-N-Out Burger War of Currents Rose (Doctor Who) Alcoholic beverage Glossary of firefighting equipment Japanese administration in Manchukuo Unsafe at Any Speed Campfire Charles Goodyear Lighting Three Mile Island Compiler optimization Power cable High-voltage direct current Ground and neutral Ford Crown Victoria Split phase Circuit breaker Glastonbury Festival Wynn Las Vegas Luck Eaton's Ring circuit Water turbine Royal Ordnance Factory Attack on Pearl Harbor Nuclear reactor The Dukes of Hazzard Toilet Japanese tea ceremony Wind turbine Conan the Destroyer Clamp meter Food court Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Gliding Tom Leykis Oh My Goddess!
