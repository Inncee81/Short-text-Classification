can i use florcent bulbs with a dimmer switch short answer is no there are some special florescent fixtures that you can use with dimmers you can sometimes buy special ballasts to replace those in standard fixtures that will allow for dimming also some of the compact florescent bulbs will work on a dimmer they are harder to find and you do have to check to make sure even with these special ballasts or bulbs some dimmers will not work so you have to check the requirements there as well these options are generally expensive and do not give off the same amount of light as a standard florescent at the same wattage Lighting Dimmer Stage lighting Incandescent light bulb Fluorescent lamp Compact fluorescent lamp Headlight Bicycle lighting Light-emitting diode Reef tank Electrodeless lamp Mercury-vapor lamp Transformer DMX (lighting) Light switch Pulse-width modulation Strap-on dildo X10 (industry standard) Light pollution Street light BASIC programming language History of street lighting in the United States Clifford algebra Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Diablo II: Lord of Destruction System/34 Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Houseplant Color temperature Pickup truck Wayne Corporation Poker jargon System/36 Floppy disk Switch Slide rule Windows 2000 Crossword Airbus A380 Aluminium Cannabis cultivation Traffic light Rotor machine Diode Rail tracks Quiz Call Railway signal Embedded system Digital photography Oxygen sensor DVD Taikyoku shogi Windows XP Wheel of Fortune Vacuum tube Ethernet CPU cache Lightbulb joke Handloading Betting (poker) Amstrad CPC Sail-plan Elevator Dim sum Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Electric motor Lattice (order) Bus models used in New York City Transit Toyota Prius Sailing ballast Modem Halting problem Dual gauge Tri-Stat dX Pocket cruiser Draw poker Prostate cancer Lithic flake Mutual fund Leica United States Postal Service Compact disc Enterprise content management Rail terminology School bus I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Stomach cancer Onion Nonblocking minimal spanning switch FairTax Monetary policy Gramophone record Predictive dialer The Amazing Race Screensaver Compact audio cassette Binoculars Drag racing Tire
