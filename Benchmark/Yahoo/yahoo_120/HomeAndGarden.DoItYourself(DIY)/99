creative way to hang pics i want to hang up pics of friends and family in my room but none of them are framed and i dont want to frame them any creative ideas as to what i can put them on to fasten to my walls why not make a collage with them overlapping some of the pics so as to not have them looked all squared and rigid but giving a certain sense of disorder and maybe put a cardboard base behind them so as to protect them from getting bent or damaged of course the cardboard should not be visible it's just to reinforce the back side of your collage then hang it on the wall with a nail it shouldn't be heavy so a nail on top should be enough or maybe even another one in the lolwer part to make sure it stays fixed Wrench Bong Siphon Screw Domestic water system Plumbing fixture RuneScape Mini-Games Diamond Flush toilet Glossary of firefighting equipment Basement Soldering Professional wrestling throws RBMK Ocean thermal energy conversion Samovar Carbon dioxide Water purification Seismic retrofit Professional wrestling holds Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Urinal Kitchen Sewer Irrigation Drainage Toilet Columbine High School massacre RuneScape weapons Toilet paper Forge Motor oil Saw (film) Pearl Cubic zirconia Pipeline (Unix) Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Toilet humour Naval mine Japanese toilet Geodesic dome Glass Aerial (dance move) Tap (valve) Borehole Dundas Square Blood Simple Castle of the Winds Hamster Anchor Sewage treatment Smoking pipe Coriolis effect Derbyshire lead mining history Nut (fruit) Bathroom Dialysis Guitar Radiator Scar Saw II Cookie Hydropower Rebreather Ground (electricity) Fishing Suplex Glossary of climbing terms Sailing Fire hydrant Climbing equipment Bladderwort Dairy World Trade Center Universal Serial Bus Great Lakes Cashew Metalworking Hydraulic machinery Titanic (1997 film) The Shining (film) Thermal power station The Demon Sorcerers Containment building Autonomous building Vacuum cleaner Carnivorous plant River The Phantom Manor RuneScape skills Furnace Snake Menstrual cup Ship Toilet-related injury Hogwarts Floor Directory Affair of the diamond necklace Ammunition Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II
