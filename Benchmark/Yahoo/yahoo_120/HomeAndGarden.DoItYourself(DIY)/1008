is it possible to build an mdf dancefloor i am planning a church social and it will be outdoors we always have music and dancing and rather than rent a dance floor i thought maybe i could make it i've heard that skaters use mdf for their ramps because it's cheap and sturdy is it possible to use that for a dance floor and what steps would i have to take thanks mdf is a fine material except for its resistance to moisture if its a one time event i would go with that if you want to use it more than a couple times i would suggest plywood Casting Drill bit Metalworking Motor oil Printed circuit board Bong Internal ballistics Shotgun Seismic retrofit Drilling and threading Woodworking Brewery Spark plug Petroleum Thermal power station Campfire Disc brake Welding Diamond enhancement Drill Bullet Clinker (boat building) Hydroponics Drill bit sizes Anemometer Derrick (lifting device) Pysanka Ice core Glass Thermostat Reamer Explosive material Dice Alkane Nuclear power Pebble bed reactor Dental caries Coconut crab Floppy disk Tunnel Geodesic dome Ammunition Radiohead Mattress Helium Jet engine Drilling rig Glossary of firefighting terms Batik Gramophone record Fire extinguisher Leather Metallurgy Shell (projectile) Siphon USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Cross-country skiing Naval mine Tire Carbon Katana Knife Injection moulding Wood carving Ski wax Asbestos Diesel engine Wire Iron Hemp Coriolis effect Nuclear meltdown Oil well Top-bar hive Nuclear weapon design Wax play Scientific drilling Lathe Drainage Energy development Diseases of the honeybee Steel Anchor Worker bee Oil platform Climbing equipment Diamond Sea ice Tissue engineering Acorn Chewing gum Beekeeping Fire fighting Bronze sculpture Phase transition Gravity Oil refinery Upholstery Phase (matter) Terminal ballistics
