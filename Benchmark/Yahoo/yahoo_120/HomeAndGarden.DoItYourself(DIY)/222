re roofing with a ice shield guard i am adding a second layer of shingles to my roof and city codes states i have to install a ice guard when installing the ice guard do i need to remove the layer of shingles at the base of the roof or can i lay the ice guard over existing shingles i don't want to tear re do the roof because i am going to be putting the house on the market as soon as i get the new layer on you can not just put ice guard on top of your existing shingles the product is designed to have ice and snow lay on it behind your gutter that is why it is foot wide if you just put on top then any ice and snow build up would be trapped under the ice barrier and your old shingles causing rotted plywood so if you were to just strip of say inches to put down the layer of ice barrier then you would have to put down one layer of new shingles to replace what you took off and then start your roofing Wood fuel Hydrogen economy Autonomous building Solar power Nuclear power Carbon monoxide Alcohol fuel Future energy development Coal Plastic Energy development Furnace Kitchen Petroleum Alternative fuel Nuclear reactor Fire extinguisher Fusion power Biofuel Stove Solar cell Nuclear power phase-out Renewable energy Diesel engine Explosive material Coffee Welding Fossil fuel power plant Sauna Carbon dioxide Carburetor Thermostat Air pollution Natural gas HVAC Environmental concerns with electricity generation Portable stove Compost Drill bit Inflation Fire Air conditioning Breathing gas Smoke-screen Sugar Power station Internal combustion engine Pebble bed reactor Carbon dioxide sink Beverage can stove Biodiesel Mitigation of global warming Straw-bale construction Computer Microeconomics Carbon Hydropower Upholstery Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Ocean thermal energy conversion Pottery Energy crisis Manitoba Hydro Gasoline Barbecue Propane Campfire Town gas Battery (electricity) Sewage treatment Water heater Hydroelectricity Renewable energy development Fluorescent lamp Air gun Abiogenic petroleum origin Oscilloscope Water (molecule) Volcano Desert Steel Grid energy storage Hydrogen Vacuum tube 1973 oil crisis Rice Oil depletion Home repair Spacecraft propulsion Chevrolet Corvair Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Hiking Iron Wind power
