made mistake with wall filler how to fix hey i was using wall filler to fill the millions of holes in this concrete wall in my apartment so instead of just filling the holes i put way too much filler on and now the wall has like mm of filler all over it which is very uneven painted it white and it looks horrible so my question is is there any tool or chemical which can remove the wall filler back down to the concrete i tried sandpaper but its too thick thanks dan sandpapers aren't going to work on masonry what you need to get is what's called a rubbing stone go into home depot or lowe's masonry section and pick one up this is a relatively small cementuous block that has a plastic handle similar to a scrub bad on top of it this item is less than use the stone as if your sanding now being you've painted this wall the paints going to clog the stone so have a bucket of water handy to rinse off the paints residue from the stone as you work at feathering out your patches if you use a grinder you'll merely end up with marks and gouges making the problem worse and if you were to float or skim the wall over and aren't a pro at it you'll end up in deeper trouble if you need any additional help with this let me know mike lonergan tradesprofessional inc http www tradesprofessional com Sheriff Political subdivisions of New York State Counties of the United States Miami-Dade County, Florida Plame affair Police Construction Elevator Logan County, Ohio United States Postal Service Trumbull County, Ohio County Warren County, Ohio Portage County, Ohio Do it yourself California government and politics Electrical wiring Law enforcement in France Fulton County, Georgia Cobb County, Georgia Article One of the United States Constitution Municipal government Medical prescription Water polo Athens, Georgia New Castle County, Delaware Government of Maryland United States Coast Guard ZIP Code Las Vegas, Nevada Montgomery County, Ohio Bay Area Rapid Transit Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Building code Glossary of firefighting terms Attorney General Unincorporated Dialysis Suburb Democratic Party (United States) Nike, Inc.
