is it expensive to fit a toilet and small sink into your house how much roughly does it cost to fit a small sink and loo into a box room upstairs in a house currently the only bathroom is downstairs i have no idea how much it would cost so please give me a rough idea i can buy a cheap loo and sink its more the rough cost of fitting it and plumbing etc that id need to pay out to get it done im located in uk the problem is in the waste connections you need to make a drain connection to the waste pipe and need to make a vent pipe from that connection go up through the roof that waste is the biggest and most costly effort connecting hot and cold water is not as complex especially if the new one is located directly above the old one the fixtures themselves are often loss leaders at building supply places so you can get them cheaply the room itself can be very simple to build and could be decorated easily at low cost since it will be small Do it yourself DIY ethic Hammer Olduwan Hammer and sickle Valve Hammer Editor Tool Super Mario Bros. 3 Diablo II Changing Rooms (TV show) Drill Forge Collecting fossils Axe Chisel Upholstery West Coast hip hop Piano Kenny Everett Rockhounding Stone tool Programming tool Jackhammer DIY audio Anvil Marble sculpture Home repair Repouss__ and chasing Ice axe Thor (Stargate) Metalworking Strategic management Thor (Marvel Comics) I, the Jury DIY Culture James Nasmyth Anarcho-punk RuneScape quests Death rock fashion Mjolnir (The Matrix) Reengineering Chuck (engineering) Hammered dulcimer Lithic flake Anstey, Leicestershire Glossary of climbing terms Game port Supercomputer Blacksmith Jan Hammer Koopa Troopa Usability MC Hammer Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's Hammer Throw Steel John Kennedy Toole Anarchist symbolism Drill bit Operation Flashpoint Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's Hammer Throw Lithic reduction Queer as Folk (UK) Mallet Sword making Drill bit shank Death rock Woodworking Machining Enfield revolver Home improvement Punk rock Bray Productions Moon rocks .44 Magnum Richard Roberts Guild Wars Mike Hammer Mercenary Armand Hammer Grommet Marking out Beta Ray Bill Paper Mario Stone carving USS Trathen (DD-530) Casting Technology Mario W.
