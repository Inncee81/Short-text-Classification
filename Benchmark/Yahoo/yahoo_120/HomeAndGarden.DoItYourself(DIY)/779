how can i remove carpet glue from my concrete basement floor i had berber carpet in the basement and had to remove it to my dismay the concrete floor underneath is now covered in glue what must i do to remove the glue i am looking for an easy solution regardless of cost other than paying someone else to do it of course like diy doc said avoid solvents at best they'll just soften the adhesive and make a bigger mess this requires mechanical removal scraping or grinding if the original carpet was installed with padding under it you probably have snail trails of a rubbery glue zig zagging around the room if the carpet was applied directly to the concrete it's probably a hard mastic like adhesive sort of a yellowish off white color for the rubbery stuff you'll need a scraper with a thin replaceable razor like blade these come in both a short handled version you use on your hands and knees and a long handled version you use standing up the short handled version has a thinner sharper blade and does a more thorough removal but the long handled version is a lot easier on your body you can also use a disc sander with a coarse grit sand paper but you'll go through a lot of sand paper this way fyi the short handled scraper usually comes with spare blades stashed inside the handle easy to miss if you don't know to look there for the hard thick adhesive you'll need a heavier scraper but not the thick bladed ones intended for tile removal the blades on those aren't sharp enough to cut the adhesive you can use the long handled scraper described above but he best fastest tool for this is a pneumatic scraper using an air compressor the pneumatic scraper works kind of like a jack hammer and does most of the work for you you can rent them at homedepot or your local rental yard scraping will get you to a smooth floor ready for new tile carpet wood but if you need bare concrete because you want to stain or paint epoxy it you're going to need a concrete floor grinder a concrete floor grinder uses either carbide cutting bits or carbide abrasive pucks to literaly grinds away a thin layer of concrete along with whatever's stuck to it it's extremely noisy and dusty but if you need to take the floor to bare concrete it's your tool there are two types the larger one uses a machine just like the commercial floor buffers you see janitors using but with a special plate that holds the cutters for spot work there's also a smaller one that looks like a router on steroids if your entire floor is covered with adhesive you'll need the big buffer model if you've got the snail trails either model will work but the hand held model will be less messy because you're only grinding a swath instead of the of the bigger model you may have to call around to find a rental yard that has a floor grinder of my local homedepot's rent them p s manually scraping is hard work it's tough to put in a full day scraping and it will take days unless it has to be done right now consider working at it an hour each evening after work or better yet recruit the whole family and take turns at it if you go with the grinder plan on a day to a day and a half to do a sf room Pontoon bridge Anchor Alcoholic beverage USS Tunny (SS-282) Beaver Vinegar Anatidae Washington German cuisine Acorn Abbey Fly fishing Cuisine of Denmark Wood USS Wahoo (SS-238) Seismic retrofit Cider Tuff Skittles (sport) Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Water garden Rock, Paper, Scissors Wood Duck Architecture of the California missions Roman eating and drinking Altar Bridge Panama Canal Dinghy Boat Shipwreck Hey Arnold!
