i would like some painting help the exterior paint of my house is chipping and it is time to have it painted previous professional painters have proven to be quite unreliable so i believe it is time for me to do it myself unfortunately i have no idea how the process should go and i do not have any expert tips on the subject could someone please give me a detailed procedure to follow well painting is all but easy its a time consuming and often misunderstood task st preperation im sure you already heard about how prep is the most important and it holds true but its the most painstaking but more critical task as far as painting goes for the fastest step would be use of powerwasher if used properly this can speed up this task keep a proper distance being to close can gorge your siding and spray downward to avoid unnessesary exposure to water my powerwasher comes with a hose that you can put a bleach solution in be careful obviously that the backspash does not come back and hit you bleach is dangerous wear protective suit apply it by hand or purchase a more environmental safer alternative internet search nd is removing scraping away old paint with putty knife i use a sander to feather the edges alot of paint chips can fall from the ground i suggest protection before your job even starts with the powerwashing rd is deciding how you want to apply your primer paint spraying like powerwashing is the fastest but not necessairly the most applicable way in your case th you now need to primer all exposed areas that are bare wood use a latex primer and spot prime with a paint brush allow to dry about hour then go back over you want to try to bring the primer up level with the existing paint you can primer the whole house especially if changing from darker color to lighter one it doesn't hurt and adds a certain level of added protection its not necessary though but you still need to bring it flush to the paint in those areas th choose a good quality paint and paint one area at time or board in this case start from top to bottom and keep your paint lines wet if allowed to dry it will be noticable keeping this in mind choose your breaks carefully don't paint in the sun plan your time where each side you do will be away from the midday hours th on your trim if your painting a different color let the previous color dry first th scaffolding may help speed the paint along alot more paint can be applied at a time and easier to move Paint Knife Casting William Powell Piet Mondrian Gas metal arc welding Wood How to prepare an onion cell slide Impressionism Violin Leica Bassoon Galvanization Tempera Ozone layer E.
