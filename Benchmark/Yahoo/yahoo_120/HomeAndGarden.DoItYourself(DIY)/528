do i cut the cap off the end of the wire or is it removable another way i'm changing my phone jack from a nd line to the primary line when the house was built we had a nd line put in in particular rooms recently we got rid of the nd line and i want to switch it i read about how to do that but my problem is with the wire caps i assume that is what they are called the blue white and white blue wires have something at the end of them they have never been used in this telephone jack i don't know how to remove the caps i wanted to make sure i was doing it right in all the material i read about how to switch the line there were no tips about this if i just need to cut it great but if you could detail how to cut it and what with that would be great i'm no electrician i tried pulling on the cap but nothing happened and i didn't want to force it also since the orange white and white orange wires will no longer be needed should they be capped or is it ok to leave them hanging loose please help ok i actually have the line working now you were supposed to just twist them might have been a stupid question but i'd rather be safe than fried so thanks for answering without going duh so now i have the orange white white orange wires just free and unused is this potentially dangerous should i buy caps can i leave them as is something else i should do with them thanks ok if what you are talking about is plastic and red or yellow its called a idc connector and is strickly used for telephone data lines as wire cap is not able to be used properly for this the site to see this is http www wingrovemarketing com au idc gel connectors us html these cannot be reused and you can purchase replacements from any homedepot or lowes just cut close to the connector and restrip about if the unused phone cable isn't hooked to the box then they do not have to be capped it is suggested to totally disconnect the unused wire from the box and pull out the unused wire but note if you do this that if you want to add in second line again you'll have to fish wire back to the box so at very minimum cut flush all wires clip them flush to the main outside wire sheathing no bare wires so not to confuse yourself or anyone working or buying the house in the future Drill bit Metalworking Drill bit shank Machine tapers Drill bit sizes M16 (rifle) Drilling and threading Drill Floppy disk Tire Screw Chuck (engineering) Tool bit Wood router Oil well Piccolo Junior Saga Gramophone record Menstrual cup Reamer Woodworking Social rule Shaggy dog story Ice core Wood Geodesic dome Axe Table saw Internal ballistics Saw Anchor Shotgun Bong Diamond Taps and dies Climbing equipment Irrigation Carburetor Poker jargon Bulldozer Mouse (computing) Clinker (boat building) Knife Marching band Pinhole camera Theory of conduct Pilum Milling cutter History of mental illness B-47 Stratojet Lathe (metal) Reflecting telescope Woodturning Compact disc Panama Canal Casting Cartridge (firearms) Spark plug Second Battle of the Atlantic Directional drilling Surgery Dead Sea scrolls Avenue Q Printed circuit board Ethernet Circular saw Derrick (lifting device) Borehole Laws of cricket W.I.T.C.H.
