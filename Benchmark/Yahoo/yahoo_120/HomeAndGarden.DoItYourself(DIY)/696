repairing sheetrock hole someone in my house punched a hole in one of the walls i have it cut out so it's a clean square now awhile back i heard about a method of repairing you take a piece of sheetrock larger on each side than your hole then you peel the rock off of the paper for the then spread mud on the wall around the hole then put the new piece on so the paper shows mud over let dry sand and paint but since that was years ago i thought i would look for the same method on the info net making sure my method wasn't of madness p has anyone ever heard of that and is that the best way to repair sheetrock holes thanks it's an acceptable way to repair provided the hole isn't too big leave more like of paper not an inch and it will take more than one coat of mud before it's ready for paint mark the size of the hole on the back of the piece you're working with score the marks and just snap and peel away FairTax Gross domestic product Mortgage Insurance Credit card Poker jargon Life insurance Illegal drug trade Cockroach Outsourcing Call centre Bank Free trade Inflation Annuity Price discrimination Tariff Counter-Strike Warren Buffett Option Ultima Online Best Buy Internet fraud Mutual fund Arbitrage Health care in the United States Wal-Mart Great Teacher Onizuka Economy of Russia Public transport Tesco Publicly funded medicine Windows XP Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Theory of conduct Variable universal life insurance Citigroup Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Electronic commerce Economics Short selling Wells Fargo Famine Hal Roach Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Personal finance Financial services Say's law $ale of the Century Health insurance Gaia Online DDT History of the United States (1918-1945) Labor theory of value America Online Sears Holdings Corporation 401(k) Monetary policy Animal Crossing Islamic banking Auto insurance Knots Landing Ryanair Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Verizon Wireless Primerica Financial Services Inventory Game programming Hyperinflation Progressive tax Contra Costa County, California Bulk vending Wheel of Fortune Student loan Stock Parody advertisement Business process reengineering Food Stamp Program Economy of Taiwan Local food Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Certificate of deposit Commodity markets Customer relationship management Loss leader Dot-com Money Voice over IP Privatization Dave Reichert Digital rights management Berkshire Hathaway Public good Social Credit Mergers and acquisitions Warranty Bedbug Karl Rove
