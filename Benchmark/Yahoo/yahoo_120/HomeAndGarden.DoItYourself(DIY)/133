recently laid tile lost it's lustre i removed as much as the grout haze as i could by simply wiping down it doesn't look like there is any haze left but my tiles don't seem as dark and shiny as they did before grouting i don't think it's leftover grout haze but even if it was there are squares of marble in the design so i don't think i can use the commercial haze out is there any way to get the shine and color back in my tiles should i buff the floor with sheepskin flannel or something like that i scrubbed and wiped the floors more than times the bucket of water was barely cloudy the last time i wiped my arms and knees hurt perhaps i overdid it and etched the tiles the white cloth comes up still clean i guess i should try the gloss sealer if it is grout haze and it is already dry it is best not to try to get it off as it will scratch the floors you could try to treat the tiles with a mop n glow type product but your best bet is to use a product like aqua mix high gloss sealer and finisher it is available at lowes it will cost you about but it should bring a high gloss finish back to your tiles and will seal the grout as well good luck Textile manufacturing Textile Hair coloring Upholstery Clorox Textile manufacturing terminology Cloth Knitting Plastic Mattress Jute Bleach Wood pulp Kimono Laundry detergent Menstrual cup Weaving Skinhead Washing machine Menstrual cycle Linen Dry cleaning Dye Alpaca Brewery Cochineal Tallit Flax Cashmere wool Social aspects of clothing Photographic developer Niddah Shroud of Turin Heavy metal fashion Hydrogen peroxide Light-emitting diode T-shirt Casting Pigment Carbon fiber Staining (biology) Snooker Tooth enamel Fiberglass Chlorine Sodium percarbonate Sodium hypochlorite Indigo dye Sari Hemp Dishwashing Felt Water purification Clothing Death rock fashion Tire Diaper Billiards Bong Cotton Camouflage Fabrication (metal) Denim Undergarment Sugarcane Hakama Ozone Coir Tofu Drill bit Flag of India Organic peroxide Color theory Indian English White bread Corduroy Flour Egg (food) Reckitt Benckiser CPU design Food coloring Gramophone record Glass Clothing terminology C-41 process Procter & Gamble Leather Pottery Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Yarn Paper Strap-on dildo Gram staining Sewing machine Reinforced concrete Joker (comics) Christmas tree Metalworking
