t shirt designs i want to make some shirts for myself because i'm cheap and don't want to pay for mass produced crap and i have a month left of summer and nothing much to occupy my time with i'm thinking about stitching designs onto plain cotton polyester shirts drawing with some sort of fabric paint markers and maybe screenprinting with a tutorial i found online does anyone have any suggestions as to the best quality supplies to use care to be cynical and suggest possible disasters thanks x nowadays the easiest and cheapest approach to make them look good is to get those transfer sheets that work with an ink jet printer you make the design in your computer load the printer with the transfer sheets print them mirror image and then iron them onto the shirt for designs you have everything you can think up plus everything that is on the web like free clip art or news photos or celebrity pix you need to get great quality shirts like hanes to look professional if you look at the best printed t shirts or even at an ad for companies that print t shirts you will see they offer hanes for the top of the line don't put all that effort into a crappy t shirt that will shrink and warp Construction Wal-Mart Wayne Corporation Elevator Inflation Drywall Plame affair Gross domestic product Corporate finance Inventory Crew Exploration Vehicle Hyperinflation De Lorean DMC-12 Seismic retrofit FairTax Sola fide Radio controlled airplane The Apprentice 2 Day trading Capitalism Monetary policy Property (ownership right) Monopoly (game) Anarchism and capitalism Real estate economics Economics Floppy disk Labor theory of value Babylonian law Mutual fund Social rule Money Sears Catalog Home CPU design Insurance Pennsylvania Railroad Francis Bacon (painter) Microeconomics Overclocking Mortgage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank Extreme Programming RuneScape cheats Embedded system Software engineering Publicly funded medicine Keynesian economics Mosaic Straw-bale construction Pottery Live 8 Personal finance Wallpaper SCO-Linux controversies Mahjong Wallpaper group Health insurance Bus models used in New York City Transit Product Lifecycle Management Bulk vending God Emperor of Dune Home repair Management Justification (theology) Schabir Shaik Trial Blood (computer game) Bond Filling station Basement Autonomous building Dodge Charger John Howard Yoder Japanese tea ceremony Housing cooperative Airbus Management information system Islamic banking Bruce Johnson Current teachings of Prem Rawat Chatsworth House Poker jargon William Perry McMansion Pontiac Trans Sport Drill bit Commodore 64 Oil-for-Food Programme The Death Gate Cycle Value added tax Nuclear power phase-out Sears Holdings Corporation MTR
