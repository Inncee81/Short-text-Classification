putting up a curtain rail i have to drill into an rsj can anyone suggest the best way to do this first of all are you sure it is an rsj above a window it is more likely to be a galvanised box lintel which is much thinner use an electric either mains or a good battery drill and buy a small set of hss drill bits they look gold for about set the drill speed to low if you can and slowly but surely drill into the lintel if you go too fast the drill bit could stick and force the drill around and damage your wrist then if you use a mm drill bit you should b able to use a red rawplug as i assume there is plasterboard on top of the steel if not use a self tapping screw about inches depending on your cutain rail have fun Shaggy dog story The Inside Dormitory Undergarment Scarlet's Walk Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Hemp Kitchen Modoc War She Loves You Brewery Days of our Lives The Dalek Invasion of Earth Upholstery Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Passenger car Emergency preparedness Sin City The Curse of Fenric Trapped in the Closet Public domain Milton H.
