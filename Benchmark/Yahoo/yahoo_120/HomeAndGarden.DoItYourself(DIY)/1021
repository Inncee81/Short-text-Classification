how do i install a bent gypsum board is there something special i need to do when bending gypsum board to form the top of an archway the archway is just framed with regular house framing i think it's southern yellow pine i don't want the gypsum to crack when i nail it in it's bent shape do i need to wet the gypsum board before i install it as chris says scour the back of the sheet as the paper is what stiffens it the papers tensile strength is what holds it together so if you scour it at a regular interval depending on the angle of the arch you should be just fine Compost Biodynamic agriculture Composting toilet Sewage treatment Vermicompost Houseplant Mulch No-dig gardening Gardening Weed Dairy Organic gardening Weed control Coffee Hemp Moss The Living Soil Herbicide Organic farming Glastonbury Festival Legionellosis Leaf R.E.M.
