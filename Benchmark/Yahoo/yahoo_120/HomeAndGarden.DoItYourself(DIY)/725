i want to dye a white cotton canvas slipcover which goes on a white cotton couch how can i prevent bleed i have already washed the slipcover i will use procion dye salt and soda ash i think this is the best i can do except maybe to iron the cover which i don't want to do and dry the slipcover in a hot dryer i can do that but i can't imagine any color fixed or not not rubbing off a little bit onto the white couch below or bleeding onto it when i spill something on the couch should i scotchguard the couch should i scotchguard the slipcover on both sides paint it with some sort of sealer like something that would be used on an acrylic painting will any of these chemicals harm my cat who often sleeps on the couch put a second cover between the couch and the slipcover to catch any bleeding a thick flannel sheet should do the trick and if you ever spill anything get the slipcover off the couch as soon as possible also wash the slipcover after you dye it let the slipcover sit after it has been dried for a few days to let the color set in as much as possible then wash it again anything dye that would bleed should come out in the wash you may need to do a second dye after washing it to get the right color but this is to be expected anyway i had to dye mine times for the right color to set and stay scotchgarding the couch isn't a bad precaution either i would scotchgard the flannel sheet as well if you use that between to help keep the flannel in place safety pin it to the slipcover or to the couch Dishwasher Dishwashing Washing machine Car washing techniques Coffee Timer Detergent Embedded system Solar power Oscilloscope Elevator Textile manufacturing Menstrual cup Diesel engine Sento Clinker (boat building) Spark plug Seismic retrofit Dry cleaning Japanese toilet Kitchen Hamster Tap water Central heating Cruising (maritime) Electrophysiology Sterling silver Japanese tea ceremony Thermal power station Tea Carburetor Laundromat Internal combustion engine Computer Flush toilet Teapot Printed circuit board Mercury 4 Hydraulic machinery Sauna Upholstery USB flash drive Spidey Super Stories Egg (food) Steam engine Bong Manifold Fuzzy logic Air conditioning Search for Tomorrow Plumbing fixture Boat building Pinball Sea level rise Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Toilet Diving suit Fusion power Refrigerator Scrabble (game show) Rebreather Programmable logic controller Microcontroller Carbon dioxide Saw II Biochemistry Hard water Solar cell Ford Ranger EV Haggis Diving regulator Domestic water system Water hammer Rice Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Motorcycle Maytag Corporation Bulk vending Carnivorous plant Motor oil Water Laundry Jute RISC Ice cream Automobile Tofu Relay The Midnight Sun Fuel injection Dairy Dalek variants Ramen Kosher foods Central processing unit Home repair Apollo Guidance Computer Microsoft Windows Cheese
