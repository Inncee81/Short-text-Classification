i need input on installing flagstone pavers my wife and i just purchased about four hundred square feet of flagstone pavers i am not the construction worker type but i am learning how to be a do it yourselfer we live in very temperate san diego so the cold weather is not an issue and in sd earthquakes are not a real concern for us either at first we thought of just putting in gravel and sand and laying them on top but the more i have read it sounds like it really needs to be in at least a mortar sand mixture and definetly grouted what do you think i will choose a best answer and will probably spend a lot of time taking your advice in my backyard the process is quite simple really if the product is regular flagstone it is much easier if you bought the concrete pavers that look like flagstone square tile with a stamped flagstone pattern it is more difficult but still possible we purchase first inches of limestone and pour that into the bed for the patio or walkway next level this out by eye and move anything that will not allow it to be flat ie stones roots etc now install a commercial grade weed barrier fabric and pin in place with landscape fabric pins lapping the fabric uinches over itself at the seams now place your flagstone or tiles on top of this fabric levelling with small amounts of masonary sand as you go once downcover the entire surface with masonary sand and use a push broom to work it in beneath the gaps between the paver stone or tile these gaps should be between and and inches depending only on your taste finally opposed to grout there is a product called gator dust which we use a very high grade of polymeric sand this fills in the last one half inch or so after sweeping the masonary sand in use first a vibratory tamper to seat the surface into the bed and to level any imperfections if you place a sheet of osb or plywood between the tamper and your pavers the breakage will be minimal you will wash the surface with a misting of water do not pressure wash the sand will disappear into the cracks allow it to dry take the polymeric sand and apply with a broom work it into your cracks sweep the excess to one end now gently mist the end until the sand disappears allow to dry sweep the sant to the opposite end mist and allow to dry repeat this process untill the area will take no more sand sweep up the excees and vacuum up remaining surface sand now for a really great look apply a commercial sealer and give it that professional edge makes it impermmeable to the elements just a note a pressure treated lumber frame will add years to the life of your work the polymeric sand will work in concert with the weed barrier fabric to make your hard work free of weeds for years to come good luck to you Condominium Downtown Cleveland McMansion Disney's California Adventure Jean Schmidt Campbell, California S__o Paulo Cohousing Beverly Hills, California Google Minneapolis, Minnesota Three Gays of the Condo Columbine High School massacre Donald Trump White flight Culver City, California Coney Island The Brady Bunch Milwaukee, Wisconsin Paul Hackett Scottsdale, Arizona Altair 8800 Home insurance Richard Chase Pasadena, California Filling station Walt Disney Concert Hall Japanese toilet Operation Days of Penitence Disneyland Car boot sale Anarchism and society Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts Tenderloin, San Francisco North York, Ontario Crystal City, Virginia San Francisco, California Los Angeles Times Madison, Wisconsin Real estate broker Cabrini-Green Coffeehouse Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Inkjet printer Crowd psychology Genesis (band) Carlsbad, California Shopping mall Dallas, Texas Neighbourhood (mathematics) 1948 Arab-Israeli War Glossary of graph theory Action potential Wall Street Boris Becker Fallujah C__line Dion Nintendo GameCube Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Time Warner Center Lee Harvey Oswald Rio de Janeiro Tobacco advertising The Vines Norfolk International Airport Eaton's Cupertino, California A6 road Terrorism against Israel in 2002 Mercedes-Benz A-Class Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Great Depression Video game crash of 1983 Edgewater (Chicago) Pentagon City, Virginia Kitty Genovese Neighborhoods of Chicago Door Richard Christy UK Singles Chart Sale Sharks St. Francis, Wisconsin 50 Cent Crystal Lake, Illinois Capitol Hill, Denver, Colorado Best Buy Sun Valley, Idaho Gare du Nord Burnsville, Minnesota Cellular automaton Cerritos, California Oldsmobile Silhouette Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Monster Garage Tiananmen Automatic teller machine Zoning Las Vegas Strip Dave Matthews Band San Francisco International Airport
