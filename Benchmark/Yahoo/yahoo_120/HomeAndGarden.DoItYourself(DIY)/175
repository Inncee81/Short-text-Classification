i'm tired of having a blah looking locker at school decotative ideas anyone i just have pictures up it's so boring i'm tired of staring at my locker that looked the same for years do you have any cool ideas i think i might want to use black tarp to cover up the door other than that i have no other ideas memorize your combination write down your combination twenty times once in the morning and once at night just in case you forget it write it in sharpie on the inside of your backpack you probably can't use tape or glue take everything out and clean it well with a spray make sure that there is enough room in your locker for the necessities you can decorate your whole locker so that there s no room left in it but you ll be stuck carrying around your books all day try to imagine everything that you would need to have in your locker at once all of your books your backpack your coat and personal items and then get all that stuff together and arrange it in your locker so you can see how much room you ll have to work with pick a color scheme pink and yellow red and blue your school colors pick a theme music animals dogs or cats sports cars flowers movies get a set or of brightly colored magnets you'll need plenty if you like flowers fill the inside of your locker door with a garden of artificial posies buy artificial flowers and remove the flower heads from their stems glue them to magnets with hot glue and stick them on the inside of your locker door stick a flower scented air freshener beneath the upper shelf to add realistic scent to your flower filled locker install your background if that locker look doesn t go with your theme create a fresh looking canvas by using wrapping paper or construction paper that is cut to cover the entire door or walls of the locker you can also try wallpaper but unless you get the kind that is specifically designed for lockers don t actually glue it in use magnets you can cut a cardboard or better corkboard piece to fit the back and sides individually after you fitted it tightly in the back cover the cardboard cover it in fabric insert bulletin board pins into it and put it at the back of your locker with its sides covering the sides of your locker as well it should be a tight fit use sticky tack to help it stick this becomes your bulletin board to post reminders for tests and homework assignments add a plastic cup cut off the back of it to the board for holding pens add accessories little extras like a mirror a notepad a pencil holder or a clock can be installed in your locker for convenience it s best to install these right after your background so you can plan your decorations around them i've seen ready made mirrors but don't settle for a plain and boring locker mirror jazz up an ordinary locker mirror by trimming it with decorative add ons glue on colorful feathers sequins faux jewels shells polished stones or any other cool embellishments you want another idea for decorating a locker mirror involves trimming it with glitter protect the mirror with a sheet of paper before beginning and protect your work surface with newspaper coat the frame with spray on adhesive and sprinkle it with fine glitter in a color of your choice you ll have a really cool decorative framed mirror for your locker and no one else will have one exactly like yours mirrors fall down if someone slams their locker and it doesn't even have to be you so use a strong magnet and have the mirror in an accident free area how about a wire basket to hold pens hairbrush hygiene products perfume and other small items they have the magnets on the back i've seen them in target office supply stores you can also buy 'peel and stick magnetic sheets in hobby areas of stores or michael's hobby lobby lowe's you can buy magnetic photo frames to slide photos in you can buy a scented air freshener for a nice scent if it as a sticky place on the back replace with a small piece of the magnetic sheet i'd have a memo pad up for do not forget reminders or hang a calendar big enough to write on make a little mailbox out of a small box hung on the inside of the locker place it so that people can stick notes into it through the locker slats if you have them put up some of your favorite quotes for quotes go to a scrapbook store there you can find cute quotes that are all decorated and pretty get some magnetic strips and attach them to the backs of the quote you could try hanging things from ribbon instead of sticking them pin things onto the ribbon that you tie from the top of your locker space or on the clothes purse hook mix it up you can keep the same theme all year or you can redo parts of it or the whole thing from time to time consider making seasonal changes or decorating your locker for holidays or important events keep it interesting all year long don't bring your cell phone to school and leave it on or in your locker don't keep more than in your locker if you do there would be a good chance that most or all of it would be stolen never tell anyone your locker combination someone even your friends could backstab you make sure no one is watching you use the combination locker magazines pictures internet photos school photos etc cardboard board wallpaper construction paper etc for lining locker stickers locker shelf magnets fabric scraps cleaning materials for scrubbing out locker air freshener mirror notepad bulletin board pins pencil holder clock something that's your favorite color that just says you locker kit that has many things on this list in it to save time and money maybe some corkboard make sure to measure your locker before you put it in though make a to do list for your day and week tthe calendar may have enough room for it just keep it up to date your list should remind you of papers tests projects meetings mark those items as things you absolutely must get done that day and pursue those tasks relentlessly until you get them done mark them off as you are successful clean your locker out once a week maybe every friday throw old food away Kitchen Elevator Dairy Lincoln Continental Porsche 993 Hell's Kitchen (television) In-N-Out Burger Dishwasher
