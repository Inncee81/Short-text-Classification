does anyone know which swimming pool pump has the best value for the money for both pool and spa i had a pool built just years ago my spa is not generating any bubbles or jets as it was the first year it has a hayward pump to filter both pool and spa this was highly recommended by the builder but now my pool cleaner guy cleans the filter every week so the spa can get some pressure he says that he wouldn't have bought a hayward pump also said he would have another pump for the spa i don't know anything about pools and want to learn so i don't have to second guess everyone in the pool business i don't have money to burn like some friends of mine that just keeps paying a pool guy to fix everything for them i would like to do it myself and save my money any comments or suggestions are welcomed thank you in advance if you have a single pump for pool and spa and the pump is keeping your pool and spa clean its not the pump hayward is an industry standard pump out of pools have hayward pumps on them most likely it sounds like a configuration problem with your plumbing maybe its not set up properly or your filter grids which decrease your pressure may need to be changed they can become chemically blocked and inefficient check with your pool store to get some cleaning materials for it that may help you rather than buy new filter grids Dillard University Colony in Space Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States Tropical cyclone Singaporean response to Hurricane Katrina Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Flood Hurricane Katrina in historical context Political effects of Hurricane Katrina Opie and Anthony Swedish response to Hurricane Katrina Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, Louisiana Hurricane Katrina effects by region Emergency preparedness Russel L.
