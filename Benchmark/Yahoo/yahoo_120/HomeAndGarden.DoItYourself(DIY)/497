how can i prevent my child from burning himself on baseboard heaters we're renting a house and that's what we have for heat there's an inch gap in the front across the whole heater for the hot air to come out of he can easily stick his fingers in there and burn them i'm trying to figure out if there's something i can buy i was thinking of a long baby gate but there's no walls for it to hold on to i would have to run the gate from one side of the room to the other and block off the door it's just not possible any ideas you can't protect them forever if he burns himself he isn't likely to try touching it again just make sure you get onto him for messing with it even when it is not in use that way he is less likely to start playing with it later on if you put somehing in front of it you will be creating a fire hazard you could also purchase some space heaters that won't get hot and will shut of if he knocks them over Crochet World Wide Web HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Lace-making Knitting Textile Textile manufacturing terminology Ajax (programming) Web server Apache HTTP Server Website Tatting Knot Wget Proxy server Textile manufacturing Domain name PHP Representational State Transfer Uniform Resource Identifier Secure Shell Internet Domain Name System Arts and crafts SAML Phishing JavaServer Pages Web crawler CPAN Apache Software Foundation Internet censorship in mainland China BitTorrent Extraterrestrial hypothesis Java Servlet User agent Sewing machine VJ Session Initiation Protocol Common Unix Printing System Python programming language Denial-of-service attack Librarian Transport Layer Security Virtual hosting Wiki Visual Basic .NET WebDAV Squid cache Unix Neopets MIME GNU/Linux naming controversy Cross site scripting XRI Tokelau Ragnarok Online Writers Guild of America Jabber Gaia Online Regular expression Federal Reserve Wikisource JSON Baldness Dynamic-Link Library Caterpillar Yarn MSN Messenger Microsoft .NET Open access UK Underground Microsoft Glossary of American football Mozilla Firefox Electronic commerce Scalable Vector Graphics Delta encoding Sun Microsystems University College London Wendy Orlean Williams Google Web Accelerator HyperCard Footbag Television network Pantyhose Warez University of California, Irvine I2P Preston Capitalism Internet privacy Kaisariani Leiden Opera house Gnutella Port numbers Strategic management Stardock
