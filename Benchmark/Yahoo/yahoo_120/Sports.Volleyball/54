how do i explain this to my volleyball coach my coach wants to keep me as the main jv setter im a sophmore but i really want to be on varsity i can't be one on varsity because they alrealdy have a really good one whose a senior how can i tell her i want to try a different position so i atleast have a chance at varsity because my fate is pretty much set you may currently feel badly but as a sophomore on j v you will get quite a bit more playtime which leads to more experience and becoming as better player you're true goal right now should be figuring out how to prove to your coach you are the best sophomore she has and becoming team captain that means being positive supportive of both teams and prepared to play where you are needed most being captain of j v as a sophomore gives you a better chance of securing that title on varsity your junior or senior year which i tell ya looks great in the yearbook o the trick is to look at what opportunity you have not what opportunity you don't that senior is going to graduate after this year and the more experience you have in games the better you'll be and better chance you have of being that junior or that senior setter in the next years plus i'm sure she already has left side hitters and middles and an opposite it's always a bonus to be able to hit it makes the option to run a more viable and opens up your opportunity if ever needed as a utility player so keep working on it in practice and work on your defense because if your running a you'll need to be able to play right side defense and pass as well as transitioning to set and if you have no clue what any of that means than ask your coach or look it up o my best players and the ones i respect the most are the one's i know respect me and the decisions i make i'm a high school coach and i am assuming your team runs a based on it's need for only one setter at the varsity level so run that j v court o learn leadership skills and continue to approve upon your technical and tactical skills on the court and make sure to let your coach know that you are there if she ever needs you to fill in or decides she wants to run a etc it's good to be confidant but better to be humble so set your goals high but remember it's the long term goals that count the most nothing worse than an understudy who gives up on learning the lines because she didn't get the part do you think matt casalle of the patriots wanted to be a back up quarterback all through college nope but he wanted to play pro and that's where he is now back up to brady o but on his way to signing a contract as a starting qb for another team once his contract is up here and either way he signs autographs works his butt off at practices and enjoys the check he deposits every season i bet he'd give anything though to have a j v team so he could show what he's got during true competition so show the coach and your team what you've got if they don't require you to hang around for varsity games do it anyway maybe even ask the coach if you could sit there bench so you could be included in huddles but listen watch and remember your learning will never be done so get working on putting that best foot forward be commited humble dedicated and always have a good attitude oh and throw your hat in the running to be j v captain good luck New York Giants New England Patriots Glossary of American football Baseball Pittsburgh Steelers Norway national football team New York Jets Quizbowl Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XXV American football Super Bowl XXVII Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXXVI Cleveland Browns Buffalo Bills Carolina Panthers National Football League Lore Quarterback Ultimate (sport) Poker jargon Rugby league Super Bowl XXVI American football strategy Canadian football Blackjack New York Knicks Miami Dolphins Alex Ferguson National Football League Junior varsity Betting (poker) Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl IX Badminton Yearbook Super Bowl XXI Rugby union positions Basketball The Citadel (Military College) Contract bridge Aerial (dance move) Super Bowl X Craps Essendon Football Club Bryan Robson Yao Ming Super Bowl V St. Louis Rams Tag Super Bowl III Vince Lombardi Kansas City Chiefs Larry Bird Mike Piazza Chess strategy and tactics Denis Law Softball Washington State University Sandy Koufax Super Bowl XXXI San Diego Chargers Student Luther Head Super Bowl XXXIV Steve Nash Tris Speaker High school Jerry Lucas Football (soccer) Indianapolis Colts Hal Trosky Rugby union Super Bowl XVII Ben Roethlisberger One Tree Hill (TV series) Salary cap Laws of cricket Extreme Programming Los Angeles Clippers Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XIX NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Dallas Cowboys Los Angeles Kings Joe Paterno Dog agility Texas A&M University Consensus decision-making
