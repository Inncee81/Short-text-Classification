how to increase my vertical ok so im and i play for a very elite club team i am now being trained as a middle hitter instead of my old position a setter because i am the best blocker on the team most girls in other teams hit slightly above the block just out of my reach and i need to jump higer to force them to either tip or have me block them i can get about a foot over the net my elbows are at the tape i really need to jump high so any tips would be greatly appreciaed thanks and god bless me wow and a rising star you have several jumps to practice swing with bent knee bend your knees and swing your arms this one could help you get your shoulders over the tape watch out don't let the opponent hit your face bent knee but no swing raise your arms as you are blocking bend your knees and jump not much knee help raise your arms and let go your feet with a little help from your feet and knees actually this could make you a super star when needed e g when a bad pass was sent over and your opponent jumps and swings i would call that anti killer block in air reach when the opponent tips after a fake hit and you are already in the air coming down can you grab the air and reach up for a block i had a teammate who could do it on daily basis and he blocked four consecutive hit tip in a final game and got four points in a row when practicing add weight to your lower leg would help just make sure they don't drag on your ankles and knees your jump power strength should come from your feet ankles legs waist and arms may god bless you and have fun playing volleyball Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling aerial techniques Professional wrestling attacks Suplex Equine conformation Fast bowling Swingout Diving Pole vault Skateboarding trick Piledriver (professional wrestling) Badminton Powerbomb Glossary of ballet terms Neckbreaker Backstroke Boxing Fencing Baseball Softball DDT (professional wrestling) Backbreaker Water polo Cheerleading Spanking Muay Thai Horizontal bar Breaststroke Wing Chun Marching band Batting (cricket) Chair Australian rules football American football Penalty (ice hockey) Double bass Swimming Snooker Casualty lifting Golf Figure skating Shawn Michaels Mixed martial arts Sandy Koufax Super Bowl XXVII Backgammon Ultimate (sport) Cricket Babe Ruth Front crawl Butterfly stroke Jet engine Charleston (dance move) 1957 World Series Guilty Gear Rugby union National Football League Lore Basketball GunZ The Duel Lightsaber combat Quake III Arena Glossary of partner dance terms Golf club (equipment) Dog agility Greg Valentine Strike zone Salute Items in the Metroid series Hank Aaron Harp Tenshinhan Norway national football team Battlebots Oscilloscope Ty Cobb Andr__s Galarraga Anatomical terms of location Robin Ventura Goaltender Field hockey Team Fortress Classic Punt (boat) Tetrapod New England Patriots Super Metroid Side pass (dance move) Canoe Super Mario 64
