how can i achieve this i bought some tubed vo to do a conditioning treatment to my hair i know you use a blow dryer and a shower cap but what do you have to do i meant that i bought a tube of vo 'cause someone told me they can do a conditioning treatment with this i was wonderin' how you do this it's usually used for flyaways and shine pretty simple just take the conditioner and spread it throughout all of your hair massage it for a while and then put the cap on then turn your dryer on and sit under it for as long as the instructions say to then rinse if you don't have a dryer to sit under don't worry about it the heat just penetrates better leave the conditioner on your hair minutes longer than the instructions say this is only if you are not using the dryer also the reason why you want the dryer you seat under is because you want the heat distribute evenly throughout your hair you can't do that with a hand dryer Brewery Dialysis Sento Japanese toilet First aid Manicure Textile manufacturing Electrical wiring Central processing unit Urticaria Massage Hand grenade Thermal power station Radiation therapy Carburetor Ayyavazhi mythology Carbon dioxide Hair Sterilization (microbiology) Lighting Dairy Hay Paul Is Dead Upholstery Bong Internal ballistics Humphrey Bogart Sewage treatment Hypothermia Dreadlocks Tobacco Rocket propelled grenade Oral sex Breastfeeding Mesothelioma Marilyn Monroe Wok Leaf Casting The Inside Seismic retrofit Link (Legend of Zelda) Fluorescent lamp Prostate cancer Trumpet Furnace Firearm Severe weather terminology (United States) Blood on the Tracks Urinary incontinence Swimming Tooth Shell (projectile) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Explosive material Cigar Drowning Social rule Wind power Gas metal arc welding Pachypodium bicolor Fire fighting Triage Shaggy dog story Spacecraft propulsion Hyperthermia Shampoo Reflexology Solar power Halitosis Menstrual cup Laser hair removal Ben Johnson (athlete) Comanche Heat equation Weather lore Hydrotherapy Singlish Eczema Tire Carnivorous plant Headgear Car handling Professional wrestling slang Psilocybin Philip J.
