how can i convince my mom to let me dye my hair my mom won't let me dye my hair i am and i think i am old enough to be allowed to dye my hair if i want when i ask her why she won't let me she says that it will damage my hair but when i tell her that my friends all dyed their hair and all of their hair is still so healthy she then changes her answer and says that i am too young to dye my hair if i keep going at it she will eventually yell at me and say no you cant dye your hair thats it and the argument basically ends there once i asked her if i could dye my hair with those temporary dyes the ones that last for a few months she said yes at first but minutes later she changed her mind and said no you cant i'm not allowed to do anything to my hair i cannot use straightening or curling irons or anything i really feel like she is stopping me from having the hair that i want what is something i can say to make her say yes you can dye your hair its not like i want to dye it an extreme color i have black hair and i simply want to dye it brown is your mother just wary of what could happen if a box color went completely wrong do your research find a professional hair colorist in your area and pay them a visit with your mother have him or her explain the haircolor process to your mom and how if done correctly safe it can be if your mother warms up to the idea have that hair colorist color your hair in my opinion your first color should always be done by a professional someone who's had years of experience with haircolor Kodocha Tag Hair Phoebe Buffay's songs Baldness Theory of conduct Dog Guinea pig Prostate cancer Katelyn Faber Shaggy dog story Pitaten The Ashlee Simpson Show Bob and George Stomach cancer Calvin and Hobbes Technicolor G-Man (Half-Life) W.I.T.C.H.
