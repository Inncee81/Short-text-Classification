ladies what haircut would you give to a guy with a ponytail my first reaction would be to say dont you dare touch it i love long hair on men lol but only if its attractive on them some guys just can not carry it off question is who's wanting his long hair cut you or him if you're his gf or wife he might not really want to cut it for whatever reason if thats the case u need to find out he might think he wants it cut short but would regret it for any number of reasons later secondly no matter if ur his gf wife or stylist never go short on a guy with long hair do it gradually over time once its cut u can't very well glue it back on and yall both might hate it shorter then were would you be up creek without a paddle Haircut Hair Ponytail Mullet (haircut) The Mikado Baldness Internal ballistics Kodocha Confessor (Sword of Truth) Atari ST 10cc Table tennis Wang Mang Something Positive The Ashlee Simpson Show Beard Wig (hair) Ranma __ characters Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Skinhead Mr. T One Tree Hill (TV series) Marilyn Monroe Long Path Human Sydney Riot of 1879 Megan Griffin Human height Emo fashion The Human Stain D.
