today i bleached my friends hair times first we bleached just half of it and then we dyed it pink and blue the blue didnt work the first time so we did it a second and left it in longer that still didnt work so then we just bleached the whole thing because it looked horrible with half of it pink and the other half nothing so we left the bleach on for like mins and none of the pink came out and it was only supposed to be semi perminet so when we just dyed it all black is that bad for your hair we deep conditioned once and used conditioner other times so in all we dyed bleached it times one right after another i dont want his hair to fall out or his scalp to hurt so was that a bad idea i did this to one of my guy friends today and he is complaining of his scalp hurting and i bleach my hair every months so i know it can be very hard on the hair and it was his idea to do it all of it it was all his idea to do this it was probably not the best idea but if his scalp was going to be burned you would be seeing redness by now bleach burns but semi permanents do not if the hair is going to be fragile and break you will know within a couple of days luckily he is a guy and can cut it very short probably looking handsomely exotic with his short plack hair if that happens i did a similar thing as a teenager before i got a hairdresser's license so i know how you feel when you are in a panic don't blame yourself you see when you bleach hair and then add a pigment the pigment stains the hair no matter whether the pigment you have put on is pink or brown the bleach will never make it really pale again don't let anyone make you feel bad i assume you didn't wrestle your friend to the ground during all of this so the two of you were trying your best on an experiment that just didn't work just let him keep conditioning and if there are any burns or blisters he should see a doctor from what you describe he shouldn't be seriously harmed and he good thing about hair is that it grows back and the mistakes are just history Hair Hair coloring Paint Hair color Textile manufacturing Joker (comics) Theory of conduct Psoriasis Haircut The Shining (film) Blond Pigment Blood on the Tracks 1957 World Series Michael Jackson Nine Inch Nails Staining (biology) Baldness treatments Baldness Meat Loaf Rei Ayanami Color 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dragon Booster Human skin color Battles of Lexington and Concord The Wall Color theory The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends Douglas Adams Sub-Zero Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Heinkel He 100 Melanin Pitaten Dye Time Out of Mind Social rule Little Britain Queen of Wands Hormone replacement therapy (trans) One Tree Hill (TV series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Tears for Fears Diamond Humphrey Bogart Black Red hair Cheetah Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Emo fashion Dandruff Characters of The Sandman Double Dragon Green Day Shaggy dog story Characters in the Smurfs The Fairly OddParents Human Eric Cartman Marilyn Monroe Sydney Riot of 1879 Power Rangers Taxi Driver Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Chicago White Sox Saved by the Bell Mario Highway 61 Revisited Kryptonite Bleach (album) Kender RuneScape quests Reservoir Dogs Discus (fish) Guinea pig Massage Empire Burlesque Dobermann Tooth enamel The Venture Bros.
