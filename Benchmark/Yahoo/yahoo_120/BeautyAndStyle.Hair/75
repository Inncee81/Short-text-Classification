how do i get my african american hair to grow longer well chef tod african american hair doesn't grow as fast as those who are of other nationalities thats why i answer these types of questions about african american hair all of the time so here's my opinion like most black women i permed my hair for years i was a faithful beauty salon customer i went every weeks for the perm and every weeks for wash and style kept my ends clipped i bought professional products from her for when i washed my hair at home i did everything right i faithfully went to the salon i usually wore wraps so i did not put a lot of heat in my hair i usually just flat ironed or hot curled it about once or twice a week i wrapped my hair at night oiled it well and have never colored it yet over years of perming my hair never maintained health or length sometimes i'd wear braids for months or even longer than a year then i'd perm my newgrowth have long beautiful thick hair for about months and it'd be broke off again plus i enjoy working out although permed hair will stay straight at the root while its wet if you get caught in the rain humidity sweat alot or other moisture you still have to wash it and apply heat all things considered i just couldn't keep up with my perm oh yeah and it wasn't really long enough for many ponytails then i started noticing that all the black women with natural hair had beautiful rich thick long voluptuous healthy looking hair all of them and mine was dry shabby and damaged so needless to say i went natural it has been years my hair is longer and fuller than it has ever been and most importantly it is healthy no broke off patches in the back no more month at the salon no more bathroom shelf full of hair care products to end my relentless breakage no more all day saturdays at the salon no more combs full of broken hair i love being natural it takes lots of moisture and patience but the proof is in the pudding i usally wear it in twists braids or a curly fro but on special occasions when i want to straighten it i do so with a pressing comb old school all the way my only regret is not having gone natural sooner it takes dedication because you do have to regrow another head of hair you have to eventually cut off the permed hair also there is stigma in the mainstream about natural african american hair it is said that it is not professional that it is not pretty well there is a difference between natural and unkept hair i have seen natural hair that was not well taken care of permed hair too you have to take care of whatever style you have even bald people have to maintain their proper baldness even if you wear a fro you should maintain an edgeup and make sure the fro is shaped well i think our problem is not the hair growing from the scalp as it is maintaining it's length while its growing some people's hair grows fine with perms but i would venture to say that most don't as evidenced by the numberof black females with exceptionally long permed hair either way do what works for you i wish you the best in whatever you choose if you want to talk to me about it email me puntodevista yahoo com Baldness Baldness treatments Japanese tea ceremony Afro Upholstery Textile manufacturing Sauna Shampoo Drill bit Cornrows Casting Comanche Afro textured hair Psoriasis Customs and etiquette of Japan Billboard Hot 100 EastEnders Tire Physical attractiveness Kimono Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tofu Urinary incontinence Dog Menstrual cup Clothing Guinea pig Drug test Pysanka Pubic hair Skin Knife Kurt Angle Hemp Rastafari movement She Loves You The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Beavis and Butt-head Brush Barbie Mattress Puberty Social rule Leaf Leather Hyperthermia Wood Beard Dandruff Bacon Characters in the Smurfs Tobacco Breastfeeding Hair coloring Kodocha Professional wrestling match types Infantilism Marilyn Monroe Tattoo Radiation therapy Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Keeshond Dragon Booster Preston, Minnesota Cheese Ponytail Napoleon Dynamite Menstrual cycle Depilation Bonsai Aerial (dance move) Tibetan people Pitaten Wig (hair) Tokusatsu Skinhead Meat Loaf Phoebe Buffay's songs Textile manufacturing terminology Three Stooges Columbine High School massacre The Apprentice 2 The Amber Spyglass Plame affair
