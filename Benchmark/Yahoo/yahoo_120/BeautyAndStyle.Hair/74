how much does it cost to get really good highlights because im going to get them and i juss want to know how much they cost and what color hightlights do you think i should gett i have dirty blonde hair its pretty dark but not brown it seems like a lot of people have highlight disasters too light too dark too orange too expensive for a crappy job etc so for really good highlights first research salons in your area find some reviews askl other people who went there etc and be sure that you are very specific with the kind of highlights and the color you want and bring pics with you magazine pics or whatever most places can do good highlights but you just have to make sure you are very clear about what you want becuase you gould go to a place or a place and come out with the same thing but depending on where you live i would say between and is average dont be afraid to ask people and even ask salons if they have any stylists who are better at highlights as far as color of highlights it also depends on your skin tone and eye color i have light skin adn blue eyes and naturally dark blond light brown hair and any color highlights look good on me but if you dont want to go too drastic i would say start with just a few shades lighter than your hair or if you want to just be bold get platinum blond highlights i would say get a cool tone or a neutral tone that will make it a light non yellowy orange or a slightly gold tone i think those look best with blond hair usually Hair color Blond Color theory Color Human skin color Drawing Sunglasses Hair coloring The Ashlee Simpson Show Jennifer Lopez Meriones unguiculatus Light-emitting diode Physical attractiveness Laser hair removal Red hair Eye color The Rasmus Link (Legend of Zelda) Horse Totally Spies!
