highlights im going to get highlights tomorow and i was wondering if i should keep my hair up while im in the pool like not get it wet at all because the color might come out im okay with that i just don't know if it's okay to leave it down or put it up in like a cap or something thanks if they use bleach you really shouldn't go in without a swimming cap but if you get highlights wait days and right when you get out of the pool take a shower wash your hair if you can't do that then i think it's good to get a swimming cap i have to get one cause i dyed my hair and i'm but who wants green hair right hah best of luck Hair coloring Joker (comics) Singlish Laci Peterson Hair color Sauna Headgear Social rule Skinhead Fountain Hair The Pet Sounds Sessions Customs and etiquette of Japan Swimming pool Textile manufacturing Technicolor Chicago White Sox Link (Legend of Zelda) Changeroom Hair (musical) Tanning Blond History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Swimsuit Sento Phoebe Buffay's songs Niddah Tag Swimming Brush Chlorine Electrical wiring (UK) Bathing Otitis externa Staining (biology) Towel C-41 process Georgia Institute of Technology Washington State University Beavis and Butt-head Ammolite Aqua Teen Hunger Force The Legend of Zelda series enemies Drawing The Blue Lagoon (1980 film) Diving suit Baseball cap Diving Oakland Athletics E-6 process Death rock fashion Kimono Wudu The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap The Inside The Wonderful Wizard of Oz The Red Green Show Dog Clothing Wood pulp Roger Meddows-Taylor Polar Bear W.I.T.C.H.
