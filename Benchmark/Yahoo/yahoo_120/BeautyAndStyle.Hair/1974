just used just for men beard coloring and skin blistered i followed exact directions need new product the product worked well for color but painfull blistering just for men is a metallic dye so it isnt the same formula of regular dye get some dye that is not metallic such as box dye it will take longer to process but it should not blister or anything but now you have to wait for the just for men to grow out or cut it off because you cant mix metallic with regular dye it will cause a bad reaction Hair coloring Tattoo Leather Food coloring Dye Acetic acid Anodising Alum Photographic film Sulfuric acid Copper extraction Uranium Psoriasis Staining (biology) Textile manufacturing Herpes simplex virus Rash Hair Ultraviolet Bromine Pointe shoes Nitric acid Hand grenade Titanium Cosmetics Ammonia Casting Upholstery Hydrochloric acid Undergarment Steel Technicolor Allergy 2005 World Series Vanadium Iron Hydrogen Indigo dye Compact disc Hydrogen peroxide Chromatography Tanning Dobermann Callus Herpes zoster Skin Hair color Tzitzit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lighting Corrosion William Perkin Paint Textile Batik Pigment Chicago White Sox Gamut Scarification Walnut Pubic hair Crimson Aluminium Zinc Prostate cancer Depilation Crucible steel Criticality accident Metallurgy Enzyme Use of poison gas in World War I Chromium Sunburn Tofu Nickel Laserdisc Pain of Salvation Thallium Textile manufacturing terminology Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chemoluminescence L'Or__al Technetium Sequencing Photography High-heeled shoe Kodachrome Diamond cut Autoimmune diseases Clothing Beard Die (manufacturing) Rubber stamp Hiking Anthrax Agarose gel electrophoresis Nitroglycerin Cochineal Lead
