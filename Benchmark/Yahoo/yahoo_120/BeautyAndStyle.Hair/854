hot fusion method used for extensions after removing them my hair is much thinner i am recovery without any research i was desperate enough to trust a woman who used the hot fusion method to apply extensions to my hair it looked great at first but the hair was incredibly heavy and would dry out in a matter of days i had to continue to go back to the salon anyway i had them removed after a month of wear and was devastated by the results my hair was twice as thin as it was before the application i wore clip ins to disguise the damage it is now august after getting it cut in june the remaining hair that i have has recovered but the under layers are still very broken short and somewhat sparse i do not have any bald spots and the outer layer of my hair covers most of the damage however when i touch it and put it back i am reminded of the absence of the inner layers i was wondering if this hair has a chance to recover i am only and am taking hair growth vitamins and wearing clip ins for thickness how long do you think this will take any suggestions time time time it stinks but the good news is it will recover it just takes you guessed it time good news you are young and presumably healthy it will just have to grow back in it may be hard but if you can cut the rest of your hair the healthier stuff shorter to blend in sooner with the shorter coming back hair take it as lesson learned stay away from extensions and be kind to your hair Hair Prostate cancer Baldness Knife Haircut Baldness treatments Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Beavis and Butt-head Kodocha Stomach cancer Diving suit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Textile manufacturing Sun Wood Casting Ozone depletion Gypsy moth Stem cell Pubic hair Tooth Anorexia nervosa Tire Leaf Characters of The Sandman Menstrual cup Menstrual cycle Fire fighting Seismic retrofit Tooth enamel The Ashlee Simpson Show Violin Son Gohan Milk Leather Volleyball Skin Beard Eli__n Gonz__lez Brewery Campfire Drill bit Carbon nanotube Acne Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans The Dalek Invasion of Earth Guinea pig The Amber Spyglass Rice Bread Joker (comics) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Terri Schiavo M16 (rifle) Folic acid Internal ballistics Cold fusion Headgear Tobacco Undergarment Chromatography Diseases of the honeybee Tocopherol Comanche Psoriasis Scar Bullet Potato Kimono Japanese tea ceremony Carpal tunnel syndrome Breastfeeding 1957 World Series Supernova Sant Thakar Singh Human skin color Pitaten Kurt Angle Cancer Marilyn Monroe Gramophone record Inertial confinement fusion Theory of conduct Grunge music Paint Dry cleaning Chlorophyta Depilation Naruto jutsu Atherosclerosis Puberty
