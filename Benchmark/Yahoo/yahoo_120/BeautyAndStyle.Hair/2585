hair fix question i got my hair done a month ago july th and she didn't do it correctly well i was unable to call or make another appointment as my husband was coming home from a deployment and what not well anyhow is a month later to late to ask her to fix it i mean i got two colors of highlights full head except she missed my roots the top part of my hair the part everyone sees it has about two inches of roots without the blond you can tell that she put the brown in it but not the blond even looking underneath you can see that there isn't that much growth in this last days i don't feel like i should have to pay for something that should have been done right the first time repeat after a month you can see she put one color on my roots not the other my hair obviously has two colors but only one on my top roots here is a photo from the night she did it http s photobucket com albums y beccaizzaho action view current newhair jpg it never hurts to ask but it has been quite a while you really should've called her as soon as you determined you were unhappy with the service perhaps she'll offer you a discount on your next service because of the elapsed time from the photo it appears that your hair was foiled and it looks like she used a tint to retouch previous highlights it also looks like there wasn't enough lift to attain the previous look perhaps suggest that she use a lightener with a low volume developer not tint with alternate foils of a deposit only tint for added dimension again if your ever unhappy with a service contact the stylist asap and see what can be done most stylists will correct the procedure at no cost to insure client satisfaction Hair coloring Plame affair Marilyn Monroe Inflation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hair Bob and George Pitaten Stereoscopy Roswell UFO incident Nine Inch Nails Blonde on Blonde Microeconomics Snooker Memento (film) X Window System Slow Train Coming $ale of the Century Laws of cricket Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diamond Gross domestic product Traumatic incident reduction The Ashlee Simpson Show Call centre Billboard Hot 100 Oasis (band) R.E.M.
