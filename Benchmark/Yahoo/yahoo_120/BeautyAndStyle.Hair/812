messed up with semi permanent hair color times in a row okay i have natural ash medium blonde hair i dyed the bottom half a dark neutral brown when it started fading about weeks it looked like a muddy gold brown i then died it an ash brown to cover the gold but that eventually started fading to yes i know obviously back to the goldish brown i didn't like before so the other day i tried bleaching it out it turned a dark orange i washed it and died it again with the dark ash brown now it's very uneven and i had to cut an inch off the bottoms since it was so fried from the bleach i'm stressing any ideas on how to remove the color and get it to a nice light ash brown or dark ash blonde i want it to match the rest of my hair thanks in advance for your time ok i dye my hair all the time i suggest you go to a profession place and have then dye it a color darker than what you have then ask if they can do a deep conditioning treatment fo re construct your hair Hair color Hair coloring Upholstery The Ashlee Simpson Show Color theory Wood Blond Tattoo Diamond enhancement Textile manufacturing Dragon Booster Hair Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Melanin Horse Textile manufacturing terminology Human skin color Thermal power station Joker (comics) Leather Laser hair removal Pittsburgh Steelers Color Geology of the Grand Canyon area Technicolor Wok The Ashes Polar Bear The Rasmus Red hair Paul Is Dead The Contender (television series) Staining (biology) Lake Playoff Kurt Cobain Green Day Tincture (heraldry) Flag of India Camouflage Potato Blonde on Blonde W.I.T.C.H.
