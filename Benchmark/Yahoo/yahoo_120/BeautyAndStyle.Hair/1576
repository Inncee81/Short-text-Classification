qualified hairdressers please advise me on highlighting my strawberry blonde hair i've got natural strawberry blonde hair and want to have pale blonde highlights for a summer look so today in sainsburys i bought this kit by clairol called born blonde highlights firstly what colour will my hair turn out to be on the back of the box it tells you what colour you'll get if you're already blonde or brunette but it doesn't mention red heads secondly do i apply it on wet hair dry hair clean hair dirty hair on the box it says 'do not apply to freshly washed hair' but my hair currently has frizz ease serum and hairspray on it so will the bleach get through these products or do i need to wash them out first it will tell you to apply on unwashed hair as it is best to have had a day or so of your scalps natural oils there to help protect your scalp from the bleach as for products it is best not to have any on but bleach will eat through all products so ultimately it doesn't really matter as for the highlights well i couldn't tell you if they will work or not as i have used the bleach and toners by clairol born blonde in the past but i have not heard of the highlights i am guessing because they were specifically made for otc use and i use the professional line strand tests are the best way to determine if a product will work or not and if so how long to leave it on to get the desired effect if i were you though if you really want to do this at home then i would take the colour back and pick up this one instead http www allcures com shared product asp id it is the best otc highlighter Shampoo Hair Blond Textile manufacturing Hair coloring Red hair Hydrogen peroxide Pamela Anderson Drug test Haircut Psoriasis Brush Dishwasher Joke Casting Linen The Inside The Ashlee Simpson Show Upholstery Dandruff Blood on the Tracks Pitaten Fluoride therapy Pottery Menstrual cup Paul Is Dead Tofu Comanche Blonde on Blonde Link (Legend of Zelda) Guinea pig Turquoise Polar Bear Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Baldness Leather Wood pulp Naive set theory Human skin color Acne Kodocha Aristasia Kurt Cobain Norway national football team Dishwashing Badly Drawn Kitties Burdock First aid Married... with Children Fecal incontinence Bleach (manga) Bob and George Kurt Angle Flag of India World Wide Web Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Michael Jackson HIV test Saved by the Bell Barbie Negima Ultramarine Jute Massage Kender Autopsy Japanese tea ceremony Professional wrestling match types Kimono Biodiesel Barrister Visual Basic Darryl Strawberry HyperText Transfer Protocol Dairy Laser hair removal Futurama (TV series - season 5) Microeconomics Perfect Dark Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Silence of the Lambs Eczema Hansel und Gretel Drawing Leaf The Rasmus Snooker Drill bit Characters in the Smurfs W.I.T.C.H.
