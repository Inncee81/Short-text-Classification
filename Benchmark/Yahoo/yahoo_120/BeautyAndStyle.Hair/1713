question for bald guys i am and balding very fast this is making me very very depressed plus i don't have a gf and never had one before for guys who are completely bald how did you deal with going bald well my friend you're not alone in this one just look around accept it and shake it off people have come a long way in the last twenty or so years punk rockers no longer offend the eye businessmen have begun to trade in the suit and tie for semi formal and casual attire it has been a slow and painfull process but the influence of marketing and hollywood pseudo perfection is starting to fall apart it is less and less important in the world to look a certain way true far too many people still go to the surgeons to build a better self some i will admit it does truly benefit psychologically and if that's the case good on them buy a set of trimmers keep it short and grow old as gracefully as possible your gonna save a whole bunch of time and money not having to fuss about you will stay cooler in the summer this doesn't mean it won't be an unsettling change but allowing yourself to become vain and pretentious brings with some seriously ugly karma as for the gf issue this self conscious thing your expressing is probably the root of that Supply and demand Religion Transsexuality Baldness Monetary policy Sharon Tate Economics Theodicy Law of value Theory of conduct The Death Gate Cycle Shawn Michaels Time Out of Mind Goodness and value theory Capitalism Sydney Harbour Bridge Social rule Microeconomics Great Depression Immortality Deflation (economics) Sin City Humphrey Bogart Keynesian economics Trade Causality Milton H.
