why do asian people have thinner and softer hair my assumption is its something in their diet what is it thx i have asian hair it used to be like oil slick pin straight but ever since th grade it got big volumnious curls not those small frizzy ratty ones i loveee it but actually there's this product by aveda it's a weightless moisturizer with lavender and it can make your hair almost resemble that of an asain's as long as you first straighten your hair really well first it must be completely straight and have no curls or knots or it won't work as well then apply enough of the product i suppose three squirts or so maybe a little more or less depending on the volume and type of your hair you can experiment with this although i just want to let you know that using too less of the product applied to your hair won't make it look as how should i put it 'asian ' while too much will make it look greasy into the palm of your hand then rub your hands together from then on apply it to your hair by rubbing your hair or running your fingers through your hair and don't wash it out it's not like a shampoo or anything it'd be more of a stay in conditioner so leave it in your hair for as long as you want your hair to look that way only wash it out when you are ready to wash your hair or take a shower or anything and if you want your hair like that again you'll have to straighten it reapply the product again each time hope that helps Shampoo Hair Haircut Textile manufacturing Aerial (dance move) Dreadlocks Wood Hair conditioner Psoriasis Saxophone Skin Carding Knife Dandruff Acne Curling Motor oil Violin Vector (spatial) Afro textured hair Sento Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Drill bit Upholstery Tofu Customs and etiquette of Japan Tattoo Aloe Cheese Drawing Weaving Mattress Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling match types Carnivorous plant Massage Japanese tea ceremony Textile manufacturing terminology Leaf Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Coir Bacon Breastfeeding Explosive material Baldness treatments Salad Fingers Hand Certified Nursing Assistant Prostate cancer Gilding Weightlessness Menstrual cup Black (people) Diving Poker jargon Fecal incontinence Hair coloring Japanese toilet Physical characteristics of the Buddha Stomach cancer Casting Toilet humour Internal ballistics Shaggy dog story Cruising (maritime) Milton H.
