dirty hair how come after i just wash my hair in the shower like hours half a day later it gets dirty is that normal or is it getting dirty to fast how do i fix it the more you wash it the greaser and dirtier it gets because you are striping your hair of its natural oils and in turn compensates by creating more oil my advice is wash it less frequently and you will find the less you wash it the less you will need to wash it it will probably look yucky for a while but leave it as long as you can between washes and it will look cleaner for longer guaranteed Social rule Textile manufacturing Greasers Hair color Codename: Kids Next Door 613 mitzvot Toilet Nuclear fallout Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina The Dirty Dozen Customs and etiquette of Japan Dandruff Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dry cleaning Fasting Onsen Roomba Tarantula Japanese tea ceremony Hair Brush Leather Sento Carburetor Bidet Menstrual cup Drill bit Flag of South Africa Knots Landing Rockers Shampoo Justification (theology) Diode Black belt (martial arts) Sock The Amazing Race Thermal power station Normal distribution Keeshond Coal Mud People Diesel engine Acne Sauna Psoriasis Dodge Charger Otter Comanche Cat coat genetics First aid Skin Japanese toilet Astronomy on Mars Washing machine Laci Peterson Upholstery Drain cleaner Carbon dioxide Ludwig van Beethoven Child sexuality Fuel injection Hair conditioner Horse Betting (poker) Jock itch Out of Gas Milton H.
