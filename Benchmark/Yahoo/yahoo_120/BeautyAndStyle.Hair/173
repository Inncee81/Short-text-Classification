what is the best thing i can do for my rough dry hair no matter how wet i get my hair when i want to shampoo it it is hard to lather my hair then when i go to put conditioner i haft to put a lot on and it still feels rough when it is dry after my shower it doesn't feel nearly as dry you have several options let's start with your shampoo know that a good lather although it is nice doesn't mean your shampoo isn't working if it's removing the oil and dirt off your scalp and hair follicles then it's working one of the best shampoos came out years ago had very minimal lather but it was the best product available unfortunately bcus ppl associate a rich lather with good cleaning it didn't sell as much as it should of but if the results are extremely tangled and dry hair then that particular brand is not good for your hair regardless of your hair type aside from extremely oily hair i is not necessary to shampoo daily you could be using a shampoo that's very harsh on your hair and is only adding to the dryness by stripping your hair of moisture so my suggesstion is to consult a stylist one who can physically examine your hair and shampoo and tell you whether or not the ph leel is damaging now your conditioner many products are labeled incorrectly as conditioners but are really only cream rinses that just detangle the hair not penerate the other layer of your hair and enter into the middle or if your hair fine you can be completely lacking the cortex so examine yoru conditioner to see that it does have the penetrating effect a salon provided deep coonditioning treatment maybe very beneficial to your hair they have hair repair packs that bost your hair with protein and moisture which work wonders or you can get a pure protein concetrate treatment which is also magic for your hair make sure to follow a routine of these deep conditioning treatments for a few weeks and you should see less dry hair avoid using a lot of heat in your hair avoid dramatic coloring using a lot of products that cause residue in oyur hair will only dry it out more hope i helped l Psoriasis Acne Dandruff Hair conditioner Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Shaving Tofu Brewery Baldness treatments Sento Fire extinguisher Dry cleaning Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Massage Diving suit Halitosis Upholstery Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Baldness Human skin color Depilation Thermal power station Leaf Fecal incontinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dog Stem cell Hair coloring Leather Insulin Explosive material Pubic hair Cheese Hemp Stomach cancer Skin Laser hair removal Puberty Eczema Coffee Stroke Moisturizer Rice Tooth enamel Drill bit Mattress Dishwasher Negima Otitis externa Lichen Herpes simplex virus Welding Air conditioning The Apprentice 2 Hair color Mummy Food preservation Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pitaten Bong Cancer Mesothelioma Radiation therapy Milk Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Textile manufacturing Chocolate Desert Phoebe Buffay's songs Carbon dioxide Guinea pig Ra (board game) Dairy Contact lens Diseases of the honeybee Sterilization (microbiology) Extreme Programming Electrical wiring Grunge music Diamond Wok Gelatin Dragon Booster Transformer Galactic Civilizations Theory of conduct Hydrotherapy
