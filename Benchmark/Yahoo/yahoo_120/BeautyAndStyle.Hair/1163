so i want to dye my hair blonde but the trouble is i already have brown dye on it from a few months ago what would happen if i put a different dye on top of that one would it be ok or would my hair turn like green or something basically should i wait till this dye comes out what your going to have to do is strip your hair which is basically stripping out the brown and putting a fresh color of blonde totally not worth it i stripped my hair wice already and now my hair is so ruined if you try to color it blonde with that color it might go a tad lighter but it's not going to look as what you see on the box stripping it is the only way to go but like it said so not worth it Hair color The Rasmus Hair Blond Hair coloring Technicolor The Inside Red hair Queen of Wands Mohawk hairstyle Horse Totally Spies!
