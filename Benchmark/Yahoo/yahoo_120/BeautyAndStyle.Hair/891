brunetteeee my hair color is pretty simple its a light shade of brown with natural highlights from the sun i don't like the lighter brown and i want to make the color richer since im tan it won't wash out my skin tone so how do i get a richer color do i color my whole head darker or just get some darker highlights i don't want any blonde highlights just different shades of brown plz help i think you should dye all of your hair a richer shade of your natural hair color you can get some golden brown and chocolate brown high low lights i think you should get it professionally done though just to make sure no mistakes are made which can look horrible and cost even more to get fixed in a salon good luck Hair color Human skin color Hair coloring Color theory Leather Blond Drawing Physical attractiveness Cigar Coffee Melanin Hair Horse Cat coat genetics Sunglasses Dog Link (Legend of Zelda) Eye color Red hair Polar Bear Skin Pubic hair Upholstery Dragon Booster Lighting Black (people) Camouflage Tanning Laser hair removal Shader Labrador Retriever Bock Soy sauce Diamond enhancement White (people) Complexion Shade Staining (biology) Race of Jesus Sunlight Fluorescent lamp Impressionism Color Wood Cocoa The Rasmus Lutein Ganguro Blue Rum Rococo Phong shading Pysanka Leaf Meriones unguiculatus Kimono Purple The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Technicolor Wolfrider Inkjet printer Madonna (entertainer) Sundial Potato New York Jets Carburetor Blacks and Mormonism Chesapeake Bay Retriever M&M's Diamond simulant Red Discus (fish) Light-emitting diode German Shepherd Dog Black L'Or__al Reservoir Dogs Cincinnati Bengals Titanium Marilyn Monroe RGB color model Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Coal Goomba Digital cinema El Goonish Shive Clothing The Stone Roses (album) Anodising Atari 8-bit family Tobacco Barbie Game Boy San Jose, California Made in the Shade Thermoregulation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pigment W.I.T.C.H.
