could you sew or glue into your hair one of those jessica simpson hairdo clipin extensions i have been thinking about getting extensions for quite some time and trying to figure out which of all the methods would be the best for me when a stylist mentioned jessica simpson's hairdo clip in extensions i said that i wanted something that would be a little more permenant and kinda stuck in my head for awhile so they said maybe we could just attach it in i had never heard of someone fixing the hairdo extensions in before so i was just curious if it would really last or work well opinions appreciated if you're going to sew anything into your hair get something that is made for it like a weave if you want hair extensions go to a hair supply store like sally's beauty supply and buy pre tipped hair extensions and go to a salon and have them put in hair extensions can damage your hair so i would suggest doing research on them i have clip in hair extensions and they look and feel fine and when i don't want to wear them i just take them out and they do no damage to my natural hair The Ashlee Simpson Show Wig (hair) Marilyn Monroe Textile manufacturing terminology Sewing machine Baldness Jessica Simpson Upholstery Clothing Dreadlocks Knife Autograph Kimono My Little Pony Ashlee Simpson Violin Autopsy Marge Simpson The Smoking Room Shaggy dog story Comanche Spidey Super Stories Fahrenheit 9/11 Asperger syndrome Earring Treehouse of Horror IX Kender Pubic hair Head Koopa Kid Dionysus Simone Weil Beavis and Butt-head Fashion design Wool Taxi Driver Nail (anatomy) Homer Simpson The Inside Kilt Bene Gesserit Paul Is Dead Shroud of Turin Dragon Booster Glossary of climbing terms The Beatles Pencil Simpson and Delilah Leaf Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Jessica Lynch Bart's Girlfriend Rose (Doctor Who) Climbing equipment Life and work of Ludwig van Beethoven Zhao Yun Three Stooges Meta-reference Springfield Elementary School Strap-on dildo Gwen Stefani Jerry Coleman Textile manufacturing Rudolf Hermann Lotze Roswell UFO incident Characters in the Smurfs Mohawk hairstyle Cello Hearing aid Bookbinding Fur Carpet Double bass Skinhead Downing Street memo Inheritance (computer science) Floppy disk Aphasia Cashmere wool Sideshow Bob Johnny Appleseed Fox hunting Weapon The Catcher in the Rye Go-Go boots Cryonics Napoleon Dynamite Bob and George Afro Hair (musical) Gender role Rain Man Headgear Prolog Beautiful Life RX-79 Series Mattress Henri Murger
