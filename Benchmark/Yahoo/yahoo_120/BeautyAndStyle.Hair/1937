why is my hair wavy well after a relaxer i had about weeks ago my hair is kind of wavy did i do something wrong and will getting a touch up help get rid of the waviness it depends on if it is turning wavy at the roots or on the ends of the hair if the ends are becoming wavy the relaxer more than likely did not get rid of the curl if the roots are wavy it is time for a touchup the safest way to do a touchup is to only get the relaxer on the roots when you go to cosmetology school they teach you to never get the relaxer on the ends because it will cause a lot of damage in reality most hairdressers have to get a little bit on the part that was already relaxed to make sure the hair is relaxed evenly it sounds like you needs a touchup because you should get a relaxer about every weeks anyway Haircut Cosmetology Harp Guinea pig Irish dance Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Hair Blood on the Tracks Urinary incontinence Shampoo Embouchure The Wotch Curling Gesture Brewery Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Characters in the Smurfs Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Keeshond Tarantula Theory of conduct Wolfrider Afrocentrism Cochlear implant Karen Horney Modernism Frankie Goes to Hollywood Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Real Love (song) Erogenous zone Portuguese Water Dog Music of the United States Preston, Minnesota Ancient Greek Felis sapiens Drill bit Bubble Bobble Physical characteristics of the Buddha Tonality Punctuation Katana President (game) Native American music Berkeley, California Music history of the United States 2000 Australian Grand Prix Music of California Parade (military) Ranma __ characters Waxing Textile manufacturing terminology Dream (DC Comics) Treehouse of Horror V Line (heraldry) Alcoholism Blues Jesus Nail (anatomy) Big Brother UK series 6 Pitaten Afro textured hair Undead (Discworld) Dominoes Snooker Menstrual cup Sub-Zero Tibetan people Sound Confessor (Sword of Truth) Hearing aid Kender Yoga Sutras of Patanjali XML Time Out of Mind Nichiren Japanese tea ceremony Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Tooth Fur Trichome Legacy of Kain Negima Milton H.
