need a new hairstyle do you have any good advice i have a brunette hairstyle that's ugly well it depends on how long your hair is lol if your hair is really short we cant really tell you that a long hair style will look nice so if you have short shoulder length hair perhaps try cutting it straight and keep it the same lenght and add highlights for the summer highlights will be nice if you have long hair you can try some long layers and possibly try the bump hair style with a pony tail maybe try putting your hair in a pony tail but split your hair before you do and split it not down the middle but from the side i usually do this and it looks cute depends on your face and all of that stuff good luck Haircut Equine conformation Mohawk hairstyle Teen Girl Squad Shaving Aerial (dance move) Mahoraba Emo fashion Mullet (haircut) Physical attractiveness Beard Professional wrestling throws Ponytail Volleyball Death rock fashion Skinhead Horse Poker jargon Knife Fast bowling The Pet Sounds Sessions My Little Pony Sport rowing Customs and etiquette of Japan Kimono Swingout Perl Skateboarding trick Leaf Heinkel He 100 Guinea pig Kodocha Sesshomaru Normal distribution Dragon Booster Pterosaur Strap-on dildo Totally Spies!
