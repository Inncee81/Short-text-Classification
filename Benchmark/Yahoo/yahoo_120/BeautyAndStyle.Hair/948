girls you are going dancing do you wear your hair down and straight or down and curly it depends on hair type some of my friends have naturally straight hair that does nothing after a night of dancing but slightly frizz or have a bit of static but if your hair texture is wavy or curly and you straighten it your hair will not stay straight after a night of dancing especially in the summer so it depends on preference and hair type some girls can do it and others find it annoying that their hair waves right back up after straightening Haircut Afro textured hair Fur Shampoo Dreadlocks Afro Tibetan people Aerial (dance move) Phoebe Buffay's songs Poodle Hair color Three Stooges Strap-on dildo Kimono Greco-Buddhist art Pitaten Wolfrider Drawing Swingout Hippie Portuguese Water Dog Leaf Characters in the Smurfs Hermione Granger Trichome Pubic hair Equine conformation Osamu Tezuka's Star System Snooker Squidward Tentacles Gender role Hair Napoleon Dynamite Kender Barbie Pok__mon Live!
