why did this happen okay this happened last year and im just curious why okay i visited china in that summer and on our vacation there we bought these perm products i forgot but it was this cream mix thing smells kinda like hair dye anyways i put it on my hair and wait mins to wash it off when i got out but hair was messy and tangled and i had to brush it it was hard for me to brush so then i combed it i saw hair began to come off with the comb so then i stopped and touched my head and there was spot where there was no hair only the roots okay do you know the reason why this happened my sister told me it was cuz my hair was weak but that was probably to make me feel better p s that was probably one of my terrifying scary sad moments asian hair products are usually made for the asian public asian people have much thicker and coarser hair than any other race which means their hair can handle stronger products unless it was meant for your hair type it wasn't a good idea to use it especially if you have african hair or fine caucasian hair natural blondes have fine hair of the time to see if you have fine hair wash your hair and put it into a ponytail wrap your fingers around the ponytail and if the diameter of your hair is smaller or as small as a dime you were definately not a good canidate for that product if you have weak hair like you say you probably aren't a good canidate either Hair Brush Textile manufacturing Pitaten Dreadlocks Cashmere wool Physical attractiveness Salad Fingers Hair color Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an White (people) Milton H.
