if you shave alot does your facial hair get darker and thick i knew a woman in a bunco group once who shaved every day she told us that she started plucking unwanted hairs along her chin line and soon she was plucking more and then it got to be her entire face that needed plucking so she borrowed her husbands' razor and had been shaving since when we'd see her on those once a month bunco nights she always had five oclock shadow with a darkened face below her eyes so i am inclined to believe what i saw and i know from my own experience that plucking blond hairs from my chin led to darker longer ones so i now have an entire chin of stray dark hairs to pluck once a week i would not be gin shaving and find myself with a five oclock shadow so i don't believe about shaving not darkening the beard it sure causes them too the only way to test their theory is to shave and see if you are in doubt then who will you sue Beard Shaving Depilation Hair Global Gillette Baldness Pubic hair Barber Moustache Haircut Black (people) Razor 613 mitzvot Three Stooges Physical attractiveness Puberty Blond Sideburns Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pseudofolliculitis barbae Social role of hair Effeminacy Goatee Kurt Angle Link (Legend of Zelda) Hair color The Ashlee Simpson Show Shroud of Turin Kodocha Marilyn Monroe Darken Rahl The Five Doctors Dog Race of Jesus Gothic rock Violin Guinea pig Joker (comics) Wolfrider Meriones unguiculatus Social rule Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shawn Michaels Payot Samson Johnny Appleseed Head shaving Solar eclipse Hulk Hogan Ron and Fez Dragon Booster Sunglasses Veil Laser hair removal The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Red hair Bonus Stage Double Dragon Blonde on Blonde Double bass Cheetah Leg shaving Headgear Artemis Entreri Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Melanin Midlands (Sword of Truth) The Citadel (Military College) Great Sphinx of Giza Ben Johnson (athlete) RuneScape quests Gothic fashion Crimson Chin Cat Human Geology of the Moon Coffee Princess Zelda Peter Gabriel Heinkel He 112 Tibetan people Lunar eclipse W.I.T.C.H.
