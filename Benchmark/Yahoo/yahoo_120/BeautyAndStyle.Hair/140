had my hair colored yesterday dont like it can i go back to salon and have them redo it it looks too coppery if its redone will it hurt my hair possibly call the salon and check my salon will fix it only if the sylist messed up if you picked the color and just decided you don't like it you may have to pay to have it corrected if they salon fixes it they will know if it will cause damage to your hair if it was lightened it could cause some damage it really depends exactly what was done to it and the product they use at the salon best to ask them Hair coloring Singlish Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Error correction and detection Highway 61 Revisited Negima Jacques-Louis David Social rule Hair (musical) Drawing Paul Is Dead Kimono Preston, Minnesota Super Mario Bros.
