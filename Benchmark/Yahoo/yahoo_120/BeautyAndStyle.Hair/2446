should i get a perm so i've had straight hair like pin straight not a wave in it and it's beautiful it's been glossy healthy full and very easy to manage however i've gotten so tired of the same old hair style and am seriously condisering getting a perm not s style mind you just loose curls but i know that i won't want this perm forever just a couple months or even a year but once i'm done will my hair grow back the same please those who have had perms before answer i don't want to make a big mistake o we always want what we don't have i would say not to perm your hair a perm is changing the chemical and physical bonds in your hair the bigger the rod used to perm your hair the less time the perm will stay in although the perm will eventually fall out its never out of your hair until it grows out your new hair will grow out the same as it does now i would recommend something that will take a little more time on a daily basis but will maintain the healthy condition of your hair something like hot rollers is a good way to add curl to your hair with out the damage you can try sleeping in rollers not hot ones to get some change going on with your style Haircut Hair Billboard Hot 100 Dreadlocks Textile manufacturing Hair conditioner Prostate cancer Aerial (dance move) Baldness treatments Guinea pig Tina Turner Puberty The Amber Spyglass Professional wrestling throws Anchor Chronic fatigue syndrome Tai Chi Chuan Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Breastfeeding Rod Stewart Gray Wolf Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual attraction Satchel Paige Baldness Dog Trish Stratus Shampoo Stomach cancer Brewery Leather Dolly Parton Kimi Finster Mattress Game show Dick Williams Shen Gong Wu Equine conformation The Ashlee Simpson Show Hypoglycemia Spice Girls Kender Barbie W.I.T.C.H.
