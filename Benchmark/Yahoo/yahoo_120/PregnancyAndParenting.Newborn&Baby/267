introducing solids i have a daughter who is just over months she is waking every few hours because she is always hungry no matter how much milk she drinks to me this would suggest she just isn't getting what she needs from the milk so i'm thinking about introducing solids she has been teething since months although teeth haven't come through yet i know solids as a rule aren't suppose to be introduced until months but i do think she needs it a little cereal at night at least did anyone else introduce solids early did it help thanks i have children and both of them i gave cereal in the morning and at night around months some people are very against this but speaking from experience my kids are completely healthy and it did help them if your daughter is waking up every few hours maybe the milk isn't satisfying her i would use mixed cereal or rice and mix it in with the formula in a bowl not in the bottle because it will just clog and give her about spoon fulls see how she likes it good luck i know the beginning is hard don't worry it get easier Breastfeeding Breakfast Breakfast cereal Milk Social rule Kosher foods Tooth Humphrey Bogart Plastic Bong Theory of conduct Salad Fingers The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Singlish Scooby-Doo Ron and Fez Characters in the Smurfs Little Britain Fiddler on the Roof Tea Quaker Oats Company Rice Krispies Chocolate Jewish cuisine Insomnia Philosophical skepticism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ice cream The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fancy rat Trailer Park Boys Fecal incontinence Rice pudding Coeliac disease Survivor (novel) The Shining (film) Cheese The Flintstones Television in the United States Futurama (TV series - season 5) African American Vernacular English Porridge Dairy Nestl__ Nesquik Infant formula Camp Lazlo Prince Edmund (Blackadder) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Knots Landing Happy Meal Domestic rabbit Kitten RuneScape quests Avenue Q Ben Johnson (athlete) Time Out of Mind M&M's Russian joke Shaggy dog story Soy milk Cultural relativism New Coke Russian cuisine Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Burger King Corn flakes FoxTrot Idli Soft drink Cuisine of the Philippines Good Morning, Vietnam Cheerios Kender Mountain Dew Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Ontological argument Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Edgar Cayce Nestl__ Hansel und Gretel Kodocha Hiberno-English Yoko Ono Urinary incontinence Nestl__ boycott The Death Gate Cycle Alcoholic beverage Diarrhea Kix (breakfast cereal) Customs and etiquette of Japan Haven (TNG episode) Full English breakfast Procrastination The Strangerhood Peruvian cuisine Cap'n Crunch Drink Malcolm in the Middle
