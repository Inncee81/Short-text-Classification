how often does your baby poop i am curious to see how often your children go in a day my month old son is on good start formula concentrate not powder and he will typically go only once which freaks us out a bit sometimes he misses his poop and will go once every other day my friend's kids go all day long but they are on different formulas or breastmilk exclusively i know i shouldn't worry because it is always soft but i just know that my husband and i used to poop all the time as infants when he was breastfed his poops were explosions very weird could it be a sign of something not working right the good start dha supreme in the usa he is on was recommended by his doctor it says its from months old my son was on goodstart also and until he was about a weeks old every other diaper contained a stool his dr said it was normal until his body could adjust to actually being fed he was weeks premature after that he'd go either once a day or twice a day he is now months old and goes times a day and yes sometimes he skips a day just as he did when he was on formula your son is fine just because your poop was explosive doesnt mean your sons will be after all every baby is different unless your son cries when he attempts to pass a stool and its hard or blood tinged dont worry if something wasnt working right in that area you'd have known before months Breastfeeding Jaundice Childbirth Infant formula Infant Fecal incontinence Fertility awareness Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Infantilism Feces Baby bottle Toilet humour Docosahexaenoic acid Premature birth Nestl__ boycott Dietary fiber Diaper Pitaten Elimination communication Kimberly-Clark Corporation Cephalic disorder Breast milk Protein-energy malnutrition Cytomegalovirus Drill bit International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Omega-3 fatty acid Androgen insensitivity syndrome Kimi Finster Breech birth Coeliac disease Glycogen storage disease type I Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Milk Abortion in the United States Atomic Kitten Menstrual cycle Folic acid Mnemonic Tocopherol Chair Vitamin D House of M Tobacco advertising Knots Landing Thermal power station Baby Blues Medical analysis of circumcision Pet skunk Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hearing impairment Sudden infant death syndrome Obstetrics Stomach cancer Hypoglycemia Social rule AIDS FoxTrot National Football League Food allergy Miscarriage Sex assignment Chris Candito Unemployment Adjustable gastric band Kodocha Babe Ruth Super Size Me Nutrition Baby transport Anemia Prostate cancer Blood (computer game) Schistosomiasis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Situation comedy Formula One regulations Piccolo Junior Saga Rickets Radiation therapy Brewery Prolactinoma Vampire Sento Veganism First Battle of the Atlantic Gastroenteritis Hall & Oates Kylie Minogue One Life to Live Breast Vegeta Prenatal diagnosis Nestl__ Stuttering Carburetor Metroid (video game species)
