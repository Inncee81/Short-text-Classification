at what age do you start teaching the baby to sleep in its crib my babies hate to sleep in their crib their months old i tried to make them cry in their crib till their sleep but i dont know for how long do you let them cry and is it too early to let them cry teaching them they want to sleep in their swings my arms and bouncers more any by the way once i pick them up they stop crying and when i put them down in their cribs they cry what can i do sounds like you have spoiled them already start putting them in their cribs more often and give them toys to chew on so they get more comfortable with it you have to learn to be the one in control and not let them control you which you are doing now if you don't change this now you will end up with some serious problems as they grow up go take some parenting classes so you know how to deal with the various problems talk with the babies doctor about classes or check with your local college church hospital or ymca for classes it's best to go somewhere where they can observe you in action and teach you what works well and what doesn't so you can correct things early on when you put them in their crib don't keep your place completely quiet or every little noise will wake them have a tv or radio going in the other room run the vacuum or whatever you need to do so they grow accustomed to noises and will learn to sleep through most of them advice from my wise mother i was brought up with noises around me and have no problem sleeping through the noise of a tv or radio but my husband was brought up in a quiet atmosphere and wakes at every little sound so i found out my mother knew what she was talking about you don't want them to be too loud but enough that they grow accustomed to noise while sleeping Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Sudden infant death syndrome Kodocha EastEnders Jam (TV series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog training Cribbage Childbirth The Amber Spyglass Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Urinary incontinence Humphrey Bogart Sin City Kender Dream Housebreaking Avenue Q Milton H.
