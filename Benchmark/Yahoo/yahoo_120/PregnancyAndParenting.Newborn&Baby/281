booster seat my son is now months old and and weighs about or pounds i was curious when you put them in a booster seat dont worry i'm not trying to put him in one just wondering in order to move up to a booster seat they should be around lbs i believe what you are talking about is the 'convertible' seats that double as a harness seat and a booster seat in that case they should be lbs and year old although i switched mine earlier due to them being very tall and pushing the seat behind the carseat pushing it out of a safe position anyway those have harnesses for when they are little and then you can take out the harness and use it with a regular seat belt Car safety Pound Strap-on dildo Baby transport Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Internal ballistics John Stapp Space Shuttle program Crash test dummy Galileo spacecraft Singlish Mercury 4 Harness racing Pneumatics MG42 Browning Model 1919 machine gun M16 (rifle) Ariane 5 Hobie cat Tractor Seat belt Scuba set Saturn V Dragon Booster M60 machine gun Boom Town (Doctor Who) Paragliding Airbag Personal flotation device Seat belt legislation Casualty lifting Transformers: Cybertron Swingout Owen Hart MegaMan Battle Network 5 Boeing X-43 Textile manufacturing Iditarod Piccolo Junior Saga Johnny 5 Richard Feynman Cruising (maritime) Travel trailer Mixed martial arts Page Falkenberg TGV Ben Johnson (athlete) Parachute World War I Steam engine RuneScape quests Great Pyramid of Giza Weight Mitsubishi 3000GT Equine conformation Mars probe program RuneScape Mini-Games Elevator Corran Horn Porsche 911 Space disaster S-75 Dvina 1957 World Series Booster Gold Elvis and Me STS-114 Nimzo-Indian Defence Handloading Switch Roller coaster Professional wrestling throws Mercury Atlas 6 STS-51-L Energy development Mid-Autumn Festival Wheel of Fortune B unit Shot put M-10003-6 Fire fighting Space shuttle main engine Space Race Milton H.
