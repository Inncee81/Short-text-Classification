do month olds really know what they want okay so this is really just to see what your opinions are many tell me that a month old can not possible know what they want i beg to differ my months old son cries when he wants fed his diaper changed or attention now the attention part is really funny for my son because on ocassion through out the day he will cry and cry and cry until we put him on his throne it''s the part between the cushions on the couch that are perfect for proping up babies so they don't go side to side as soon as we do this he's fine at other times he will not stop crying until his dad picks him up or at certain times of the day he wants me instead of his dad he also will cry until i walk him around or prop him up in my lap to look around i love it he is so much fun but when peole say that a baby doesn't know what they want i think that they confuse it with that the baby doesn't care well thats just a theory in the works right now my month old knows what he wants he's got different noises he makes for different things ive learned these noises so i usually know what he wants hes so funny he'll be in the bouncy seat sitting up with the rest of us adults watching tv we'll be talking if he feels left out he'll start fussing its like hes saying im here too dont forget about me lol and he likes to watch tv but when commercials come on he fusses as soon as the show starts again hes quiet its funny my son wants to be a big kid soooo bad already if hes fussing i'll hold him to where hes sitting up or put his feet down on my belly so he can stand up he immediatly stops fussing looks around he cant stand to be laying down if hes awake he wants to be doing stuff i think its funny how they seem to know what they want at such a young age how the parents just know what to do to make baby happy i know he cant be thinking im hungry i want to eat now but somehow he 'knows' does that make sense Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
