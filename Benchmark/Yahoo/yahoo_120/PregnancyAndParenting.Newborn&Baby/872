what can i do to calm down my newborn with acid reflux try to keep him in an upright position as much as possible especially after feedings you could try feeding him half as much twice as often prop his sleeping surface up about degrees so his head is higher than his feet my son slept in his car seat for a long time but ask your doctor about it first you can try over the counter gas drops you can ask your doctor about getting a prescription acid reducer if you're feeding formula you could also ask about switching that frequent burping burp during feeding after each ounce or two that's what they say but honestly this did not work for my son he would quit eating as soon as he burped the first time you can try it it probably works for some you can try baby massage especially a tummy massage rub the stomach in a semi circle starting at the bottom right working up to the top and ending at the bottom left you can try pushing the legs up to the chest and then all the way back down to straight both at the same time and then alternate somewhat like a bicycle it seems to help relieve the gas i can't explain it the best maybe there's a website i'll edit if i can find one good luck they do grow out of it i hope you have lots of supportive people around i know how stressful it can be Breastfeeding Burping Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Childbirth Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling aerial techniques Backstroke Massage Professional wrestling attacks Fire fighting Recumbent bicycle Mattress Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Swingout Gastroesophageal reflux disease Breaststroke Siphon Diving Water (molecule) Drill bit Hypoglycemia Anatomical terms of location Internal ballistics Hair Clinical depression Breech birth Rugby union positions Suplex Front crawl Chair Bicycle Obesity Medical prescription Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Skateboarding trick Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Motor oil Bloat The Contender (television series) Textile manufacturing Insomnia Bicycle frame Comanche Piccolo Junior Saga Gas metal arc welding 2000 Australian Grand Prix Caffeine Thermal power station Fast bowling Cancer of the larynx Acne Four-stroke cycle Electric motor Care Bears Veganism Reflexology Butterfly stroke Poker jargon Cheese Omega-3 fatty acid 1957 World Series Cannabis (drug) Anxiety Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Suicide methods Fibromyalgia Shaggy dog story Manicure Cat Carpal tunnel syndrome Infant Flatulence Hydrogen peroxide Vampire Welding Fertility awareness 2004 World Series Alcohol fuel Coeliac disease First aid Naval mine Physical therapy Gray Wolf Eyeglass prescription Adjustable gastric band Asthma Aquatic ape hypothesis Swimming The Amazing Race Alcohol Cocaine Reflux Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Diving suit Counter Yarrow
