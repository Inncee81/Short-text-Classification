my newborn weeks old is always like gasping for air i don't know if it's that he has to burp or what but it's when he inhales it sort of sounds congested but he isn't it's fast breathing and he does it for a while he doesn't do it when he's sleeping though anyone have any idea what this is and how i can treat it i am not too sure but when does it happen when he is feeding newborn breathing is irregular breaths per minute not like adult but it may indicate some difficulties with breathing if it happens when feeding feeding can take a lot of energy out of babes which may explain why he doesn't do it when sleeping again i am not too sure but if you are concerned i would ask your doc Pneumonia Sleep apnea Hypoglycemia Burping Theory of conduct Elephant Infant Respiratory rate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carbon dioxide Liquid breathing Guinea pig Childbirth Diving Hydrogen sulfide Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Diving regulator Kangaroo Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Fire fighting Garfield Aquatic ape hypothesis Cocaine Rebreather Rapid eye movement Tetrapod Infant respiratory distress syndrome Breastfeeding Cat Shaggy dog story Breath Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Drowning Asphyxia Clomipramine Triage The Midnight Sun Decompression sickness Time Out of Mind Breathing gas Cetacea Whale Mechanical ventilation Nasal congestion Emphysema Soul Ranma __ characters First aid Xenon Traumatic brain injury Hiberno-English Back to the Future Breath of Fire III Urinary incontinence Pranayama The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Late Night with Conan O'Brien Hippopotamus Emperor Penguin Cluster headache Bart chalkboard gags Bird Cyanide Bong Pitaten 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Animism Karma Duchenne muscular dystrophy Congestive heart failure Hypothyroidism Extreme Programming Firefighter Duesberg hypothesis Famous last words Botulism Giraffe Snoring Vampire Atrial fibrillation Equine conformation Sin City Futurama (TV series - season 5) Diazepam Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Little Britain Cardiac arrhythmia Monster Rancher monsters Tyrannosaurus rex Carbon disulfide Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Jaundice Electrophysiology The Shining (film) Fan death Angel One (TNG episode)
