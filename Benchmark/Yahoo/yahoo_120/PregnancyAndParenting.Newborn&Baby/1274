is it ok to give an infant benadryl for a cold i know a girl and she claims that a doctor prescribed her benadryl for her months old cold but i have never heard of a docotor prescribe benadryl for a cold much less anything else for that matter if i have a toddler and the doctor prescribed him benadryl when he was two and that was because he was having a lot of trouble sleeping cause hes father was away on a mission has anyone ever heard of this and if so how much would you give a month old also she gives it to him constantly i think under a year you're supposed to be real careful with medicines if her doctor prescribed it then fine but she may not be following the doctor's instructions if she's giving it to him all the time when my daughter had a stuffy nose at about months my doctor said there wasn't too much i could do about it the only medicines i give are for gas or infant's tylenol when she started teething Childbirth Medicine Fertility awareness Sleep apnea Physician Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Nasal congestion Homeopathy Psoriasis Little Britain Naturopathic medicine General practitioner Common cold Sigmund Freud Buprenorphine Father's Day (Doctor Who) Breastfeeding Characters in the Smurfs Stomach cancer Quackery Group A streptococcal infection Podiatrist Salah Dimenhydrinate Death Note Publicly funded medicine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mystique (comics) Doxylamine Gender role Psychiatry Triage Le Malade imaginaire Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Sleeping Murder Pediatrics Osteopathy The Ashlee Simpson Show Traditional Chinese medicine Chinese University of Hong Kong Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
