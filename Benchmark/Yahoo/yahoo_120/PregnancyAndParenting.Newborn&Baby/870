month old hates stroller i have a stroller travel system where the car seat fits into the stroller when he's an infant then he can sit in it like a big boy with a tray in front of him when he's bigger he is now months and curious about the world i never had any problems with him in the carseat portion of the stroller he loved it now that i have started to put him in the regular seat of the stroller he hates it he arches his back tries to turn over in it and goes nuts he doesn't like to sleep in there anymore either this makes it very hard to take him out anywhere i want him to look at things other than just my face and see what the world is all about honestly if that carseat with him in it wasn't so heavy i'd stick it out but i honestly can't take it with winter approaching i want him to be happy sitting in the stroller the 'normal' way so i don't have to deal with tantrums in feet of snow anyone have any advice is this a phase or do i seriously need to look at another stroller the stroller i have is actually an umbrella stroller when its being used in its 'normal' mode i try putting him in a full recline or fully erect positions and in between and he hates it my guess would be that he liked the snugness of the carseat and that he doesn't feel safe in the bigger open stroller i would get an insert for the stroller like a bundle me a sheepskin liner or just use a rolled up thin blanket around his head shoulders like a head support and maybe one around his feet too so that he feels safer Baby transport Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) M16 (rifle) Professional wrestling throws Car safety Hiawatha Line Chair B-47 Stratojet Equine conformation Mattress Swingout Tire Poker jargon EastEnders 2000 Australian Grand Prix Glossary of climbing terms Casualty lifting The nature of God in Western theology Basic English Childbirth IBM PC compatible Backstroke Cliff Richard Breaststroke W.I.T.C.H.
