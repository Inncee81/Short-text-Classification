how do i teach my son to self soothe my son is now months old he was never allowed to cry by his father now i have convinced my husband that self soothing is okay it's coming up on years that i haven't had a decent night's sleep i'm sick of getting up or times a night just to cover him and rub his back for him to get back to sleep i've started the self soothing during the day he eats drinks his cup of whatever change the diaper and i put him in his crib for him to take his nap i leave the room sometimes and at times he will cry for a few minutes and be out other times he will cry for or more minutes for me to come and get him but he is months old and needs a nap during the day i hate hearing him scream like he's in pain when i know everything is okay i'm scared the neighbors will complain cause he's screaming like he does when he wants my attention am i doing it right or is it a lost cause p s we are moving soon and he will not be in the room with us anymore i don't want him to be spoiled he thinks when he cries he gets whatever he wants so he's starting to cry and scream for everything he wants he's already starting that and i want to stop it before it gets too bad i don't understand why moms have decided that everytime your baby cries he absolutely needs something i don't believe in letting a baby cry it out for more than a few minutes but i also don't think that every time my baby cries he has a need that absolutely has to be met at that moment the whole argument crying is the only way he can communicate so if he is crying he's telling you he needs something is sometimes completely false i've seen toddlers and children who are able to communicate cry sometimes because it's late at night and they are grouchy seriously even adults get grouchy sometimes have you ever seen a mom or dad tell a year old it's time to go to bed usually they whine and cry because they don't want to go to bed a baby can be fussy because he is overly tired and needs to take a nap i know my baby and i know what he needs the key is to determine what the crying is about if he's crying because he's hungry that is a cry that abslutely needs to be met if he's crying because he needs to be held absolutely hold him and love him if he's crying because he's grouchy and fighting sleep then it's ok to let him cry it out once again if he's truly crying due to a need for a nap he should only cry it out for a few minutes and then he will go to sleep if he cries for more than say minutes he might be crying for other reasons that need to be addressed it seems like you are a caring mother who loves their child but does not want him to become spoiled follow your motherly instincts learn what his cries mean and you will for sure make the right decisions Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Shining (film) Avenue Q Friends About a Boy Miss Saigon Pitaten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Phoebe Buffay's songs The Marshall Mathers LP The Amber Spyglass The Contender (television series) Night (book) Ron and Fez The Catcher in the Rye The Subtle Knife The Inside 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Kodocha Breastfeeding The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
