breastfeeding baby poop ok this is actually more than just a poo question it is a long story bear with me and thanks in advance my six week old son has just recently days has had the normal yellow seedy poop but with a little mucus in it i read up on it allover the net and seems he may have an allergy or sensitivity from what i gather it says on most sites to contact the pediatrician well his doc is very unsupportive of breastfeeding and i plan to switch doctors after his month shots none of the other docs can get me in until long after these are due and i don't want to jepordize him getting these we have had issues with slow weight gain but for the past weeks he hs gained ounces a week but is still a little small for weeks he is happy and dosen't seem to be in any pain whatsoever he sleeps good and has plenty of wet diapers his doc allready triedd to get me to supplement even gave me free formula which i wanted to throw at her i of course refused the offer and kept b f i feel like she is not goin to help at all and will probably hassle me about his weight and make me feel incompetent shes very uneducated in the b f field and has given me a lot of poor info what would you do i'd never do anything to jepordize my baby should i just slowly elimnate foods or could this be more serious even though he smiles and seems very comfortable even during these bowel movements help your pediatrician is unsupportive of breast feeding get rid of this person this is an old fashioned and dangerous attitude also if you can't get your baby to another doctor for a check up say that he is sick mucous in a diaper should be enough to get you in for health reasons many doctors schedule well baby checkups in advance to reserve space for sick kids you should check this out if your child is sick breast milk is the best thing for him shots can wait shots should wait if your baby might be sick if fact if your baby has a stomach bug he cannot be immunized i didn't immunize my daughter until she was because she had cousins who had seizures when immunized as infants my daughter had a hard time gaining weight too your pediatrician should be helping you to solve this not giving you a bad time i did have to supplement for a short time but there are many formulas to choose from i chose an organic brand with no hormones with the advice of a lactation specialist and counselors at la leche i never would have taken the free sample just because it was free so i understand why you wanted to throw it at her i actually did fire my baby's first pediatrician because of his narrow minded views follow your gut on this maternal instinct is real as long as your baby isn't losing weight there's little to worry about if he seems happy and has plenty of wet diapers there are many techniques to increase your own milk supply which made it so i no longer had to supplement contact a lactation specialist at any hospital and the la leche league they have plenty of good sound proven advice on breast feeding hurdles Childbirth Urinary incontinence Milk Infantilism Fertility awareness Infant formula EastEnders Cancer Tocopherol Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Breast Protein-energy malnutrition Diarrhea Cat Guinea pig Chronic fatigue syndrome Allergy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pregnancy Diaper Theory of conduct Nipple Poker jargon Cytomegalovirus Nutrition Nestl__ boycott History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Nipple piercing Prolactin Social rule Publicly funded medicine Vitamin D Breast milk Crohn's disease Coeliac disease Brassiere Health insurance Abortion Premature birth Omega-3 fatty acid Insulin Breast pump Recurring South Park characters Dieting Ulcerative colitis The Shining (film) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Clinical depression Sharon Tate Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Atkins Nutritional Approach Kodocha Pediatrics Controversies in autism Medicine Days of our Lives Medical prescription Medical analysis of circumcision Night (book) Pitaten Apollo 8 Conker's Bad Fur Day Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Psoriasis Traumatic brain injury YuYu Hakusho Anorexia nervosa Malaria The Catcher in the Rye Tuberculosis Prenatal diagnosis Equine conformation Joke Ayurveda Insomnia Radiation therapy Charmed Boston Public Mattress Traumatic incident reduction Transsexuality Sin City Jaundice
