how much should a month old baby eat and how often my baby is weeks old and she eats oz every hours and she's starting to get pretty chunky i was just wondering if she is eating to much and how much most week old babies eat that sounds right to me although every child is different some eat more and some eat less if she seems satisfied then it's fine if not then give her more if she pulls away or acts uninterested before the bottle is done then it's to much your little girl will let you know how much is enough if you are truly worried that she's getting chunky then ask your dr if she is still in a good range for her age and height please remember that babies need the extra fat s so they can grow healthy and strong they grow so much the first year usually triple their birth weight by their first birthday incredible isn't it keep up the good work i hope this helped Breastfeeding Kodocha Kit Kat Childbirth Social rule Mnemonic Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo Junior Saga Jon Secada Elephant Puberty Humphrey Bogart Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Chinese New Year Sesame Street Ron and Fez Negima Birth weight Atkins Nutritional Approach Comanche EastEnders Pregnancy Milk Super Size Me The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Tasmanian Devil YuYu Hakusho Koala Persona (video game) Blood on the Tracks Homer Simpson Cliff Richard Baby Blues Egg (food) Spirited Away Anorexia nervosa Cuisine of Denmark Hamster Guinea pig The Incredibles Santa Claus Body mass index Ben Johnson (athlete) One Piece minor characters Drawn Together Binge eating disorder Friends Charmed Hall & Oates Stomach cancer Generation Y Gwen Stefani Elvis and Me The Fairly OddParents Garfield Frankie Laine Infantilism Teen Girl Squad Invader Zim Fancy rat Pok__mon Live!
