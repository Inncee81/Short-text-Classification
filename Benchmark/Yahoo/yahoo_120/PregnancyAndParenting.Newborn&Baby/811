how to give prilosec to my weeks old and how long to see the result my daughter is weeks with silent reflux she was given zantac which didn't help so now she's on prilosec how can i give her the medicine can i mix it with milk anyone been in this situation can you help me and also how long will it take to see the results i'm really worried n worn out sorry for all this confusion i have already talked to her doctor i was only asking other mommies how to give it to her coz the doc said to give it by dropper syringe and she doesnt like it so i was wondering if i could mix it with her bottle and how long till i see the results anyone who has been through this would be helpful thanks i went through the same thing with my son first i would call the pharmicist and ask if they added any flavors to the medication with my son's meds they put it into a suspension and didn't add any flavors to mask the taste and trust me it tasted just like if i had chewed the pill itself if they didn't flavor it ask if they could and bring it in personal experience with my gremlin is bubble gum if it already flavored then the best way is to do it the same way as a pet unfortunately open her mouth and stick the syringe as far back into her mouth without choking her squirt it in and pinch her nose she will automatically swallow to clear her throat so she can breath miserable and she'll fight it but the benefits of the meds is more important good luck might also consider checking her out at the local childrens hospital gastro intestinal specialist my pediatrician tried to tell me my son was just refluxing and give him the meds it ended up that it wasn't reflux at all it was an allergy to his formula and he needed to be on a special formula with the proteins already broken down for him Breastfeeding Gastroesophageal reflux disease Chewing gum Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Oral sex Asthma Traumatic brain injury Halitosis Medicine Tea Babe Ruth Coeliac disease Brewery Pneumonia Drowning Allergy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Gaia Online Adjustable gastric band Bread Garfield Happy Tree Friends Bubblegum Kodocha Beer 1957 World Series The Inside Tobacco Intravenous therapy Food allergy Cancer of the larynx Heartburn Coffee Ebola 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fancy rat One Piece minor characters Tobacco smoking Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypoglycemia Shaggy dog story Common cold Cuisine of Denmark Milton H.
