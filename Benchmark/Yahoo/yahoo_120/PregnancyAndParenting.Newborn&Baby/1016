two dogs and a baby in an apartment how am i going to manage me and my husband our expecting our first baby we live in an apartment with dogs im really worried about how im going to manage walking the dogs enough when i have a baby the dogs need to go out to use the bathroom about every hours and need two long walks a day how am i going to take the dogs to the bathroom i cant leave the baby inside alone while i walk the dogs and the baby will be born this december so i dont think i can take the baby with me everytime they have to go when my husband is home it wont be a problem but he is gone about hours a day has anyone else had dogs and a baby in an apartment how did you manage any advice will really help thanks getting rid of the dogs is out of the question i love ivy b's answer you have months to train your dogs to walk with you and a stroller or sling though i realize that in december it will be cold and you won't want the baby going outside each time must your dogs go potty every hours many dogs are physically capable of waiting longer than that maybe you can start trying to push it out a bit between now and december if you can get them to you'll only have to take them out once while home alone with baby do it before hubby leaves once mid day and as soon as hubby gets home for the time that you're home alone if it's just too cold to take baby with you then put him in his crib and take the monitor with you and walk the dogs very quickly dogs are very important members of the family i realize but never more important than your child i'd start getting them used to the new schedule and the shorter mid day walk now dogs are very adaptable they'll do just fine Breastfeeding Avenue Q Dog training The Inside Atomic Kitten Characters of Lost Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Social rule Housebreaking Philip J.
