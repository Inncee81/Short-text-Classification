to all ladies who have delivered a baby vaginally i went to a childbirth preparation class with my husband a few weeks ago and the instructor said that when i get to the stage during labor when the baby is crowning that there might come a point where the doctor will ask me if i want an episiotomy or if i want to try to push her out naturally and risk tearing so my question is is it common to tear or need an episiotomy to get the baby out and if it is then which one would did you choose i know this can be a touchy subject but i am really concerned about it and the best way for me to allay my fears is to hear from women who have gone through it already starting around weeks you could try massaging your perineum the area around your vagina daily perineal massage may increase the area's stretching ability leading to less need for an episiotomy and fewer natural tears try this technique yourself with clean hands and trimmed nails or have your partner do it for you if you're going solo have a large mirror handy so you can see what you're doing and to help familiarize yourself with your perineal area sit in a semi reclined position in a warm comfortable area spreading your legs apart lubricate your fingers thumbs and perineal area with vitamin e oil from punctured vitamin e capsules pure vegetable oil or personal lubricant don't use baby oil mineral oil or petroleum jelly place your thumbs about to inches to or just past your first knuckle inside your vagina and spread your legs press down toward the rectum and toward the sides at the same time gently and firmly continue stretching until you feel a slight burn or tingling hold this stretch for about two minutes until the tingling starts to subside now slowly and gently massage the lower part of the vagina back and forth hooking your thumbs onto the sides of your vagina and gently pulling the tissue forward as your baby's head will do during delivery keep this up for three to four minutes finally massage the tissue between the thumb and forefinger back and forth for about a minute be gentle because a vigorous touch could cause bruising or swelling during the massage avoid pressure on the urethra urinary opening as this can lead to irritation or infection of course perineal massage isn't for everyone and it may not help in every case the most important thing you can do is to choose a midwife or doctor who's experienced and comfortable delivering babies without doing episiotomies in general midwives tend to perform this surgery less often than physicians regardless of the type of practitioner you choose discuss your wishes and expectations with that person before the birth Prostate cancer Intersex surgery Anal sex Massage Fecal incontinence Fisting Female genital cutting Professional wrestling holds Condom Strap-on dildo Carpal tunnel syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Masturbation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) First aid Milton H.
