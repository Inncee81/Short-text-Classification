how long do i wait i posted this here b c i get more replies my fiance have a month old we've been fighting like crazy since we brought him home he doesnt want to communicate about our relationship i want some more help from him with the baby he works hours a week so thinks i should do everything monday i left and me and my baby are at my mom's house i tried calling to talk he never called back he just doesnt want to talk to me so i don't know if he's saying he needs time how long do i wait for him to figure things out before i file for child support and find day care etc he wil not talk at all no counseling nothing talking isn't an option so how long he is just probably feeling like in second place because the baby needs more attention right now i would recomend that one day just leave the baby with your mom and invite him to lunch or dinner and try to talk think over dont call him bacause he will know is you the one calling just show up and tell him lets go to lunch or dinner a place quiet where u can talk and if he does not show any interest i guess thats a sign that he does not want anything to do with u or the baby and file for child support i know is hard but you have to concentrate in ur baby if he doesnt show interest hope everything works ok Atomic Kitten Shaggy dog story Kodocha Ron and Fez Social rule The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Laura Schlessinger Humphrey Bogart Hollyoaks Friends Jon Secada Phoebe Buffay's songs EastEnders Single certification Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Cindy Sheehan Sharon Tate Plame affair Rosa Parks Yom Kippur War Futurama (TV series - season 2) AFI 100 Years series Bringing It All Back Home Pitaten Oasis (band) Baby Blues Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tag John Sheridan (Babylon 5) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Malcolm in the Middle Calvin and Hobbes Kimi Finster The Family from One End Street Christmas worldwide Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blankets (graphic novel) Infantilism Beetle in an Anthill Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Treehouse of Horror V Jennifer Lopez Kurt Cobain Sydney Riot of 1879 Calvin Coolidge Grandview, U.S.A.
