month old daughter with pubic hair we took our month old to her pediatrician yesterday and she noticed that her breasts were slightly enlarged she said it might be normal but if they get larger before her month appointment to come in for testing when i got home i started researching premature thelarche and found that infants with pubic hair are more likely to have tumors etc my daughter has fine peach fuzz that is very light in color in her pubic area she was pretty hairy when she was born preterm but it has all since fallen out the rest of her hair is brown should i be concerned about this fuzz and should i take her back to her doctor sooner appointment with pediatric endocrinologist or wait and see if the hair darkens breasts grow serious answers only if you're just going to tell me to go to the doctor dr kumar whatever then don't bother answering i want to hear from other people who've seen or heard of this before not people who have no idea what i'm talking about and she saw the doctor yesterday the doctor examined her with her diapers off she didn't notice it and that's why i'm asking if i'm just being paranoid about this slight peachy fuzz my ds has peach fuzz too if the dr examined her with her dipe off and didn't say anything it probably isn't anything to worry about but i'm also a firm believer in trusting your mommy instincts if you think something is wrong just call and ask if you can talk to the dr over the phone they should be able to put your mind at ease or tell you to come in again Puberty Androgen insensitivity syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Delayed puberty Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Cancer Hair Milton H.
