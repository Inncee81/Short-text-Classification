milk formula hi right my and a half month old baby boy is a hungry baby and is not happy on the regular milk formulas so we put him on sma white hungry baby as we did for our first baby girl he then became conspipated so we kept giving water and still didnt work we was then advised by health visitor to change to one that worked so we tried cow and gate but it didnt fill him up and was always hungry has anyone had same problems and if yes then what milk worked for them as we are running out of ideas thanks hi i think he could be overfed babies this age have very tiny stomachs and have to be fed every hour or two i would give him or oz every two hours and see how he does it is too early to give cereal in my opinion but if you decide to then make sure it is thin in consistency because thick will make him constipated don't give too much water because all he needs is formula now also remember that crying does not mean that he is hungry necessarily he could be just crying because he wants to be held or for another reason experiment a little to see if it is something else my daughter was a very fussy baby those first few months and looking back i think i was overfeeding her i just thought if she was crying it meant she was hungry but later i realized that she just liked to be held constantly and cuddled and talked to she is still this way and at months she is still sleeping with us at night and our month old son prefers his own crib and to be left alone in his own room go figure they all have different needs and the best thing to do is experiment and see what works also another tip try letting your baby sleep in an elevated position in a carrier and see if it helps with the colic and makes him calmer but try to stick with feeding small amounts more frequently he may even sleep better my mother in law told me that if you give a fussy baby a few little spoons of vanilla ice cream it will help with colic it has worked for me before especially when i was at my wits end try that and see if it works Breastfeeding Milk Phoebe Buffay's songs Joke Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Shaggy dog story Infant formula Chocolate Fecal incontinence Kodocha Miss Saigon The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Coffee Paradox About a Boy Stomach cancer Infant The Catcher in the Rye Romulus and Remus The Amber Spyglass Jam (TV series) Sea-Monkey Nestl__ boycott Knots Landing Sleeping with the Enemy (Simpsons episode) Mattress Pitaten Characters in the Smurfs Poker jargon Garfield The Shining (film) Nestl__ Comanche Coeliac disease Childbirth Humphrey Bogart Salad Fingers Insomnia Hypoglycemia Vanilla Ninja Bread Theory of conduct Cliff Richard Sudden infant death syndrome Trailer Park Boys Milton H.
