my month old baby will only sleep hours per day but acts tired all day long what can i do all the books and experts seem to say that the average month old baby needs about hours of sleep per day my month daughter will only sleep hours per day no matter what i do she sleeps hours of naps and hours at night also she acts sleepy rubbing her eyes yawning fussing all day long even within only an hour of waking up from a nap is it normal for her to act tired all the time i try to make her nap more often but she fights it and if i try to put her to bed earlier she just wakes up earlier and won't go back to sleep right now this is her sleep schedule am wake up for day am first nap pm second nap pm bedtime i hate seeing her so tired and trying to keep her going for hours between sleeps but if i put her down after hours she will fight the nap for another hour anyway any suggestions i've putting her down after only hours and she will usually go to sleep but then it throws off the rest of her schedule for the day also i haven't started her on solids yet do you think she might sleep more after we start her on solids children tend to sleep a lot more and seem tired when they are having growth spurts and you know that they grow a lot out of the womb around the first year yes solids will help to give her the energy her body needs during this time as well as help with the sleep cycle my daughter started sleeping really well and had the perfect schedule hours at night and two hour naps of course im one of those moms that refuses to give in to the crying if i know she's tired have you started her on the semi solids yet the baby cereals i mean those are wonderful to start off and she will be getting the nutrients she requires from the formula or breast milk as well as having her body learn the process of solid food digestion she may also be over stimulated or understimulated during the day which could be tiring her out i would suggest you take her to a pediatrician to make sure it isnt something more serious however my daughter simply had to start eating food more suited to her needs she perked right up once she started learning to sling her own food around lol Sleep Breastfeeding Narcolepsy Urinary incontinence Cat Polyphasic sleep Insomnia Daylight saving time Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Puberty Bodybuilding Characters in the Smurfs The Contender (television series) Shaggy dog story Nutrition Human height Hera Mattress Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypoglycemia Phoebe Buffay's songs Coeliac disease Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Dream Out-of-body experience Apollo 8 Housebreaking Fancy rat Ferret Avenue Q EastEnders Gastroparesis Infant formula Folic acid Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Pet skunk Ekadasi The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Amber Spyglass Rais massacre Capercaillie Carbon dioxide Gastroesophageal reflux disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Jet lag Veganism Tocopherol Rodney McKay The Shining (film) Childbirth Sant Thakar Singh Kender Hypnosis National Football League Sewage treatment Social rule Koala Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obesity Reflexology Sumo Sleep apnea Chocolate Futurama (TV series - season 5) Vegetarianism Dieting Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Milton H.
