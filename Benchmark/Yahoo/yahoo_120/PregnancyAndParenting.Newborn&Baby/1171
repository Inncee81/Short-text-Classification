co sleeping i got into the habbit of letting my baby sleep with me its easier since im breastfeeding now she is months part of me wants to put her in her crib but i heard that co sleeping can reduce the rick of sids source dr sears practicing pediatrician in answer to a question about co sleeping a don't worry continue co sleeping because i have thoroughly researched this common concern and written two books on the subject the baby sleep book and sids a parent's guide to understanding and preventing sudden infant death syndrome i feel that i can confidently advise you on this subject in the sids book you'll find more than scientific references to support the information provided on sleep and breathing patterns and safe sleeping arrangements also my wife and i co slept with every one of our eight babies and i have advocated the practice throughout my years of being a pediatrician i've come to the conclusion that co sleeping if practiced wisely and safely can actually lower the risk of sids and here's why co sleeping helps your baby rouse himself new research has shown that in most cases sids is caused by a baby's inability to arouse himself from sleep normally when something occurs that threatens your baby's well being such as difficulty breathing he will automatically wake up for reasons that are still unknown in some babies this protective mechanism does not go off and so these babies are more at risk for sids this is where the positive aspects of co sleeping come in dr james mckenna director of the mother baby sleep laboratory and professor of anthropology at the university of notre dame has conducted numerous studies of mothers and babies who were co sleeping and night nursing his group of researchers found that mom and baby share similar patterns of sleep arousals what we call nighttime harmony they drifted in and out of sleep stages in a similar but not always identical pattern some sids researchers believe that this is a factor in baby's protective arousal mechanism this harmony may also be related to a psychological synchronicity between co sleeping mothers and their babies the co sleeping mom is more likely to subconsciously sense if her baby's health is in danger and wake up researchers also believe that the carbon dioxide you exhale when you sleep close to your baby may help stimulate her breathing plus co sleeping infants tend to automatically sleep on their back in order to have easier access to nighttime feedings back sleeping has proved to be one of the top risk reducers for sids meanwhile babies who sleep separately from their moms have been shown to experience a decrease in the amount of rem sleep the state of sleep in which protective arousal is the most likely to occur co sleeping is a common practice worldwide the rate of sids is lowest in cultures that traditionally share sleep such as asian while there could be many other factors contributing to the lower incidence of sids in these cultures all the population studies i've seen have come to the same conclusion safe co sleeping lowers the sids risk co sleeping warnings are based on imprecise science i began my pediatric career in academic medicine and teaching in university hospitals at that time i learned an important lesson about scientific research when the conclusions of a scientific study and common sense don't match suspect faulty science both dr mckenna's writings and my two books mentioned above contain information that proves the original studies that triggered the alarm about co sleeping were flawed in addition scientists have yet to come to a universal agreement on the definition of co sleeping i've always considered co sleeping to mean bed sharing or sleeping within arm's reach of mother however it can also be defined as simply being close to mom or sleeping in the parents' bedroom no matter your interpretation you will find general agreement among all sids researchers pediatricians and the american academy of pediatrics that sleeping in the same room with parents lowers the risk of sids co sleeping is as safe as the conditions you practice for obvious reasons parents under the influence of alcohol drugs or medications that interfere with normal sleep patterns should never have their baby in their bed other safeguards to employ sleep in a king size bed if possible to give everybody enough room be sure there are no wide crevices between the mattress and the guardrail or headboard that your baby's head could sink into never allow infants to sleep in the same bed with siblings or caregivers they may not have the same awareness of a baby's presence that parents do don't fall asleep with your baby on a surface that isn't firm such as a couch or a beanbag chair she could
