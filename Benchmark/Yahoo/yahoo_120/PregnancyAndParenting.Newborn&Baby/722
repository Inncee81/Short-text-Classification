baby's personality my son is weeks and day old i still see no real trace of his own personality and i thought by this point he'd be smiling all the time he smiles occasionally and has times before when i was smiling at him goofing off but only about times in total recently he's been more fussy than ever before and i'm just curious why isn't he smiling yet and what's going on with his personality also it seems as if he is unable to focus on my eyes for very long without looking upwards he looks for a second if you get his attention but not every time i'm worried that something could be wrong pediatrician said everything was fine with him and he's a perfectly normal baby but why at weeks are all this things still happening is he just too young yet to completely focus he does focus but not for more than a few seconds and has only followed me with his eyes a couple of times a lot of the times it looks like he's spacing out my baby was fine and then around weeks became very fussy and unhappy for about a week then everything just changed once again and he was a happy baby at about weeks he started smiling and at this point weeks he smiles coos and makes little laughing noises it will all happen when you least expect it as for focusing attention even my boy seems like he is spaced out half the time especially when he is tired sometimes he just looks off into nowhere like he is looking at something really interesting even though nothing is there he shouldn't be able to really follow objects for very long until at least months and even then it is still only about inches don't worry nothing is wrong Social rule Milton H.
