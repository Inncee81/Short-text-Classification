rash on face my son cut his chin not enough to get stitches but he needs to keep a bandaid on it all day now he is developing a rash where the bandaid goes does anyone have advice on what to use or do to get rid of the rash well i use benadryl cream but it depends on how old the child is if they are under you should ask a doctor it could have been caused by things one being that he could have had a reaction to the adhesive on the bandaid and the second being that he could be allergic to latex which is what most bandaid are made of my son and i both have that problem and it can be fixed by buying latex free bandaid a little more expensive but less irritation also remember that the skin on the face is one of the easiest places to get irritated i hope this helps and i hope the rash clears up Psoriasis Eczema Latex allergy Tattoo Allergy Fecal incontinence Rash Scabies Condom Hay fever Urinary incontinence Food allergy Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Multiple chemical sensitivity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mattress Strap-on dildo Diaper Roseola Crohn's disease Tarantula Spina bifida Cephalexin Group A streptococcal infection Dexamethasone Urticaria Skin Sulfasalazine Urticating hair Corticosteroid Rubber Scar Methamphetamine Syphilis LaTeX Acne Shaving Infantilism Paracetamol Latex Menstrual cup Cellulitis Breastfeeding Aluminium Dairy Hypersensitivity Cat Dandruff Lupus erythematosus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Waxing TeX Depilation Radiation therapy Internet troll Pointe shoes Callus Hydrogen peroxide Intravenous therapy Suture Amineptine Medical analysis of circumcision Irritable bowel syndrome Food Safe sex Measles Creosote Lyme disease Diarrhea Road Rash Vulcanization Gay bathhouse Chlorpromazine Polychlorinated biphenyl Ashton-Tate Cashew Lichen planus Cephalic disorder Menstrual cycle Mathematics Biotin Candidiasis Little Britain Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Pubic hair Theory of conduct Traumatic brain injury Cancer Chewing gum Paint Schistosoma mansoni Enzyme Casting Carpet Diving Yarrow The Caves of Androzani Prostate cancer Phimosis
