getting a breastfed baby to drink formula i have a month old who has been breastfed from day one i am going back to work and have to get her to take a bottle so i can put her in daycare i've tried giving her bottles numerous times and she just won't take it in fact she starts crying everytime she sees a bottle i've tried a few different types of nipples to no avail i had my mom and sister to try to give her bottles as well but she wouldn't take them either any suggestions i already feel awful for putting her in daycare but i have no choice please help serious answers only please also i can't pump i've tried hand pumps electric pumps and even rented one from the hospital none of them work so i have to give her formula please don't lecture on breastfeeding i already know and am proud to say my year old was breastfed until she was months old i don't need another reason to feel guilty right now i have already met with a lactation specialist and according to her it's not uncommon for women to not be able to pump with that said i am going to keep her on the breast for as long as possible whenever possible my son is in day care as well i have trouble pumping enough for him so he gets formula and breastmilk at day care when he is with me in the evenings and weekends he is strictly breastfed you said the pumps aren't working but i think maybe you could pump even if it's manually enough to keep your supply from drying up that way you can still nurse baby when you're with her my nursing time with my son is even more special to me now since i don't see him during the day that being said you can try the nd nature nipples that is the only one my son has ever used they have holes so they function like your nipple plus there are no stages so you don't have to worry about switching sizes baby controls the flow so there is less danger of overfeeding like with most nipples the baby has to actively suck or nothing comes out he uses avent bottles and i use an avent pump during the day so i don't have to worry about conversion there is also a bottle that is actually shaped like a breast and has a little nipple on it i can not think of the name but your lactation consultant should be able to tell you what it is that may help your little girl some other tips have someone else give her the bottle as you have already been trying also try the bottle when she is less likely to fight it for instance when she wakes at night she will be tired so she may just start sucking before she even realizes it is a bottle also she may not like the formula you have chosen my son would not drink enfamil gentle ease but he takes the regular enfamil lipil with iron with no problems talk to your pedi about this you could also consider buying breast milk from a reputable milk bank i have never tried this but i know it can be done the people at the day care probably have some experience with this type of situation so call them and see what they recommend your little girl may be completely different with them than she is with you and her auntie and grandmother just remember that any breast milk is better than no breast milk so keep nursing her whenever you can you can do this try not to stress yourself out and feel guilty you are doing the best that you can and it's obvious that you are a loving mommy you will find a way to work it out Fertility awareness Nipple Nipple piercing Infant Childbirth Infant formula Milk Humphrey Bogart Social rule Prostate cancer Knots Landing Breast pump Urinary incontinence Friends About a Boy Infantilism Nestl__ Avenue Q EastEnders Prolactin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion Dairy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha Indianapolis 500 Carburetor Breast cancer The Lovely Bones Conker's Bad Fur Day Little Britain Jon Secada Haloperidol Yoko Ono Thermal power station B-47 Stratojet Phoebe Buffay's songs Characters in the Smurfs AFI 100 Years series Hypoglycemia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Expert system American Psycho Ben Johnson (athlete) Transsexuality Breast milk Joke Fecal incontinence Oxytocin Mastitis Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Mattress The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Theory of conduct The Super Milk-chan Show Nestl__ boycott Ron and Fez Stuttering Frankie Laine Insulin Vitamin D The Shining (film) Breast fetishism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Everwood The Human Stain Mammary gland Nudity Pok__mon Live!
