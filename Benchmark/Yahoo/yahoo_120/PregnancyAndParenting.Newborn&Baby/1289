is daycare beneficial for a one month old i will be having a c section in september i have noone who can come to my home and help me with my older son he will be around months when the next baby comes and i have unwillingly considered putting him in daycare for the first couple of weeks so i can heal a litle bit my husband will be working and we have no family who can come and help me any suggestions i don't want to put my son in day care but i don't think i can be pulling to him once i have a c section i've had two c sections and the recovery really isn't that bad really i think if you put your child in daycare when the baby comes home you will be creating a jealousy situation start practicing now having your son crawl up on you when you sit on the couch or the bed get him used to sitting beside you not on you also consider hiring some housecleaning help or hire a mother's helper this is someone who'll come for a few hours each day just to help you out if you can pay for daycare you can pay for this and your son will be much better off Day care Children of a Lesser Clod Breastfeeding Knots Landing Milton H.
