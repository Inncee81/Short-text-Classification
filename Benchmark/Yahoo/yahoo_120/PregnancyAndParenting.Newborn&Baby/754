most frustrating baby day so far any ideas my wife and i just had a baby boy who is weeks old and he normally is very quiet and has always eaten very well today is the first day that he has cried pretty much the whole time he has been awake he isn't sleeping very well today either any parents ever have a kid that can do a complete change in the way they act i e from laughter to screaming we have tried everthing from holding him the vibrating chair swing cuddling feeding but nothing is working today is it possible that it is just belly cramps or gas please help thanks well first thing i would do is put yourself in his little booties imagine you are uncomfortable but you are not sure what is wrong you can't communicate except to voice your frustration with your delima the only way you know how with a loud wail you persist in your wail hoping that someone hears you and fixes what is wrong daddy changes you nope thats not it mommy feeds you nope thats not it both mommy and daddy try to burp you nope i know it can be enormously frustrating to you but think about how he is the only way his needs are met is by someone else guessing at what his needs are the poor little thing cannot even turn over to get more comfortable he is just beginning to notice the little hands attached to him but can't use them yet i am so glad i do not remember being a baby it has to be extreemly frustrating and a confusing time but to solve your problem at that age he should not really have established a routine yet at first my week old was taking a nap during the day about am to pm not anymore now it seems the only way i can get him to sleep is if i take him for a long walk somedays he likes the swing but lately he hates it sometimes he has really good days where he can be coaxed to smile to where he looks like he is laughing from moring to evening othertimes evenings are hell he has to be on the boob all day i would not count on having the good fortune of a set rountine anytime soon i would chalk it up to gas and or a growth spurt for gas you can do two things if traditional burping doesn't work you can lay him on his back and push his legs lightly to his chest and count to ten do this times also you can massage his little belly and try to break it up it you feel that might be it you can also try to give him gas drops growth spurt just feed him more if you are breastfeeding let him finish on his terms for formula make a few ounces more and let him drink what he wants babies have an innate ability to eat to fulfill their needs and not more do not make him finish the bottle however today my now week old has been eating every hour Breastfeeding Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Social rule Sin City The Shining (film) Aerial (dance move) Kodocha Jon Secada Poker jargon Friends Hansel und Gretel Milton H.
