tummy time my month old son hates tummy time every time i put him on a blanket on the floor for tummy time he does nothing but cry should i just let him cry while down there or what i tried laying him on my stomach and do tummy time and he hates that too i mean he has his moments where he will be fine for a few min but then he starts to cry any ideas or advice thanks don't worry if your son resists a daily quota of tummy time many young babies don't like it because it is very limiting as far as what it allows them to see and do when your son is on hisback he can wave his arms and legs twist his torso and see all around him but when he is on his stomach he has to work very hard to keep his head up can use only his arms for support and is unable to move his legs much one way that you can make it more pleasant for him is by putting him on his tummy on the floor or bed and then lying on your stomach so that you're face to face with him get close and be a little silly he might be entertained and may lean his head on yours for support you can also offer him a little unbreakable mirror in which to admire himself when he looks down or play a musical mobile to encourage him to pull his head up as your son's neck gets stronger tummy time should become more comfortable for him but if he remains unhappy when you put him down skip it babyhood is not a race if he crawls four weeks later than his peers it doesn't matter now and it certainly won't matter later Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Swingout Breastfeeding Equine conformation Diving Comanche Professional wrestling aerial techniques Breaststroke Conspiracy (TNG episode) Babe Ruth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
