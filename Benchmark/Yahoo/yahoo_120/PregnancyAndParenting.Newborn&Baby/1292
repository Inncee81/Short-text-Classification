nursing mothers or mothers who have nursed please help my month old son has two itty bitty teeth and he seems to think he can twist my breast around any way he wants and chomp down on my nipple how can i get him to stop without upsetting him or just how can i get him to stop he's only done it twice but i would like to nip this thing in the bud no pun intended if your reaction didn't scare him then try pulling him into the breast covering his nose with your breast so he has to open his mouth to breathe when he chomps this is unpleasant enough to encourage him to stop doing it if he is playing with the nipple with his teeth and hurting you pop him off and set him on the floor by your feet he will probably get upset but you are trying to teach him that if he abuses your nipple he can't nurse anymore you can pick him back up and resume nursing after a minute or less but what you just want to get across is that biting nursing time being over hope this helps i nursed two of mine until they were so i dealt with a lot of teeth Breastfeeding Shark Breast Cat Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Janet Jackson Tooth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Backstroke Kodocha Milton H.
