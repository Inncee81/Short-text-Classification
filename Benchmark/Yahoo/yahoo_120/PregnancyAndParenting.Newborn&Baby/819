i have a two month old who has found her hands and now sucks her thumb she has a pacifier but spits it out i tell her no and give her the pacifier but she screams like she is sooo mad any moms have any ideas on how to deal w this its my first baby and i would hate to give in my nd started sucking his thumb at months old when he turned months old i would put baby gloves on his hands and give him the pacifier he got used to it and stopped sucking his thumb now he looks for the pacifier generally though it's not bad at that age only when they are about years old it starts becoming bad but it was easy confusing my son so that was good it's easy to confuse a baby into forgetting one thing and getting used to another try it but i wouldn't suggest quite yet wait a few more months good luck Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Treehouse of Horror IX Poker jargon Rocko's Modern Life President (game) Breastfeeding Kodocha Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Humphrey Bogart Ashton-Tate Pacifier Shaggy dog story Macbeth Shen Gong Wu Friends About a Boy Emperor Guangwu of Han Vampire Social rule Milton H.
