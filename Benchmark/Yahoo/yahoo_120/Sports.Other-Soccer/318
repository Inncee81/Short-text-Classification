americans often say the reason why they dont like football soccer is because of low scoring why if you look at the english league or spanish league or infact most other leagues you usually get scores of or or even higher why is it americans complain about this if you look at the english league you only see a couple of draws over many weeks in american football a game can last up to hours and over that time the score are often only in the s or even less do americans not realise that the reason why the points difference is so big is due to the fact that you get points for a touchdown and then an extra point for the mighty hard part of kicking a ball over and between an unguarded goal also another point for doing the same thing in open play a game of football lasts at most hour mins from start to finish and you only get goal point for a goal australia beat samoa in soccer yet the highest score i can find in nfl is washington vs n y giants if you break it down this is only touchdowns at best why do you say this is the reason it's because we are conditioned to high scoring in all our major sports it isn't because we chose to be that way many teams in all sports do surveys based on the input of their season ticket holders they have surmised especially and unfortunately in the national hockey league and major league baseball that fans want more goals and more runs scored generations of americans are nurtured to believe that offense wins games i say hogwash the only thing i care about is that my teams come out on top it is interesting to me as well why my fellow countrymen complain about low scoring low scoring to me is like calling an incision a small cut scoring is scoring a cut is a cut there is no need for more description my point is that fans of football and fans of soccer may never understand why they are the way they are all that is important is that we try to be ambassadors of our sport i have the best of both worlds go eagles go dc united i am a huge fan of soccer and football my advice to anyone is that if people are intentionally putting down other sports just point out to them what they are missing if they don't like a sport don't let them think that it is acceptable to put it down National Football League American football New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals Playoff New England Patriots Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXVI Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVII New York Jets Baseball Rugby union Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XIV Buffalo Bills St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XI November 2004 in sports Major League Soccer The Football League Super Bowl IX World Football League Super Bowl XXIV Canadian football Sudden death Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl I Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XVIII Football Super Bowl XXXI September 2005 in sports Super Bowl III Overtime (sport) September 2004 in sports Comparison of Canadian and American football American Football League Playoff format Super Bowl Glossary of American football October 2005 in sports Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XIII FA Cup Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXXVI Australian rules football Super Bowl XV Major League Baseball Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXIII December 2004 in sports San Francisco 49ers Kansas City Chiefs Australia national football team Negro league baseball Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Sports timeline Super Bowl X Philadelphia Eagles Rugby football Monday Night Football American football strategy Baltimore Ravens Ice hockey Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl VI Jim Thorpe Rugby league Salary cap Arena football Ty Cobb History of rugby union Manchester United F.C.
