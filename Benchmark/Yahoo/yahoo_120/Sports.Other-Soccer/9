question for soccer defenders alright so basically i am very good technically i can juggle the ball around times and when it comes to one touch shot dribbling passing etc i am very talented i am a midfield though which means i need to be good technically which i am as well as being good in defending however i am very bad at defending i find it so difficult to win balls and i am usually the loser in winning balls help i need real thorough tips on how to defend like when to step blah blah etc thankyou so much your advice will help me suceed i used to be a sweeper but i also play in the wings wether front mid or back my best advice when you play defense is never hesitate when you go for a challenge do it coz when u hesitate the opponent takes advantage of that when you tackle a guy make sure you get the ball out of him also time your sweeps when he opens up slip your leg a bit to keep the ball in his full control and dont let ur opponent get away too much especially if he is a deadly scorer i would rather get a yellow than give up a break away attack Football (soccer) positions Water polo Football (soccer) Defender (football) Basketball Rugby union positions Midfielder Glossary of American football Snooker American football Fast bowling Fielding (cricket) Rugby league Norway national football team Eight ball American football strategy Baseball Table tennis Chess terminology Tennis Team Fortress Classic Field hockey Fencing Canadian football Formation (football) Mixed martial arts Australian rules football Billiards Four square Tackle (football) Bobby Charlton Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ice hockey Cincinnati Bengals Touch football (rugby league) Harrow Football Aerial (dance move) Blitzball Mortal Kombat New York Giants Geoff Hurst Swingout Michael Jordan Rugby league positions Boxing Cleveland Browns Professional wrestling holds Offside law (football) Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXV Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Indianapolis 500 Football Sydney Riot of 1879 Fullback Super Bowl XXXVI Professional wrestling match types Super Bowl I Laws of cricket Tenshinhan Strap-on dildo Endgame Personal foul Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
