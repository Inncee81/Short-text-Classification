what league is the best considering english teams have made it to the final the past three years and in the version three of the teams in the semi finals were from the premiership does this mean that the english league is the best league in europe the italian serie a is far too defensive for me and it is pretty corrupt the matchfixing scandals involving ac milan juventus and a few other italian clubs really rocked the league last year's serie a was boring and inter milan won the league by coming points clear of the second placed team as roma i think the la liga is pretty exciting and barcelona fc is my favorite team there are lots of brazilian players and it is pretty entertaining there is more flair and you its not as quick as the premier league so there is chance to show of your skill i support manchester united and i think that the premier league is the best league in the world the league is more attacking than defensive and it is really competitive we have a big four consisting of arsenal manchester united chelsea and liverpool next year will be pretty interesting because tottenham hotspurs will be hot on arsenal's heels all year in last year's champions league all the english clubs topped their groups and three if the semi finalists were english clubs last year's bundesliga's title race was great and it went right down to the wire but bayern munich had a bad season and didn't even qualify for the champions league they will be missed in order to make the bundesliga more popular a german club needs to go far in the champions league and perhaps even win the competition i would say the portuguese league next they may not be that popular but the team that is going to win the title isnt as predictable as it is in france we all know who is going to win lyon i would say the epl is the best league in the world followed by the la liga and then the serie a then the bundesliga and then the potuguese league Tottenham Hotspur F.C.
