what are some things that i need to know or skills to be a good full back in in u im kind of new to soccer help would be nice firstly congratulations for taking up the wonderful game of soccer football to some and secondly well done for being a fullback sometimes its all guts and no glory but it can be a very rewarding position particularly when you score a rare goal anyway my advice is to mark closely as the previous person said and to be hungry for the ball not giving attackers time on the ball is vital you also have to know when to dive in and contest the ball and when to hang back and jockey if you are outnumbered in defence best to try to force the attacker to the sideline by jockeying and not let him through the middle organisation in defence is also vital make sure on set pieces corners free kicks etc each opposing man is marked and when moving up make sure the defence is in a straight line to catch the opposition offside knowing when to move forward in attack is also a skill there's nothing better than winning the ball with a strong tackle and turning defence into attack run with the ball pass to a midfielder or forward and continue your run to make the extra man you might snare yourself a goal remember to get back if the play breaks down or have someone cover for you anyway good luck Glossary of American football Football (soccer) positions American football Rugby union Football (soccer) Australian rules football Rugby union positions Rugby league Canadian football Volleyball Rugby league positions American football strategy New York Giants Defender (football) Fullback Football Norway national football team Touch football (rugby league) Baseball Offside law (football) Super Bowl XXI National Football League Lore Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XVIII Cincinnati Bengals Rugby football Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl X Poker jargon Super Bowl XXIV Ultimate (sport) Super Bowl XXXIV Offensive team Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XVII Fast bowling Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXVI Pittsburgh Steelers Carolina Panthers Indoor soccer Super Bowl XXIII Snooker Super Bowl I Super Bowl V Midfielder Super Bowl XII Chess terminology San Francisco 49ers Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl XXXVI Cleveland Browns Billiards Jack Charlton Bobby Charlton Tag Leeds United F.C.
