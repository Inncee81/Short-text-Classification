my soccer cleats are giving my feet blisters what should i do to prevent this buy new cleats i own some adidas soccer cleats that fit my foot pretty good with just enough room but they are causing my feet to have blisters should i buy new cleats a little bit bigger or what would be recommended what i do with my lacrosse cleats is i find out where i blister and then to prevent blisters i put vasceline over the area and cover it in duct tape just trust me on this the duct tape makes a slipper surface against the cleat so it won't rub it will slip and the vasceline keeps the tape from being in direct contace with your skin the whole idea is for the duct tape to rub and not your foot it works well for me its sorta like a home made blister pad Shoe Pointe shoes Callus Mattress Wart Hiking Dinghy Softball Tarantula Bong Duct tape Gag (BDSM) Skin Adidas Strap-on dildo Electrical wiring Professional wrestling match types Equine conformation Climbing equipment Deck (ship) Upholstery Compact audio cassette Psoriasis Breastfeeding Oakland Athletics Disneyland Chair Smallpox Eczema Drill bit Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Spider Tick Fume hood Tattoo Vampire High-heeled shoe Radio controlled airplane Ben Johnson (athlete) Hand grenade Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Adidas-Salomon Herpes simplex virus Hazing First aid Diving suit Woodworking Glossary of nautical terms St. Louis Cardinals Seine (fishing) Bicycle brake systems Foot-and-mouth disease Domestic rabbit Cellulitis Foot Memorial Stadium, Clemson Textile manufacturing Mark Fidrych Football (soccer) U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Ulcer USS Trigger (SS-237) Sunburn Clemson University Amateur telescope making Indianapolis 500 Duct Tape Forever Bicycle pedal Sock B-47 Stratojet Lacrosse Syracuse University Orange Lechaina A Prairie Home Companion Knot Bicycle lighting Watergate scandal Hard disk Mars Exploration Rover Dracunculiasis Herpes zoster Asbestos Self Portrait Liver Mouse (computing) Group A streptococcal infection Pottery Donald Neilson USS Tunny (SS-282) Fast bowling Horse tack Screw Mustard gas M16 (rifle) Violin Pet skunk Electric motor The Caves of Androzani Magnetic tape
