i see david elleray former referee is renewing calls for sin bins in football do you agree personally speaking i don't and here's why first of all in football it's very easy to deny a team posession so if a team know they're down to men for say minutes then their first reaction will be to simply get the remaining players behind the ball and ironically teams a man up will be less likely to score sin binnings would very quickly become something that completely kills the flow of a game probably also the in stadium atmosphere as the supporters realise they've got minutes to go to the loo or get a pie and also the player who gets sin binned is getting a breather so imagine him coming back on the field and right away making a lung bursting run to skin a tired defender and score who's really been penalised then you make a great argument against this idea it would destroy the flow of the game and it would give too much power to the referee as if they don't have enough its another judgement call too fallible Football (soccer) American football Canadian football New York Giants Cleveland Browns Rugby union 1957 World Series Cincinnati Bengals Volleyball Water polo FA Cup Baseball Super Bowl XVII American football strategy Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl IX Carolina Panthers Gaelic football Penalty shootout (football) San Francisco 49ers Tag Iron Bowl Super Bowl XIX Glossary of American football Rugby league Buffalo Bills St. Louis Cardinals Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXVII Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XVIII All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Softball National Football League Lore Newcastle United F.C.
