how can a dividend policy be created by the stockholder to suit his her personal needs i might be able to give a better answer if i knew what the personal needs were for a person requiring regular cash flow those of us who are retired for example investing in a mutual fund that pays monthly dividends would be a solution not all mutual funds pay dividends monthly but a few do those that invest in debt securities are more apt to than those investing in equities among the equity funds bcf pays monthly current distribution is about annually also bdj about annually and some others also now not all stocks pays dividends at the same time so it is possible to buy dividend paying stocks that have staggered pay dates so that you have a somewhat consistant cash flow not easy to do however requires a lot of work but lets look at a few high paying dividend stocks to give you and example bac pays quarterly on about and for example about currently bbt pays quarterly on about and about currently usb pays quarterly on about and about currently so by purchasing your securities based on dividend pay date it is possible to structure your portfolio so as to meet your personal financial needs not easy but possible i have no idea why all of these fancy stock screeners we have do not allow screening for dividend pay dates but then i always want more than i have Mutual fund Corporate finance Annuity PE ratio Dividend Stock Bond Derivative (finance) Equity investment Warren Buffett Finance Security (finance) Life insurance Corporation Individual Savings Account Collateralized debt obligation Stock market Personal finance Rational pricing Financial markets Insurance Capital asset pricing model Black-Scholes Eugene Fama Cost of capital Debt Microsoft Pension Economy of Russia NASDAQ Venture capital Federal Reserve Social Security debate (United States) Exchange-traded fund Berkshire Hathaway Economy of India Mortgage Citigroup Money supply Tax Monetary policy Primerica Financial Services Lloyd's of London Short selling Equity swap Social Security (United States) Microeconomics Conglomerate (company) Institutional fund management Cooperative Closed-end fund Stock exchange Retirement plan Temasek Holdings Valuation (finance) Income tax Trust (Law) USA FairTax Futures contract Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of South Africa Technical analysis Mergers and acquisitions Margin (finance) Capital accumulation Fixed income Financial services Stock market index Hyperinflation Interest Economy of Chile Monopoly (game) Deflation (economics) Federal National Mortgage Association Canadian National Railway Credit card Cash flow statement Variable universal life insurance Stock broker Modern portfolio theory Housing cooperative Employee stock option Bretton Woods system Wells Fargo Mikhail Khodorkovsky 401(k) Anarchism and capitalism Financial analyst Sears Holdings Corporation EBITDA Swap (finance) Modigliani-Miller theorem Great Depression Financial audit
