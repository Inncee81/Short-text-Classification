why would buying a fund be better than buying each dow stock on a dollar investment i would pay in commissions after all have been bought and sold lets say that the investment lasts years the commission would be higher because of all the spin offs over a year period there would be many splits and many dividends would i make more on a dia fund or more buying all the individual stocks one by one with a fund where do all the dividends go into the fund handlers hand do the spin offs of dia stocks account in a fund are they added into the fund i guess you have dissect every word on here i meant the fees that i would have to pay for selling the spin offs if all you want to do is track the djia then you should just buy the stocks yourself as you mentioned a mutual fund will be professionally managed and will charge huge fees if you use zecco com then trading is free so use that if you buy the individual stocks so that you dont pay any fees in a fund the dividends still eventually get paid to the fund holders as far as spin offs etc the fund manager has control over what to do he may heavily weight some stocks and hold very little of another it all depends Mutual fund Stock PE ratio Annuity Bond Citigroup Exchange-traded fund Hedge fund United Kingdom corporation tax Short selling Insurance Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend Equity investment Taxation in the United States Warren Buffett Stock market index Microeconomics Corporate finance Corporation Wall Street Crash of 1929 Stock broker Individual Savings Account Financial markets Derivative (finance) Security (finance) Bretton Woods system Gold as an investment Institutional fund management NASDAQ Federal Reserve Investment bank Bank Income trust Finance Technical analysis Option style Tax Microsoft Social Security debate (United States) Life insurance Foreign exchange market Enron Corporation Capital accumulation Anarchism and capitalism Variable universal life insurance Euro S&P 500 Mergers and acquisitions Wheel of Fortune Margin (finance) Futures contract 401(k) Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Venture capital Temasek Holdings Lloyd's of London Supply and demand Social Security (United States) Publicly funded medicine Closed-end fund American International Group Eliot Spitzer Passive management Mortgage Monopoly (game) Fiat money Economy of Russia Employee stock option Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Morgan Stanley Rational pricing Surplus value Dot-com Money Wal-Mart Credit card Student loan Sears Holdings Corporation MMORPG Trust (Law) USA Day trading Economy of Chile SCO-Linux controversies Arbitrage Mikhail Khodorkovsky Toll road Andrew Carnegie Philatelic investment Financial services Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Retirement plan Usury Primerica Financial Services Supply-side economics
