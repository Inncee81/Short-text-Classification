why is it bad when people sell their stocks i don't quite understand the market dropping like it is i guess my question is why are people freaking out about sub prime mortgages and why would they sell shares because of it because of the insecurity of sub prime mortgages and the fact that a percentage of these will end as re posessions some companies holding these mortgages could find themselves with liquidity problems investors in these companies will get nervous and want to get their money out before the company collapses these companies then sell their shares in other companies to get the money to pay out their own withdrawing shareholders if a lot of shares in a company are sold these shares drop on their price this tends to make shareholders in other companies nervous and they sell before the price drops too much you then can get a snowball effect but usually the market stablises itself after a short while because most investers are there for the long term and accept the minor rises and falls Bond Stock market Deflation (economics) Mortgage Asian financial crisis Stock PE ratio Enron Corporation Short selling Financial markets Warren Buffett Great Depression Dot-com Derivative (finance) Institutional fund management Bank Closed-end fund Mergers and acquisitions Dividend Corporate governance Corporate finance Debt Temasek Holdings Corporation Insurance Keynesian economics Citigroup Capitalism Privatization Employee stock option Arbitrage One.Tel Wall Street Crash of 1929 Yield curve Margin (finance) Economy of Russia Hedge fund Bretton Woods system Berkshire Hathaway Hyperinflation Market capitalization Mikhail Khodorkovsky Exchange-traded fund Finance United Kingdom corporation tax Housing cooperative Intellectual property The South Sea Company Capital accumulation Sears Holdings Corporation Monopoly (game) Mortgage-backed security American International Group Microeconomics Taxation in the United States __lectricit__ de France Government National Mortgage Association Publishing Islamic banking Annuity Gold as an investment Supply and demand Investment bank Stock market index Microsoft Mad Money Monetary policy Labor theory of value Say's law Predatory lending Long-Term Capital Management Technical analysis Gold standard Life insurance Health insurance Financial services Stock split Inflation Monopoly Interest Option Modern portfolio theory Video game crash of 1983 Money supply Speculation Corporate raid Monetarism Efficient market hypothesis Income trust Dow Jones Industrial Average Famine
