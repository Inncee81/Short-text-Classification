best asset allocation for a college student my niece is a college student who got a settlement for and wants to use it primarily to generate income to help pay for living expenses while she is in college should she use the typical income asset allocation model of bonds stocks money market and would it be more lucrative for her to refinance on her fully paid for home and add that money to the investment portfolio or would the new mortgage not make it worth while never take out a loan to invest if you happen to lose the money in the investments now you just have a loan it's way better just to have a paid for house and no mortgage for the rest of your life i'd say a college student first of all needs this money in a trust where she can't get at it until she's even if she's responsible and level headed she will be more so in years then i'd say invest the money primarily in government backed securities like municipal bonds or treasury bonds invest some in stock funds but not individual stocks more likely to go under i don't think you really need any in cash i e money market if you go with my year time horizon suggestion thanks and good luck Mutual fund Mortgage Security (finance) Finance Insurance Life insurance Financial markets Citigroup Personal finance Deflation (economics) Taxation in the United States Capital accumulation Municipal bond 401(k) Modern portfolio theory Social Security (United States) Stock Institutional fund management Income trust Interest Collateralized debt obligation Hedge fund Investment bank Warren Buffett Derivative (finance) Money supply United Kingdom corporation tax Corporation Bank Tax Economy of Russia Mortgage-backed security Corporate finance Government debt Student loan Government National Mortgage Association Social Security debate (United States) Keynesian economics Primerica Financial Services Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Closed-end fund Short selling Securitization Federal Reserve Supply-side economics Capital asset pricing model Great Depression Federal National Mortgage Association U.S. public debt Bank fraud Gold as an investment Rational pricing Trust (Law) USA Inflation Toronto-Dominion Bank Yield curve Monetary policy Annuity Microeconomics Temasek Holdings Money PE ratio Retirement plan Eugene Fama Money creation Hyperinflation Wells Fargo Treasury security Mergers and acquisitions Individual Savings Account Arbitrage Berkshire Hathaway Money fund Property tax Economy of Chile Islamic banking Fractional-reserve banking Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Cost of capital Variable universal life insurance American International Group Repurchase agreement Predatory lending Real estate developer Central bank Education in the People's Republic of China Bretton Woods system Economy of the United States Credit card Stock market Fixed income
