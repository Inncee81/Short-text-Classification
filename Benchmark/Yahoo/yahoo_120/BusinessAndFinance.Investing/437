market meltdown as the global markets are in melt down at the moment dow in one day and looking to continue short term at least i was wondering what the overall or general impact would be on hedge funds are moves like this positive for hedge funds or negative i imagine that if the hedge is setup correctly then it should be almost neutral but that is perfect world and never reality as you can probably see i know almost nothing about the activities of hedge funds so i would be interested in opinions from those in the know you are being misled by the name hedge fund there are several that have completely collapsed and several more on the way only time will tell how many will be effected the ones that have already collapsed were highly leveraged and they got their clocks cleaned as a result rumor has it that there are a bunch in serious trouble and they are attempting to liquidate a lot of their holdings to unwind their leverage darn breaks my heart would not surprise me in the least if the melt down was partially caused by the liquidation of the funds however that would most likely be putting blame where it should not really go the real blame belongs squarely on the shoulders of alan greenspan when he dropped interest rates to zero back in and fueled the housing binge that was the root cause of what is happening today Hedge fund Gold standard Asian financial crisis Short selling Monetarism Federal National Mortgage Association Nuclear meltdown Derivative (finance) Deflation (economics) Globalization Arbitrage Corporate finance Debt Federal Reserve Long-Term Capital Management Futures contract Keynesian economics Financial services Money supply Bretton Woods system Hedge (finance) Insurance Chernobyl accident Hyperinflation Bond Enron Corporation Goldman Sachs Great Depression 9/11 conspiracy theories U.S. public debt Mutual fund Welding Eliot Spitzer Law of value Technical analysis Professional wrestling holds Monetary policy Explosive material Inflation Reagan Administration Foreign exchange market Modern portfolio theory Collateralized debt obligation Annuity Gold as an investment Stock market Fire extinguisher Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans International Monetary Fund Supply and demand Normal distribution Risk management Hedging Phase (matter) Tai Chi Chuan Fast bowling Professional wrestling Finance Dragon Booster Star Trek: Enterprise Digital photography Sea level rise Gravity Probe B Investment bank Supernatural Carburetor Collapse of the World Trade Center Speculation Property tax Future energy development Nuclear power Vacuum Ravi Shastri Spice Girls Unemployment Mortgage-backed security Commodity markets Baroque chess Year 2000 problem Situation comedy Climate change Say's law Oxy-fuel welding and cutting The Shining (film) Global warming Many-worlds interpretation Neoliberalism Siphon Capitalism Supply-side economics Dowsing Three Mile Island Margin (finance) The Inside Fiat money RuneScape quests Equine conformation
