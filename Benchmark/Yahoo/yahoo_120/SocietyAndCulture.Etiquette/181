is tipping going too far it seems just about every service known these days expects a tip i went to a fast food restaurant franchise that had a tip jar and this particular restaurant always has bad service is that even allowed can someone break it down for example horseback riding trail leaders dry cleaners bell hops that put your luggage in the cab there've been a few times when i've pondered should i have tipped that guy i think it's gone way too far you're right everyone expects a tip these days especially at the holidays i even get a card taped to my trash cans with my trash collector's name stamped inside so we know who to make the check out to i even had a skycap at the airport tell me no fewer than times in minutes that he works for tips like i've never flown before personally i am sick of it now i tip when i feel like it and when the service rendered deserves it i tip in restaurants when i get good service if i get really crappy service i do not leave a good tip i usually leave something just no the expected remember when it was i do not put in tip jars for a cup of coffee starbucks shoud pay their employees properly while charging that amount for coffee tips means to insure promt proper service if i do not get either it is reflected in the tip i used to bartend and wait tables i worked hard for my tips service staff today need to realize that they can't just show up and get tons of extra in tips they have to earn it i feel that if i feel resentful over leaving a tip then the tip wasn't deserved if i feel happy to leave a tip then the person has earned it Tip Poker jargon Octopus card Tea Health insurance Coffee Waiter Craps Menstrual cup United States Postal Service Microeconomics Insurance Friends Life insurance Coffeehouse Soldering The Amazing Race Brand Restaurant Draw poker Cannabis cultivation In-N-Out Burger Shaggy dog story Cha chaan teng Futurama (TV series - season 5) Epcot Knife Taxicab Economy of Cuba Dilbert Tenshinhan Betting (poker) Yum cha Copyleft Credit card Mutual fund The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Star Wars Holiday Special Aerial (dance move) Docklands Light Railway Theory of conduct Equine conformation Surveillance Sant Baljit Singh Kill Bill Drill bit Airport Bay Area Rapid Transit First aid The Drew Carey Show Wayne Gretzky RuneScape economy Fast food Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Sandy Koufax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank Unemployment benefit Condom Radiohead Knots Landing Time Out of Mind Volleyball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Electrophysiology Public transport American Idiot Procrastination Cuisine of Denmark Champagne (beverage) Wal-Mart Table tennis Ice hockey National Football League Unemployment Days of our Lives Alex Ferguson Saturday Night Live Mnemonic Jon Secada Full Metal Panic?
