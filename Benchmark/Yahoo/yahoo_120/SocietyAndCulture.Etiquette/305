if your child throws up outside a restaurant do you feel that the employees of the restaurant should clean it up or as a parent do you feel it is just another part of being a parent and it's your responsibility to clean up after your own kid it wasn't my kid the kid wasn't sick just gagged while eating too much and ran out the door there were no tables outside just a line of people waiting to get a table the puke was aimed for the bushes but apparently missed and hit some of the wood decking as well the mother and father were both with this kid the kid went right back to the table and continued to eat the mother was annoyed that no one from the restaurant helped clean up i don't think the employees even knew what was going on i personally think that it is the parent's job to clean up after their kids i would never expect a college aged restaurant worker to clean up vomit outside of the restaurant i would tell the manager of the restaurant that your child had a accident outside and ask for a bucket of water i think it is the responsibility of the parent to clean it up inside or outside One Tree Hill (TV series) Sento The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Friends Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Milton H.
