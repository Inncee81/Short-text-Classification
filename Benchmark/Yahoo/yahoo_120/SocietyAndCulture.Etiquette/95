tell lifeguard when ppl drink at the beach i know that it is illegal for people to drink on a public beach and sometimes you will see a person sneak some once in a while i normally dont mind as long as they aren't being rowdy but the other day i saw a couple with a cooler who were sneaking vodka and other spirits into their soda cans while their kids were around it was a very quiet beach and they were getting loud and silly while the kids were running around unsupervised the lifeguard seemed to want to say something but didnt after a while they were clearly intoxicated and i approached the lifeguard mentioning i had seen them slip stuff into their sodas he said he would talk to them but all he said was that they had to keep it down without mentioning the alcohol the lifeguard was a teenager in the future what can i do about this if you drink on the beach and you are rowdy you are disturbing other people's good time yes you should tell the lifeguard everything and its the lifeguards decision whether to bring up alcohol or not i don't mind if people drink just to cool down and relax just be respectful towards the people around you Alcoholic beverage Drowning Swimming pool The Catcher in the Rye Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Vodka Social rule Cocktail Driving under the influence Ripped Pants Mothers Against Drunk Driving Drink Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Lifeguard The Beach Boys Beaches of Hong Kong Alcoholism Insomnia Drunk driving (United States) Sauna Codename: Kids Next Door Ocean Beach, New York Camp Lazlo Hyperthermia Caffeine Mountain Dew Trailer Park Boys Wine French cuisine Humphrey Bogart Drunkenness Red Bull The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Coffeehouse Long Island Iced Tea Distilled beverage Radiohead Swimming Polyethylene terephthalate Squidward Tentacles Alcohol Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sunset Beach (soap opera) Sin City Stewie Griffin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Coca-Cola About a Boy Moonshine Fecal incontinence Archie Comics Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Teen Girl Squad Straight edge Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Jennings Randolph Lake Jack Kerouac Characters in Bleach series USS Tigrone (SS-419) Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
