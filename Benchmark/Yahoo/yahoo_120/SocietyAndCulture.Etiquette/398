what happened to personal space i find myself at a company where touching seems to be commonplace this makes me uncomfortable i find it unnecessary and very unprofessional i don t mean to sound frigid or antisocial but i was brought up to respect personal space and was taught that physical closeness touching is an intimate thing that is reserved for family close friends and significant others the thing is i don t comprehend by osmosis so if you are explaining something to me then you needn t put your hand on my shoulder or back i understand you quite well via the use of my ears likewise if you are speaking to me then you needn t stand so close to me that your nose is merely inches from mine i have no hearing impairments i hear quite well what really gets me is when i take a step back the close talker takes a step forward when i have said please don t touch me the toucher does it again down the line why is it so difficult to respect someone s personal space haha i understand completely when i transitioned from working for an american bank to a french one the continental europeans would stand so close i felt like our noses were about to touch when they were talking to me for me i feel the best thing to do is just make the other person feel at ease if they feel they need to stand four inches from you to talk to you let them by putting them at ease they can talk about the work situation they need to get through as long as it doesn't cross a line into inappropriate i did once try to say something but it made things terribly awkward and that person just felt like they couldn't work with me anymore which you don't want if it really bothers you and you want to change things when they are standing there and you walk up to speak with them stop two feet away then three build it up until you've got your bubble and it will not be a shock to them they'll barely notice regarding the pat on the back etc i haven't figured out what to do with that except ignore and don't reciprocate in the hopes that they will catch on also be aware that they are trying to convey emphasis or kindness with their gestures so you will have to compensate if you don't want gestures touching make up for it with a kinder softer tone more intonation emphasis they'll realize your method gets the job done sufficiently Social rule Milton H.
