friend constantly complains about weight but won't work out she also won't watch what she eats i even got her a free gym membership to my gym and she only went with me once i'm so tired of hearing her complain about her weight always being late i have nothing to wear etc what can i say to her and yes she is about pounds overweight she had a baby months ago and uses that as an excuse don't answer if you can't bother to read the whole question she has not lost any weight since having the baby first off it takes about a year to get the baby weight all the way off so even though she's using it as an excuse keep telling her that it will take a while to lose it but you also needs to tell your friend that she needs to stop complaining to you about her weight issues if she's not going to do anything about it all you can really say is the truth you know she's not doing anything about her weight and everytime she complains about it tell she can do something about it and that you are willing to help if she is unwilling to have your assistance then tell her to quit complaining The Contender (television series) Friends Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ben Johnson (athlete) Pok__mon Live!
