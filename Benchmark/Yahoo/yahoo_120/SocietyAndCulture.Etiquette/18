can you complain about people upstairs making too much noise during sex i live alone in my apatment and the couple upstairs have sex almost every day night and each time i can hear the bed making that creeking noise loudly its so disturbing to hear and its really embaressing when i have guests over am i able to complain to the office about it can i do anything about it i want it to stop i cant live here any longe if i have to hear that noise every night btw i had a really hard time picking a category so sorry if its wrong i know i cant stop people fom having sex but perhaps i can get them to try and find a way of having sex that does not involve other people hearing it it isnt my business i dont want to hear it your first approach should be to the upstairs tenants in this particular case it might be more sensitive to do this with a well penned note through their door i would make it matter of fact i would not be specific at this moment in time as to the nature of the disturbance just mention the times that the noise became an invasive annoyance in your apartment they will know what you are talking about without you having to sound as though you are a pervert listening to private moments or not so private at the moment if you do not get any feedback then it is time to go to the caretaker or whoever looks after the building or even the building management company but you have to bear in mind that this could go one of two ways if they are the sort of people who glory in letting everyone know what they are up to they could very well increase the activity and the volume but i hope for your sake that they are just a little bit unaware of how enthusiatic they sounding and will want their private life to return to just that i do wish you well it is an uncomfortable position to be in in the meantime turn up the volume on your tv radio and buy some ear plugs Social rule A Day in the Life Sin City Hearing impairment Friends The Shining (film) Avenue Q Headphones Hearing aid Strap-on dildo The Inside The Star Wars Holiday Special Music Infantilism Surveillance Jam (TV series) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Milton H.
