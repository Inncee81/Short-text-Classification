how can i get my coworker stop bringing in junk food i've asked politely i've asked directly i've told her that diabetes runs in my family that i have a major sweet tooth and that her bringing in double fudge marshmallow treats every day and setting them on the counter next to my desk is cruel i even threatened to put diabetes patients' amputated toes feet on her desk if she doesn't quit but still she brings in the goods our office is loaded with all the ice cream cookies snacks and junk food you could want but it is all kept in the kitchen and so is not a constant evil temptation i have heard others ask her as well not to bring in sweets so often but she just laughs and thinks it's funny i know that my lack of willpower is my problem not hers but if someone admitted to being an alcoholic would it be considered thoughtful polite or appropriate to start happy hour in their cube each morning at am once in a while would be one thing but this is every day how do i get this overbearing glucose pusher to back off sometimes the more you say the more likely someone is going to do what you don't want they like to get a rise out of you say nothing and bring in fresh fruit or healthy snacks and just put them on the desk if nothing else you will have a choice when you see those other forbidden snacks it's worth a try Diabetes mellitus Snack food Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hypoglycemia Food Shaggy dog story Confectionery Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Insulin Hamster Tooth Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Atkins Nutritional Approach Ice cream Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Good Morning, Vietnam Oreo The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Street food Gastroparesis Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Social rule One Piece minor characters Dilbert Healthy eating Glucose Customs and etiquette of Japan Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Knots Landing Dental caries Hyperglycemia Grandview, U.S.A.
