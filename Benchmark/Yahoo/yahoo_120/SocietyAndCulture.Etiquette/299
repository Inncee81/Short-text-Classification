birthday etiquette please read more only if you intend to be honest and polite thank you ok after posting my last q and the responders deliberately being rude calling names i will not tolerate any of that nonsense this time heres my dilemma my girls are yr wks apart we have one large party that falls between their bdays every year this is because they're blessed to have such a large extended family that love them and want to attend it makes it easier for family to come in from out of town we live in vegas for one party instead of parties usually around friends family attend that are only wks apart not to mention the pocket book now on each girl s actual bday my hubby i do a small intimate special day catered to whatever the bday girl wants to do that day this year she wants chucke e cheese how do i invite her grandparents pl and aunt uncle cousins pl who live here in town to come enjoy the fun but pay their own way this is not a real birthday party and no presents given since the huge party is only weeks away i m not being cheep we just honestly don t have the money to pay for other than our selves last year we learned the hard way these same people we verbally invited to come hang out and we were left with the bill again let me make it clear this is not a party we send out invitations to nor is there presents exchanged on this small day catered to the bday girl because it s saved for the huge party that falls only weeks later i feel uncomfortable not inviting them because we see her grandparents and aunt her family on a weekly basis since we live in the same town if i don t invite them i know they will have hurt feelings but i just can t afford to cover their bill again this year i feel pressured into it seeing they have more of an income to play with when it comes to these things how do i politely tell them they are more than welcome to come join in the fun but regrettably they will have to cover the cost of their own food drinks game tokens just tell them that your daughter wants to go to cec's on her b day ask them if they would like to join you remind them that it is just a fun outing and that gifts are not expected etc try to arrive before them and order your food when they go through the line they can order theirs Poker jargon Social rule Birthday Pitaten Garfield Fancy Crane Theory of conduct Wedding Crashers The O.C.
