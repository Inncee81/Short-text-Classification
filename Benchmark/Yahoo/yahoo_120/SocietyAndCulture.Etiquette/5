dining out and loo trips i tend to avoid loo trips during meals although when they last a long time and there's a lot of wine flowing this isn't always possible so i dissappear between courses where possible any other tips for timing visits always a difficult one but between courses is ok but sometimes the interval is quite short i made the mistake once of excusing myself from the table for the toilet having not noticed that a lady had a few seconds before quietly left the room she used the downstairs toilet and i went upstairs we both appeared back together after about minutes and when my wife and i got home we had a great big row as she thought that we had been in the toilet together having some nookey i tried to explain but she as women don't would not listen and i spent the night in a spare room the women's husband also had the same thoughts and i subsequently found out that they had a similar confrontation when my wife phoned the hostess the following day to thank her for the evening she casually asked about the existence of the two toilets and was put right and all was forgiven the women's husband did not make such a phone call but phoned me instead to confront me with his knowledge i put him on to my wife and she explained to him the toilet arrangements at that house all blew over but that other couple were divorced two years later Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Shining (film) The Inside Social rule The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Toilet Ocean's Twelve Rent (musical) Plame affair Time Out of Mind Dead Like Me Friends Blood on the Tracks World War Three (Doctor Who) Sin City Harrow School Episodes of Lost (Season 1) About a Boy What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
