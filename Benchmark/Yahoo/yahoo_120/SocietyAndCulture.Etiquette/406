am i being clingy so i've been with my boyfriend for years all of a sudden i feel like i'm being really clingy like if he doesn't call me for a day i think something is terribly wrong i know it's just because he's about ready to leave for a backpacking trip for the next week and i won't be able to even talk to him because he won't get service on the trails not only that but i'm hours away from him right now because we i went home for a week to see my family and our homes are hours away we met at college but it seems like he doesn't really want to talk to me that badly normally he is really excited when i call and has alot to say but for the past day he hasn't been so now i'm all paranoid that he's going to break up with me when he gets back or something he does stay up late to talk to me still but now i feel like i care more like he's too busy he says that he does really miss me but he's just been acting different the past day do you think it's just because he's busy yes you're being clingy that said it's a natural reaction to prolonged seperation in a young relationship and yes years is young you just have to remember to keep some perspective the odds are he's just distracted by the fact that he's home and all that that entails catching up with family and friends checking out old haunts and realizing that home isn't the way you remember it also he's got a big trip coming up and that's probably on his mind as well just remember to breathe he's been with you for a year and a half things have gone well so far and will likely continue to do so find something to do to distract yourself explore a hobby you've been putting off while he's around call up a girlfriend you haven't seen in a while set up a theme night outing bowling and dinner dressed as miss usa contestants as a random example with a group of friends and put your extra time and nervous energy into preparing for that don't get all worked up and him centric while he's gone if you do you'll be miserable the whole time he's gone no relationship is healthy if every second is about the relationship you had your own interests before you met him right how are those interests doing now have you let them whither and die while you spend time with him those interests are part of why he fell for you in the first place use this time apart to rekindle them and return to your roots when he comes back you'll be happy to see him and you'll have things to talk to him about and share with him and on the cynical side if he does decide to break up with you when he gets back you'll already have a list of other things to do that don't require him Friends Shaggy dog story EastEnders Theory of conduct Avenue Q Social rule Pitaten The Smoking Room The Amber Spyglass Miss Saigon 1957 World Series Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ocean's Twelve New York Giants Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind One Tree Hill (TV series) T'Pol Poker jargon The Ashlee Simpson Show Big Brother UK series 6 Phoebe Halliwell Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) W.I.T.C.H.
