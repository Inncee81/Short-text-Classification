what would you do if you were me the last time my friends relations came to visit they asked him to collect them from the airport a hour drive from where he lives meaning a hour round trip for him i work about a half hour drive from the airport and make the hour drive to our home town at weekends so i offered to collect the visitors they told me their flight was in at pm but they made a mistake and it wasn't in until almost pm which meant i didnt get home until well after midnight they never apologised for making me wait nor offered me any token of appreciation this trip was an extra hour's drive for me they are coming over again this weekend and have hinted at getting a lift with me again i'd rather get home much earlier on a friday night to go out with my friends and besides i think they were rude so why they hell should i put myself out for them however if i dont collect them my friend will have to do the hr journey as busses stop at pm what would you do just let it be known very simply as soon as possible that you have already made plans for friday night and sorry but you won't be available and furthermore the courtesy is only available in cases of extreme need as you have appointments to keep at the weekend i think you should have a chat with your friend about it because somepeople think that one favour means a lifetime's committment they may not be willing to travel so often if it's not that easy for them or they will have to arrange to get an earlier flight so they can get a bus i got badly caught like this once when a neighbour i didn't know that well asked me for a lift to her work place which was sort of on the way to my job i had to take a minute detour which made me late she turned up on my doorstep the next morning at am just like that and expected the same again except i was on a day off she shouted at me how am i supposed to get to work so i had to put her straight told her my work hours were erratic that i didn't have the same starting time every day and that i didn't mind an emergency but that was it she hasn't spoken to me since Social rule Sydney Riot of 1879 The Amazing Race The Family from One End Street Ocean's Twelve Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Operation Market Garden Public transport Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Norway national football team Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Wheel of Fortune Lee Harvey Oswald Miami-Dade Transit 2003 North America blackout Time Out of Mind James Hanratty Transport in Hong Kong Saturday Night Live 2005 trial of Michael Jackson One Tree Hill (TV series) Dead Like Me EastEnders Paul Morphy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Soap opera Operation Yellow Ribbon Little Britain Meat Loaf Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 San Francisco Municipal Railway Continuation War History of Test cricket (to 1883) Taxicab 24 Hours of Le Mans MTV2 Good Morning, Vietnam 1957 World Series Eddie Guerrero New York Giants Paul Is Dead Mojave people Ben Johnson (athlete) Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Ayrton Senna Alex Ferguson John Cage Midnight Run Battles of Lexington and Concord Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Machinima The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Utility cycling Incarnations of Immortality Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Oasis (band) The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) Rosa Parks Have I Got News For You The Amber Spyglass IBM PC compatible About a Boy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Indianapolis 500 Pitaten Knots Landing Avenue Q WNNX (FM) Extras (sitcom) She Loves You Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Hey Jude Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Detailed timeline of the assassination of John F.
