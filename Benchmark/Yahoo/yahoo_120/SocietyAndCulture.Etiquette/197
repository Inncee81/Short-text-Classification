the boss is throwing a party do i have to go my boss is having his annual party and expects me to be there we're a small company and my job is managing the office i scheduled a vacation over the same weekend that he's having his party and he's been giving me hell about it for two weeks he claims that not only did i hurt his feelings but our customers expect for me to be there i feel like parties should be optional not mandatory yes i really am going out of town for vacation w my boyfriend my son and my brother the boss was very vague about when the party was so i made reservations only to find out later that the party was the same weekend i'm not cancelling my plans but someone in real life said you have to go you are the voice of the company and now i feel like a heal i apologized to the boss and told him next year i would attend all is good sort of now it sounds as though you don't really want to go tell him that you've already made plans for that weekend and that you've put down a non refundable deposit or you've gotten non refundable airline tickets or whatever is appropriate to your situation i can't imagine an after work hours party being mandatory ask your boss to please give everyone your regrets for not being there EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Singlish Knots Landing Dilbert Social rule James T.
