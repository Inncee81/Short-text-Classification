the expense of weddings why do couples make things so much more expensive for their guests these days by going away for their weddings when you get married you save up to have the wedding you want and therefore have an idea of how much you are going to spend when you have been invited to a friends wedding you like to buy nice present new clothes to look nice at the wedding and then these days you have to pay for accomodation for a couple of nights to a week for going abroad i appreciate that a couple likes to chose where they get married but if they do want friends and relations to watch them take their vows surely they should get married in their community and then go off to whatever destination they like according to their own funds i don't want to sound mean but when it comes to bills or new clothes for a wedding and overnight at a hotel my sensible head says bills i should have added i really genuinely would love to see my two friends get married and will be upset to miss it people who get married at a place where all of the guests will have to travel must expect that this will reduce the number in attendance significantly not only is it a matter of monetary expense but also of time it's become difficult to take time off i just saw an article saying people now take day weekends than a week off not everyone may like the beach or the mountains or wherever the wedding is taking place destination weddings are great for two people the bride and the groom who immediately get to go on their honeymoon for the rest it may just be okay i'd send my regrets get a nice gift and wish them well and by no means feel badly that you can't go White wedding Friends Wedding Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Social rule Mail-order bride Knots Landing Wedding Crashers Wedding reception Kill Bill Miss Saigon Saturday Night Live Humphrey Bogart The Amazing Race Wedding ring Ocean's Twelve Edward VIII of the United Kingdom ABBA God Emperor of Dune Tourism Sally Ann Howes Little Britain EastEnders Jewish view of marriage Stephanie McMahon-Levesque Lauren Bacall Marilyn Monroe Kimono Arthur Cayley Charles, Prince of Wales George Costanza Women in Islam Avenue Q Sharon Tate Incarnations of Immortality Theodore Roosevelt Publicly funded medicine Animal Crossing About a Boy We Belong Together Blenheim Palace Babe Ruth Fiddler on the Roof The Apprentice 2 Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Drew Carey Show Juliana of the Netherlands Haven (TNG episode) Kevin and Kell Saved by the Bell Green Day Arjuna Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Etiquette Flat tax Jewish holiday Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Sleeping Murder Jennifer Lopez Have I Got News For You 613 mitzvot Culture of the United States Good Times Surveillance Hyperinflation Viva La Bam Coronation Street Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Jumping the shark Funeral Divorce Britney Spears Fancy Crane The Phantom Manor Microeconomics Neighbours Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cary Grant Culture of Bangladesh The Emancipation of Mimi Culture of Thailand The McGuire Sisters Mormon missionary Melanie Wilkes Rich Mullins Live 8 Shot of Love Random Harvest Futurama (TV series - season 5) Chinese marriage Anne Boleyn Big Brother UK series 6 Father's Day (Doctor Who) Inflation
