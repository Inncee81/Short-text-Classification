are different cultures in america really trying to blend together i am asking this question because i consider myself an american eventhough i am of multiculteral decent i see and hear blacks refering to themselves as african americans polish refering to themselves as polish americans mexicans refering to themselves as mexican americans etc is this truely how we see ourselves or is this the way that certain groups perpetuate the racism that seems to be growing at an alarming rate in this country as i see it if we continue to segregate ourselves culturaly we will never acheive the racial harmony we all claim we want whats your oppinion although i believe we do need to reach a certain amount of harmony among races i do not think that people should give up their cultural heritage altogether america is unique in that we have the opportunity to learn so much about nearly every culture in the world we need to take advantage of this opportunity and not shove it away in the name of blending together the way to racial harmony is through acceptance the way to acceptance is through education in order to achieve racial peace each community needs to take on the responsibility of education more events such as cultural fairs and the like should take place only through education are we ever going to see racial harmony Affirmative action Hispanic African American Race (U.S. Census) Racial segregation Music genre Brown v.
