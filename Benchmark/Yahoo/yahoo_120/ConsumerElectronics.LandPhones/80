vonage if you have it what are the pro s and cons i am sick of my phone company and the ridiculous prices i keep seeing these vonage ads but i m skeptical if you have vonage please share your experience and tell me if they are all they say they are how exactly does it work and if you had it to do all over again would you please provide feedback thanks only down sides for vonage for me have been lost packets when using internet connection for heavy surfing vpn connections resulting in stutter on voice line vonage doesn't use rsvp so there is no guarantee that you'll be able to maintain bandwidth while you use your internet connection not saying that you can't but there is an effect using a cable company telephone service like comcast or such isn't impacted by the internet usage as the signal is carried on a different frequency on the cable than that used by the high speed internet also i have frequently experienced delayed voice messages for voice mail up to days on vonage have complained many times over past years they never have dealt with that all that said i am very cheap and like the phone svc with taxes over and above the increased realiability of traditional lec based phones they stay up when power is out or the cable vendor phone plans i won't switch until they go under from the current lawsuit brought by verizon for patent infringement ultimately i think vonage will go under but i'm going to ride it down as long as i can btw the lec's spread this stuff about not being able to be located when you call not true you do have to register your address with vonage so that the information can be sent to the call center just one extra step Voice over IP Telephone Integrated Services Digital Network Modem Broadband Internet access Session Initiation Protocol Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Asynchronous Transfer Mode Cable television Phreaking 9-1-1 Telephone exchange Telegraphy IP Multimedia Subsystem Enhanced 911 Telephone tapping Digital Subscriber Line Frame relay Radio Skype Packet switching Bluetooth Television AT&T Ethernet Private branch exchange Cellular network Global System for Mobile Communications Network Switching Subsystem Toll-free telephone number Wi-Fi Internet service provider WiMAX Amateur radio Direct marketing Public Switched Telephone Network TiVo Mobile phone Morse Code Sprint Nextel Corporation General Packet Radio Service Spam (electronic) Universal Serial Bus Central processing unit Denial-of-service attack Audiophile Mouse (computing) E-mail Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line America Online Quality of service Electronic amplifier Google X.25 Coaxial cable Network effect Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Oscilloscope Antenna (radio) Public transport Transmission Control Protocol Teletext IEEE 802.11 NSA encryption systems Communications protocol Gmail Password Telephone numbering plan Bell System CDMA2000 Tesco Audio data compression CPU cache Loudspeaker Virtual private network Broadband Networks Submarine communications cable Electric power transmission Radio clock Global Positioning System XML High-voltage direct current Power line communication Telstra ITU-T Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Radiotelephone Software patent debate AppleTalk NTSC CompuServe Digital television Differentiated services
