circuit to start a phone all with message i want a battery powered circuit with switch to activated a circuit to start a phone call with message too high water level in sump hole cavity is the reason i would check x com what i would probably do would be to get the alarm system from them that instead of calling a central monitoring station will call upto preprogrammed numbers then instead of a door or window contact i would modify it so that it would trip the alarm when the water gauge clicks past a certain level i would have this connected to a separate float then the one that controls the sump pump as you do not want to be called every time the pump comes on only if it rises over a higher level that for whatever reason the pump wasnt able to pump out fast enough Thermal power station Burglar alarm Apollo Command/Service Module Fire alarm control panel Carburetor Locomotive Diode 2003 North America blackout Voice over IP Glossary of firefighting equipment Aircraft engine controls Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Cave diving Telephone exchange Federal Standard 1037C Vacuum Embedded system Siphon GSM services Switch Hydraulic machinery Solar power Transistor E85 Oscilloscope Circuit breaker Motor oil Skype Programmable logic controller Mooney M20 Domestic AC power plugs and sockets SCADA Musical Instrument Digital Interface X10 (industry standard) Semiconductor device Telephone Telephone tapping IPod Computer Residual-current device Space shuttle main engine Network Switching Subsystem Tesla coil Rebreather Infusion pump Computer bus Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Toyota Prius Apollo Guidance Computer Windows XP Dialysis Three Mile Island Fossil fuel power plant Computer virus Naval mine CPU design MOSFET Pump Circuit design Transformer Diving regulator Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Mach kernel Hydroponics Battery (electricity) Digital circuit PowerPC Logic gate Relay IP Multimedia Subsystem Submersible pump Capacitor D-subminiature Diesel engine Jumpstart 3rd Grade Liquid crystal display Turbocharger Action potential Cellular network Dimmer Integrated Services Digital Network Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Daylight saving time Electrical generator Lake Burley Griffin Phreaking Glossary of firefighting terms Ford Ranger EV USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus Rail terminology RISC Windows 2000 TGV
