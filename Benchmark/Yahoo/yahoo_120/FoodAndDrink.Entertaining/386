any good ideas for a sweet birthday party i'm turning on june th yeah i know it's a long time but my parents plan everything like a year before and i'd like to do something really special since it's a big deal the problem is none of my friends get along i'm i guess you can say 'clique floater' and i have a lot of friends that are from different 'cliques' and so if i have a girls' night out they'll probably get into fights or something i originally wanted to do a big s hollywood themed party but i'm worried that it might cause awkwardness and none of my friends really dance here are some ideas you might be able to use my idea is for a capture the flag party i'm going to be turning so i thought i'll try something new our local park district has a lot of hiking trails and camp outs areas around it so it'll take place there the invitations could be a torn up piece of paper with all the usuals on it then also send with it a colored bandana i e a orange bandana for the orange team then once all the guests get there with they're bandanas showing what team they are on there are teams each team has a headquarters where the flag is located you'll also need lots of water balloons it should also be hot out you might need to explain the game to your guests some people stay back an guard the flag while others head out to get the other teams flag is the point of the game is to capture the other team's flag and bring it back to your team headquarters you can also capture prisoners from the other team and put them in the jail at the headquarters if you hit them with a water balloon then you've caught them but you have to keep your jail guarded or all the prisoners can run away no hitting or tackling is allowed for the player's safety during the duration of the game you should have water in case anybody is thirsty when it's over everybody comes back from food and a small party i e time for cake presents music and all that stuff have fun and play safe for my th birthday party we did a mall madness game idea for those of you who dont know what mall madness is it is a board game kind of thing for mainly girls in the game you have certain things to shop for but anyway for the birthday party party of we all went out to dinner first next we actually began the party we split into teams of two make sure everyone on the team gets along for the most fun each team got i was born on the th of february each team had to buy items my name is shannon so each team had to buy an item that started with an s h a etc the team that spent the closest to won that game keep all receipts so you can return everything the second part of the party took more planning my parents took close up pictures of things in the mall with a digital camera they gave each team copies of the same pictures we had to plot where those things were on the map and take a picture with someone on our team standing in front of where the close up picture was taken make sure your mall is ok with people taking pictures the team that correctly guessed the most pictures one that game the rest of the night we played the actual game and ate cake and stuff it was a great party The Ashlee Simpson Show Tag Spidey Super Stories Wheel of Fortune New York Giants Big Brother (USA TV series) American football Birthday Garfield Satchel Paige Glossary of American football The Amazing Race 1957 World Series The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Late Night with Conan O'Brien Paintball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Quake III Arena EastEnders RuneScape quests Mario Customs and etiquette of Japan Baroque chess Marching band American football strategy Humphrey Bogart The Contender (television series) Cincinnati Bengals The Price Is Right Whose Line Is It Anyway?
