when you get an invitation in the mail wedding dinner party etc do u assume your kids are invited too in this scenario the invitation is addressed to you and your spouse you are the only ones named on the envelope even if it is to a cocktail party do you still assume your kids are welcome note i'm not asking because i don't know i'm asking b c i have a lot of cocktail and dinner parties i'm always surprised by the number of people who don't know and show up with their kids kids are not included when they are not on the invitation you're put in a tough spot when someone shows up with kids it is an error of etiquette on their part to assume that it is okay to bring their children with them i might suggest that for the next or parties you have a babysitter on hand and let the guests that come with children that you generally don't have children at your parties but you have provided a babysitter on this occasion hopefully they will get the point that children are not invited you do however run the risk that guest think that a babysitter will be provided Wedding Crashers Mail Day care Customs and etiquette of Japan Little Britain Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) Meal Gmail The Brady Bunch Starfleet ranks and insignia Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Etiquette Divorce Saturday Night Live SAML Envelope Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Domain Name System Whose Line Is It Anyway?
