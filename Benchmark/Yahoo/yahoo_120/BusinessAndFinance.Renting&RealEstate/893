pre home construction question new home construction i was looking up property online and was wondering what the cost would be to hook up the utilities the lot i was interested in is in town and the description states that the elec water is at the street also is it more expensive to have a home with a large footprint or one with a small one thats multiple stories thanks there are homes in the area the lot is partially cleared surrounded by large trees and doesn't require a septic tank when talking about additions to a house it is always less expensive to add to the ground floor rather than adding another story so i would assume the same would be true when building originally tapping into utilities can get costly but there is even more expense getting to the access point for example it costs abou to tap into the water another to tap into the sewer where i live but that isn't including what it costs to pipe from the house so if you have a deep lot it may be quite a bit more i don't know what the electric company charges but i do know they will charge you for the meter which cost like around here i suggest you speak to your builder about these costs in your area Autonomous building Septic tank Water supply Wind turbine Sewage treatment Mach kernel Solar power McMansion Seismic retrofit Energy development Irrigation Bungalow Microeconomics Kitchen Construction Transformer Solar panel Mars, Pennsylvania Wind power Manitoba Hydro Rapid transit Hydropower Geodesic dome Roof and tunnel hacking Theory of conduct Renewable energy Electrical wiring Solar power satellite Tesla coil High-voltage direct current Nuclear power CPU design Ocean thermal energy conversion Electric power transmission Cruising (maritime) Supply and demand Insurance Zerg Natural gas Dundas Square Welding Lechaina Hydrogen economy PlayStation 3 Adjoint functors Urban sprawl Quicksort Wardenclyffe Tower Collapse of the World Trade Center Extreme Programming Easement Natural monopoly Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Straw-bale construction Naval mine Thermal power station Property tax Telephone tapping Independent Subway System Items in the Metroid series King City, Ontario Halting problem Software patent debate Bong CPU cache Digital circuit G__del's incompleteness theorem Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Economics Drill bit West Side Highway Protoss Bass guitar Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Gas metal arc welding Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Gross domestic product Chopper (motorcycle) Life insurance SimCity 4 Langmuir probe Wildfire Tank landing ship Windows XP Alternative fuel Cray-1 Big Dig Mixed martial arts Atari 8-bit family Taxation in the United States BASIC programming language Montr__al-Mirabel International Airport Milton H.
