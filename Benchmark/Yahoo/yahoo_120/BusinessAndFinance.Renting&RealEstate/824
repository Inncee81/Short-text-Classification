is a money merge account a good idea while looking into refinancing my mortage the broker told me about a money merge account and said it would be a great way for me to build equity and get out of debt fast we live paycheck to paycheck as it is would this really be a good idea for me or it is a gimmick not a very good explanation by the broker you should have asked him to explain further this is only my own thinking there are morgtage holders all brand new in us who carry the morgtage a person has his her entire paycheck every payday deposited into an account with the morgtage holder i understand that other debts can be held also car credit cards etc then actually a line of credit is available to the client to explain from the deposits the normal monthly morgtage payment is paid either by your check or as a draft when the payroll check is deposited on that day all the money is applied to the morgtage principle this reduces the principle for that day and any subsequent days that the money remains in the account now as above the credit line you are able to write checks from the account for any and all the bills that you normally pay every month car payment to the same company or other credit car payment to the same co or other etc groceries clothing utilities etc it's just as critical here as anytime not to overdraw your income from that account here's the kicker every day that you have a balance in the account which is reducing the principle on the morgtage on a daily basis you have saved interest on the morgtage which is equivilent to earning the same interest as the morgtage interest rate at the end of the month any balance is still applied to the morgtage principle thereby reducing the daily interest until the next payday or later if there is no balance and you have not overdrawn the amount of original deposit you have saved interest for that month even though you may not have paid down the principle since you left no balance you should be aware that saving interest every month year eventually pays off the morgtage sooner interest is calculated by the day same as credit cards in some cases a year morgtage may be paid off in years all this would have to be calculated to fully understand the savings it is sometimes stated that you earn the same interest as the morgtage rate a little confusing one is not paid that interest it's interest saved a penny saved is a penny earned right bear in mind that the morgtage holder can earn money by using your cash in the account on a daily basis in several ways money market loans etc for instance if you have a low interest loan they may be able to loan your money at a new higher interest rate this is only my understanding not carved in stone i understand this came from australia to the us you will have research to verify Mortgage Bond Microeconomics Debt Bank Monetary policy FairTax Annuity Deflation (economics) Primerica Financial Services Tax Money supply Gold standard Social Security (United States) Insurance Mutual fund Cheque Interest Economy of Russia Short selling Internet fraud Bank fraud Finance Estoppel Citigroup Predatory lending United Kingdom corporation tax Credit score Stock Social Security debate (United States) Islamic banking Corporate finance Student loan Certificate of deposit Margin (finance) Octopus card Refinancing Payday loan PE ratio Savings and loan association Law of value Life insurance Financial audit Derivative (finance) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bretton Woods system Supply-side economics Capital accumulation Keynesian economics Treasury security Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Intellectual property Mergers and acquisitions Debt consolidation Economy of India Payroll Unemployment benefit Fiat money 401(k) Capitalism Double-entry book-keeping Hyperinflation Euro Government debt Schabir Shaik Trial Debit card Corporation Federal National Mortgage Association Fractional-reserve banking Legal tender Futures contract Unemployment Poker jargon History of the United States (1918-1945) Reaganomics Tertiary education fees in Australia Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Central bank Surplus value Investment bank Savings and Loan crisis Corporate governance Microcredit Ford Motor Company Arthur Laffer
