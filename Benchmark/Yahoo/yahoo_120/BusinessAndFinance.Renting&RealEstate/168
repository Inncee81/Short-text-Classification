if sellers make counter offer a house listed as i made an offer of and the seller pays closing prepaids today i not sure if she heard through the grapevine or not that the sellers are going to offer to pay half of the closing costs only and counter that is fairly reasonable to me but it's not quite where i need to be to feel comfortable w the monthly payments etc i have financing on loan can i negotiate w the mortgage company for a lower rate also what is a good counter offer to the sellers counter offer actually this was questions thanks for your replies for one thing you need to set a limit that you can live with in other words with closing costs etc at what amount is it that you are comfortable with the loan at this time most mortgages are going at around but money is getting very tight in fact the central bank is pumping a lot of money into the economy right now so that the mortgage market doesn't go nuts so you can shop around and you might get a lower rate but right now i would simply assume i can get the if that rate has been guaranteed by the lender so i would just work with the make the amount you need to be at your top price now assuming the price is somewhere between seller pay all and seller pay i would counter half way between the amount you need with seller paying and and seller let's say that number you must have is seller pays all costs ideally i would still insist on seller paying of costs but you raise your price a bit and for an odd number like seller pays all closing costs let the real estate agent know you are right at your limit chances are the seller will accept but even if they counter they will know you are at your limit if they counter again recounter at seller pays for all costs etc which is only a fraction more if they want to sell they will if they deadlock and refuse your offer then you can give in with a big show of desperation for or hope this helps Mortgage Insurance Supply and demand Real estate broker Microeconomics Interest Bond Short selling Deflation (economics) Capitalism Islamic banking Government National Mortgage Association Financial markets Price discrimination Economics Monetary policy Debt Security (finance) Student loan Gold standard Life insurance Federal National Mortgage Association Predatory lending FairTax Contract Annual percentage rate Credit card Surplus value Title insurance Unconscionability Mutual fund Inflation Mortgage-backed security Money Stock Tax Subsidy Annuity Primerica Financial Services Capital accumulation Economy of Russia Option Derivative (finance) Bretton Woods system Supply-side economics Tariff Monopoly Real estate bubble Federal Reserve Central bank Gross domestic product Value added tax Real estate Taxation in the United States Intellectual property Keynesian economics Usury Donald Trump Privatization Social Credit Money supply History of the United States (1918-1945) Housing cooperative Futures contract Monopoly (game) Poker jargon 401(k) Arbitrage United Kingdom corporation tax Rational pricing MMORPG Economy of the United States Conveyancing Call option Personal finance Airline U.S. public debt Salary cap Blackjack Law of value Internet fraud Final Fantasy XI Interest rate Collateralized mortgage obligation Economy of Chile Stock market Common Agricultural Policy Anarchism and capitalism Citigroup Corporation Great Depression New Deal Wal-Mart Euro
