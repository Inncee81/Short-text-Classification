how long it will take if i cancel services i'm going to move to a new house this sunday but if i want to cancel all the services phone internet tv water etc when should i cancel call them now and tell them to cut them off on monday they will not cut them over a weekend as it requires them to read out your meter so if you tell them you are moving on sunday and want things cut off on sunday chances are they will cut you off on friday as that is their last business day i always tell them to cut things off effective the day after i move out otherwise you risk them coming that morning and cutting things off and then you are left to load a truck with no a c and no running water in the bathroom neither of which are pleasant if the person moving in has already paid their deposits and set up their services to be cut on then they won't actually even cut anything off although they'll charge the new person a fee to cut it on they will just come out and read out your meters Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March United States Postal Service Sunday Virgin Mobile Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans 2003 North America blackout MTV2 Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Big Brother (Australian TV series) Electricity meter The Standard CBC Radio One Daylight saving time Holy Week WNNX (FM) Avalanche Monday Jewish services Privatization Otakon Insurance Hurricane Katrina timeline Easter September 11, 2001 attack memorials and services London Congestion Charge Microphone Glacier Naval mine Liturgical year Monday Night Football Reaction to the assassination of John F.
