how do i remove my wife from home ownership to get a reverse mortgage she is not to qualify i am she is willing to do this in order for us to get a reverse mortgage loan will we have to go through a lawyer or can this be done at little or no expense if i die first she will sell the house and then pay off the loan also we plan to make a will leaving her the house so she will be the owner and will be able to sell pay the loan and move in with her sister my question is how to legally remove her from the title in order to start the loan process without costing us you don't indicate what state you are in but it should be possible to quit claim your wife off the property do your reverse mortgage and then quit claim her back on not to mention the fact that in many states she would have dower rights even after the quit claim process this sort of situation takes place all the time and so there should be a well worn path to follow also the bank never owns a home when there is a reverse mortgage it's just a lien on the property like any other type of mortgage if the person with the reverse mortgage passes away then the heirs have the right to refinance out of the reverse mortgage or if the home goes on the market for sale the proceeds will be used to pay off the reverse mortgage and anything left over goes to the heirs Concurrent estate Allodial title Life insurance Title insurance Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Islamic banking Real estate bubble Foreclosure Mortgage-backed security Taxation in the United States Predatory lending Donald Trump Personal finance Real estate broker Government National Mortgage Association Mutual fund Leasing Student loan Primerica Financial Services Bond Capitalism Personal property Easement Derivative (finance) Bankruptcy in the United States Construction Property (ownership right) Security (finance) Collateralized mortgage obligation Lawyer Corporation Monopoly (game) Housing cooperative Debt Federal National Mortgage Association Mobile home Real property Property tax Savings and loan association Intellectual property Unconscionability Capital accumulation Short selling Order of succession Copyright Appeal Anarchism and capitalism Money Squatting Economy of Russia 401(k) Monetary policy Urban renewal Irish Property Bubble Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim United Kingdom corporation tax Trademark Liar's Poker Subsidy Real estate developer Mechanics lien Copyleft American individualist anarchism Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Land reform Babylonian law Copyright law of the United Kingdom Probate Interest E-mail spam Gold standard Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Credit card Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Fee tail Labor theory of value King Ranch Bank Stock SCO-Linux controversies Conveyancing Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Mikhail Khodorkovsky National Australia Bank Irish Life and Permanent Thomas de Littleton Deflation (economics) British monarchy Deed Economy of the United States Wells Fargo Cooperative Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Refinancing
