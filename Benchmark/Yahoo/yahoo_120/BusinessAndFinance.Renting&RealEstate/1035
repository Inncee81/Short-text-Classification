how do they determine the cost of construction loans how does that process work as far as what we take the loan our for and what are we paying per month im trying to see if we can handle the cost of that loan and our current mortgage we just did this and just finished our house i know there are many different types but with ours we paid the accumulated interest every month and only paid interest on the loan during the construction period each month we would turn in our amount to be reimburst and we would pay the interest on the total amount that was taken out so far so in the beginning it wasn't bad but towards the end was in most cases the construction loan has a higher interest rate than when you roll it over to a mortgage so those last couple months are brutal and we actually paid more those months than we actually have a monthly payment now but seems like when were looking every bank had their own version of a construction loan so be sure you check around also we moved into our house before it was done so we could save almost months of paying both payment although we were renting at the time but our rent was still just as expensive as a house payment luckily we had a basement we lived in had no real kitchen for a month or carpet but we had a working bathroom so it was okay being that it was just me and my husband we could do it but if you have kids i am sure it would be much more difficult Mortgage Student loan Interest Insurance Savings and loan association Life insurance Credit card Annuity Real estate bubble Bond Debt Government National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) Annual percentage rate Bank FairTax Federal National Mortgage Association Money Leasing Mutual fund Hyperinflation Collateralized mortgage obligation Interest rate Primerica Financial Services Gold standard Subsidy Monopoly (game) Derivative (finance) 401(k) Economic rent Payday loan Harlem Anarchism and capitalism Surplus value Housing cooperative Predatory lending Savings and Loan crisis Bretton Woods system Capital accumulation Unemployment Refinancing United Kingdom corporation tax Leasehold estate Economy of the United States Islamic economics Inflation Real estate developer Microcredit Social Security (United States) Credit score Consumer finance Flat tax Gross domestic product Mortgage-backed security Tertiary education fees in Australia Basement Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Schabir Shaik Trial Federal Reserve Yield curve Compensation of employees Certificate of deposit Social Security debate (United States) Money supply Security (finance) Donald Trump Property tax Tuition Babylonian law Title insurance Municipal bond Corporate finance Rental agreement U.S. public debt Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Cheque Capitalism Mobile home Government debt Bank fraud Debt consolidation Tax Productive and unproductive labour Treasury security Blackjack Freeters Universal life insurance Variable universal life insurance Cost accounting Mensal__o scandal Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Knots Landing Unemployment benefit
