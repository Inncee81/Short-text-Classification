new landlord will not allow me to mail rent and she expects me to coordinate a time to be home every st she stated she will stop by on the first of each month i informed her this was unacceptable and that even trying to schedule a time for her to come each first of the month is too stringent am i being unreasonable she will not accept checks can i deduct money order cost i want to just mail it but feel i will have to call her to ensure receipt because of the way she is acting and her lease speaks of late fee clause after five day grace i am trying to get her to install a drop box or something thanks for all responses i just wanted to get a feel from others in order to gauge whether my reaction to her expectations is isn't reasonable i still believe coordinating my schedule to fit hers though i understand her having bills and not wanting to watch the mail for rent is an inconvenience use university credit union and money orders aren't free i am in a year long lease but will move in months neighborhood too congested and she has habit of dropping by other day she did so in order for me to fill something out for her call me and not at the end of each month for a coordination of st month rent collection i value my privacy time away from work no her providing me a place to live doesn't obligate my being home for her to get rent just needed to vent thanks guys hope she finds makes some middle ground i'm mad hi new landlord i live in chicago although some rental laws are the same across the board i would check with your local tenant group the landlord seems unreasonable and im not sure it's enforceable to have you be home every month on the first to collect rent i would challenge this in a positive manner if you can it is true that rent is due on the st grace period to the th but it is up to the landlord if she will accept checks cash money orders so you may be at a loss on this one further i do not believe the expense of money orders can be billed to landlord the landlord by law is required to supply you with a mailing address among other things however if you choose to mail it based on your concern you should use the post office's certificate of mailing receipt last time i had to use it the landlord wont know you have done this but anything delivered by the post office is legally binding when tracked in this way i would try to get her to install the drop box which i think would be the best route to go in your situation since she is visiting the property anyway good luck Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Leasing Leasehold estate Contract United Kingdom corporation tax Insurance Poker jargon Article One of the United States Constitution Credit card Eviction Annuity Taxation in the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Public housing Mortgage Public domain Post office Social Security (United States) Monopoly (game) FairTax Identity theft FidoNet American individualist anarchism Education in the United States Rental agreement Microeconomics Internet fraud Surveillance Motion picture rating system Same-sex marriage in Canada Babylonian law Mail Life insurance Data retention National Kidney Foundation Singapore Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Student loan Money Child support Property (ownership right) Information Technology Infrastructure Library Bond Domain Name System Passenger car School choice Constitution of Ireland Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Education in the People's Republic of China Housing cooperative Parliament of the United Kingdom Renting Rent control Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Anarchism and capitalism Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Divorce American Civil Liberties Union Health insurance Civil unions in the United Kingdom Appeal Serfdom Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Copyright law of the United Kingdom Betting (poker) EastEnders Corporation Due process Islamic banking Freedom of information legislation Education in Germany The Amazing Race Public-key cryptography Gold standard Baseball CPU cache Food Stamp Program Wrigley Field Scientology beliefs and practices Airline Airport Theory of conduct America Online Security (finance) Hyperinflation Intellectual property Economics Fox hunting Warren Buffett MetroCard Medical prescription Social rule Ten Commandments Capitalism
