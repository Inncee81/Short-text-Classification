is the real estate market really that bad i live in middle tennessee and we are getting ready to put our house on the market however with all the news reports about the housing market we don't know what to believe we have some people saying it isn't slow in our area which i tend to believe with all the new construction and the houses selling what do you think hard to answer this briefly but i'll try the housing market is in a huge corrective state meaning there were various recent factors that caused the current slump over priced homes not overvalued too many homes for sale and not enough buyers side show bob mortgage brokers who put people into incorrect loans similar brokers who lied on application to make a quick buck but didn't care about their clients future i e option arm loans lenders who were willing to give loans to people with very shaky applications etc etc what you here on the news is nothing but overblown doom gloom which is exactly what almost all news is ever hear anything good coming out of iraq not from the news go talk to an actual iraq war veteran to find out the true facts also what you hear housing market in the news is geographical certain areas of the country have major problems with overpriced homes california florida texas oddly enough these areas are often the same places where the bad loans were issued the vast majority of home loans are fine no defaults the news won't tell you this because it is boring they will tell you nothing but fire and brimstone here's my advice be sure of the value of your home before you market it and know all of the costs associated with selling your home prior to listing it it is a buyers market right now but if you are certain of your homes' value you'll come out ok don't get beat up by low ball offers made by uneducated buyers due to their equally uneducated realtor list you home with a reputable realtor and use someone who has been in the business for at least years which takes you prior to the housing boom Mortgage Insurance Short selling Predatory lending Mutual fund Real estate bubble Citigroup Government National Mortgage Association Donald Trump Deflation (economics) Arbitrage Title insurance Mergers and acquisitions Bond IBM PC compatible Plame affair Privatization Supply and demand Bank Microeconomics Economic relations of Japan Real estate Day trading Security (finance) Monetary policy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mobile home Debt Stock market Interest Price discrimination FairTax Financial markets Islamic banking Federal National Mortgage Association Gold standard Berkshire Hathaway CPU design Boston Red Sox Halliburton Annuity Poker jargon Floppy disk Savings and Loan crisis Unemployment Bank fraud Inflation Internet fraud Ashton-Tate Education in the United States Economy of Russia Microsoft M16 (rifle) MMORPG Diamond Economics Donald Rumsfeld Ford Motor Company Los Angeles Clippers Gross domestic product Fahrenheit 9/11 Atari 8-bit family Babylonian law Great Depression Primerica Financial Services Tennessee State Constitution Karl Rove Enron Corporation Singlish Oil-for-Food Programme Urban sprawl Economy of Africa Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Detroit Tigers Debugging Economy of the United States Mortgage-backed security UK Singles Chart Advertising Housing cooperative Jean Schmidt Urban renewal Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina X Window System CBS
