why do real estate agents make so much to the selling agent and the buyers agent seems like a lot especially when houses are k in a lot of places what exactly do they do that i couldn't do myself seriously real estate agents actually do not make that much unless they are top producers the average real estate agent grosses about year the reason i say they do not actually make that much is you have to account for their expenses brokerage fees etc for example on a home offering commission the breakdown would be as follows total commission to list agent to selling agent agent breakdown subtract franchise fee broker split gross agent commission now subtract taxes licensing fees marketing fees expenses such as car gas etc and the agent is not left with much for their valuable services offered such as preparing proper legal documents negotiating the contract cordinating inspections title work financing not to mention advertising marketing and showing the home i hope this helps you understand that agents do offer valuable services at lower rate than you'd expect southeast mi realtor Real estate broker Mutual fund Mortgage Gross domestic product Tax Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Contract Stock Advance fee fraud Publishing Mergers and acquisitions Cable television Measures of national income and output Predatory lending Day trading Annuity Short selling Agency (law) GNU General Public License Life insurance Multiple Listing Service Financial services Citigroup Supply and demand Primerica Financial Services Government National Mortgage Association Sport utility vehicle Lloyd's of London Wal-Mart Salary cap Eliot Spitzer Leasing Property tax Investment bank Social Security debate (United States) Productive and unproductive labour Concurrent estate United Kingdom corporation tax Bank Security (finance) Value added tax Real estate Stock market Capital accumulation Wells Fargo Warren Buffett Capitalism Mobile home FairTax Credit card Reaganomics Inheritance tax Mediation Privatization Oakland Athletics Monetary policy Inflation NFL on television Free trade Real estate economics Housing cooperative Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Airline Service National Kidney Foundation Singapore Title insurance Business-to-consumer electronic commerce RKO Pictures Option Price discrimination PE ratio ITV Television in the United States Acorn Computers Estate agent (United Kingdom) Futures contract Student loan Arbitrage Emissions trading Donald Trump Conveyancing Trust (Law) USA Finance Real estate bubble Franchising Business Internet fraud Hedge fund Licence to Kill Filling station Nuclear power 2004-05 NHL lockout Economy of Pakistan Sears Holdings Corporation
