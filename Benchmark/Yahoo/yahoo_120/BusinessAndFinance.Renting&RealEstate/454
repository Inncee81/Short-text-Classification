help signed a lease and found mold before moving in what should we do first off my wife months pregnant and i found an awesome executive townhome and signed a two year lease before we agreed to sign a lease the landlord let us know that there was a leak on the second floor previously but it had been fixed yesterday we began the process of moving in i was getting ready to prep a room for painting when i noticed a line about inch thick and feet long going through the ceiling on the bottom floor it ended in a wall that had a baseball sized bubble i chipped away the paint to discover a pizza sized patch of mold and general grossness the line running across the ceiling has mold underneath the paint as well i can't get ahold of the landlord right now and am supposed to officially move in sign papers today there is no way i'm going to live here with mold and a pregnant wife i know the landlord will fix the problem but is there any way to legally get out of this we have everything packed we love the place is it worth it we haven't signed any paperwork yet but we did pay to hold the place are supposed to pay another today the landlord is very nice and accomodating and would surely refund the should we just back out right now please keep in mind that we are packed and ready to move if we don't take this place we would probably have to wait weeks to find a new place which is a pain we will have a newborn in the house in three weeks i would go ahead and move in but block off that room until the landlord can fix the mold it doesn't sound like a major problem and something that can be taken care of easily if the landlord won't fix it make sure you take pictures of the mold detailed pictures then get an estimate from or companies on what it would cost to remove the mold and fix the drywall and paint etc if he still won't pay i would go ahead and pay to have it repaired myself and then sue the landlord for the money you spent i have a feeling that the landlord will take care of the problem until it's repaired though block off the room and don't use it Leasehold estate Casting Ocean's Twelve Poker jargon GunZ The Duel EastEnders Miss Saigon National Football League Knots Landing Estoppel 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Shaggy dog story Volleyball Guinea pig Pregnancy The Inside Rental agreement Friends Slot machine Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Drill bit The Sims 2 CPU cache Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Leasing Microeconomics Economy of the United States Windows XP Bristol Grammar School Wal-Mart Fecal incontinence Topps Bus models used in New York City Transit Plastic Menstrual cup Boom Town (Doctor Who) Janet Jackson Beetle in an Anthill Ben Johnson (athlete) Glossary of partner dance terms Theory of conduct The Contender (television series) Plame affair Abortion debate Japanese tea ceremony Public domain Humphrey Bogart Major League Baseball television contracts Haibane Renmei Jon Secada Bread Jumpstart 3rd Grade Francis Bacon (painter) Blenheim Palace Downing Street memo Publicly funded medicine Seismic retrofit USS Tunny (SS-282) Rent (musical) Mortgage Capitalism Asbestos Tire Futurama (TV series - season 5) Chatsworth House Nintendo Entertainment System Garth Brooks Kurt Cobain Childbirth Health insurance My Little Pony Bruce Johnson National Kidney Foundation Singapore Manorialism Xanadu House Hamster Dualism (philosophy of mind) System Shock 2 Surveillance Basement Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Traditional animation Sento Kitchen Annuity Charles Goodyear Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Buckingham Palace Gross domestic product
