is it legal for my apartment complex in los angeles to only allow me to use one cable installing company i am moving into a new place and the only way to get cable and internet is to use this company called consolidated smart systems they only do direct tv and charge an extra dollars a month to maintain the service which sounds like a total scam to me is it legal for an apartment building to not only limit me to having to use direct tv instead of any cable provider but to have to use this sneaky company that will install it and add extra chargers for example i can't call direct tv and have them install it i have to use these middle men that only install direct tv i assume the company has some deal going with the landlord where they get cutbacks or something is there anything i can do i've already signed the lease so i am stuck actually it is against the law to prohibit any tenant from choosing their own cable or direct tv provider go to the fcc website for all the rules a landlord cannot tell the tenant who they will use even if it is in the lease its against the law his lease is invalid because of it being against the law so call the cable company you want and use it let this landlord tell you that you broke the lease then show him the fcc website print it out and tell him that he broke the law and if he tries to throw you out of your house you will contact the attorney general the fcc and the city inspectors and turn him in you would have a heck of a law suit i have just gone through this with one of my tenants only difference is my tenant is a lawyer and not a very good one she did everything wrong including attaching a dish satillite to my outside roof against fcc and my rules and did not use the existing dish provided for this very thing she lost and ended up paying to have it removed and the roof repaired print out those laws on the fcc com Cable television Leasehold estate Federal Communications Commission United Kingdom corporation tax WWOR-TV Broadband Internet access Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Barrister Leasing Rental agreement Apartment Estoppel Trademark Eviction Poker jargon Islamic banking Appeal North American Numbering Plan New York Central Railroad American Broadcasting Company Intellectual property Media in Canada Housing cooperative Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Kazaa Japanese law Elevator New Hampshire Supreme Court Obscenity Property (ownership right) Property law Serfdom Public domain Prostitution in Germany First-sale doctrine Public transport 9-1-1 Television in the United States Insurance Waste (law) Contract Article One of the United States Constitution Boston and Lowell Railroad Credit repair Universal Serial Bus Rent control Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Modem Freedom of speech Digital television ITV Make money fast Plame affair World Trade Center Concurrent estate Land tenure Amateur radio Home Box Office AT&T Solar power Sealand Wi-Fi Voice over IP Strategic lawsuit against public participation Attorney General Babylonian law Fixtures Direct marketing Real property Ethernet Teletext Copyright law of the United Kingdom Lawyer Trust (Law) USA Pirate decryption Tennessee State Constitution Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Oscilloscope Government of Maryland High-voltage direct current Confidence trick Concentration of media ownership Judiciary of Hong Kong Scots law Same-sex marriage in the United States Manorialism Public housing Television Monopoly (game) Copyright Naval Station Norfolk High-definition television United States Postal Service French nobility Easement Eminent domain
