apartment limitations to wear and tear in nj is there a statue of limitations to normal wear and tear like a time frame i stayed in my aparment for months and my landlord is holding my security deposit to repaint and clean from my time there nj state law states landlords cannot charge cleaning fees to tenants who leave their apartments broom clean landlords often try to deduct such fees as well as fees for painting the landlord did the intial walk through and gave the ok that it was clean enough for us to move out now hes changing his story saying that the he feels he doesnt have to pay for a repainting cause we didnt stay there long enough mind you we never had a lease agreement but only a verbal agreement that i could move into that apartment as long as i paid rent and give days notice that if i were leaving i satisfied both requirements and again in his walk through he never said anything about the walls or anything about the apartment not being clean i have written documents saying that i paid a deposit from a previous lease with the landlord i just moved into another unit versus the original one but i never signed a renewal to a lease agreement when my original taime was up so it could be considered month to month rental did you take pictures of the condition of the place when you moved out next when was the last time the landlord painted the place best bet is if you have pictures to show the condition of the place when you left then sue him in small claims in nj the landlord has days to send you a written accounting of the deductions of the security deposit and return anything left if out of the days then you can sue if still within the days then he is ok Leasehold estate Estoppel Housing cooperative Mortgage Eviction Public domain Babylonian law Contract Waste (law) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Apartment Rent control Concurrent estate Octopus card Accounting methods Annuity Public housing Insurance Apartment building Modding Manorialism Intellectual property Trust (Law) USA Denis Law Plame affair Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Immigration to the United States Prostitution in Germany SCO-Linux controversies Kyoto Protocol Life insurance Domestic partnerships in California Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Irish Land Act Poker jargon Barrister International Criminal Court Serfdom Rent (musical) Student loan United States Postal Service Wal-Mart Short selling Monopoly (game) Stuyvesant Town Toyota Prius Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Miss Saigon Social Security (United States) Copyright Islamic banking First-sale doctrine Blockbuster Video Betting (poker) Identity theft Automatic teller machine British Rail Class 86 EastEnders Chatsworth House Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Nuclear proliferation Copyright law of the United Kingdom Oplan Bojinka Indian nationality law Sento Allodial title New Deal Section 8 (housing) Treaty Virgin Mobile Visa (document) Auto insurance Real property Condominium Judiciary of Hong Kong Mutual fund Animal Crossing Xerox Operating surplus Land reform Oakland Athletics Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Eminent domain The Inside EFTPOS Art Modell Pumi Microeconomics H-1B visa Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Property (ownership right) Schabir Shaik Trial Publicly funded medicine Statute of frauds
