tampa real estate i was thinking about buying a townhouse in the tampa area ideally i would like to purchase a single family home in a nice safe area but i can't realistically afford that as a single person living alone so i thought i might buy a townhouse as the payments would be the same as rent if not cheaper then finish grad school get a better job then rent out the townhouse later on it has to be better than paying rent right anyone have any advice or precautions regarding this plan actually you need to think about a couple of things first you need to buy in a community that will allow you to rent later on that may cause problems because a lot of condo townhome developments only allow a certain percentage of the units to be rentals a high percentage of owner occupants keep property values up so now you're thinking well i will just rent in a community that allows everyone to rent could be a good idea but then may not be sometimes property owners neglect their property when they rent the market is pretty soft in florida so there is a chance that you'll buy in a development that has a high percentage of renters that may affect the appearance and maintenance of the community these are just a few of the things you should think about before committing to a purchase owning rental property can be veyr profitable and you will have the best experience if you weigh out everything good luck Microeconomics Housing cooperative Renting Property tax Donald Trump Anarchism and capitalism Public housing Leasing Real estate bubble Capitalism Property (ownership right) Capital accumulation Rental agreement Monopoly (game) Supply and demand First-sale doctrine Concurrent estate Intermediate consumption Economic rent Gross domestic product Progressive tax Gentrification American individualist anarchism Estoppel Productive and unproductive labour Mobile home Money Surplus value Tax Publicly funded medicine Carlsbad, California Leasehold estate Taxation in the United States Economics Health insurance Real estate economics White flight Ownership Extreme Programming Babylonian law Warren Buffett Intellectual property Economy of the United States Boston and Lowell Railroad Operating surplus Externality Annuity Stock Public good British residential property market New Urbanism Celebration, Florida Economic inequality Value added Condominium Land reform Squatting Labor theory of value Life insurance Islamic banking Law of value Electronic commerce Pacific, Missouri Harlem Dividend Marriage Unemployment Geolibertarianism Movie studio Great Depression Montrose, Houston Economy of Russia Hire purchase Auto insurance Graduate school Solarquest Major League Soccer Oakland Athletics Suburb General aviation Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Rent control Eminent domain Individualist anarchism Land use forecasting MMORPG Internet fraud Arguments for and against drug prohibition Timeshare Personal property Satchel Paige San Fernando Valley Consumption of fixed capital Bailment
