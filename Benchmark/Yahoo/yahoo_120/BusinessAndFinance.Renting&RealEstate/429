what is the best way to find a real estate agent we're first time home buyers and i don't know anyone in our area that's actually purchased a home so i have no way to get a recommendation should i just check realtor com until i run across someone that's particularly helpful is there particular well know real estate agents such as century or remax that generally has a good reputation what would you recommend for finding a decent one attend open houses in the area and just talk to as many as you can you'll come across one that you click with and that's a much better way of finding an agent than a cold call to the office or walking in and getting whoever meets you at the door first as to relying on national companies don't go on that alone they have good agents who work full time and really put an effort into it and they have part time agents who piddle with it as a hobby and really don't care if they sell something or not plus they have a high turnover rate all agencies do a real estate agent's job isn't to sell you a house a house will sell itself their job is to help you find a home so you need someone who is familiar with the area and more interested in you than just selling you the first thing you can afford that is currently on the market the perfect house for you may not even be on the market right now and a good agent will help you be patient and not push off something else on you so they can just close a sale and move onto the next person honestly i've been happier with the smaller local companies than the big national companies Real estate broker Mutual fund Insurance Mortgage Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation Gross domestic product Unemployment Steve Jobs Economics Plame affair Real estate Supply and demand Publishing Security (finance) Oakland Athletics Warren Buffett Station wagon Trademark Theory of conduct Advertising Real estate bubble Internet fraud Wal-Mart Tesco Government National Mortgage Association Social rule Call centre Tax Housing cooperative Annuity Plame affair timeline Contract Price discrimination Monetary policy Agent handling Modelling agency Stock Citigroup White flight Ashton-Tate Secretar__a de Inteligencia Wayne Corporation Title insurance Islamic banking Debt Say's law Life insurance Toyota Prius Pitaten Primerica Financial Services Capitalism Surplus value Carl Barks FairTax Care Bears Motion picture rating system Privatization Money supply National Health Service Alcoholics Anonymous NASDAQ Karl Rove The Inside Friends Property tax Syphon Filter Survivor (novel) Babylonian law Autograph Arbitrage Airline Federal National Mortgage Association Insider trading MMORPG Betting (poker) Open access Humphrey Bogart Inflation Principal-agent problem Mobile home Keynesian economics Financial markets Donald Rumsfeld MapleStory Capital accumulation Bretton Woods system Property (ownership right) English grammar Real property Monopoly Economy of Nigeria Intellectual property Avenue Q Option Sugar Land, Texas Mach kernel IBM PC compatible
