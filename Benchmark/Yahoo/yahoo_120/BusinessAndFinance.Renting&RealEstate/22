how to go about selling a driveway easement i am the dominant tenement of a driveway easement this has created many problems between myself and the land owner because they just don't seem to get the concept i would like to sell my rights to them and just construct my own parking pad on my property with the money is this a possibility and what is it worth first lets make clear that an easement is a property right that can be bought and sold utility companies buy and sell easements all the time the question then is its worth that of course depends on all those variables associated with real estate question from above why would they pay to get rid of the easement various possible reasons it very likely would increase the value of their land the ability to use the subject portion of the property for purposes other than a driveway etc i am sure that you already know if you abandon the easement you will ultimately lose it you should enforce your right to use the easement first otherwise why would they want to pay you for it if they are going to get it for free ultimately good luck i hope this helps Easement Adverse possession Microeconomics Conservation easement Intellectual property Mortgage Capitalism Monopoly (game) American individualist anarchism Property (ownership right) Property law Real property Tax Leasing Property tax Anarchism and capitalism Estoppel Mutual fund Land reform Apartment building Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Surveying Supply and demand Rail trail Wealth Money Exchange value SCO-Linux controversies Allodial title Public domain Concurrent estate Philosophy of business Life insurance Ownership Economics Law of value Insurance Sport utility vehicle Theory of conduct Free trade Dividend Title insurance Labor-power Poker jargon School of Salamanca Primitive accumulation of capital Labor theory of value Richard Pombo Productive and unproductive labour Gross domestic product Inheritance tax Commodity Public good Sears Holdings Corporation Arguments for and against drug prohibition Copyleft Anarcho-capitalism Scientology beliefs and practices Privatization Class (computer science) Opportunity cost Goodness and value theory Copyright Land trust Celebration, Florida Surplus labour Free market Political economy Patent GNU General Public License Surplus product Warren Buffett MMORPG Real estate economics Corporation Campaign finance reform Institutional fund management Contract Short selling Babylonian law Mathematics Keynesian economics Virtual economy State Carl G.
