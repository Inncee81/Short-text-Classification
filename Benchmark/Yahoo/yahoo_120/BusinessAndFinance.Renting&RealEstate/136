should my mom rent her house out in ca or sell it my mom who's and on a fixed income is currently living with me in boise waiting for her house to sell in northern california she wants to have her own place but is kind of in limbo right now because of the market some family members think she should just rent it out and wait for the market to turn around which i know may take a while instead of selling it for what she would get for it right now her home is paid for so she could afford to lower her price and still pay cash for one here there are a ton of homes flooding the market here in boise too so she could still get a great deal on a home here eventually as well if she rents it out she would have to rent something for herself here when the market does turn around and she was to sell then wouldn't she lose a big chunk of it to taxes anyways if it was rented out longer than years thanks for any advice she would not earn a profit from it the rent she gets would have to pay her rent here by the way my mom is way into her health is isn't going anywhere for a long time my parents are in the same situation in southern ca and they want to move out of state to be near me so i've been doing lots of research as far as taxes are concerned she could have a capital gains tax exclusion even if she rented but she'd have to sell it within years to qualify in the years prior to the sale of the house you need to have lived in the house for at least months in that year period it sounds like your mom is single or widowed so she'd get up to k profit untaxed it's k for married folks if she refinanced her house in ca and took some money out to put down on a house in boise she could rent out the ca home the rent would cover the refinaced amount of money and i'm assuming her mortgage payment in boise be sure to save some money for unexpected troubles plumbing a c roof etc if you go this route i'd recommend getting a property management company to take care of the ca home trying to be a landlord out of state is not going to be easy of course mgmt is going to take a portion of the rent too so do your math to see if this works out for your mom the easiest thing is to sell now but if you're willing to do a little work it could mean a huge difference in profits good luck to you and your mom Insurance Mortgage Taxation in the United States Life insurance Microeconomics Bond FairTax Tax Monopoly (game) Capital accumulation Economic rent Leasehold estate Warren Buffett Annuity Progressive tax Capitalism Productive and unproductive labour Economy of Russia Real estate bubble Property tax Money Islamic banking Housing cooperative Flat tax Babylonian law Intellectual property Great Depression Income statement Leasing Renting Profit Value added Health insurance Divorce Credit card Keynesian economics Estoppel Derivative (finance) Treasury security Variable universal life insurance Privatization Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Bank Mergers and acquisitions Investment bank PE ratio Intermediate consumption Illegal drug trade Health care in the United States Poker jargon Airline Public policy Public housing Dividend Mortgage-backed security Debt Primerica Financial Services Economy of the United States Gold standard Labor theory of value American individualist anarchism Prostitution in Germany Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Public good Article One of the United States Constitution Citigroup 401(k) Price discrimination Law of value Arbitrage Monetary policy First-sale doctrine Publicly funded medicine Value product Copyright Donald Trump Rent (musical) UK Singles Chart Social Security (United States) Security (finance) Euro Capital gains tax Trust (Law) USA My Little Pony
