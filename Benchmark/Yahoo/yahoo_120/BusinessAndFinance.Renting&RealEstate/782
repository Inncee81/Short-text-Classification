trouble with the tenants upstairs i live in an apartment with my son and my husband when he's not in iraq in june the apartment upstairs was leased to three guys about a month after they moved in i had a hole open in my bedroom i put an order in with maintenance and they came in and patched up the hole a week later i come home to a steady stream of water in my room and in the bathroom i called the emergency maintenance and they came out to check out the damage they went to the apartment above mine and the guys didn't have a shower curtain up and they had an inch of standing water on their floor yet the tenants didn't see this as a problem the maintenance guys called the landlord and he came and let me out of my lease as i was moving my stuff out the guys from upstairs came to my door and started threateing me with a lawsuit because the landlord was having them evicted i didn't know what to say so i shut the door in their face what would you do in this situation i'm not too concerned about the lawsuit threat i'm an attorney we live in a small town and i'm afraid they may try something if we ever see one another again sorry i wasn't very clear on that before i'm living back home right now while my husband is in iraq i only have about more months here and i had trouble finding an apartment that would let me only lease for months and not a full year since i currently live in a college town most of the housing is taken by students i had to move back in with my parents which i hate doing since i've been on my own for a while now if i lived down where my hubby is stationed when he's home this wouldn't be a problem i think you did the right thing you know they have no basis for a lawsuit if they should bring it up again explain that the maintenance guys called the landlord and not you try to redirect their anger chances are they will find a new place to live and if you don't go near their location they will likely calm down however as a marine wife don't forget your other resources if you see a problem let some of the other marines know what is going on they'll get your back the marine's are a tight unit who protect their own Friends Leasehold estate Kitchen Maison Ikkoku 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Avenue Q Trapped in the Closet Apartment Big Brother (USA TV series) Chatsworth House Rental agreement Blood Simple Sin City Poker jargon 2004 Republican National Convention Humphrey Bogart Public housing Shaggy dog story EastEnders M16 (rifle) Eviction The Shining (film) Piccolo Junior Saga Little Britain Vista Way One Tree Hill (TV series) Rent (musical) Miss Saigon Babe Ruth Fred Phelps Queensbridge Bristol Grammar School Waste (law) Plame affair timeline Black Books Babylonian law Richard Chase Windows XP Meat Loaf Enron Corporation Buckingham Palace Mark Guglielmo White House Columbine High School massacre Satchel Paige Donald Neilson University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Cosmo Kramer Jessica Lynch Passenger car Florida Institute of Technology Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 NorthBridge Apartment Complex Reservoir Dogs George Costanza The Commons Hamster Marilyn Monroe World Trade Center StarCraft: Uprising Stuyvesant Town The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan The Star Wars Holiday Special Eddie Guerrero Chatham Square NWo Full Metal Panic?
