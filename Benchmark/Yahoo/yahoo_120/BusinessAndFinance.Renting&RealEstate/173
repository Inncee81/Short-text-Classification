nj real estate i have my real estate license somewhat new to it my husband and i are looking to buy our first house we currently live in manasquan i have my whole life and don't want to leave we can't afford it our goal is to move to brick for a few years and hopefully make some money off of a house so that we can move back to manasquan before our son goes to school we have found a few different homes we don't care if we make a ton of money off of them as long as we don't lose any you think we will be ok or do you think brick real estate is staying where it is nj real estate ballooned way to fast from and since has tailed off considerably it should be a little less profitable for awhile the problem is as you live in brick both areas will increase in value but after time you will know if you can handle a bigger payment or not and you might actually find yourself making very good money after a few years in real estate learn your job well and you will get back in manasquan but i would tell you from my experience get the hell out of nj it is a rip off i lived there for years there are so many better places to live Real estate broker Manasquan, New Jersey White flight The Wall Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Life insurance Mortgage Health insurance Mutual fund Capital accumulation Real estate developer Knots Landing Concurrent estate Reaganomics Poker jargon Pitaten Gross domestic product Craps Insurance Tax Surveillance Real estate bubble Avenue Q Babylonian law Carl G.
