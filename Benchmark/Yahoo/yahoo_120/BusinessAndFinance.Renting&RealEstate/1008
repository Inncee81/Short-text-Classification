help my apartment flooded and i think there is mold my apartment has flooded three times since i moved in to it in march not to mention how many possible times it flooded before that i think there is mold and i think i am allergic i am having asthma like symptoms and had to see a doctor about it the same week that we moved in i have to use an inhaler every night anyway i am wondering if i should have an inspection done on the apartment and if i can break the lease or anything like that if there is mold and i am allergic to it i also have a months old and am weeks pregnant can i break my lease anyone experience anything like this or know anything about breaking leases call the county building inspector and explain the problem and they will send someone out to do a mold test however here is the catch if the inspector finds that there are elevated levels of mold spores and condemn the apartment you get to break your lease but must vacate immediately if he condemns it that means it is unsafe for human habitation and that is what he is legally bound by just so you know what happens yes you are under no obligation to stay in a place that constantly floods the legal term is constructive eviction ps you need to find another place for your month old to stay for awhile black mold takes weeks to set up in a child's lungs and can cause respiratory bleeding and death if you are experiencing symptoms imagine what your month old is going through Asthma Allergy Leasehold estate Toxic mold Pregnancy Insulin Hay fever Obstetrics Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Pneumonia Aspergillosis Tobacco smoking Childbirth Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Air pollution Abortion Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Breastfeeding Medicine Prostate cancer 2001 anthrax attacks Miscarriage Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Lung cancer Coeliac disease Menstrual cycle Terri Schiavo Miss Saigon Cocaine Traumatic brain injury Iraq and weapons of mass destruction The Inside Casting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Animal testing Psoriasis Pulmonary alveolus Nitrous oxide Cystic fibrosis Stroke Asbestos Hypoglycemia Bong Malaria Radiation poisoning Common cold Multiple chemical sensitivity Leasing Eczema Kibbutz Chlorpromazine Endometriosis Methamphetamine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Human adaptation to space Smallpox Contract Flood Haloalkane Arthur Mold Alcoholism Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Medical record Aspartame Cytomegalovirus Milton H.
