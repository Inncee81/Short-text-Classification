am i responsible to pay a lein from a renter that was evicted started as a year lease opt yrs later no buy the renter made changes to my home with the assumption that he was going to purchase after being unable to aquire a mortage after years and at this point on a month to month assumed rental agreement nothing in writing for years the renter told us he was moving out per our lawyer an eviction notice was served exactly one day before the closing on my home which i could only sell for what i owed to the bank because the renter had incurred an unbelievable amout of damage to the property a judgement was placed on my home for improvements he made while living there am i responsible to pay him anything also the closing had already taken place papers signed and checks drawn and sent prior to the knowledge of this lein days later the lending bank has put a stop payment on the checks from the closing because this lein is dated day prior to closing by the way it wasn't signed by the renter just submitted by his lawyer can this be legal what rights do i have yes this lein is from the actual renter the original agreement obligations were not fulfilled in the first year we extended them for an additional year with still no mortgage aquired after that point no more agreements were put in writing biggest mistake here is that it is a family member whom i rented to this person has personal issues which i cannot elaborate on in respect to him i can say that a large quantity of drugs were found in my home when i went there to clean up the property which i just cleaned up and sent to the dump i live out of state and had hours to clean the property and get it ready for sale a real estate broker told me that it would take to bring the property up to low fair market value because of the condition of the property this lein is for aproximately should i counter sue it sounds like the outcome will be contingent upon the language used in the original lease to buy agreement if he breached this agreement or didn't perform find a mortgage under the terms of the agreement were his rights terminated by the language in the agreement it sounds like they are hoping to inconvenience you into submission to his anger if you are only breaking even then remember lawyers don't get paid unless there is a fight dispute that two parties cannot work out amongst themselves and you started it his feelings are obviously wounded because you had previously treated him differently seemed disinterested in the legal stuff then you went and changed the game and got all technical and stuff and now he's attempting to feel better after all how dare you only be interested in the financial respects of your property and not his emotional state of mind and make a profit from his labor best wishes for an amicable resolution to your situation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mortgage Contract Intellectual property Microeconomics Insurance Leasing Annuity Rental agreement Plame affair Leasehold estate Concurrent estate Estoppel SCO-Linux controversies Islamic banking Continuation War Free trade Property (ownership right) Mutual fund Trademark Real estate broker Poker jargon Housing cooperative Credit card Supply and demand Renting Taxation in the United States Cyprus dispute Public domain Patent Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Predatory lending Donald Trump First-sale doctrine Inflation Monetary policy Lawyer Kyoto Protocol Treaty FairTax Monopoly (game) Life insurance 2004 World Series Boston and Lowell Railroad Bond Mediation Trust (Law) USA Great Depression Civil rights Construction Bank Tax Wal-Mart Deflation (economics) Schabir Shaik Trial Debt Unlawful combatant Short selling Title insurance Derivative (finance) Joseph Chamberlain Bretton Woods system Economy of the United States Arbitrage Citigroup MMORPG American individualist anarchism Economy of Russia Major League Baseball television contracts Euro CPU cache Mensal__o scandal Israeli West Bank barrier History of the Jews in France Corporate governance Domestic partnerships in California Yom Kippur War Capitalism Advertising Day trading Copyright law of the United Kingdom 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines History of Schleswig-Holstein Gold standard International Criminal Court Oasis (band)
