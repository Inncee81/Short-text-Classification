how can i negotiate lower rent my lease is up next month and i've recently seen my same floorplan same view etc advertised for less than what i pay will i be able to negotiate lower rent on a new lease i know they often try to increase it at the end of the lease it can't hurt but dont be surprised if they dont give it to you i'd say go for it though if they haven't had any problems with you since you've been there no late pmts no noise complaints etc then they would probably prefer having you stay as opposed to hoping the next renter is as good as you so give it a try i always say hope for the best but expect the worse doesnt hurt to ask though Atomic Kitten Leasehold estate Boston and Lowell Railroad Public housing Renting Gentrification Health insurance Capitalism Rental agreement Harlem Tariff Cyprus dispute Leasing Blockbuster Video Outsourcing Inflation Estoppel Theory of conduct Free trade Keynesian economics Intermediate consumption Broadband Internet access Prostitution in Germany Economy of Africa Canadian and American health care systems compared Winter War Microeconomics Paul Martin Boeing Palestinian National Authority Software engineering Satchel Paige New York City Economic inequality Economics Japan-United States relations Property (ownership right) Guantanamo Bay Progressive tax Neville Chamberlain Torquay United F.C.
