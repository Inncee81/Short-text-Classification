how is middle school like um i'm going into th grade and i have some basic questions are the th graders mean how will i know who to sit with at lunch how will i find my classrooms do people really pull off your bookbag and its just that i'm really developed for a th grader i have brests im ' and im just afraid that might make me look like a slut and then the th graders will make fun of me or call me a whore because to them im apparently trying too hard i'm just kind of scared about my social life because theres a chance i might not have anyone i know in my classes sadly some th graders will be annoying the first few weeks of school but it's not like how you see on tv with th grades shoving th graders into trash cans or anything it's more like aw how cute th graders eww th grader i remember when i was in th grade i hated it it's just something we do cuz it was how we were treated in th but it's nothing to worry about just annoying like a rock in your shoe annoying sit with people you feel comfortable with if you don't like crowds stick to a smaller group things like that make a friend in the beginning of school and you can sit with them just pick a place ask politely if you can sit down and talk to them thats how you can make friends too i know a lot of people are like oh those tables are for losers but you should be able to sit whereever you please most schools have a map available on their website or in the office just grab one and keep it with you on the first day better yet get one before school and visualize how to get to each class in your head using the map after a week it's really easy to keep track of where to go next no there's always stupid rumors of stuff like that at our school it was the rumor about guys pulling bra straps and girls stealing stuff from your gym locker never happens there is the occasional jerk how does stuff like that but it's not anything to worry about please believe me when i say this 'developed' th graders are often liked alot or at least in my school and pretty much everyone worrys about th grade social life and by the end pretty much everyone says wow that wasn't hard at all Recurring South Park characters Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Kodocha Shaggy dog story Avenue Q The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Marshall Mathers LP Beavis and Butt-head Social rule Milton H.
