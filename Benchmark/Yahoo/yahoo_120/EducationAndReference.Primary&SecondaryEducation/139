schooling in america hi i am just being nosey i notice that a lot of people say my child just started school etc i am just soooo curious how your schooling works in the us in australia when your child turns they start prep and then go to year when they are turning school always starts in feb for each child and they go into the certain grades depending on there age i am just curious how your schooling works cause all throughout the year someone always says my child just started school thanks oh my god its so wierd and confusing we start school in feb and goes throguh to nov we get lots of school holidays during that time school starts at we have primary school which goes to grade aged and then high school aged to and then go to uni or whatever you choose to do with your life if we have low grades you may have to stay back a year if they are really bad or you just go on through to the next year in feb yours system sounds so complicated there are systems in place it just depends on the district neighborhood where you live or the school you choose to send your kid to usually you send your kid to the district school decided by your address but sometimes the child needs extra care special needs or an exceptionally smart child or you just don't want to send your kid to a certain school the majority of schools start beginning of september after the harvest in by gone days america used to be farmland families had lots of kids they needed to help on the farms the most work on farms is in late spring summer and early fall so the kids were needed at home in late fall through the winter and early spring children would go to school so september fall through the end of may to mid june early summer is traditionally the school year june july and august is summer break the other system is called year round school modern times see less farmland and more children packing into city schools so someone invented tracts where a group of children all different ages different class rooms of course will start one week another group will start weeks later and so on each school handles it differently but that's the general idea each track goes to school for weeks then gets off so on off through the whole year that's how you get kids starting school all the time some parents pray all their kids are on the same track less scheduling and easier to manage some parents like having only one kid home at a time it's also beneficial to children not to have months to forget the previous year's learning we call them grades kid starts first grade around years old kindergarten that is spelled correctly it's german is for year olds and can be mandatory depending on where you live kids progress yearly through eighth grade usually going to different schools at th middle school and th grades high school they come back from summer break in the next highest grade unless they have poor proformance scores that year school scores are also called grades poor grades gets you kept back a year or sent to the dreaded summer school to make up the work year around programs promote kids during one of the off sessions again it's different for every school but usually its in summer or fall still with me lol Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Kindergarten Education in Romania High school Academic term Education in Australia Daylight saving time Grade (education) Education in Taiwan Primary education Culture of the United States Graduate school Education in Sweden Ra (board game) Japanese calendar GED Education in Hong Kong Boy Scouts of America Houston Independent School District Pump It Up Norway national football team CPU cache Independent school (UK) Hebrew calendar Caulfield Grammar School USS Yorktown (CV-10) School choice Playoff Murdock-Portal Elementary School Alex Ferguson Secondary education in France Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 No Child Left Behind Act College EastEnders Education in Portugal Miami-Dade County Public Schools Education in Canada French Republican Calendar West Caldwell, New Jersey Baseball Empire Burlesque Breastfeeding Leeds United F.C.
