first day of middle school im so nervous about lockers periods unified arts gym art i am scared to death what do i wear on the first day what happens if i cant even open my locker what if i dont have any classes with my friends help me anyone else feeling felt this way what was your first day of middle school like and did things go horrible or good did things get better help don't worry about the lockers at my middle school we bought them during social studies i have no idea why and then they let us go into the hall and practice opening them until we got the hang of it they're your best friend once you get the hang of them make sure you get one that's around all your classes though trust me a trained monkey could open a locker yeah it may take a couple tries to get it at first but by the third day you'll be slapping your head and going i was nervous about this think back to elementary school you did have periods only you didn't call them that you would start the day off with math and at do english then a you'd switch to science or something like that periods are just like that only you switch classes true your teachers are going to be a little more demanding but th grade is still pretty easy it's not until th grade or so that they get really demanding and by then you'll be ready most teachers will start off with a review of what you should already know so the first couple of weeks should be easy they expect you to get lost i don't know how big your school is but unless it's huge it's not as big as you think it is by the second week you should be able to navigate with ease gym is pretty much the same as it was is elementary except you have to change out and don't worry by the second week or so you'll be so confortable doing it that you'll be walking around in your undies to go get water and such i'm not kidding in the slightest pretty soon you won't be uncomfortable i don't know about art but if your school is requiring you to take it then even if you suck really bad like me you'll be okay as long as you do your work if you voluntarily signed up then they'll probably be harder on you sorry to tell you but you might end up in a class without any of your friends that's okay middle school is all about growing up and meeting new people is a part of that they're all just as nervous as you are so just be yourself and you'll have loads of friends as for what to wear on the first day wear normal school clothes unless your school specifically tells you to wear something different why they would i have no idea my first day well lemme see it was fun it's not much different from elementary first days except for the whole switching classes thing you meet new people you get better lunchroom food yay and you get to do new things other things unless you've gotten a school list beforehand the only thing you need to bring on the first day is a pen or pencil some paper and a folder you write down all the things you'll need for each class so you don't end up buying things you won't need if you can sit with new people at lunch even if you sit with old friends invite some new people over especially kids who moved from out of town no one wants to eat alone and it's a great way to meet people do your homework it's not like elementary school you teacher's not going to keep asking about missing assignments and make up tests you have to take it upon yourself to ask them about it don't be offended when your teachers don't know your name after a couple days some of them just suck at memorizing names it's nothing personal besides it's a great rapport builder when you have to coach the teacher to get your name every day whatever stereotypes you see in the movies forget them now don't waste your money on the dances if you have different bars in the lunchroom the pizza and chicken nugget bars are the best ones to visit this may be the first time your teachers allow you to eat during class take advantage of this don't worry have fun th grade is awesome join a club don't worry what people think don't annoy the upper grades it'll come back to bite you during high school do the extra credit do your homework all the best for a save and happy school year Shaggy dog story Social rule Hunter College High School Kodocha Murdock-Portal Elementary School FoxTrot Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Bart chalkboard gags Education in Germany Education in Romania Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Milton H.
