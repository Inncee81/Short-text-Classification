selling sats papers issues i have alot of spare sats papers and i want to sell them to get rid of them i tried this on ebay a few weeks ago and some women said i was braking rules and threatened to report me to the qca qualifications and curriculam authority is there anything wrong with this thanks thery are just past papers they are sold on other websites and they have not had any bother if you are spelling spare copies of blank sats papers then i'm sure that you are fine doing so as i remember being able to buy them through whsmiths a few years ago haven't looked in recent years if they are still available to buy but i would guess so i'm assuming you are a teacher so you know that once a sat paper is released the questions won't get repeated so i can't see how you are breaking rules i guess the only thing could possibly be making a profit from someone elses work but to go as far this person did to complain to you seems pretty petty however if you are selling pupils filled in sats scripts that is a different matter lol anyway how much are you selling them for i'm interested myself p SAT Education in England Theory of conduct Oakland Athletics MAME Have I Got News For You W H Smith 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines ROM image 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sin City Live 8 The Star Wars Holiday Special I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Publishing Internet fraud Philatelic investment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Shaggy dog story Neopets Password RuneScape cheats CPU cache Fair use Make money fast Canadian Senate Houston Chronicle Philosophical skepticism GED The Age Wheel of Fortune The Apprentice 2 Negima Poker jargon Ken Jennings Weekly World News Book collecting Amiga Power Rupert Murdoch Voynich manuscript Socrates FoxTrot W.
