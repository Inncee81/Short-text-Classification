daughter starting middle school what are some key pointers i can give her she's very smart and a very sweet kid i'm just not sure she's ready for the evils of middle school tell her to be nice to people and try not to be too shy when meeting people i remember when i was in middle school i had a tough first year because i was very shy and not confident but the thing is pretty much all the other kids feel the same way i know she is young but maybe take her out to a mall or something a few days before school starts and let her get her nails done or let someone give her a makeover but not too much of a makeover maybe get her a new outfit that she loves it will make her feel like a million bucks and ready to start school i know if my mom had done this for me it would have made me feel better about school good luck Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Care Bears 2000 Australian Grand Prix Okashina Okashi Social rule Saved by the Bell Nine Inch Nails The Adventures of Pete & Pete The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie New York Giants Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide The Contender (television series) Kim Possible Alignment (role-playing games) Radiohead Current teachings of Prem Rawat Codename: Kids Next Door The Ashlee Simpson Show Van Houten family Maison Ikkoku AFI 100 Years series Winx Club Clown Teacher's Pet (Disney) Malcolm in the Middle The Fairly OddParents Undergrads Tupac Shakur Recess (TV series) The Jam Sharon Tate Ranma __ characters The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Kimi Finster My Life as a Teenage Robot Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) Frankie Laine I Want to Hold Your Hand The Critic The New Batman Adventures Fruits Basket Marty McFly The McGuire Sisters Theory of conduct Doug About a Boy Boston Red Sox Singlish Cliff Richard Pitaten Boston Public Charmed Once and Again My-HiME Biff Tannen E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
