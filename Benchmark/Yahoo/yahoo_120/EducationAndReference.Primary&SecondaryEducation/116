what can i put in my first locker at school plz scholl is on the way they have mirrors shelves magnets and pencil holders in staples they're available in all kinds of colors last year i put a mirror on the inside of my locker not the door the back two little animals they were magnets and a pencil holder also in the back on the door i had pictures of all my friends people from bands my baby cousin and my puppy all hung up with magnets if the locker isnt wide enough for x pictures try cutting them down and making a collage and taping them up but it's a pain in the butt taking it down at the end of the year the person next to me had a shelf in her locker which was also cute dry erase boards were also pretty popular you could write assignments on them or in my case i would go write on my friend's if you know the exact size of your locker cut a piece of cardboard out and glue tape all pictures to it and make a collage it won't be as hard to take down at the end of the year or you can decorate all to your mascot the one cheerleader had go hawks printed out really big and all her friends' cheerleading pictures keep it organized also lots and lots of folders keep papers in there instead of throwing them in your locker i did that and it was such a pain cleaning it out at the end of the year at the end of the year you want to be having a good time and taking pictures with your friends not cleaning out all junk out of your locker locker shelves are also a great idea to stay organized and they're stackable also when you have to take a project home actually take it home i left coffee cans and all kinds of projects in my locker it was such a pain cleaning it all out Sento Surrealist techniques Teen Girl Squad Pencil Collage Upholstery Floppy disk Toilet paper Sampling (music) Marching band Phonograph cylinder Changeroom Cardboard Shen Gong Wu One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Punch card Paper Sgt.
