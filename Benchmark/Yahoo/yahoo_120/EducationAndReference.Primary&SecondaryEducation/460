is it normal to be scared im just entering high school and im so scared that some nights i cant sleep isit that scary when u enter ninth grade what can i do to get rid of that fear the key to getting over being scared of high school is to get involved whether that is a club or a sport believe or not you are not the only freshman having these fears once the first day of school comes and goes you will feel much better it is a change going from middle school where you might change classes twice in a day have maybe different teachers and a light homework load i am sure you will be fine not sure what it is exactly that you are afraid of but maybe it will help you to make a list of what scares you about going to high school then next to each fear try to think of something to counteract it for example if the high school has over a thousand students and you are worried you will not find your classes try to go the week before school to familiarize yourself with the school's layout good luck Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Yearbook Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Education in the United States FoxTrot Grade (education) One Tree Hill (TV series) Hunter College High School Graduate school Lynbrook High School Singlish Cardcaptor Sakura Shaggy dog story Phillips Exeter Academy Brown University Stuyvesant High School High school Full Metal Panic?
