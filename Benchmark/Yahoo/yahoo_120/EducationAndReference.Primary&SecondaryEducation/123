i dont know what i want to do for a living im a senior this year in high school and i have no idea what i want to do after school family members keep annoying me about it but i have no idea i dont even know if i want to go to college or not is it a good idea to take a year break after high school to think about what i want to do for a living every body tells me if you take a year break its very hard to go back is this true while it is true statistically that roughly of people who take a break after high school do not return to college you need to do some serious thinking and see if you might be in this category i wasn't statistics don't lie as i always say but they can be manipulated such as by relatives w their own agenda or if crucial elements are left out like drive ambition interests and experience i myself took a three year break after my undergrad work to return to grad school in a totally different field i realize it's not quite the same but if you're determined then no study on earth will stop you i am also the parent of a kid who does not want to go to college both his parents did am faced with the numbing fear that he'll fall by the wayside as many kids without college educations can but society is different now job opportunities are different take stock of your skills and ask yourself can i improve on my skills by taking time off or not and let's not forget many who do go to or more yrs of college end up doing nothing with it my kid is in a rock band extremely talented trust me i'd tell him if he wasn't but i know the odds of his succeeding yet look at someone like johnny depp who not only followed his dream of becoming a rock star but fell into acting my kid is also very good looking charismatic and has been acting since he was how can i just deny all that what you become is up to you not anybody else except lady luck sometimes talent skill looks and so on are not enough but sometimes they are as the famous novelist james michener wrote go waste young man he counseled young unsure college grads to go experience the world i can't think of a better preparation for life youth the undiscovered country you really can come back to it if things don't work out i did and so have millions of others listen to your heart best of luck to you whatever you choose to do One Tree Hill (TV series) Johnny Depp Mathematics Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices Anti-intellectualism Social rule Milton H.
