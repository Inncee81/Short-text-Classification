what happened please answer from kindergarden to th grade i had been a social butterfly but then in th grade we moved to another school for half the school year i had made one friend there and then i came bach to were i lived before but to a different elementary school for the next half of th grade made friends to all of a sudden in middle school i am not social at all anymore and now in highschool i have trouble making friends cuz im so shy what happened to me i've always wondered this please answer same thing happened to me it could be just your natural temperament especially now that your hormones are fluctuating as you begin to go from a girl to a woman it can be a good thing because it makes you go deeper you find yourself now you slow down and don't make as many mistakes i knew another girl who kept her boldness in high school and beyond she ended up having no reservations and sleeping with guys getting diseases and has severe depression mood problems now in her s i am glad i got more introverted and shy in high school because it kept me more pure and not doing stupid things if i could look back though and guide you so you don't stay introverted like me you are going to have to honor that turning within in yourself try to look into yoga and meditation to take ti even further make it productive and don't let yourself get to withdrawn you are going to have to push your comfort level and make sure you socialize enough figure out what your passions are i e art music sports other fun things clubs volunteer etc and participate in them when you find more like minded people you will naturally start to come out and this will start to come out in the other areas of your life look at it as a gift most people have so many distractions with popularity they never find out who they are until they have a mid life crisis in s etc your body and mind are naturally slowing you down use it as a time to go within and find out what your passions are then talk action and the rest will happen naturally and don't worry too much you're young it's natural for some of us moving a lot as a young kid can be stressful it was important part of your life that is now influencing you still Social rule Pitaten Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
