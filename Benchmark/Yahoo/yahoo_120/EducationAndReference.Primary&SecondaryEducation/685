what do you personally think of school uniforms just curious i am sooooo glad i'm going into high school because i went with uniforms st th i only had freedom in kindergarden i hate it because i think everyone deserves a chance to express themselves in school of course some rules need to be there but not to where you are taking away who a person is the school wonders why we wont follow dress code so we can be more professional and they don't realize that kids might not be so mean if they just let them be themselves and be comfortable and not feel like they are everyone else and be an individual person without wearing the same thing like they are in the army how can you listen to them in school when they give you the advice be youself clothes can be a statement of who you are and they should not take away who you are or the way you want to present yourself that's just my opinion though School uniform Fashion French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Clothing Journalism ethics and standards High school subcultures Culture of the United States Etiquette Slander and libel Beavis and Butt-head Canadian Armed Forces English grammar Uniform Appeal Aladdin (1992 film) Women in Islam Religious Society of Friends Vestments controversy Rush Limbaugh Cross-dressing Jennifer Lopez Simone Weil Alignment (role-playing games) Kilt Characters in the Smurfs Sola fide Freedom of the press Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Dalek Invasion of Earth LaVeyan Satanism Social aspects of clothing Social rule Funeral Garrison Keillor Brave New World Battle of the Bulge Laura Schlessinger Peer review Ethics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gender role Theory of conduct Taxi Driver Hijab Karen Horney Sharia Marching band Rudolf Steiner Lawyer Datalore (TNG episode) Hate speech Asperger syndrome Kindergarten Corset W.I.T.C.H.
