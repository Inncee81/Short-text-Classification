how many binders for high school i'm starting my first year of high school as a sophomore in weeks i want to know what all you high school students do for binders do you have one binder for each class that seems the easiest except i don't want to carry binders around all day we don't use lockers do you just use one big binder for everything or or so that you have one for your morning classes and one for afternoon classes thanks for helping i'm gonna be a sophomore too yay me it's a personal choice really but some of your teachers may tell you that you have to have a binder specifically for their class if i were you and assuming none of your teachers cares that you combine binders i would get two inch binders and use dividers if you are taking a class that doesn't really use much paper say driver's ed then you might be able to get away with just a folder for that class if you're going to get one or two big binders pay a little extra and get the heavy duty ones the cheap ones break a lot easier and it'll be a pain to take everything out and put it in a new binder Student GED Graduate school The Citadel (Military College) Education in Romania Education in Germany HMS Electra (H27) Teachers (film) Cigar Great Teacher Onizuka Columbine High School massacre Lynbrook High School Education in the United States Marching band Secondary education in France Education in Portugal Social rule Redundant array of independent disks Diving Chromatography SAT Surveillance Oasis (band) Theory of conduct Education in the People's Republic of China Driver's license Saved by the Bell The Catcher in the Rye Williston Northampton School Drifting (motorsport) Sydney Riot of 1879 Paper size Secondary education in the United States Education in France Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Paint Teacher Drag racing Boston Public Jennifer Lopez Education in Australia Floppy disk Computer USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Windows Vista Wah Yan College, Hong Kong Alexander Technique Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Tai Chi Chuan Advanced Squad Leader Universal Century Technology Hal Trosky Surreal number Ceramics Tina Turner Kodocha 2000 Australian Grand Prix USS Augusta (CA-31) Grade (education) Professor 2004 Democratic National Convention Homecoming (tradition) Hogwarts subjects Strap-on dildo COX-2 inhibitor Doomsday argument Education in Hong Kong Education in Malaysia Hunter College High School Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Golf club (equipment) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Columbia University YuYu Hakusho Clements High School Japanese tea ceremony Ambulance Midnight Run Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Sento Television in the United States Pastel Fecal incontinence The Star Wars Holiday Special Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Clarinet Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Russ Texas A&M University Bully Microsoft Office Mountaineering Anchor William Fremd High School Yao Ming National Football League Scientology beliefs and practices
