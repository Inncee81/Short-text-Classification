starting high school this year i dont really know what to expect i have a brother whos going to be a senior this year and im not exactly sure if thats a good thing or a bad thing yet lol i guess its going to be weird for me because i know a lot of the upper classmen and that makes me feel like i have to impress them i want people to like me but i dont want to come off as annoying and phoney either my brother says all you have to do is say hi to the people you know but is that it its just going to be different and i want to start out fresh with no enemies or anything like that ahhh yes i remember those days it was different so many tall people lol well your biggest problem at first will be finding your way around haha that's how upperclassmen know who are freshmen the freshmen always wander around in packs yelling amongst each other where is this place you know things along thos lines in this case you stay with an upperclassmen that knows their way around or go to an upperclassmen that you know and just ask them in a discreet fashion this is the easiest way unless you prefer asking teachers instead your second problem will be the amount of homework it will increase know that but it isn't as bad as freshmen usually make it first seem what you do is you go into your first week of high school and expect loads of homework expect upwards of two or three hours of homework though you likely will never have this much getting into this mindset will make everything much better and easier it's all psychological expect more get less that's just natural if you think about it another issue the teachers are much less lenient in most cases they are less strict and tend to be more relaxed and such they don't have to be on your backs all the time since you are more mature than ever however they also won't be reminding you all the time to do this and that you must be able to remember yourself be more responsible there isn't much to it oh and yes i said that the teachers are less strict that is providing that you behave better than you did as a youngling simple solution when it comes to teachers be responsible and don't start trouble upperclassmen naturally look down on freshmen the freshmen however bring this on themselves i'm saying this generally this isn't the same for everybody the typical freshman will be overcome with pride and this is natural they are now in high school and no longer a little kid the effect is always the same upperclassmen become annoyed because the little freshmen are getting way ahead of themselves this generally separates the school into two parts the annoying proud freshmen and the mature annoyed upperclassmen yet another simple solution for an always present problem don't be the typical freshman you don't have to separate yourself from them just don't be like them be humble and i'm being figurative here treat the upperclassmen like gods they will be amazed and you will be one of the few freshmen that take their place among the upperclassmen and there's nothing cooler than being a freshmen that hangs with upperclassmen this my friend is how to handle high school heehee Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Social rule The Citadel (Military College) Education in the United States Pitaten Procrastination RISC Debugging CPU cache The Adventures of Pete & Pete Scientology beliefs and practices Poker jargon EastEnders Asperger syndrome Student Japanese tea ceremony Fast bowling Graduate school Bond Infantilism Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Case Western Reserve University Calvin and Hobbes Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kender 2000 Australian Grand Prix Quizbowl Undergrads A Course In Miracles Hamster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cannabis cultivation New Trier High School Virginia Military Institute The nature of God in Western theology Saved by the Bell Motorcycle Paragliding Requirements analysis Car handling Mach kernel The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Milton H.
