at which grade is show and tell obsolete i am a school teacher and i am having trouble justifying wasting a half hour to an hour each week on show and tell i would like to hear comments on the pros and cons of show and tell i teach first grade at an elite private school i do understand that they need time to publicly speak and listen and learn to respect others however they do have other venues for this in class i find that too often the kids bring a toy and just want to show it and not talk i didn't have show and tell in first grade we had journals instead where we could write about how we were feeling and what we were doing at home i think journals are developmentally appropriate because it helps st graders with emerging writing skills you could allow them to share their journals in small groups or pick a few kids every week to talk about them so they all get a turn Education in the United States Rush Limbaugh Experiential education Graduate school Hunter College High School Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Edward R.
