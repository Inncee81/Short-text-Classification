why do we still follow the old fashioned school calendar that gives summers off it isn't like most people have to have their children help run the farm in the summertime year round schooling with small breaks between terms would be much better suited to our way of living today the old fashion school calendar and the year round calendar both have advantages and disadvantages i can agree with you i have went schooling based on the year round calendar and it did suit me i didnt have many burn outs i had plenty of rest and i didnt forget as much but keep in mind that it interferes with traditional family time this includes vacations relative visits and sporting events summer is the season when families can spend time together getting a chance to close their wide relationship gap year round schooling starts in the mid summer season creating frustrations for parents to plan for family activities Gregorian calendar Calendar Eid ul-Fitr Hebrew calendar Baseball Equine conformation Poker jargon Full Metal Panic?
