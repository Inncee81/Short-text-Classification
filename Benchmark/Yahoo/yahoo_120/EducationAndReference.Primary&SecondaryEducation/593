do you think that year round school is better than a traditional schedule my kids are getting ready to go back to school next week after having weeks off we were on a year round schedule until two years ago when we switched to traditional personally i liked year round because the kids seemed to stay in learning mode better when the max time they were off was six weeks after speaking to a few teachers they have implied that they spend the first weeks of school just reviewing everything from the last year and some of the children come back to school after weeks never having picked up a book do you think that year round school or traditional schedule is better for educating i agree year round is much better i'd like to see us go to a trimester system that would have month off in the summer and a week break between each trimester for the students and one for the teacher the teachers would remain for the first week off to accomplish all the stuff they don't have time to do during the regular day training grades in service etc this would give one extra week the middle trimester would be longer but time off for christmas and thanksgiving both of which would fall in that time frame would take care of that i also feel that teachers should be on a month contract and paid accordingly with two weeks of that summer break used for advanced skill training in their fields i don't feel a total of one month vacation is unreasonable many of our civil service employees receive that anyway military postal etc Pregnancy Education in the People's Republic of China Grade (education) Education in Germany National Football League Academic term Education in Romania Education in the United States Education in Japan Tai Chi Chuan Education in Portugal Graduate school Education Teacher Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete International League GED Abortion debate Juris Doctor Education in Hong Kong The Contender (television series) Miami-Dade County Public Schools Kindergarten No Child Left Behind Act Suzuki method ITV Daylight saving time Wheel of Fortune Education in Australia Education in Taiwan Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Boston and Lowell Railroad Air Education and Training Command Playoff Conscription Walt Disney World College Program Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Monday Night Football Hogwarts Homeschooling Breastfeeding Education in Austria Lawyer Hikikomori The Catcher in the Rye Publicly funded medicine Billboard Hot 100 Minor league baseball Apprenticeship Thanksgiving Miscarriage Port Authority Trans-Hudson Education in Albania High school Literacy USS Yorktown (CV-10) Cleveland Browns Alex Ferguson Laura Schlessinger Alexander Technique Pro-choice USS Texas (BB-35) Johnson & Wales University Negima Primary education Classical education United States Postal Service Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ben Johnson (athlete) __cole Polytechnique Heinkel He 112 Boarding school Master's degree Daikatana Leasehold estate Working time Kalamazoo College United States Army Christmas Miami Dolphins Lynbrook High School Charter school Neighbours Tripartite System North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Waldorf Education Gregorian calendar Past teachings of Prem Rawat Pittsburgh Steelers USS Alamo Fasting Culture of the United States College Slow Train Coming Secondary education in France
