why is it that naughty students who mark around are more smarter than the students who always listens well from what i have seen there is a certain breed of children who fall into the category you refer to these are basically gifted or exceptionally smart pupils i have studied their behaviour generally and many of them do not work hard as you said they have fun and do well easily and perhaps this is why they don't see the need to sit down and study but you have to realize that sometimes it's not just complacency these students have a different internal mentality they are more interested in how things work in finding out stuff they are actually interested in etc they can go on for ours playing with little figurines despite being teenagers or spend ages assembling little robots they have the patience and drive to do it but when it comes to studying sometimes they just feel bored by it all that's why certain schools have gifted classes to challenege these kids nonetheless many of these kids don't want to study endlessly they get stuff easily this is of course a small proportion of those who don't study the rest just flunk if you notice this group i speak of is like the top percent of the world intellectually many people will feel threatened by them but get to know them and you'll see they are normal people with slightly different characters they are more outgoing social and confident a far cry from those who do well because they sit and study all day it's frustrating many of us know what you mean just have to bare with them but also realize that that's just the way they are Asperger syndrome Education in the United States Gifted Beavis and Butt-head Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Autism Education in the People's Republic of China Intelligence quotient Social rule Stuttering Education in Singapore Education Dyslexia Brian Griffin Undergrads Volleyball Time Out of Mind One Tree Hill (TV series) Saved by the Bell Tai Chi Chuan Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Microeconomics Kim Possible The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Graduate school Teen Girl Squad FLCL The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child sexuality Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder About a Boy Martial art Esperanto as an international language Adolescence The O.C.
