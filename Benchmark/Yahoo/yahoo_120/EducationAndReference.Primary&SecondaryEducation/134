what is the point of pe in school i absolutly hated pe when i was in school and still dont know what the point of this class was it has put me off sport for the rest of my life and as for the pe teacher could they get more arrogant isn't it time this subject was made optional as it could free up useful study time for more important subects such as english and maths regular exercise is considered important while you are still growing and your body is developing and it's thought to be good to get kids into the habit of playing sports or working out regularly also there's the theory that it takes some of the rambunctiousness out of kids so they're more quiet and docile in their other classes some people also believe it makes kids less interested in sex pe teachers know all these theories but they often get an inflated picture of their own importance they teach kids to be competitive which is not good and if kids don't do well they hold them up to ridicule which is actually counterproductive Tai Chi Chuan Homeschooling Education in the United States Education in Romania Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Hogwarts subjects Exploitation Social rule Graduate school Economics Volleyball Harrow School The Adventures of Pete & Pete Beavis and Butt-head Theory of conduct Education in Japan Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Education in Germany Ruy Lopez Danish Folkeskole Education High school subcultures Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Property (ownership right) Waldorf Education The Catcher in the Rye Teachers (film) Socrates Intelligent design movement Great Teacher Onizuka Mathematics The Bash Street Kids Aesthetic Realism Education Boston Public Summa Theologiae David Hume Martial art Confucius Aikido Inflation Game theory David Beckham Lynbrook High School Music lesson Labour economics Supply and demand The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Space Cases Teacher's Pet (Disney) Hunter College High School Criticism of libertarianism Scientific method Jaime Escalante Austrian School Grade (education) SAT Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Reiki Adolescence Code: Lyoko Professor Separation of church and state Sport Punk ideology Secondary education in Japan Marching band Ceroc Philosophy of language Vegeta Rich Mullins Current teachings of Prem Rawat Columbia University Henri Bergson Ultimate (sport) No Child Left Behind Act Education in South Korea Singlish The Body (Short Story) College admissions Cardcaptor Sakura Education in the People's Republic of China Liam Gallagher Goodness and value theory Ultimate Muscle Rugby union The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Survivor (novel) Development of Darwin's theory Transactional analysis Stuyvesant High School Constitution of Ireland Ben Johnson (athlete) Caulfield Grammar School __mile Durkheim Yoga Extraterrestrial life Topps Parkour
