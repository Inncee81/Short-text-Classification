why city public schools suck i went to schools in south philly pa and i don't think the reason that the kids do bad on tests are because all the money are going to white schools i think the kids just don't care all the years i went i just got this vibe that school was daycare to everyone i mean why give inner city schools money if the kids won't use the text books the right way by reading them and not defiling them and i speak from experience i hate when race is brought up it's like you can get people to stop thinking you can't run a school district if you blame it on whitey not giving money to blacks bunch of crap they give money to suburb schools because they actually use it and don't go on field trips every month so they don't have to teach i remember that crappy busy work they used to give becaue a majority of the students come from low income or divorced i dont care upbringing they meet other street wise kids and are swayed to their level school dont mean crap unless you want to play in a higher level of sports im sure there are a hand full who want to become something in life to get out of town also i think some of the teachers dont care for the not so bright students and worry about the elite few and im sure that some teachers are intimidated by the jerky students that is why some cities try busing i dont think it works beam me up scottie Education in the United States Graduate school Craps Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Satchel Paige Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix No Child Left Behind Act Homeschooling Tai Chi Chuan Education in the People's Republic of China Phoebe Buffay's songs One Tree Hill (TV series) Characters of Lost Avenue Q American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Education in Japan Vegeta Social rule Philadelphia Phillies Blackjack Kindergarten Sandy Koufax Jean-Paul Sartre Reggie Jackson Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Beavis and Butt-head The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kyle Broflovski Ken Keyes, Jr. John Lindsay Novel Hogwarts subjects Culture of the United States University of Houston 1919 World Series Education in Romania Columbia University Major League Baseball television contracts Education in Portugal Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Public education Education Affirmative action Literacy Poker jargon Education in Germany Infantilism Eric Cartman Doug Socrates The Catcher in the Rye Suburbs of Johannesburg Ben Johnson (athlete) Babe Ruth School choice Unemployment Belconnen (district) American and British English differences Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Bart chalkboard gags Marilyn Monroe NAACP Profanity Professor Humphrey Bogart Ty Cobb Murdock-Portal Elementary School Teachers (film) The Magic School Bus Theory of conduct Martial art Grand Forks, North Dakota College Dead Like Me Shit Dancing at Lughnasa The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe World Series Sydney Riot of 1879 Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education in France Chinese University of Hong Kong Israeli Arab Brown v.
