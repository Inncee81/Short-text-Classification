first day of school panic attack ok so school starts on the th my first day as a freshman in high school i had a bad panic attack on the first day of summer school this year and stayed home that day because it was so bad i'm afraid it's going to happen again but i really cannot miss my first day my mom can't get me to a doctor until september because of some mix up with health insurance does anyone have any advice well i have had panic attacks for years but i've gotten them bad since i moved to this new school in january i sometimes had them at school in the morning before school on the bus or fist hour and sometimes the whole time it's really scary and i'm afraid it will happen again i know i'll probably be fine at school but in the morning while getting ready i have so much time to think and do so much of it but i can never convince myself everything will be fine i suffer from the same thing i have panic attacks in certain situations but just make sure not to thnk about it the more you think about having a panic attack the more frequent they will happen just go to the school and just go to your classes like you did in th grade i know th grade kind of sucks since its your first year being a high school but once the first day goes by you should be fine also talk to your parents so you can release some of the anxiety that you are having always helps me also if you cant fall asleep the day before ask your mom to give you something so you can sleep my cousin always had t do this cause she would start to have panic attacks and she would take something the night before so she can sleep just emember be yourself when you go to school just think your not the only freshman going through the nervous stage about going into high school have fun remeber dont think about it and talk to someone senior this year Anxiety Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Grandview, U.S.A.
