a daimond question is it real and how do i sell it i have found what i think is a diamond but i am not sure it is not in a piece of jewelry but just by itself here are the tests i have done i have placed it over small print in a book and could not read through it i have did the hot breath test and it did not fog up although i have now read to not do this i originally did use it to scratch the glass of a jar it did put a deep cut into the glass i would like to know to whom i could take this to and how to know if the value is correctly given to me its about the size of an eraser on the top of a pencil with the shape as being cut flat on top and then going out wider and then narrow to a fine point at the bottom any thoughts would be appreciated take it to any jeweler in the mall they have diamond testers these test by seeing if the stone conducts heat if it does it's a diamond or moisannite they will also have magnification to check the clarity and color etc size wise it sounds like to carat they'll be able to tell you the worth of the stone and will have options for selling or mounting it Diamond Diamond simulant Diamond cut Diamond enhancement Amateur telescope making Material properties of diamond Drill bit Diamond clarity Ammolite Turquoise Equine conformation Casting Christmas tree Sega Saturn Laser engraving Synthetic diamond Cubic zirconia Hope Diamond Gemstone Van Halen Door Pencil Plastic Cullinan Diamond Gemological Institute of America Carbon Argyle diamond mine Woodworking Bassoon Welding Traditional animation Wood carving Bong Printmaking Compact disc Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sharpening stone Aztec Oscilloscope Sextant Bicycle frame Lathe Wood Amethyst Eyepiece Lighting Filigree Software testing Opportunity rover Birthday Floppy disk Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom Wheel of Fortune Wassily Kandinsky Spark plug Facet Beastie Boys Art Nouveau Coffee File (metalwork) TRS-80 Cabochon Clarinet Menstrual cup Drawing Katana Gramophone record GED Violin Redundant array of independent disks Fire extinguisher Sears Holdings Corporation Stereoscopy Terminal ballistics Amateur astronomy Circuit design Game development Rainbow Islands The Hobbit Koh-i-Noor Lightning Pearl Sacred Harp Crater of Diamonds Undergarment Cat Carburetor Photography Brewery Pottery Audiophile Telescope Printed circuit board Regular polytope Parallax Mattress Guitar
