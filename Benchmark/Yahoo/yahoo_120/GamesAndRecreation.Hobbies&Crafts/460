is there an way to make silk fabric sturdy i am looking to make a peice of silk fabric stand up straight for an art project thanks for your help the iron on fusible interfacings work quite well but depending on what you are making with it do you have the shape that you want it to be molded you can use watered down white glue to stiffen up fabric it won't be wearable anymore the stitch on interfacings tend to come in heavier strengths so depending on how much you need to stand up you may wish to go this route how thin of a silk are you using what i would do personally would be to take the silk to the fabric store not walmart but a real fabric store and ask the ladies at the cutting table which interfacing will fuse without making the silk look bad if the silk is really thin the fusing may stain the silk good luck Carpet Mattress Knitting Cloth Glass Kimono Upholstery Parachute Casting Plastic Textile manufacturing Japanese tea ceremony Metallurgy Strap-on dildo Christmas tree Powder metallurgy Clothing Leaf Colours, standards and guidons Knife Jute Chair Dry cleaning Sword making Pottery Silk Supernova Sundial Boat building Carbon fiber Model aircraft Bicycle frame Transformer Fiberglass Cross-stitch Sewing machine Nuclear fusion Yarn Welding Crinoline Bulletproof vest Wearable computer Floppy disk Ship model Fuse (electrical) Skirt and dress Shell (projectile) Hakama Carbon nanotube Cannon RISC Spider Iron Embroidery Christo and Jeanne-Claude Headgear Knitting needle Tire Undergarment Wood Bong Diving suit Reinforced concrete Typewriter Hot air balloon Tissue engineering Polystyrene Hand grenade Magnesium Clinker (boat building) Piano Buddhist art Bookbinding Fabrication (metal) Rapid prototyping Seismic retrofit Magnetism Pump It Up Screen-printing Circuit design Screw Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tier One Canoe Sock puppet Cookware and bakeware Geodesic dome Moth Embedded system Solar cell Synthesizer Roof Shroud of Turin Suture Teen Girl Squad Order of St. John Sewing
