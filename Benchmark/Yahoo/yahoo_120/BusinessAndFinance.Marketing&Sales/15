loan officer or insurance sales which is harder right now i am working as a loan officer but i have the opportunity to cross over into insurance mortgages are pretty easy because if you call enough people eventually you find some that want or that you can convince they need to refinance but i feel some of the things that are acceptable to do are immoral and i don't want to compromise my intergrity which is harder to sell which demands more hours and which has more income potential are there immoral aspects of the insurance business i just don't like selling people at a higher interest rate than they qualify for so i can get money back from a bank while they pay more but my company pressures me to i'd go in to a different job altogether what kind of degree do you have i only say this because i've worked in an insurance office before and there's calling lots of calling do you want to switch your life over to us from xx you can save it's not a savings of they're spending just as much it's just at your office instead of someone else's if you'll still be at the bank and you're supposed to get mortgage insurance or home insurance they're more than likely getting it with their mortgage payment or through an outside office if you have a mathematics degree you could be an actuary they make figures they don't call anybody they do figures calculations on computers it's not bad work good luck to you Mortgage Insurance Life insurance Primerica Financial Services Annuity Money Bond Bank Savings and loan association Debt Unemployment benefit Taxation in the United States Personal finance Unemployment Federal National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) Tax Predatory lending Mutual fund Interest Economy of Russia Financial markets Great Depression Health insurance Finance 401(k) Derivative (finance) Capital accumulation Supply-side economics Government National Mortgage Association Financial services New Deal Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Security (finance) Monopoly (game) Real estate bubble Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Actuarial notation Gross domestic product Usury Inflation Mortgage-backed security Toronto-Dominion Bank Charles Ponzi Call centre Interest rate Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Collateralized mortgage obligation Student loan Annual percentage rate Subsidy Blackjack Economy of the United States Savings and Loan crisis Irish Life and Permanent Gold standard Commodity markets Theory of conduct Consumer finance Credit card Leeds United F.C.
