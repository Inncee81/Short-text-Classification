small chest pains i've been having slight chest pains recently they only occur when i apply pressure to the area though but pressure comes from having my torso in a an angle that causes the pain not pushing on it i have a blood pressure of i'm curious since i do martial arts when thrown and not falling properly lead to this because i had the pain under the armpit for days then it transferred to more of the left nipple region perhape you have pulled a muscle in your chest and side alot of times it hurts like it deep inside also do you find that it hurts when you take deep breath that also can occur i think i would watch it close and back off the martial arts for a couple days just to let the area rest then if it doesnt ease up you might want to get a doctor to look at it Equine conformation Professional wrestling throws Massage Diving Professional wrestling attacks Breastfeeding Myocardial infarction Aerial (dance move) Angina Tai Chi Chuan Lung Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumothorax Pressure point Mixed martial arts Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Swingout Breaststroke Trumpet Menstrual cup Lung cancer Local anesthesia Drowning Carpal tunnel syndrome First aid Pneumonia Suplex Elbow bondage Chokehold Breast bondage Professional wrestling aerial techniques Internal ballistics Wing Chun Psoriasis Swimming Terminal ballistics Respiratory system Pain Conspiracy (TNG episode) Single bullet theory Scoliosis Breast Aortic dissection Sperm Whale Hip fracture Stopping power Martial art Boxing Decompression sickness Archery The Inside Aikido Exercise Fecal incontinence Bruise Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Abdomen Milton H.
