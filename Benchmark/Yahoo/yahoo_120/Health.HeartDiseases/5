could i die with this bicuspid aortic valve disease i asked earlier what it was now i know what it is is it possible to die or have any complications what so ever with it and only the problem with bicuspid valves is that they have a tendency to become calcified and fibrotic hard and thickened over time if you are not seen regularly by a cardiologist and the valve becomes very calcified it can make it difficult for your heart to get enough blood flow out to your body think of a showerhead with the nozzles clogged leading to symptoms of chest pain fainting spells or heart failure on the flipside some people with bicuspid aortic valves will have more trouble with valve leakiness than with a tight valve a leaky valve makes your heart work extra hard to get the same amount of blood out to your body as a heart without any leaky valves over time this can overwork your heart and make it start to fail third a few people with bicuspid aortic valves have abnormalities with their aortas as well and can develop aneurysms or narrowings that need to be addressed now i will say this don't panic bicuspid aortic valves are actually quite common and people who live with them usually live normal lifespans the above complications tend to be seen in people who do not get regular follow up and let things progress until they are really bad before they go to their doctor unfortunately the fact is that most patients with bicuspid aortic valves will require surgery during their lifetime for some with more deformed valves intervention is required in childhood or adulthood however the majority have relatively normal valve function and remain undiagnosed until late in adulthood when the valve becomes stiff it is impossible to predict when you will need surgery to replace your valve but the most important thing is to follow up with your cardiologist on a regular basis you need to know that a cardiologist will need to monitor you with echocardiograms to help determine if and when you need to have anything done don't worry though as long as you keep seeing a cardiologist who understands bicuspid aortic disease you should be ok surgery is very safe these days and you can generally expect a long and healthy life even after having your valve replaced hope that helps good luck Atrial septal defect Aortic valve stenosis Heart valve Aortic insufficiency Marfan syndrome Myocardial infarction Heart sounds Heart Stroke Hypertension Blood pressure Mitral regurgitation Atheroma Atherosclerosis Pneumonia Prostate cancer Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Sickle-cell disease Mitral stenosis Atrial fibrillation Aortic aneurysm Medicine Diabetes mellitus Aneurysm Traumatic brain injury Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mitral valve prolapse Coronary catheterization Aorta Chronic fatigue syndrome Dialysis Heyde's syndrome Hypoglycemia Multiple sclerosis Stomach cancer Physical examination Cardiovascular disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cephalic disorder Anorexia nervosa Syringomyelia Coronary heart disease Bipolar disorder Urinary incontinence Cirrhosis Echocardiography Adult attention-deficit disorder Cardiac stress test Coronary circulation Folic acid Penis Malaria Von Willebrand disease Cardiothoracic surgery Anemia Diabetic neuropathy Electrophysiology Anxiety Mesothelioma Growth hormone treatment Autism Rheumatic fever Childbirth Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Angioplasty Circulatory system Rheumatoid arthritis Polycystic kidney disease Syphilis Rebreather Gastroesophageal reflux disease Organ transplant Panic attack Artery Atkins Nutritional Approach Colorectal cancer Thermal power station Osteoarthritis Radiation therapy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diabetic retinopathy Tocopherol Leukemia Clinical depression Crohn's disease
