congenital heart defect atrial septal defect which method is better in detecting or affirming the presence of a congenital heart defect especially the atrial septal defect is it mri or ecg thank you what if compare mri with echocardiogram an ecg alone is of limited value in detecting or affirming the presence of a congenital heart defect while some heart defects including primum and secunding asds are associated with specific ecg findings ecgs are neither sensitive nor specific enough for a doctor to rely on them alone mri provides very high resolution images of the cardiac anatomy and done properly is probably the best imaging study that we have at the present time to detect the presence of congenital heart lesions the problem is that mri is very expensive and is therefore not really considered to be a first line imaging study for many congenital heart defects an echocardiogram can provide all the necessary information in those situations mri is overkill mri is almost never inferior to echocardiograms though unless you consider patients who have pacemakers or icds and are therefore not always able to have mri imaging hope that answers your question Cardiology Electrocardiogram Magnetic resonance imaging Aortic dissection Mitral regurgitation Ventricular septal defect Cardiac stress test Myocardial infarction Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Turner syndrome Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Congenital disorder Echocardiography Atrial fibrillation Congenital heart defect Cardiac arrhythmia Long QT syndrome Functional magnetic resonance imaging Cephalic disorder Antiarrhythmic agent Computed tomography Hypoglycemia Heart rate Noonan syndrome Spina bifida Medicine Multiple sclerosis Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Radiology Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Defibrillator Cardiac arrest Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Breast cancer Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Estimation theory Atherosclerosis Obstetrics Malignant melanoma History of brain imaging Angina Positron emission tomography Brain tumor Atheroma Syringomyelia Troponin Magnetoencephalography Chest pain X-ray Growth hormone treatment Fetus Emergency department Amiodarone Coronary circulation Cardiac surgery Flecainide Cancer Bone marrow transplant Cardiac cycle Mitral stenosis Septic arthritis Appeal MMR vaccine AIDS reappraisal Terri Schiavo Patent ductus arteriosus Cardiac pacemaker Cerebellum DiGeorge syndrome Bradycardia Doppler effect Mental imagery Prolactinoma Tocopherol Myasthenia gravis History of intersex surgery Electroencephalography Hyperkalemia Medicare (Canada) Software testing Optic nerve Medical analysis of circumcision Incest taboo Action potential Endometriosis
