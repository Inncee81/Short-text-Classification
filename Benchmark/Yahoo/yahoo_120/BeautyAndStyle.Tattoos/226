getting a tattoo for my sixteenth opinions i eventually want to get all of these tattoos done but i'm not sure which one i want first i'm also not completely sure about the quotes placement and colors of the tattoos i want i'd love to hear your opinions a small black heart on my instep or the words in the absence of love there is nothing worth fighting for in the shape of a heart in the same place the ghandi quote you must be the change you wish to see in the world i'd like to get this one to the left of my spine on my mid back i'm really unsure on this one haven't put alot of thought into it i heard the quote and love it i really need ideas on this one i want to get something on my ribs but only after i'm done having kids i don't even want to think about having kids right now something on my shoulder ideas opinions well for one thing whenever you get your first tattoo don't listen to other people get something that means something to you otherwise you'll definitely regret it later in life but i do think that the things you've come up with are very unique and creative so good job also you said you wanted one for your sixteenth birthday again only get it if you're positive it's what you want i don't know where you're from but where i live you're supposed to be so i got mine done a week after my th birthday i'd wanted a tattoo forever and seriously thought about going to canada and getting one behind my parents' backs but now that i think about it i'm glad i waited it made turning kind of special so no matter how bad you may think you need a tattoo at those years will fly by trust me good luck Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Sydney Riot of 1879 The Emancipation of Mimi Ron and Fez Current teachings of Prem Rawat Luck Real Love (song) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Vegeta Jennifer Lopez The Ashlee Simpson Show W.I.T.C.H.
