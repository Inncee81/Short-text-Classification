do ankle tattoos look good when on both the inside and outer ankle do a lot of people have them also is a sun moon a stupid design for a tattoo or can it be a classic image especially when done by a good artist thanks whether a tattoo looks good or not is generally determined by the talent of the artist the most wonderful tattoo idea can be ruined by a horrible artist and also a crappy tattoo idea can be transformed into something wonderful with the right artist if you want a sun and moon then go for it it's not something that i'd get because i really don't feel a connection to the sun or the moon you definitely must be mindful of the tattoos you get and make sure that you do feel something for them and that they're not just a design that you think is cool or neat good luck with whatever you decide Tattoo Vanilla Ninja Art Social rule The Apprentice 2 Tokusatsu Irezumi Memento (film) Astrological sign Galactic Civilizations Ra (board game) W.
