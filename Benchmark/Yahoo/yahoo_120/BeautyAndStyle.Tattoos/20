is it ok for a guy to get a tattoo of a treble clef and drama masks under his belly button i mean is it like 'gay' it is a really cool design and such but hey just trying to get other peoples opinions i understand why you'd wanna ask this question tattoos are a big thing but i don't see why you think it'd look gay i mean i assume music and acting are your passions in life so it would be a great tat for you to get it apart from that we have to consider the fact that it would be extremely sexy to get said tattoo are you sure you wanna be that sexy hehe just go for it sounds ace and you'll love it xx Jon Secada Good Charlotte Prince (artist) Rod Stewart Daz Dillinger Spice Girls Marvin Gaye Eric Cartman Sheryl Crow The Isley Brothers Jody Watley The Ashlee Simpson Show Drama Max Martin Namie Amuro Clef Time Out of Mind Michelle Branch Double bass Friends Tina Turner Tattoo Sexual orientation Recurring South Park characters Future-Drama The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Mandy Moore Cyndi Lauper Musical notation My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Violin Ron and Fez Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Kyle Broflovski Avenue Q Bow Wow Wow Cher (entertainer) Hey Arnold!
