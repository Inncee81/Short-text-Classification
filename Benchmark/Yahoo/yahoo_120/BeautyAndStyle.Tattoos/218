ultraviolet tattoo i saw an episode of csi the other night where they found a tattoo on a woman's body that only showed up under a uv light it was penned with uv ink i was wondering whether you know if this is actually possible and what the procedure for getting one done would be yes it's quite common there is white ink that has uv reactive pigment in it only making it visible under blacklite now there is no promise that it won't be invisible as only time will tell but for the most part it is invisible except under uv light other colors can be used like this as well but they will be visible under regular light the procedure is just like any other tattoo as it is just a pigment in the ink if you would like one talk to a reputible tattoo artist chances are they've done one before Tattoo Ink Paint Pigment Black Polymethyl methacrylate Ultraviolet Scarification Drawing Invisible ink CMYK color model Color theory Albinism Tattoo gun Human skin color Fluorescent lamp Iris (anatomy) Irezumi Leopard Light Melanin Invisibility CSI: Miami Printmaking Color vision Rubber stamp Optical spectrum Titanium dioxide Mercury (element) Figure drawing The Invisible Man Black body Typewriter Cape Feare Color Malignant melanoma Photographic film Color blindness Philadelphia Experiment Traditional animation Corrosion Red Fountain pen Clitoris Laser Subtractive color Jan van Goyen Planetary nebula Nuclear explosion Cosmetics Mineral CSI: NY Body modification Earring Sento Camouflage Light-emitting diode Hair color Woad Ultramarine Eye color Unreal CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Georges-Pierre Seurat Electromagnetic spectrum Tuatara Ouroboros Primary color Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Extraterrestrial skies Iron-gall nut ink Lighting Impressionism Sunscreen Titanium Prostate cancer Xenon Henna Gamut New Zealand elections Photosynthesis Body piercing Zinc Moronobu Hishikawa Material properties of diamond Thermochromism Color space Vitiligo Bioluminescence Filter (optics) Observational astronomy Ballpoint pen Bilirubin Diamond Halo Screen-printing James Wong Howe Fantastic Four
