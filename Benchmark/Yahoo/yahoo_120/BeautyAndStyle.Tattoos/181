anyone got lots of tats but cant stand to look at visible ones all the time im allways jugeing the one on my for arm i got and i dont have a beef wit em u defiantlycan see em but more in the summer time i don't mind looking at mine the one on my arm is actually good but not great and i have some comlaints about it but that ship has sailed i got it years ago in a friend's basement but she was practicing to be a professional and now is so it's not really jailhouse or anything so it's not perfect but i figure that's just a part of the whole story of getting that tattoo at that time so that's what i look like now i actually kind of wish i could see more of them more often but many of them are hidden on my body on my back etc so i don't see them most of the time Inquisitorial system Tattoo RuneScape quests It's Walky!
