is the henry acu bolt lr a good med range coyote hunting rifle by med range i mean from yrds and nothing over yards as a gunsmith and a gun shop owner and year varmint hunter i can tell you without any doubt that the henry in standard long rifle caliber is a waste of money if you intend to take coyote at yards or further however if you bought the same rifle in hmr caliber costs the same thats a whole different story the lr lacks stopping power and unless you make a good head shot the coyote is going to disappear as in run away under his own power the hmr on the other hand is a smaller bullet but it's loaded into a necked down magnum case and shoots with much more muzzle velocity and shoots much flatter with reduced bullet drop and incredible energy and impact i have killed coyotes with my hmr custom remington at yards without difficulty there is just no comparison between the lr and the hmr the ammunition for the hmr is somewhat expensive but what would you rather do put them down or spend hours searching for wounded coyotes shot with a lr or spend a few dollars more for ammunition that will do the job i have sold over new hmr caliber rifles in my shop already this year and i can't manage to keep them in stock that should tell you something .22 Long Rifle .17 HMR Shotgun Rimfire Krag-J__rgensen Carbine 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Varmint rifle Rifle Terminal ballistics Firearm Wildcat cartridge Cartridge (firearms) Assault rifle Ammunition M16 (rifle) Sniper rifle .44 Magnum Jarmann M1884 .22 WMR Sniper Machine gun .17 HM2 Airsoft Suppressor .357 SIG Mini-14 Kammerlader Stopping power Air gun Bullet M60 machine gun Mauser M82 (rifle) .30-06 Springfield AK-74 Handloading External ballistics M1 Carbine Railgun .30 Carbine 10 mm Auto 7.62 __ 51 mm NATO Punisher Accuracy International AWM Marathon (computer game) M40 (rifle) Heckler & Koch MP5 .303 British Field Artillery in the American Civil War Shell (projectile) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Repeating rifle SKS Beltway sniper attacks Shotgun shell Turok: Rage Wars M4 Carbine .45 ACP Gun safety Mossberg 500 Krag-Petersson Desert Eagle Remington Arms Doom enemies Trench warfare Personal weapon Remington M1867 Heckler & Koch G36 SA80 Cannon Tracer ammunition Lee-Enfield 7.62 x 39 mm Colt Commando Paintball Beretta 92F/FS Winchester Model 70 Archery .22 Long Wal-Mart The Inside Flintlock Sturmgewehr 44 United States Navy Mark 12 Mod X Special Purpose Rifle Directed-energy weapon .22 CB Equine conformation .45 GAP Long gun
