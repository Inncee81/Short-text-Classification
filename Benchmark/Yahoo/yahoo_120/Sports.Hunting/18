whats the big x mm scopes good for i assume you are referring to the objective size its just like telescopes the bigger the objective is the more light it collects which translates into a brighter image and better resolution at high magnifications basically you will see better in low light conditions and at high power longer than lesser sized optics of equal quality Binoculars Eyepiece Telescope Optical telescope Astronomical seeing Microscope Lens (optics) Hubble Space Telescope Adaptive optics Reflecting telescope Magnification Angular resolution Very Large Telescope Speckle imaging Observational astronomy Telescopic sight Hubble Deep Field Amateur astronomy Eye SETI Red dot sight Extreme Programming Amateur telescope making Big Bang Digital photography Galileo spacecraft Interferometry Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing observatory Leica Synthetic aperture radar Photographic lens Gamma ray burst Photography Chandra X-ray Observatory Spotting scope Blazar Refracting telescope Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Microscopy 2003 UB313 Astronomy Stereoscopy Macro photography Apparent magnitude Comet Hale-Bopp Cat's Eye Nebula Spitzer space telescope Electron microscope Eyeglass prescription Pluto Bicycle lighting Autostereogram Depth of field Image scanner Planetary nebula Motion capture Anamorphic widescreen Holography Normal distribution Mirror Infrared astronomy Super Nintendo Entertainment System Mount Wilson Observatory Sun 1 Ceres Sniper Optical coherence tomography Optical interferometry Classical mechanics Digital single-lens reflex cameras Laser applications Parallax Mouse (computing) View camera Monochromator Mass STS-82 Zoom lens Color Extraterrestrial skies Extrasolar planet Variable Diamond cut Cognitive science Operational amplifier IMAX Faster-than-light Occultation Liquid crystal display Light Camcorder Widescreen Optical spectrum Clementine mission Solar eclipse Solar cell Confocal laser scanning microscopy
