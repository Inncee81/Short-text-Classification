registering a pistol whenever i've bought a gun in the past it's been from a dealer store so they register it then i just bought a pistol from my friend so how where do i get it registered it's illegal to carry an unregistered weapon even with a cc permit correct i live in georgia what state do you live in chances are you don't have to register anything a private sale is a private sale it's just like him selling you candy or a video game gun stores are ffl federal firearms license permit holders and they don't register a gun to you per se they just make you fill out the paperwork to make sure you're elgible to buy it but in a private sale no such paperwork is needed i don't believe except in gun unfriendly states like california illinoise etc guns need to be registered although technically a record is kept of the sale and maybe thats what you mean by registered it's legal in most states to carry openly on person open carry or in a vehicle however once you conceal the gun you need a concealed firearms permit that's why it's called a concealed permit i recommend signing a piece of paper stating he's transferring the gun to you with the serial make model caliber etc on it so if something happens eg it gets stolen or used in a crime it wont come back registered to him Gun politics in the United States Gun politics Firearm Airsoft Beltway sniper attacks Gun control in the United States (by state) Federal assault weapons ban Pistol Machine gun Gun Control Act of 1968 Carbine Trademark GLOCK Firearm case law Cartridge (firearms) Submachine gun Grand Theft Auto III National Firearms Act Ammunition National Rifle Association Vehicle registration plate M1911 Shotgun Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Assault rifle Warez Security (finance) Copyright infringement of software Digital rights management Heckler & Koch MP5 Sawn-off shotgun Copyright SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Moonshine Medical prescription Prohibition (drugs) Technology in the Stargate universe Air gun Murder Police California government and politics M60 machine gun Illegal drug trade Taxation in the United States Punisher Counter-Strike Copy protection Prohibition M1 Carbine Assault weapon Public domain Revolver Video game controversy John Browning Sten Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Webley and Scott Berkshire Hathaway GoldenEye Columbine High School massacre Suppressor Desert Eagle Notary public Identity theft Artillery Mumia Abu-Jamal M82 (rifle) FairTax Telephone tapping Pornography Israeli Military Industries Medium machine gun German car number plates UK Singles Chart DVD Terminal ballistics Rifle Confidence trick Poker jargon Microeconomics Caliber Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Let's Make a Deal Atari 8-bit family .22 Long Rifle Alcoholic beverage Rules of the road Internal ballistics .357 SIG Democratic Party (United States) Sears Holdings Corporation ITunes Music Store Apple Computer Battlefield 2 US and Canadian license plates
