do you believe in overkill personally i don't believe there is such a thing you can never kill something too much am i saying you should use a bmg for squirl hunting no but if you do i don't really care and no one else should care either your not a very efficent hunter if you do but its a humane kill lets face it if someone was using a lot for deer hunting most people would say that it is overkill but so what if someone wants to use a lot for deer hunting nobody should give him her any greif if someone walks into a store and asks what should i use for deer hunting someone should say you might want to look into a or sir you probably don't need a i'm just saying nobody should get mad at anybody for using a larger than proficent cal if that makes any sense i do agree with the damaging of the meat i just hate it when people use a lr on coyots if anything is going to give peata more things to use against hunters its shooting animals with an unsuficent cal i do agree with the damaging of the meat i just hate it when people use a lr on coyots if anything is going to give peata more things to use against hunters its shooting animals with an unsufficent cal if some one wants to get the living he kicked out of them for the giggles that one thing so what if he wants to shoot prairie dogs with a win magnum i ve been known to shoot armadillos with my for giggles but there is items that will set me off quick using a monster magnum to make up for poor shot placement when the old boy cant kill a deer with a thanks well maybe if i use a win magnum i ll kill that deer this year those who wont the magnums so they can shoot deer at yards when they cant hit a bulls eye at yard using semi auto with high capacity magazines to make up for poor shot placement because they might need more then shots to kill that deer those who wont to under gun for anything like you said about the lr and coyotes i cant count how many times i have read questions on this forum can a caliber be used for deer because i m recoil sensitive i have bumped in to fools like this it is these people note i did not say hunters that are giving you and i a bad reputation if they cant kill a deer or other animal with a humane one shot kill they need to stay out of the woods if they are so recoil sensitive that they cant use a sufficient caliber weapon to do the job they need to stay out of the wood if they cant hit the bulls eye at yards don t shoot yards hunting and ethics go hand in hand true hunters respect the game they hunt and don t intentionally allow it to suffer if someone has the skill and wants to use a to shoot the heads off squirrel that his or her business i use a lr to save money and do the same job and giggle on how much money i saved over the person using the i cant help but wonder if we should not make everyone qualify each year with their weapons before being allowed to get a hunting license you don t get a drivers license or pilots license until you prove you can drive or fly granted nuts drunks and drug addicts still get to driver or flying but maybe it would stop some of them for the sake of our sport and the wildlife d hunting with rifle pistol muzzle loader and bow for over decades reloading rifle pistol and shotgun for over decades Internal ballistics Terminal ballistics Carbine Rifle Hunting Archery .44 Magnum Air gun M16 (rifle) .22 Long Rifle Revolver Marathon (computer game) Concealed carry (USA) Fox hunting Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Doom enemies Varmint rifle Gray Wolf Beretta 92F/FS Krag-J__rgensen Railgun Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sniper Mini-14 Sniper rifle M1 Carbine Sin City Grand Theft Auto (game) The Invisibles Stopping power Cat Red Deer Airsoft Unreal Counter-Strike Mauser Bow (weapon) Battlefield 2 Comanche Whaling Shotgun shell Handloading Punisher Theory of conduct .357 SIG 10 mm Auto Hitman (computer game) Dog YuYu Hakusho Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Suppressor GunBound Resident Evil (video game) Technology in the Stargate universe GunZ The Duel Ammunition Cartridge (firearms) Wildcat cartridge Trapping Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Tag Columbine High School massacre Paintball Trench warfare Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an M82 (rifle) Day of Defeat Wyatt Earp Bullet Equine conformation Sly Cooper M2 machine gun ISSF shooting events RuneScape skills Half-Life: Opposing Force Cheating in Counter-Strike Cincinnati Bengals The Covenant Shen Gong Wu Conker's Bad Fur Day
