is it legal to own a dragunov rifle in massachusetts and where can i buy one according to the massachusetts assault weapon ban all copies of the ak are illegal to own and possess however even though the drag is a larger version of the ak by design it should not be banned so its not banned by name but what about by features massachusetts law states that a weapon which is capable of accepting a large capacity ammunition feed device holds over rounds is illegal it also includes the prior catagory of assault weapon as far as i know a drag does not have any magazine that's over rounds so it appears that you're ok there then you go back to part i administration of the government title xx public safety and good order chapter licenses sale of firearms chapter section firearms sales definitions antique firearms application of law exceptions it states in the exceptions to the assault weapon definition sub vi any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds of ammunition so it is not excepted from the assault weapon ban since it can hold more than rounds in my opinion it is allowed since as far as i know it is not named by feature or design to fall within the definition of the assault weapon ban of mass as far as where to buy one i'd look online and have it shipped into mass for the cheapest price you may also want to look in the ak section of ar com or www ak net for more info on drags and copies which are available i know a company released a romanian copy for around which was pretty accurate contact your local gun shop and ask them about the rifle before having it sent to them about the legality of the rifle Firearm Federal assault weapons ban Assault rifle Rifle Assault weapon Carbine Airsoft M16 (rifle) FN FAL Terminal ballistics Dragunov M82 (rifle) Sniper rifle M4 Carbine Internal ballistics M60 machine gun Shotgun National Rifle Association Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act Beretta 92F/FS Krag-J__rgensen Ammunition Sniper Heckler & Koch G3 Marathon (computer game) M1 Garand Concealed carry (USA) SKS Gun politics in the United States Gun politics M249 Submachine gun Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Air gun Cartridge (firearms) Bullet Mini-14 Repeating rifle XM29 OICW Battlefield 2 Springfield 1903 rifle Artillery M1 Carbine Heckler & Koch G36 Cannon Colt Commando Sturmgewehr 44 United States Navy Mark 11 Mod 0 Sniper Weapon System Counter-Strike Halo: Combat Evolved Technology in the Stargate universe AK-74 Gun safety Beltway sniper attacks 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Lee-Enfield Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Microsoft Heckler & Koch G11 Speedloader .22 Long Rifle Kammerlader QBZ-95 GNU General Public License Stopping power FN P90 Jarmann M1884 Five-seveN Medium machine gun Public domain Bulletproof vest Punisher GLOCK Desert Eagle Tavor TAR-21 Paintball Weapons of mass destruction Bren Wildcat cartridge Archery Krag-Petersson Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus M14 (rifle) Gatling gun Cosmic Era Mobile Units Karabiner 98k Heckler & Koch MP5 U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance SA80 Tank
