are any nuts if any as in salted almond walnut etc good for your heart there aren't any 'magic' foods that can automatically improve your health a good diet includes plenty of variety and nuts contain many of the vitamins and minerals that are usually missing from the 'mainstream' range of foods however the benefits of eating a good diet which will probably include nuts seeds as well as green vegetables wholefood 'staples' and a moderate amount of fat can easily be cancelled out by doing unhealthy things if you eat nuts while drinking beer in front of the tv then they are definitely not going to help your heart a 'fruitarian' diet is very healthy and contains a lot of nuts the idea is an extreme version of veganism as well as cutting out all animal products you also exclude foods that are obtained by damaging a plant only those parts of a plant which are designed to be discarded can be eaten for example grains wheat maize barley rice etc are permitted but only if they have been stripped from a plant which continues to grow afterwards rather than being cut down as it would be in western industrial agriculture surprisingly it is possible to get sufficient nutrition from these foodstuffs alone however the most healthy part of the diet might be the amount of effort that you need to put into obtaining the right products Vegetarian nutrition Hamster Fruitarianism Nutrition Bread Cereal Agriculture Soybean Omega-3 fatty acid Rice Healthy eating Green Revolution Peanut Milk Tocopherol Food guide pyramid Genetically modified food Dieting Maize Organic farming Tofu Atkins Nutritional Approach Folic acid Quinoa Potato Paleolithic diet Coeliac disease Food preservation Coronary heart disease Dietary fiber Jewish cuisine Barley Ramen Fruit Alcoholic beverage Fancy rat Chicken Chocolate Vitamin C Acorn Cuisine of Africa Golden rice Antioxidant Cuisine of Denmark Neolithic Revolution Kosher foods Alcohol fuel Miso Egg (food) Peruvian cuisine Margarine Beer Nut (fruit) Cheerios Genetic engineering Flour Economy of Colombia Domestic rabbit Oat Famine Cuisine of Malaysia Kashrut Sugar MyPyramid Common bean Cuisine of Brazil Soul food Flowering plant Breastfeeding South Beach diet Hypoglycemia Vitamin Low-carbohydrate diet Sorghum Hemp Zinc Passover Stomach cancer Vegetarian cuisine Botany Brewery Economy of the People's Republic of China Guinea pig Watermelon Cheese Global warming and agriculture Plant Obesity Trans fat
