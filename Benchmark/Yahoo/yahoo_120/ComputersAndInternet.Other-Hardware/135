computer problems help my sony vaio desktop just stopped working out of nowwhere i am pretty literate in computers so don't worry about hard words i checked all of the connections and they are all fine whenever i push the power button it doesn't make any attempts to start up none of the fans turn on no beeps no led light my best guess is that the power supply died the computer is years old i was just wondering if anybody could confirm that it is the power supply try running it on the battery try using a different outlet on a different circuit to use house current for ac power if you are using a surge protector make sure it is working properly you can check the power adapter with a volt ohm meter and see if it is giving juice to the machine plug in the adapter to the house power outlet check the outgoing power just after the brick to see if it is putting out any juice it also could be that the cmos battery has died which is easily replaceable Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Laptop Residual-current device IPod CMOS Battery (electricity) Volt Transformer Thermal power station Universal Serial Bus Electricity Floppy disk SCSI Personal computer Circuit design BS 1363 PlayStation Portable Three-phase electric power Toyota Prius Windows XP Embedded system Carburetor Oscilloscope Electricity meter Copy protection Bicycle lighting USB flash drive Computer forensics Atari ST Electrophysiology Apple Macintosh Sega Saturn Electrical generator X Window System Sega Hybrid vehicle Tungsten Handheld Digital circuit IMac Desknote Fuse (electrical) IBM PC compatible Digital photography Ethernet Vacuum tube Mach kernel X10 (industry standard) Poker jargon Electric motor Diode Surveillance Baroque chess Nintendo Entertainment System RFID Commodore 64 Light switch Power strip Spark plug Spark gap Relay Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ohm's law Super Nintendo Entertainment System 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Nintendo DS Wheel of Fortune Transistor Uninterruptible power supply Series and parallel circuits AmigaOS Thermostat Current source Battery electric vehicle Power-On Self Test Computer Pinball Enigma machine Loudspeaker PlayStation 2 The Amazing Race Operational amplifier Circuit breaker PowerBook Voice over IP Solar power Radiation hardening Game controller Blue screen of death Fluorescent lamp Nintendo GameCube Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Overclocking Desktop computer Switch Logic gate
