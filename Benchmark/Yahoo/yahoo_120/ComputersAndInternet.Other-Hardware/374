hard drive failure what can i do ok so i'm new to the world of hard drive failure when i turn on my computer i get the error message primary hard drive failure and i hear a slow clicking noise and very loud spinning which i can tell is coming from my hd the spinning starts and stops a couple of times then it just stops so i'm pretty sure the drive is screwed two questions is there anything i can do to try to get the drive working again or is hd failure a completely non reversible thing and second is there any way i can get my data back without sending the drive into a computer store thanks unfortunately that clicking metal sound you speak of is the death rattle of a hard drive if you hear it your hard drive is fixing to die and most likely already doesn't work fully so to answer your question no there is nothing you can do to get the drive going again unless you know how to refurbish a hard drive you may be able to save bits and pieces of your data but it sounds like the bios can no longer even recognize the drive so you wont be able to do that either there is a service available that will get your data off of a failed drive but it is very expensive almost never a consideration for a failed drive unless the data is crucial sorry to be so wordy but i didn't want to answer you by simply saying your screwed even though that is pretty much the case on the bright side hard drives are getting pretty cheap i saw a gb for the other day Floppy disk Hard disk Redundant array of independent disks IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family Modem IPod Digital photography Atari 2600 Drill bit Embedded system Digital circuit CPU cache Computer virus Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Compact disc Cache Commodore 64 Windows 2000 Pinball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gramophone record Analog-to-digital converter Computer forensics Computer Prank flash Table tennis DVD System/34 AmigaOS Manual transmission Apollo Guidance Computer MP3 Theory of conduct System/36 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Advanced Technology Attachment Dither Bicycle lighting Amstrad CPC Telegraphy John Cage USB flash drive Booting Partition (computing) International Phonetic Alphabet NeXT Hash table Pretty Good Privacy Disk storage Professional wrestling throws Radio Screw Extreme Programming Hearing impairment Early IBM disk storage Morse Code Debugging File Allocation Table Kasparov versus The World 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mouse (computing) Knoppix Halting problem Cray-1 Burroughs B5000 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Error correction and detection Video game music Volleyball Computer numbering formats Mach kernel Hubble Space Telescope Friends The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Compact audio cassette Lathe Galileo spacecraft MAME Swingout Toyota Prius Overclocking Mars Exploration Rover Computer storage Ethernet Personal computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows XP Communications protocol Sound effect Shaggy dog story One-time pad CPU design Time Out of Mind Apple Open Collaboration Environment
