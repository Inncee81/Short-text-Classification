installation of a nd harddrive does it need an operating system to run i've been thinking of adding a nd harddrive to my computer i know i need to designate one as a master and the other as a slave but do i need to install windows xp or whatever os on the new harddrive can i install a different os linux first assuming you are referring to an ide drive and not setting up a raid since it sounds like you merely want to toss on a unix version for the new drive no it doesn't need an os all it needs is a connection to the mobo using the ide you seem to understand that one needs to be designated as master and slave using the jumpers so i'll spare you that explaination once physically connected you'll need to enter your bios and tell the system you have a drive most mobos have an autodetection option for finding drives so look for that if it doesn't have that option you'll need to manually enter the pertinent information heads sectors etc save the settings once windows boots check if you can see the new drive in my computer if so feel free to format it partition it as you see fit also this might be of some help to you as it is an step by step instruction set with pictures for adding a nd disk http www perfectdrivers com howto seconddrive html Hard disk Redundant array of independent disks Partition (computing) Booting Linux USB flash drive Advanced Technology Attachment BIOS Blue screen of death File system Computer virus Knoppix Emacs AmigaOS Virtual memory NTFS Disk cloning Wget IBM PC compatible Unix Floppy disk MS-DOS Operating system DOS FreeDOS Apple II family Gmail OpenBSD Microsoft Windows Macromedia Flash HyperText Transfer Protocol Domain Name System DragonFly BSD ReactOS Mozilla Firefox TRS-80 Disk formatting IA-32 Modchip Timeline of computing 1990-forward Mac OS X PDP-11 Unicode and HTML MIPS architecture Computer bus Xbox Server Rootkit Drive letter assignment Apple Macintosh World Wide Web LiveCD Mouse (computing) Windows registry Library (computer science) Forth programming language Universal Serial Bus MAME Atari 8-bit family WordStar NX bit Commodore 128 LaTeX Atari ST OpenOffice.org Linux kernel CP/M Commodore 64 Fdisk Linux distribution Mandriva Linux Bluetooth SAS System Visual Basic PHP Comparison of file systems Dual boot Comparison of web browsers IBM PC Amiga PlayStation 2 AS/400 Supercomputer Mach kernel
