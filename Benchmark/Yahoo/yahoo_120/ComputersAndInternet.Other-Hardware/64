what is the equivalent of intelcore duo e ghz is intelcore duo e ghz faster than pentium iv ghz what is the single core equivalent eg piv ghz of intelcore duo e ghz tnx in terms of processing power the intel core duo e ghz processor will actually handle applications faster than the pentium ghz in that regardless of the fact that the pentium is running at slightly more than double the clock speed it can still only handle processor instruction per clock cycle where the dual core will handle instructions in the same clock cycle also processor speed is not the only consideration of the speed of a system any system is only as fast as it's slowest rated component the pentium is only rated at an mhz front side bus the e dual core is rated at mhz front side bus thus communications through the front side bus will also speed up programs running when communicating with other components installed in your machine Pentium III Pentium M Central processing unit Xeon Pentium Clock rate PowerPC VIA C3 Celeron CPU cache CPU design RISC Pentium II Front side bus Pentium Pro Cell (microprocessor) Microprocessor Itanium 2 64-bit PR rating Opteron Duron Apple Macintosh Athlon 64 MIPS architecture PowerPC G4 Cyrix Apple Intel transition CDC 6600 Intel 80486 Intel i860 Supercomputer IA-32 Timeline of computing 1990-forward NVIDIA GeForce 6 Series INMOS Transputer Northbridge (computing) Computer architecture PC motherboard Montecito X86 PlayStation 3 IEEE 802.11 PowerBook HyperTransport CPU electrical consumption Xbox 360 3dfx IBM PC AMD K6-III IBM POWER AMD K6-2 IBM PC compatible Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer Radeon AMD K6 Software-defined radio Stream processing Simultaneous multithreading Super Nintendo Entertainment System ARM architecture Magnetic core memory Windows XP Motorola 68000 Data General Nova Zilog Z80 Microprogram Athlon 64 X2 Intel iAPX 432 Symmetric multiprocessing Apollo Guidance Computer RCA 1802 Distributed computing AMD64 Xbox SGI Visual Workstation NX bit ThinkPad AltiVec Cray-1 Computer bus Transmeta Branch predictor Digital circuit X86 assembly language VIA Technologies Mac OS Power Mac G5
