overclocking and adding new memory i bought a new memory module an mb kingston i already have two ones the second one is a no name the third is the same as the first mb kingston my motherboard is msi kt v three memory slots available my processor is amd but i down clocked it about one year before it was a working on mhz in the first slot is an kingston the same one in the second and the no name in the third did i do it right and how can i overclock amd again to work on mhz having a bit of trouble understanding the question seems that you added memory you now have sticks of meg on the system that seems fine the board supports gig so you can add more in the future but you have all slots filled so you will need to replace a stick or two you use to have the processor amd over clocked to which seemed a bit aggressive overclocking is not for everyone you need to be very careful that you know exactly what you are doing or you will damage your components if you haven't any background in overclocking or have a limited knowledge of system configurations i would not overclock that system you would be better served adding a newer faster processor to gain more speed your motherboard will support up to a i would suggest that as an option first http www msicomputer com product p spec asp model kt vl class mb Overclocking Athlon Celeron Pentium 4 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Opteron Radeon Front side bus IBM PC Cyrix Central processing unit GeForce 6 Series Power Macintosh G3 PlayStation 2 Sound Blaster NVIDIA Timeline of computing 1990-forward Apple Macintosh Xeon NForce4 AMD K6-III CPU cache Atari 8-bit family MSX VIA Technologies Apple II family Personal computer RISC Commodore 64 PlayStation 3 Linux kernel AMD 5x86 MIPS architecture ATI Technologies CDC 6600 Data General Nova TRS-80 Color Computer VIA C3 DDR2 SDRAM IBM PC compatible Amstrad CPC MOS Technology 6502 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Windows XP NX bit Radeon X Series Clock rate Northbridge (computing) IMac Atari ST X86 CPU design DDR SDRAM Reconfigurable computing Xbox 360 Computer bus Nintendo DS Apple IIGS 3dfx Dual-core 64-bit Amiga AMD64 Secure Digital card Pentium M PowerBook PR rating Pentium D Motherboard X86 assembly language Sempron Power Mac G5 Cisco PIX Nintendo GameCube HyperTransport ABIT AirPort Duron USB flash drive Cray-2 IA-32 Power Mac G4 INMOS Transputer Pentium III Integrated circuit Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Pentium Pro AMD K6-2 Dynamic random access memory SGI Indy
