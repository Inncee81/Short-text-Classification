for a game that's minumum required mb gpu is i am downloading world of warcraft its minimum mb gpu is and thats exactly what my computer has will the game work all right or should i just upgrade it depends on what the gpu is if it is an integrated gpu it will be sharing memory from you installed ram note most integrated gpu's are not ideal for gaming but in most cases will work on lowest setting but usualy don't work well if your gpu is an add in card then it usually has dedicated ram and will perform much better than an integrated gpu but with only mb or ram for video you will still need to turn down the graphics of the game to a minimum the other thing you need to look at is how old the card is wow requires a graphics card with support for at least directx recommended directex c that means that your looking for something along the lines of a radeon and up or an nvidia geforce mainly something that will suport transform and lighting ATI Technologies Graphics processing unit Radeon NVIDIA GeForce 6 Series Graphics card Windows Vista PlayStation 3 3dfx GeForce Xbox GeForce 7 Series GeForce FX Doom 3 Radeon X Series Xbox 360 GeForce 256 GeForce 3 GeForce 2 Counter-Strike IMac IBM PC compatible Nintendo Revolution DirectX World of Warcraft Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Far Cry PC Engine The Sims 2 Vertex and pixel shaders Scalable Link Interface Shader Windows XP OpenGL Cg programming language Game programming Stream processing Apple Macintosh Atari 8-bit family ThinkPad Dawn (demo) TurboGrafx 16 PlayStation 2 Windows XP Media Center Edition Atari ST Sega Dreamcast Nintendo GameCube PowerBook G4 Redundant array of independent disks Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sinclair ZX81 Apple IIGS S3 Savage Commodore 64 Game Boy Advance Apple II family H.264/MPEG-4 AVC World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade TRS-80 Color Computer Random access memory ZX Spectrum Commodore 128 Deus Ex: Invisible War Microprocessor First-person shooter Amstrad CPC NForce4 Linux Read-only memory Windows 3.x Color Graphics Adapter Frame rate Mac OS X v10.4 FLOPS Source engine Mac OS X History of video games (Sixth generation era) Original Amiga chipset TRS-80 Mac mini Computer bus Betting (poker) IBook Commodore PET Diablo (computer game) Power Mac G4 Cube BBC Micro Acorn Electron Nintendo 64 Knoppix AmigaOS History of operating systems Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories FIFA Series PlayStation (original)
