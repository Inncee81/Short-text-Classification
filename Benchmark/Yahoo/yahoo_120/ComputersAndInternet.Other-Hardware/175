can someone explain the clockspeed of a core duo for me so i just bought a laptop with a core duo merom which runs at speed of ghz but my own pentium prescott runs at something ghz isn't a core duo suppose to be faster than pentium as others have said it is the better architecture that allows it to be faster even at a lower clock speed but let me go ahead and explain a little bit why this is true while clock speed is the most widely known measure of a processors performance it is in reality only one half of the equation the other half being instructions per cycle ipc here is how the two combine together clockspeed tells you how many clock cycles there are per a given amount of time ghz means billion clock cycles per second ghz means billion clock cycles per second etc ipc is how many instructions are actually done on each of those clock cycles the new core duos have much higher ipc than the pentium s meaning they are more powerful you won't ever see actually ipc numbers listed for a processor but think of it this way if a p running at ghz only does instructions per cycle but a core duo running at ghz does which does more work in a given amount of time doing the math would tell you the core wins billion to billion this incidentally is also the same reason amd processors were outperforming intel processors for years even though they had much lower clockspeeds amd focused on ipc while intel focused on clockspeed but now since we have hit a wall on clockspeeds at around ghz intel has started to focus more on ipc as well Xeon Athlon AMD Celeron CPU design RISC Microprocessor Pentium III CPU cache Central processing unit PR rating Athlon 64 Pentium D Clock rate IA-32 PowerPC Pentium Overclocking NVIDIA X86 AMD64 Cyrix 64-bit MIPS architecture Transmeta Apple Intel transition Moore's law IBM PC compatible Timeline of computing 1990-forward CDC 6600 X86 assembly language Intel i860 Pentium Pro NX bit PowerPC G4 Northbridge (computing) PC motherboard Intel 80486 AMD K6-III Laptop Mach kernel Branch predictor Duron Computer PowerBook PlayStation 3 CPU electrical consumption Pentium II AltiVec Radeon DEC Alpha Intel 3dfx Cray-1 Montecito IA-64 ATI Technologies Intel 80386 IBM POWER Mainframe computer Supercomputer L4 microkernel family Magnetic core memory Symmetric multiprocessing Dual-core Microprogram Computer architecture Simultaneous multithreading IBM PC Wintel GeForce 6 Series Benchmark (computing) VIA Technologies Windows XP Stream processing AMD 5x86 Speed of light Efficeon HyperTransport Data General Nova Motorola 68000 Linux kernel Word (computer science) Sun Microsystems Intel XScale Control Data Corporation Intel i960 Vector processor
