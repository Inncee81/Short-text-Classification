nd monitor on laptop i am trying to hook up monitors to my laptop which is docked one is a tv for windows media center and the other is just a monitor my problem is that there is only vga output on my laptop i'm also using vista so i can't use a media extender unless i have xbox i don't i've seen some external usb video cards but i don't know whether it could handle video on a inch tv thanks for any solutions i'm kinda desperate i decided to be smart and wait until a week before i head off to school it was a nice thought but no such luck on the s video port thanks anyway i think u need sli ports to run more than one monitor along with video cards so i think you need sli ports and video cards Universal Serial Bus Laptop Xbox ATI Technologies Apple Macintosh 3dfx Xbox 360 Television IPod USB flash drive Windows Vista PowerBook Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IBM PC compatible Graphics card Nintendo GameCube GeForce 6 Series Windows XP Atari ST Scalable Link Interface Floppy disk Video Graphics Array Nintendo Revolution History of Microsoft Windows NForce4 Computer hardware IBook Commodore 64 Personal computer Computer and video games Bluetooth PlayStation 3 Hard disk Computer bus Timeline of computing 1990-forward Radeon IBM PC Mac mini PlayStation 2 Amiga IMac PowerPC Sega Dreamcast Surveillance Memory card Super Video Graphics Array Power Macintosh G3 Digital Visual Interface MIPS Magnum PC Engine Game Boy NVIDIA Digital video recorder Screenshot Power Mac G4 Cube Quake Secure Digital card Computer display standard Mac OS X Microsoft X Window System Archos Mac OS X v10.4 Modchip Commodore International DVD Digital photography Ethernet History of operating systems TRS-80 Color Computer In The Groove (game) STS-114 Atari 8-bit family Game programming Apple II family Musical Instrument Digital Interface Liquid crystal display The Inside Acorn Archimedes AirPort Digital audio player CompactFlash Sound card Tungsten Handheld Display resolution Nintendo AlphaSmart Nintendo Entertainment System Dance Dance Revolution Microprocessor D-subminiature Common Unix Printing System AmigaOS Sound recording Desknote QuickDraw S-Video Video game console Computer forensics
