video games cpu video card or ram i am very confused with all this cpu video card and ram stuff let's say i want to play a game like half life or doom mostly d fps games my computer currently is running on a pentium r cpu ghz a sis video card and mb of ram which should i be upgrading to be able to play these games smoothly also how do these cpu video card ram affect my gameplay thanks to be honest you'll probably need to upgrade all three to be able to play games like that smoothly the video or graphics card vga is probably the most important thing when gaming is your key concern as it does all the d rendering of the graphics and without certain features you won't be able to play many modern games ram is pretty useful stuff when gaming too gb is about the minimum you'll need to be able to run most modern games but i'd go for gb if you can afford it your ghz processor just about scrapes through minimum requirements but if you're in the mood for upgrading it go for a dual core core duo processor and that should speed things up quite a bit other than that if your games are running jerkily low frame rate causes this try turning all the graphics options off or to their lowest settings and play at the lowest resolution available i'd suggest reading the back of the game boxes you want to be able to play and looking for the minimum recommended is better requirements and building a system around that there's a really good article on games and the technologies behind them on wiki link in sources hope this helps Pentium 4 IBM PC compatible Xbox 360 ATI Technologies PC Engine Doom 3 PlayStation 3 Xbox Nintendo Revolution First-person shooter Atari 8-bit family Original Amiga chipset 3dfx PowerPC Cell (microprocessor) Amiga PlayStation Portable Pentium M Mac OS X TRS-80 Color Computer Apple Macintosh Computer and video games X86 Windows XP History of computer and video games IMac Personal computer Sega Saturn CPU cache Microprocessor PlayStation 2 Amstrad CPC Sinclair ZX81 PowerBook Atari ST Laptop Windows Vista TurboGrafx 16 RISC AMD Graphics processing unit Opteron Game Boy Commodore 128 Nintendo GameCube MSX Mouse (computing) PC motherboard Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Apple II family Color Graphics Adapter Athlon Texas Instruments TMS9918 Counter-Strike IBook Computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis History of Microsoft Windows MIPS architecture NVIDIA Computer workstation Random access memory IBM PC TRS-80 Timeline of computing 1990-forward High-definition television BBC Micro The Sims 2 Cyrix Apple IIGS Frame rate Video Graphics Array Poker jargon Far Cry Game programming Atari 2600 Mac mini Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Computer and video game genres Quake Nintendo 64 Athlon 64 Front side bus Radeon VIA C3 NX bit PlanetSide Power Macintosh G3
