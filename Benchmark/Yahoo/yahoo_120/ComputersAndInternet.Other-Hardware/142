pc run through laptop hi im going away to college in a week and i just got my new laptop for school its a hp pavilion dv i play a few games for the pc but my laptop has an integrated video card so it dosnt run games well at all the reason i cant bring my pc to school is because it will take up to much room in my small dorm monitor mouse keyboard ect i was curious if there was a way where i could just bring my pc box and hook it up to my laptop so that it just uses my laptop screen and keyboard the only way to control your desktop from laptop i could think off is using remote desktop connection but most games would not work with that by the way if you are thinking to bring your desktop and laptop to the dorm just ditch the laptop and get flat screen monitor and keyboard Laptop Desktop computer Universal Serial Bus Atari ST IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh Windows XP Personal computer X Window System IMac Screenshot Bluetooth PowerBook Computer Television Mouse (computing) ATI Technologies Computer and video games Mac OS X v10.4 Microsoft Windows Computer hardware Windows 2000 Desknote Windows Vista Screensaver Computer keyboard History of the graphical user interface Game controller Sega Dreamcast Apple Computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface PowerPC History of Microsoft Windows Bridgewater State College IBook Mac OS X Oscilloscope Graphics card Computer terminal Atari 8-bit family Computer bus Commodore 64 Apple Remote Desktop Stardock Microprocessor Amiga ZX Spectrum Hard disk Floppy disk The Inside PlayStation 2 Touchpad Internet Apple IIGS Kaypro Tablet PC Liquid crystal display IBM PC PC Engine Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer display Amstrad CPC Commodore International AmigaOS Computer wallpaper Apple II family ThinkPad Wearable computer Cyberspace Windows Server 2003 Wi-Fi KVM switch VAIO Jumpstart 3rd Grade Commodore 128 OS/2 Macintosh Portable PCI Express IPAQ S-Video X Window System protocols and architecture Otakon Power Macintosh G3 TRS-80 Acorn Computers HP Pavilion Radeon PLATO Computer and video game genres PowerBook Duo Sega Saturn SUSE Linux AlphaSmart Color Graphics Adapter Virtual desktop EMachines Common Unix Printing System Xbox 360
