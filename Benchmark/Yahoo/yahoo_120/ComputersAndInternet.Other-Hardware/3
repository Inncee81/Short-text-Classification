where's the radeon x xt gone to i cannot seem to find the radeon x xt video card nowadays on the production line ups of gpu manufacturers it's specs are good mainstream to performance specs has pixel pipelines and has mb bit memory what i've read and seen on several benchmaks and performance ratings on venerated websites gamespot tom's hardware gpureview com etc the x xt performs well it even beats nvidia's gt performance wise did they stop producing this video card in the market what happened in pc magazines the x xt cannot be found for retail distribution if what i've heared and concluded is true did the x series took over the x series well unfortunately yes the did discontinue this model due to the x series i agree with you on the preformance of the x xt but ati has the tendency to make a new model that may not be better but replace an older one just so they can compete with nvidia's continuous products for example just like your situation there was the x that was replaced by the x after some research i found little and no difference one just has vista certified on it the x xt and the x are similar to this if you plan on buying the x xt or x i would recomend you not if you are one of those i need more graphic card power guys then i would recomend the powerful but overpriced nvidia ultra i've been a fan of ati but due to the latest benchmarks i think ati has gone down the ultra is top of the line and does fantastic for gaming and multimedia ati's oponent the hd is still a great card with preformance a little less good than the ultra ati though made a stupid card it uses alot more power than nvidia cards and is louder in conclusion the x xt was a great card but thanks to ati it was scrapped the ultra is a good card for now but it is overpriced the ati hd just sucks for that price cause it not worth it the x is ok if you want a decent card for a good price that will do most of todays applications these results were all based by my cole summers testing corp these cards have been tested by me based of fear need for speed carbon c c ghost recon advanced warfighter adobe cs unlead studios and all runing vista and xp hope this helps comp expert cole summers 3dfx IMac GeForce 2 GeForce Apple Macintosh Windows Vista Counter-Strike PlayStation 3 GeForce 3 OpenGL Graphics card Xbox Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Revolution GeForce 7 Series Xbox 360 Overclocking IBM PC compatible DDR2 SDRAM Doom 3 Vertex and pixel shaders PowerVR Graphics processing unit GeForce 256 AMD Nintendo 64 Scalable Link Interface Nintendo History of Microsoft Windows TurboGrafx 16 Shader Sound Blaster Microsoft ZX Spectrum Digital photography EMac High-definition television Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon VIA Technologies Amiga RISC Computer and video games The Sims 2 S3 Savage Timeline of computing 1990-forward Atari ST Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Apple Computer Game Boy Advance Atari 8-bit family Sega Dreamcast Teletext PlayStation 2 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Commodore 64 CPU cache ThinkPad Hard disk PlayStation Portable Topps First-person shooter Sears Holdings Corporation Sega CD Dawn (demo) NForce Universal Serial Bus Silicon Graphics NForce2 History of computer and video games Benchmark (computing) DVD Computer and video game industry CPU design Modem Game programming Microsoft Windows Pentium 4 The Price Is Right PowerBook G4 Internet fraud Microeconomics Floppy disk M16 (rifle) Nintendo Entertainment System Apple II family DirectX TRS-80 Mainframe computer Panavision
