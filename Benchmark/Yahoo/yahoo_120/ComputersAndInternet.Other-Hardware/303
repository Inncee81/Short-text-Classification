a good cpu what make a good cpu when you look at their specifications at this time speed is no longer an issue the reason being is that cpu manufacturers have hit a wall in their ability to make even faster cpus reason being is because of the size of the cpu itself the board they make has gotten so small that the electrical paths are so close together yet so tiny they are interfering with each other a smaller sized cpu would result in a faster performance because the electrons would have travel less distance but since we are at that wall no faster cpus are forthcoming for a while reason being is because they just can't get the tiny connections any closer these connections are a lot smaller than one of your hairs cpus are currently at the end of third generation i do not know when the fourth generation will arrive but till then the manufacturers are tweaking with what they have now that is why you are now seeing dual and quad core cpus just more tweaks to get more performance out of the same older tech to keep sales going until fourth gen can arrive bit cpus are out there which do perform much better than bit but not too much software has been written for bit cpus so if you are a gamer best to stay with bit cpus for now best to get the dual core bits ones with a large level cache this level cache is a memory storage for the cpu on frequently used commands it is extremely high speed because it sits on the cpu thus not having to fetch those store commands from main memory which is about times slower level cache is also expensive bus speed is also something to consider the faster the better intel's is faster but amd processors tend to be faster and use more electricity on the other side intel's faster bus has bugs in it at this time and people are having to reduce bus speeds on their mother boards because of those bugs general rule is that if it costs more it performs better Computer Celeron Microprocessor 64-bit PowerPC Pentium 4 AMD Cache Athlon Microprogram Compiler optimization MIPS architecture IBM PC compatible VIA C3 Cyrix PlayStation 2 Dual-core IBM PC Redundant array of independent disks Clock rate Virtual memory CDC 6600 Branch predictor PDP-11 Opteron Cray-1 Motorola 68000 AMD K6-2 INMOS Transputer Cell (microprocessor) X86 NVIDIA Computer bus Xeon ARM architecture Pentium D Drill bit Moore's law Intel 3dfx Atari 8-bit family Mach kernel AMD K6-III Radeon Dynamic random access memory Digital circuit VIA Technologies Computer workstation Overclocking Integrated circuit NX bit GeForce 6 Series Commodore 64 Pentium M Intel iAPX 432 Hash table Memory (computers) ZX Spectrum Field-programmable gate array Supercomputer Radiation hardening Atari ST MOS Technology 6502 PC motherboard Pentium Pro Laptop Data General Nova Pentium II Sega Saturn Hard disk HyperTransport Buffer overflow History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Athlon 64 Quicksort Xbox 360 Tandem Computers PlayStation 3 TRS-80 Register renaming Sinclair ZX81 Personal computer Computer architecture Wintel Nintendo Revolution Xbox
