can cm punk john morrison revive ecw's glory days wow after watching ecw the main event match between cm punk john morrison was unbelievable it nearly gave me a heart attack it has my nomination for match of the year so my question to u is this can cm punk john morrison revive ecw's glory days or any other superstars in the ecw roster who're also capable of it your thoughts unfortunately no its not that they don't have the ability its the wateredown product ecw in its glory days was not about wrestling it was about extreme wrestling weapons going to the brink death defying moves blood violence with all that has happened in the world and the possibly injuries that could occur wwe does not want to bring back this style of wrestling the other important thing that made ecw was the fans these fans were not only die hard fans they were knowledgable they appreaciated each and every move each and every stunt and knew exactly what was going on it was like a family the current ecw is just a lesser smackdown still a huge arena that isn't filled to capacity with for the most part younger fans or guys just there to watch wrestling with little knowledge of the business ECW One Night Stand World Wrestling Entertainment Kurt Angle Extreme Championship Wrestling Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling slang Scott Levy WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
