no pyro techs cheep show here s my take did anyone record because i only got a quick look at vince s son good ratings because of hype weak show what happened to the pyro tecks cena had none kennedy is story lining something involving vince bigger than gm irs behind irs was a great seconds watch him legalize something for vince he was played as legally smart before with a six million dollar man connection de be osy cena's ok with me i hate orton so i liked vince is in a bind so his parts were ok the diva sings eaaa booker t gotta fight not talk cutout the king stuff the rest of the show was a waste again i found the angle wish i recorded vince says keep smiling at two unknown wrestlers before his exit unsure maybe twins but at least one is connected to be his kid i bet the first half of nickname is already genetic i think vince's in real trouble and will lose but the last time i was thinking same and he beat the wrap proved me wrong question is rewind and see if vince says keep on smiling to only one of the two youngsters he said keep on smiling to paul london because when vince was walking backstage to his limo in a similar fashion a few months ago when the limo explosion occurred paul london was the only one smiling while everyone else was looking at mr mcmahon with concerned confused looks on their faces so he was just referring to what happened the night of his death and by the way you did not get a look at vince's son since i seriously doubt his illegitimate child will turn out to be paul london Shawn Michaels Vince McMahon Hulk Hogan Mark Calaway Paul Levesque Kurt Angle Chris Jericho John Cena Eddie Guerrero Stone Cold Steve Austin Professional wrestling match types Paul Wight Ric Flair WWE RAW Trish Stratus Professional wrestling throws World Championship Wrestling XFL Booker Huffman Eric Bischoff Chris Benoit Royal Rumble The Rock (entertainer) Extreme Championship Wrestling NWo Stephanie McMahon-Levesque Bret Hart John Layfield WrestleMania XX WWE No Mercy ECW One Night Stand Virgil Runnels III Montreal Screwjob Roddy Piper Taboo Tuesday World Wrestling Entertainment Glen Jacobs Poker jargon SummerSlam Suplex Page Falkenberg Sin City WWE Homecoming Shane McMahon Shoot (professional wrestling) A.J.
