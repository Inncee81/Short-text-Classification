if cena loses the belt at summerslam do think the wwe will get better i sure hope it does oh yea it should get better but if he cena wins he should lose it to triple h then triple h can be the champ of wwe but would be good match to see if cena wins but it would be better to see orton win the tittle and lose it to triple h and then some then later on in the year see triple h lose the tittle to hbk or stone cold steve austin or anyone else but i really doubt that stone cold will come back that chicken shit wrestler i like him but have not seen him wrestle in a long time but it be cool to see hhh be the champ for a change instead of cena cena is alright but i want to see him lose the tittle i get tired of seeing him winning over and over again it gets old i think the wwe would get a little better if cena loses his wwe tittle it would be a hell of better to see a new champ rise and kick ass cena is alright but he should just lose the tittle and shoot for world champoinship tittle after whoever wins out of khali and batista i think it be better if batista would win because i want see him and cena toe to toe in a hell in the cell match or better yet a standing ten count match where theres no pins or sumbmissions but that sounds kind of cheesey to me i don't know gimme your thought about it but i think it would be better for wwe to see cena loses his tittle to orton even though i don't like the guy but at times iike him like when he hurt slaughter the other week i got a kick off that i think it make the wwe better if cena lost his tittle to orton better yet if orton kicked cena in the face like he did the rest of the wwe wrestlers ha WWE Unforgiven WrestleMania XX WWE Championship WWE Vengeance Glen Jacobs World Heavyweight Championship Taboo Tuesday Evolution (professional wrestling) Randy Orton Ric Flair WWE RAW Mick Foley Hulk Hogan Royal Rumble Carly Colon The Rock (entertainer) Roddy Piper WWE No Way Out Booker Huffman Paul Wight Professional wrestling throws WrestleMania World Wrestling Entertainment WWE Armageddon WWE Backlash WWE Homecoming Leon White Survivor Series Bret Hart Bill Goldberg Professional wrestling match types Jim Ross Solofa Fatu Adam Copeland WWE Judgment Day Music in professional wrestling Professional wrestling slang King of the Ring Suplex In Your House NWo Montreal Screwjob Chris Benoit WWE Draft Brock Lesnar WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
