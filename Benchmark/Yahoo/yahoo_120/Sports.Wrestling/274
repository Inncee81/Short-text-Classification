interesting idea for smackdown vs raw i understand this isn't that important but it's a thought anyway have sandman's entrance music as enter sandman like it was in the original ecw even if they could get motorhead's cover of the song what do you think in the original ecw sandman's theme was in fact metallica's enter sandman go to hell monica since this is realistically the only time that sandman will be in a wwe game i would suggest that it makes sense to do the origional sandman as opposed to this sad watered down version that we get today have him come with the beer and the cigarette and the kendo stick like he used to ECW One Night Stand Jim Fullington Professional wrestling match types Extreme Championship Wrestling Music in professional wrestling WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
