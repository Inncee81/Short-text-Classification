is it true that anti wrestling fans have nothing better to do obviously it is true that anti wrestling fans have nothing better to do than worry about why wrestling fans watch wrestling i have yet to see a pro wrestling fan say that its real and what the outcome is is legitamite we all know that the wrestlers are working from a script we all know that the majority of the hits and punches are not as devastating as the wrestlers would have us believe i do want you anti wrestling fans to take a metal folding chair and have someone smash it over your head or back and tell me thats not real you do not see metal folding chairs used all the time and the reason being is that there is a very real possiblity that you can get injured and badly it has been said that it is nothing new that a few wrestlers after they are finished with their match have broken fingers or some other legit injury i find it funny that the only people who keep saying that prowrestling isnt real are the anti wrestling fans this is a rant and not a question also yes i know all about the prowrestling websites i never stated that i liked ufc or anything of the kind i personally do not care for ufc or mma my own personal opinion i find that to be nothing more than glorified boxing that is my opinion and i mean no disrespect to those that like ufc mma events oh and rated r for retarded if you dont like it you didnt need to post a comment on here then so bugger off whoa whoa whoa i never stated that wrestling isnt fake i know that they go from a script and i have known that for quite some time and obviously dustin b has a mad on for the matrix triliogy if he finds the need to put what i have said in the same context as those films i agree with you if wrestling's so fake then why don't all the people who believe so get in the ring themselves they need to realize that the wrestlers that get in that ring every week are sacrificing their health for something that they have such low regard for if wrestling was so fake then why are wrestlers constantly suffering from major injuries and some even dying the anti wrestling dumbasses need to realize that and they need to shutup i am so sick of them coming onto this section just to complain about wrestling i have something to say to all the people on here that hate wrestling get a life if you don't like wrestling no one said you had to watch it no one said you had to like it or write about it you are all just pathetic losers with nothing better to do than criticize something you know nothing about yes i ranted too i am just sooo sick of the people that hate wrestling that come on here i'm not saying they have to like it but if they don't why can't they stay off here and let the real wrestling fans talk Mixed martial arts Professional wrestling slang Professional wrestling Ultimate Fighting Championship Kurt Angle Professional wrestling holds World Championship Wrestling Glen Jacobs Eddie Guerrero Professional wrestling attacks Vince McMahon Paul Levesque Leon White Mark Calaway World Wrestling Entertainment Professional wrestling match types Adam Copeland Bret Hart Amy Dumas Shoot (professional wrestling) World Class Championship Wrestling Stone Cold Steve Austin Martial art Nelson Erazo Montreal Screwjob Richard Vigneault Lawrence Whistler Hulk Hogan John Cena Paul Wight Extreme Championship Wrestling The Best Page in the Universe Professional wrestling throws Page Falkenberg Matt Hardy Pro Wrestling Illustrated Warrior (wrestler) Antonio Inoki Ric Flair Lex Luger Wrestling Ted DiBiase Botch (professional wrestling) Ron and Fez Roddy Piper Mick Foley Greg Valentine Nick Dinsmore Harley Race Randy Savage Scott Levy Carly Colon A.J.
