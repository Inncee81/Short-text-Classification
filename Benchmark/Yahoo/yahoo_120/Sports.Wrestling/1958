if you were or could be a wrestler what kind would you be high flyer power technical submission artist well rounded also who would you have for a manager or would you even have one what would you use for a finisher any other pertinent info feel free to write lol ok dude soyou would be arn anderson huh lol no thanks ls i have been dropped on my head enough oh yeah i would be more of a power guy because of my size i would mix in a little technical in too though actualy i think i would be well rounded i would have bobby heenan or j j dillon as a manager my finisher would be a jack knife powerbomb called lights out over broadway or the back cracker which would be a spine buster like my boy aa arn anderson i would use the nagata lock i just recently found out that hurts like hell to tap my opponents thats not lame at all kenneth uh diva wow wow diva how can anyone ompete with that i'll try my best lol nick name diva dominator wrestling gear i would wear something like what either mickie melina trish wear or maybe something like what lita wore in team extreme i'd most likely have it like melina's but i'd add abit of flavour to it i would have tribal patterns like randy's and they would be going down the side of my legs on my top and like what randy has on his gear at the back where he has his name orton i would have diva dominator written on my ss lol in a tribal font all the tribals will be green and the rest will probably be black kind of a dx style lol favourite type of match anything extreme tlc last man or in my case last women standing elimination chamber steel cgae stretcher match extreme rules match ladder match and defiantly first blood match ect also the royal rumble would be awesome yeah i know divas don't really fight in these matches but that will all change once i get into the wwe lol wrestling style power brawler i would be the diva that does all the powerslams powerbombs spine buster anderson style lol and unique moves such as rko stnna spear goldberg style etc rarely i would jump off the top rope but if i did i wouldn't go luchadore style i would use moves like cross body frog splash etc technical and old school moves are what i would also use but i'd stick to power brawler i'd also has a submission like sharpshooter so i guess i would be well rounded but power brawler is more my style theme song i know you hate them lol but i would have 'rollin' by limp bizkit you get so pumped up and you can get the crowd reallly into it it's a loud fun and energetic song it sort of explains me loud fun and energetic i can just imagine all the pyro going off with that song it would be crazy lol i took this bit from your other question that i answered finisher my created move is called revolution' or either 'check mate ' it's like a combination of f and rko first you put your opponent on your shoulders like f then while still holding your opponents head you spin them around in the air and before your opponent hits the floor you jump up in the air and hit them with the rko it's kind of hard to understand but it's a really cool move hometown i'm from australia but i would love to resign from either texas or missouri lol where randy and hbk are from gimmick i would be bad ss dominant heel i would be the kind of diva that no one would want to mess with and i will never ever tap out i wouldn't be anything either than a heel they just have the most fun as weird as this may seen i would love to be the one to get the hell booed out of me lol but i would also get cheered whenever i had a really good match or if i ever won a title i'd be like the less scarier and girl version of the undertaker he's someone who everyone looks upto and that's what i'd love to be like a role model to all even though i'm a heel even though the fans may hate my guts which would be awesome in a weird kind of way lol my wrestling ability gets me the respect from the fans brand raw it's the a brand it's got the best women's division it the brand that owns the wwe women's championship which brings me to my next question championship the wwe women's championship of coarse it's a life long dream and just to hold that title i would have fulfilled one part of my dream and what diva said about the tag team titles i'd pick her to be my tag team partner in a heart beat and i'd love to have you as our manager if that is ok with you though because i know you stand alone and that's when we can be called global domination remember that's what diva said in one of your questions manager hbk or randy if i turned face it would be hbk and i would learn so much from the showstooper as a heel it would be randy and he could give me alot of pointers in being so good at being bad lol but because they have got so much talent that's the main reason why i would pick them quote saying my accomplishments are endless lol yes i would have an ego and you're either with me or against me team me randy edge and hbk we would all be heels and we would be stylin' and profil'n like evolution we would be dangerous at all time and we would make impact everywhere we go ecw sd raw and eventually start a war with tna feud i'd love to have a feud with the diva that has been my main inspiration and my role model lita she kicks ss and i would love to fight her for the women's title at a wm dreams do come true great great question hollywood starred my fingers are on fire now lol
