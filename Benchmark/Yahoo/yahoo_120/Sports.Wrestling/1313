mask vs mask ultimo dragon vs rey mysterio loser has to remove their mask these two together can go all night long but i dont really think that the match would have much meaning to it if you think about it since rey rey has lost his mask once and unmasked not long ago for eddie guerrero during the tribute show the fans know what to expect from him he would have to win the match and that would take the anticipation away from it i believe from a fans perspective if dragon won the match then it would be meaningless cause rey rey would have lost his mask again and the fans wouldnt care about it but i would love to see the match after all that and my money would be on rey rey Eddie Guerrero Oscar Gutierrez WrestleMania XX Lucha libre StarrCade Chris Jericho The Great American Bash Professional wrestling match types WCW World War 3 Charles Ashenoff El Hijo del Santo SummerSlam Matt Hardy Fall Brawl WWE Judgment Day Clash of Champions Carly Colon Dionicio Castellanos Chris Benoit Dean Simon Bash At The Beach WWE No Mercy WWE No Way Out WWE Vengeance David Bautista Hulk Hogan SuperBrawl Professional wrestling aerial techniques Road Wild WWE Cruiserweight Championship Halloween Havoc Adam Copeland Adolfo Tapia Mark Calaway Yoshihiro Tajiri WWE Armageddon Taboo Tuesday Slamboree Chris Scoville WrestleMania 21 PWI Years WWE Unforgiven Uncensored Kurt Angle WWE Tag Team Championship World Championship Wrestling ECW One Night Stand WWE Backlash Paul Heyman Jos__ Luis Jair Soria WrestleMania XIX Rammstein Rob Van Dam Breath of Fire III Survivor Series Souled Out WWE Homecoming Nelson Erazo Art Barr NWo Los Conquistadores (professional wrestling) Music in professional wrestling Spring Stampede Professional wrestling slang Glen Jacobs Paul Wight Insane Clown Posse Professional wrestling holds Rei Ayanami Eric Bischoff Suplex Rob Conway King (Tekken) The Mexicools YuYu Hakusho A.J.
