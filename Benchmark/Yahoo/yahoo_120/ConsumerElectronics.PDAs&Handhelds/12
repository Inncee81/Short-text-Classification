is the at t blackjack worth it my dad doesn't see a point in me getting a blackjack especially since i wont be allowed any internet capabilities i understand that the online aspect is important if you want a blackjack but are the redeeming qualities that good such as microsoft windows for phones or windows media player plus video and pictures and texting with the qwerty pad and i've heard nothing bad about calling quality i all seems worth it even without the internet am i wrong and if so why i was just recently going to upgrade to one of those i wanted mp player and a better camera video phone i was going to get one of those for dollars after mail in rebates but in order to get it for instead of dollars i would have had to sign an additional a month for two years for data contract but instead i got a samsung sync for dollars and it is good much better camera mega pixels and you have to buy a small micro sd for music and storage but so far i love it one other important thing about the blackjack is its not insurable for damages that means if you break it you buy another one but i would only buy one if i was in to business one other thing you have to consider is that if you are not too much in to roller balls on the face of the phone its hard to navigate the screens as well for programs you have to have fairly small fingers but thats my opinion good luck Blackjack Digital photography IPod Mouse (computing) BlackBerry Windows Mobile Palm OS Windows XP Floppy disk ITunes High-definition television Nintendo Pixel Microsoft Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis ITunes Music Store Creative Zen Computer and video games Danger Hiptop Windows Vista Craps Commodore 64 Xbox 360 Neopets Intellivision Verizon Wireless Atari 8-bit family Mobile phone XML Atari ST Game show Super Nintendo Entertainment System Acorn Electron Gmail IBM PC compatible Game Boy Advance Nintendo DS Xbox Apple II family Copy protection Game Boy History of computer and video games Digital camera File Allocation Table Sinclair ZX81 ATI Technologies Nintendo 64 Hard disk Sega Handheld game console Television Microsoft Office Linux HyperCard Enterprise content management Microsoft Windows Windows 2000 Movie projector Vorbis Wheel of Fortune QuickTime Stereoscopy The Amazing Race Video Blog Screenshot Game programming Digital rights management Macromedia Flash Computer and video game genres PlayStation 3 Microeconomics Nintendo GameCube Winning Streak Orders of magnitude (data) Need for Speed DVD Skype Jumpstart 3rd Grade Final Fantasy XI Oscilloscope Cable television Poker jargon Hearing impairment Smartphone Mac OS X v10.4 ZX Spectrum H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Broadband Internet access TiVo Modem
