how can i write with a metallic caligraphy pen i have two and i have never been able to write with them i have the ink and stuff and i dip it in there but i just seem to scrape the paper what am i doing wrong it can be quite difficult to start with if you are beginner try and start with the largest nib you have assuming that you have pens with interchangeable nibs don't dip the pen into the ink because that is a way of overloading the nib and getting blobs use a brush to put some ink in behind the nib shake it gently when you put the nib to the paper wriggle it around a little until the ink starts to flow it can be quite frustrating until then i understand completely Fountain pen Ballpoint pen Dip pen Pen and ink Calligraphy Tattoo Ink Pen Shodo Mimeograph machine Writing Invisible ink Milton H.
