what should i draw i like to draw and i need a subject preferrebly not a person because i'm not so good at people just an object and i do draw sunsets and paint them all the time i guess i mean something symbolic like keys and hearts i don't know but all suggestions are welcome and also i am good at people it's just the hands i can't get and i practice all the time i just can't get the hands here's an idea get black paper and white chalk and draw a still object backwards instead of drawing shadows draw its highlights it's fun art doesn't have to be constricted it's not a boxed skill even if you can't draw hands you can draw a person and for his her hands draw tree branches or something just do what you feel Drawing Art Tag Milton H.
