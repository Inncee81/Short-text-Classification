which is better nintendo wii or playstation i want to get one but i dont know which one i should get help please give me good reasons thanks although i'm entirely biased towards nintendo and i hate sony i'll try to make a point for both sides wii pros new innovative controller classic titles such as mario and zelda only internet browser built in forecast channel news channel you can buy old nes snes n genesis games in vc image viewer mp player from sd cards cons poor graphics compared to xb and ps mhz cpu i think somethin mhz ati gpu but still really good no hdtv no homebrew options yet so you can't use linux or an alternative os like you can with ps you need to put the sensor bar on your tv no dvd cd playback ps pros huge graphics and cpu power cell chip motion sensitive controller but not as innovative as the wiimote in terms of usefulness of the motion sensor homebrew options include alternate os you can install ubuntu linux which i'm using now on my laptop plays dvd cd wii does not yet no need of a sensor bar hdtv cons not as innovative doesn't have the motion and pointing capability of the wiimote no rumble pack expensive i've heard there aren't too many good games for it sony branded p that's up to you whether or not it's a pro or con system specs aside the wii is for nintendo fans who want to play the latest sequels of their favorite series i've just been playing legend of zelda twilight princess and it is amazing but if you don't like zelda you might not want it i'd never played a zelda game before tp though and i now love the series ps is for more of the hardcore gamer whatever that could possibly mean i guess it's for the graphics people who think the same old same old games with intensely better hdtv resolution graphics are great i definitely say get a wii but if you like the stuff ps has to offer save up your money it might be a while before you can either afford it the price comes down no one really needs a blu ray drive anyways Sega Dreamcast Video game music Nintendo DS Xbox 360 The Legend of Zelda series Radeon History of computer and video games Game Boy Advance Computer and video games Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Saturn Nintendo Entertainment System TurboGrafx 16 Apple Macintosh High-definition television The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Rare (video game company) Handheld game console The Legend of Zelda Game controller Final Fantasy NVIDIA Windows Vista IMac The Sims 2 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Gradius GeForce 6 Series FIFA Series CD-i History of video games (Sixth generation era) PowerBook Atari 8-bit family Cell (microprocessor) Intellivision Zelda II: The Adventure of Link PowerPC Laptop PC Engine Nintendo Power History of video games (16-bit era) IBM PC compatible Princess Zelda Mouse (computing) Windows XP The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Super Mario remake series N-Gage Counter-Strike IPod Nintendo Virtual Boy Game Boy Atari 2600 Link (Legend of Zelda) The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Console game First-person shooter Sony Computer Entertainment Console wars Action Replay Graphics processing unit Super Smash Bros.
