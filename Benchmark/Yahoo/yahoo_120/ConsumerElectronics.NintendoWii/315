where can i buy the wii zapper i bought resident evil today and the guy working said they had released the zapper shell and it was selling online for about but i cant find it anywhere the wii zapper itself is not for sale yet however if you look on amazon com they are selling things that are very very similar to the wii zapper they're pretty much identical operate in the same manner but they don't have the wii logo on it nor the warantee from the manufacturers i would suggest looking on amazon first if they don't have it there you can always check ebay they sell different varieties including rifles pistols and a machine gun type set up make sure you get the one that holds both the remote and nunchuck and not just the remote the one that holds both is the one that is most similar to the real wii zapper Superior Defender Gundam Force Amazon.com Airsoft Nintendo Machine gun Cartridge (firearms) NES Zapper Federal assault weapons ban Light gun Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando Trademark M60 machine gun Team Fortress Classic Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Handloading Internet fraud Super Nintendo Entertainment System Electronic commerce Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bulk vending Marathon (computer game) Embedded system Submachine gun Sega Dreamcast .22 Long Rifle Krag-J__rgensen Starsiege: Tribes Nine Inch Nails Resident Evil 4 GoldenEye The Star Wars Holiday Special PlayStation 2 MAME Counter-Strike Bullet Auction GLOCK Modem Google ROM image Assault rifle Gun politics IBM PC compatible Shotgun Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Entertainment System Mutual fund Firearm Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Windows XP Commodore International Mozilla Firefox Star Trek Customizable Card Game Cigarette Colt's Manufacturing Company Apple Macintosh Sun Microsystems Amiga Turok: Dinosaur Hunter Unreal Trigun characters Internal ballistics Carbine Battlefield 2 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Electric guitar Beretta 92F/FS RX-78 mobile suit series TimeSplitters: Future Perfect Monopoly (game) Perry Rhodan Sonic the Hedgehog Compact audio cassette Armia Krajowa Heckler & Koch G3 Rifle .357 SIG SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Dot-com Windows 3.x M82 (rifle) Grand Theft Auto III Birmingham Small Arms Company Enigma machine Punisher Personal weapon Family Guy Windows 2000 BMW Live 8 M16 (rifle) Discus (fish) Timeline of computing 1990-forward Common Lisp GunZ The Duel Battlefield Vietnam Tribes Aerial Assault Beltway sniper attacks Kammerlader
