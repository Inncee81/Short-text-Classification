wired nintendo wii connection i want to know if i have a wired connection for my wii do i need to plug the wire into my laptop if not where else can i plug it in i assume you're trying to use wiiconnect with your wii there is a method in which you can hook your wii up to your laptop however it requires a lan adapter you plug it into your wii then plug the ethernet cable into your router i assume you must have high speed internet because dialup just will not work i don't think plugging it into your laptop will do you any good if you have a wireless router you don't have to hook it up to anything and you don't need the lan adapter but like i said you have to have wireless internet for that to work good luck Wireless LAN Wi-Fi Universal Serial Bus Router Ethernet Bluetooth Local area network IEEE 802.11 Cisco Systems Digital Subscriber Line Game Boy Advance Wireless access point MAC address HomePNA Nintendo DS AppleTalk Laptop Broadband Internet access Internet service provider Telegraphy Nintendo GameCube TIA-568A/B WiMAX Computer bus Domestic AC power plugs and sockets AirPort Computer network Power line communication Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 Modem Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Seismometer Multiplayer Internet Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Password LAN party Spark plug Secure Digital card Dial-up access PCI Express Cable television Asynchronous Transfer Mode Wireless Quality of service Registered jack Mobile ad-hoc network 3Com Corporation 10-gigabit Ethernet Sega Dreamcast Quake Internet protocol suite PowerPC IPod HyperTransport Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Jack plug ALOHAnet Windows XP Telephone exchange Category 5 cable Telephone Hotspot (wifi) Extensible Authentication Protocol Transmission Control Protocol Musical Instrument Digital Interface Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Broadcom Serial communications Game Boy Token ring Fiber distributed data interface USB flash drive Adapter BS 1363 SCART General Packet Radio Service Overhead lines Personal computer Power over Ethernet 9-1-1 Nintendo Computer Desktop computer Transmission line Television Internet Group Management Protocol Internet cafe FireWire Wardriving Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Personal area network Electrical wiring Denial-of-service attack Battery electric vehicle
