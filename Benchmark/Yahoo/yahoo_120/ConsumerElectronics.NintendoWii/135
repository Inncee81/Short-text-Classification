hi has anyone played resident evil on original gamecube before if you have please answer my question ok there is a question in the beginning of the game the question is which best describes your opinion about games i mountain climbing beyond the hardships lies accomplishment ii hiking the destination can be reached rather comfortably ok the questions are they a trick questions please let me know also one more thing when i kill a zombie why does the same zombie comes back to live becomes more damn power scary what is the best way to kill the zombie for good do i blow the heads off thanks guys ladies mountain climbing sets the game to hard mode hiking sets it in easy mode and they come back to life like that because they are the prestage of the licker if you have ever played resident evil or seen the resident evil movie the licker is the thing with the long tongue well after the zombie dies it turns into a crimson head with long nails and super speed and ven though the game does not show this after a crimson head dies it mutates into a licker interesting huh it is the evolutionary pattern of the t virus and there is no way to kill a zombie for good because they willjust wake up fierce and quick so just try to shoot them and when they fall run past them there is a chance it did not die and is best to keep them that way better to run into a zombie than a crimson head right lol Resident Evil (film) Resident Evil (video game) Resident Evil Blood (computer game) Resident Evil 2 Paul W.
