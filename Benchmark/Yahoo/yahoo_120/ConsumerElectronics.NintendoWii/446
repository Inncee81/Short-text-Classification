is sonic the hedghog going to be on super smash bros brawl i keep hearing different stories and i am wanting to find out for certain if sonic was on there then i would definetly be buying the game if not i am still not sure what to expect for the nintendo wii sonic has not been confirmed to be in super smash bros brawl but neither have most shoo in characters as of now it is extremely extremely likely that he will be in the game probably about a chance if i had to put a percentage on it many sites such as ign will agree with me if you need to look it up the owners of sonic have gotten very friendly with nintendo and were very intent on having sonic in the game another reason that further confirms that sonic will be playable in brawl is the upcoming wii game sonic and mario olympics not positive on the title its close to that at least this game will feature mario and sonic together in one game this makes it a very reasonable assumption that if mario and sonic are main characters together in one game that sonic would also be featured in brawl as well to help promote the olympics game sonic was also the fan requested character for ssbb and nintendo has stated that they will strongly base character inclusions on what the fans want the most to sum it up the game should be one of the best of its time with or without sonic with that said sonic is extremely likely to be included in brawl and i highly recommend purchasing this game check http smashbros com for updates every weekday if sonic is confirmed this will probably be the first place you will hear about it Nintendo Revolution Super Mario 64 Super Mario 128 Mario Super Smash Bros.
