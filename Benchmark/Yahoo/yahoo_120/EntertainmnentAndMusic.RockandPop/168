mcr haters why ok i admit im an obsessive mcr freak but im fed up of having people call me emo and saying all this crap about mcr if people arent into their music fine i dont care but what i do care about is people who diss them and without a real reason a lot of them have never listened to mcr but why what did mcr do to them thats made them so hated i dont get it good question when you ask a question on yahoo answers and state 'mcr haters dont bother answering' they still answer saying they hate them ok i know just cos i love them not everyone is going to love them people have different opinions but come on what makes them that bad that makes people hate them mcr have clearly stated in an interview that they are not emo and even if they were so what if anything they are alternative rock they are a band with real musical talent and they write their own songs so why diss them for that if i could play the guitar like ray toro or sing like gerard way or play the drums like bob bryar then id be happy you have got to respect them for that personally i think their music is really insprirational their music isnt like heavy metal or grunge its pure rock i dont care what anyone thinks i love their music and i cant wait to see them in november cos they are also brilliant live Grunge music Nine Inch Nails Emo Rock (music) Heavy metal music Jennifer Lopez Music history of the United States Atomic Kitten Blur Pop punk Popular music Nirvana (band) Time Out of Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show The Smashing Pumpkins Samples of music from the United States Liam Gallagher Pearl Jam Hip hop rivalries Gothic rock Dave Grohl Judas Priest Love and Theft Country music Avenue Q Primus (band) Art rock The Used Journey (band) Napalm Death Gothic metal Manic Street Preachers Music history of the United States (1980s to the present) Alternative rock Bruce Dickinson Guns N' Roses Music of Washington The Clash Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Indie rock Kraftwerk Iron Maiden The Band Rich Mullins Kurt Cobain Blonde on Blonde Deftones Van Halen Sonic Youth AFI (band) Bee Gees System of a Down Music genre Lostprophets Stone Temple Pilots Metal music Hardcore punk Tom Waits Bad Brains Theory of conduct Nas (rapper) Donovan 50 Cent Pixies Scorpions (band) Metallica Britpop Sampling (music) Def Leppard H__sker D__ Bad Religion King Crimson The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Avril Lavigne Good Charlotte Selling out Faith No More Collective Soul Music of Arizona Antichrist Superstar The Monks Black Sabbath Rush (band) The Isley Brothers AC/DC Current teachings of Prem Rawat KISS (band) Social rule High school subcultures American popular music New Order R.E.M.
