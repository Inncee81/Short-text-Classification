how do i turn on sap on my tv i have a sony tv no cable anything else i should add there are really only ways to turn the sap on for a channel that has it available there may be a button on the remote that is labeled sap so pressing that should work right away if pressing it doesn't change anything you may be watching a program that is not being broadcast with sap you may have to access the tv's menu and search around for the sap option there if turning it on doesn't work that way it may be for the same reason as listed in above hope that helps PlayStation Portable Windows XP Bluetooth Ethernet PlayStation 2 Gmail Cable television Xbox 360 Vision mixer Mouse (computing) Gradius IPod Macromedia Flash Hello world program Palm OS Danger Hiptop Embedded system Screenshot Windows Vista Nintendo Revolution AmigaOS Television syndication Radio Floppy disk Slot machine Resident Evil 2 Photography Remote control SAS System Federal Standard 1037C BBC EastEnders Poker jargon DVD ABS-CBN Taskbar Windows 2000 Mozilla Firefox GameFAQs Nintendo DS Game controller Option key System/34 Software patent debate CBS Ecco the Dolphin The Daily Show Classified information Nintendo GameCube System/36 MTV Control Panel (Windows) Common User Access Search engine optimization Nintendo Entertainment System Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Discovery Channel Common Unix Printing System DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Television in the United States American Broadcasting Company DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution CFTO Friends Resident Evil (video game) Computer and video games Super Smash Bros.
