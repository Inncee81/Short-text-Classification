my lcd wide screen has devoloped blue spots at the top corners of my screen what is going on well i dont think its dead pixels cause it would just be one spot and not biger areas like the top corners like you say and its not speakers thats only with tube crt tvs and its not your lamp dying i think its i minor adjustment with your lens or the mirror in the back of the tv im leaning towards the mirror thats at the back of the tv the light engine projects the image onto the mirror then reflects it to the screen any way you have to have a technician do any work on it and they will give you a definite answer im not a technician but i do know a little about tvs a technician in here might be able to answer your question better but you would still need a tech to fix it good luck Television Liquid crystal display Plasma display Light-emitting diode Stereoscopy DLP Canon T90 Pixel Cathode ray tube Digital photography Liquid crystal display television IMac Movie projector Stage lighting Eye Color Nintendo DS Lighting Gamut Computer display Reflecting telescope Screensaver Cinerama Oscilloscope Widescreen Digital projector Intellivision Game Boy Single-lens reflex camera Binoculars Technicolor Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting View camera Projection screen Mirror Leica LCD projector Mechanical television Anamorphic widescreen PlayStation Portable TFT LCD Digital camera Danger Hiptop Telescope Eyepiece Vectrex Light gun Atari 8-bit family PowerBook Enlarger RGB color model Carburetor Interlace Lens (optics) Autostereogram Head-Up Display Amateur telescope making Camera Head-mounted display Zoom lens IMAX Photographic lens Photography GunBound Contrast ratio Holography Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Map Parallax Interferometry Hubble Space Telescope Optical telescope Wearable computer Frontlight Original Amiga chipset Ray tracing Super Nintendo Entertainment System Confocal laser scanning microscopy Contax Windows XP Digital single-lens reflex cameras Microscope Polarized glasses Film Digital Visual Interface Laptop Fishfinder RuneScape Random Events Rendering (computer graphics) Sextant Galileo spacecraft Laser engraving Headlight Xbox 360 Thermostat Bicycle lighting Shadow mask Double-slit experiment Car handling Mirror galvanometer
