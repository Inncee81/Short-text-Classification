i just watched on blu ray last night on a hd tv and was wondering whats the deal with blu ray and hd dvd's i could not notice a real difference in the picture compred to dvd's are these more expensive discs even worth it oh they are very worth it was made to look grainy so that's not a good demo disc some movies on blu ray are also made before digital so there's still a little grain but blu ray has much more space allowing the colors to be richer and the image to be times better in clarity then standard dvd you should try watching pirates or especially on blu ray to see the difference Blu-ray Disc Laserdisc Widescreen DVD Compact disc PlayStation Portable Television Gramophone record Stereoscopy High-definition television Digital photography Warez Nintendo GameCube Anamorphic widescreen Movie projector Technicolor Color PlayStation 2 Sega Dreamcast Microeconomics Astronomical seeing Xbox 360 Video CD Video Film speed Videocassette recorder Blu Cantrell Nintendo 64 Back to the Future trilogy Digital cinema MPEG-2 Super Video CD Film Handheld game console The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film) NTSC Video codec Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Commodore 64 PlayStation 3 MP3 The Ultimate Matrix Collection DualDisc High fidelity CD-ROM CD recorder CD-R H.264/MPEG-4 AVC PAL DVD recorder VHS Babylon 5 Samuel Vimes 8 mm video format Tax Computer animation Game Boy Drill bit The Hand That Feeds Atari 8-bit family Copy protection Telecine Observational astronomy JPEG Super Audio CD Dolby Laboratories Brewery Cinematography Aliasing Popeye Enterprise content management Disc jockey Adobe Photoshop Hard disk Digital video Disk image Titanic (1997 film) Camcorder Nintendo Indiana Jones Weezer Movie studio Film colorization Marillion Resident Evil: Apocalypse Hyperinflation Pornography Eminem Digital rights management United States dollar Motion picture rating system Dither Inflation GP32 Transformers: The Movie Film preservation Video game music Signal (information theory) Blockbuster Video
