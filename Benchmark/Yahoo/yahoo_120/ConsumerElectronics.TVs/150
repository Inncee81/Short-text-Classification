hitachi tv repair problem http answers yahoo com question index ylt aph lvi k pycpuni f bty ix qid aabihsm so i tried to replace the ics in a hitachi tv usng the instructions above once i put everything back together however thetv now refuses to go on instead it makes a chirping sound i have not replaced any of the resistors yet also while un soldering the ics i had a very poor iron and the board sort of peeled so when i resoldered it was extremely difficult to get it to stick on the board that may be the cause if so how do i fix this also a red light flashes on the back of the board while it chirps i got this tv set off a friend who was going to throw it so if i fail i plan to just toss it anyways i recently repaired a hitachi built zenith projection tv it gave a repeating chirp sound and had the flashing light on the board just as you describe i discovered it was a bad stk ic i replace both ics no matter which one is actually at fault you may have installed a bad ic from the box this is not unheard of when you de laminated the land on the board you might have introduced a short circuit to the power supply the runs that portion of the circuit clean off all the flux and the area for shorted runs or lands by all means get a better soldering iron to work with if the quality of the soldering is below standard the trouble can be because of that the iron needs to be regulated to around degrees for proper solder flow and to prevent damage to the board i read the post you used for instructions i hope you also considered fecomosis' advice about de soldering wick that screwdriver thing was not a good idea you must use either a good de soldering iron with a vacuum pump or de soldering wick copper braid used to remove solder from the connections this is a job i would not recommend for the consumer but since you have already tried why not finish the job Soldering Carburetor Printed circuit board Welding Transformer Solder Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring Central processing unit DVD Cray-2 Cray-1 PCB layout guidelines Heinkel He 100 IPod Capacitor plague Ball grid array Brazing Modchip Solar power USB flash drive Extreme Programming Apollo Guidance Computer Thermal power station Electric motor Canon T90 Circuit design Glass Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Industrial engineering Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Surface-mount technology Sinclair ZX81 Computer Cathode ray tube Circuit breaker Soldering iron Transistor Motorola 68000 Drill bit Violin Software engineering Scientology beliefs and practices Atari 8-bit family Mattress Relay Thermostat Poker jargon Programmable logic device CPU cache Theory of conduct Oscilloscope Service life Laser Operational amplifier Seismic retrofit Bicycle lighting RFID Vacuum Avenue Q Liquid crystal display Solar cell Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Dairy Incident Command System Nintendo Entertainment System Ethernet Compiler optimization M16 (rifle) Gas metal arc welding Arc welding Rail terminology Electronic amplifier Electrophysiology AMD Glossary of climbing terms Digital photography Battery (electricity) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Point-to-point construction Inflation Hitachi, Ltd.
