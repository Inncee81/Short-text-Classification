dierect tv my family is planning to get dierect tv for my dads birthday cause yes we only have local channles at the moment is it worth it or should we get something else direct tv is good if you do have problems with rain knocking out the signal have the installer make a nd visit to retune the dish it can sag after a couple weeks so call them to readjust it if you can't get a picture during rainstorms personally i prefer the dish be mounted in the yard since it won't sag mounted there of course i prefer dish network bigger dish less problems with rain and alignment once again better to mount it on a pole in the yard instead of on that flexy roof Satellite dish Home Box Office Hey Arnold!
