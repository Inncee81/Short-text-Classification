which should i get flat screen tv or a projector my boyfriend wants to get a projector but the majority use for the tv will be to watch tv daily won't it get expensive having to replace the bulbs is it better to get a flat screen for daily tv watching instead of a projector the lamp replacement is the most expensive defference here as far as flat screen ithink you mean flat panel thats the thin ones that you can hang on the wall flat screens are just the regular tube tvs with a flat screen any way it also depends on what screen size you are looking for the projector im assuming you mean front projectors the ones where you have the small device and it projects the image onto a wall or screen other than the rear projector lcds or dlps any way the projector can give you very big screen sizes pepending on how far away you place the projector but for picture detail and brightness the plat panel either lcd flat panel or plasma will give you better brightness and picture quality over the projectors if you mean rear projection types like lcd rear projection or dlp the picture quality can be very good but it wont be wall mountable as they tend to be inches deep they will be cheaper at first but you do have the issue of lamp repalcement over time so really unless you plan on having very large screen size front projector or low initial cost rear projector i would ultimately choose a flat panel either lcd or plasma hoped i helped good luck Television Liquid crystal display Plasma display DLP Movie projector LCD projector Light-emitting diode Digital projector Lighting Digital photography Cathode ray tube Projection screen TFT LCD IMac Fluorescent lamp Widescreen Headlight Oscilloscope IMAX Laptop Stereoscopy Liquid crystal display television Digital cinema Solar power Bicycle lighting Movie theater Incandescent light bulb Anamorphic widescreen Screensaver Slide projector Video Drill bit Gamut Pixel View camera Stage lighting Photography Enlarger Vacuum tube Cinerama Contrast ratio Plasma (physics) Mechanical television Compact fluorescent lamp 35 mm film Organic light-emitting diode Wardenclyffe Tower High-definition television Eyepiece Computer display Persistence of vision Perspective projection distortion Automotive lighting Terminal ballistics Welding Photographic lens Light gun Imperial (automobile) Bicycle frame Mercury-vapor lamp Computer 3-D film Atari 8-bit family Out-of-body experience Digital Visual Interface Konica Minolta IPod nano Equine conformation Transparency (photography) Strap-on dildo Bicycle Film Nintendo Mattress Rail tracks Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Temporal bone Gas metal arc welding Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PowerBook M16 (rifle) Laserdisc Binoculars Computer animation Magnet Bluetooth Microphone Handheld game console Glass Photolithography Map Fire alarm control panel Digital cinematography ThinkPad 19th century in film Inertial confinement fusion PLATO
