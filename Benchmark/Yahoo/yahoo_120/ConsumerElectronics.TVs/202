why are american tv broadcasts fuzzy and over saturated i live in the uk and for a while now ive wondered why the picture of some american broadcasts appears fuzzy over saturated and with generally poor quality when compared to native broadcasts its not everything series like and csi are crystal clear however things that are shot live in a studio like chat shows and news channels like fox and abc have noticably poor picture watching some footage today shown by bbc news but filmed by nbc i think about the bridge collapse in minesota the difference was very noticable does anyone know why this is because it is most likely a live feed directly from the u s and has to go through several transfers before arriving at your t v pre recorded broadcasts are sent over digitally to your local stations and broadcasts from there but live shows are sent directly from the us stations and relayed via several satellites with each transfer causing a decrease in quality American Broadcasting Company Television in the United States Australian Broadcasting Corporation Television High-definition television BBC One BBC Cable television Television syndication NBC Fox Broadcasting Company Dish Network Communications satellite Digital audio broadcasting Sky Digital Fox News Public broadcasting Channel 4 WCCO Live Aid CSI: Crime Scene Investigation WWOR-TV WNBC-TV Lists of television channels Radio Telef__s __ireann Television in Canada Media in Canada Television network CBS News program BBC Television CNN NTSC KCAL-TV Digital photography KSTP-TV NFL on television BBC Radio Five Live Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Digital television News presenter Home Box Office WNEP-TV KSDK Prime Television TV-FM DX ABS-CBN Major League Baseball television contracts WTXF-TV Serial Satellite television The Today Show Sound recording WKYC-TV KYW-TV MSNBC Television channel Cartoon Network Studios BBC World Five (TV) BBC Northern Ireland International broadcasting Radio BBC Radio Dubbing (filmmaking) XM Satellite Radio Science fiction on television Freeview WUSA (TV) Saturday Night Live KHNL BBC News 24 Movie studio Sky Sports Timeline of the BBC 8 mm video format ANT1 Regional television in Australia Hubbard Broadcasting Corporation Media of the United Kingdom CBC Radio One Commercial broadcasting KARE KNXV-TV John F.
