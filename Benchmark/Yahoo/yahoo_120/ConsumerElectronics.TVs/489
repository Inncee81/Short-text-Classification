whats better lcd or plasma well i want to purchase a tv and i really don't know whats better i want a good tv that will last me a good years and has very good quality so should i choose a lcd or a plasma also what company should i go for i heard sony is the best but i'm not sure gimme any suggestions of good tv's thanks well both have certain benefits but overall lcd is probably going to be your choice since it is inherently designed to last longer than years you see semiconductor based equipment can last indefinitely but due to flaws in the material it does not last forever lcd is semiconductor based while plasma is designed to be a design based on ionizing gases when you ionize gas it changes the gases ability to conduct and phosphor does darken as the ions strike the phosphor it can last long but it does have a limited life to it that's the main reason lcd is preferred longevity is built into it but let's look at some problems i've seen in the real world lcd is easily damaged by little children i've had four customers who purchased lcd panel tvs and their to year olds have smashed the panels with rocks marbles cut the panel with scissors and stones it's not kid proof the plasmas can handle kids better plasmas generate a lot of heat can have glare problems in really sunlit rooms easily damaged if dropped low end lcds will show screen lag on fast action it really shows up in sports and games so you want an ms or better response time on the lcd crystals lcd panels don't burn but plasmas do not good on paused pictures or msnbc cnn or any display that doesn't shift on the screen when it comes down to lcd sony is the leader and if you want the best right now look for the wax chassis out now they have motion flow technology which refreshes the frame times to most lcds that only do it one time this gives you a razor sharp picture with hi speed action like games and sports the xbr model line is one of the wax chassis Plasma display Liquid crystal display television Light-emitting diode Cathode ray tube Fluorescent lamp Oscilloscope Plasma (physics) Stereoscopy Television Vacuum tube TFT LCD Digital photography Gas tungsten arc welding Diode Spacecraft propulsion Handheld game console Konica Minolta Movie projector Solar cell Laser Laptop Gamut Computer display Welding Glass Vacuum IMac Solar wind Nuclear power Windows XP Internal ballistics Fusor PlayStation Portable Gramophone record Gameplay of StarCraft Tank Sega Dreamcast Solar power Fusion power PlayStation 3 Nuclear fusion Mouse (computing) Helium PowerBook Turbocharger Nintendo Semiconductor device Loudspeaker Team Fortress Classic Casting Combine (Half-Life 2) Organic light-emitting diode Nintendo Virtual Boy Electrophysiology Corona discharge Ceramics Universal Century Technology Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Tesla coil Sharp Zaurus Directed-energy weapon Transistor Photography Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Laserdisc Mass spectrometry Ionizing radiation Langmuir probe Fluorine Sun Super Nintendo Entertainment System Equine conformation Knife DLP Synthetic diamond Microeconomics Gas metal arc welding Railgun Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Quake III Arena Ionosphere Pixel Boeing 737 Fluoroscopy De Lorean DMC-12 X-ray MP3 RoadShow Defense of the Ancients Carbon dioxide Digital rights management
