my tv doesnt work and i need advice i think a powersurge may have affected my television i have a regular inch jvc tv that is only yrs old what could be the problem and how much would i be looking at to fix it tia well pete is the most correct while you only see one glass fuse in the tv there are several fusistors and microfuses that can open up to protect the power supply along with the horizontal output that can short and stop the tv from powering up throwing it away can cost more than the repair and having it diagnosed is a must if you plan on turning it into the insurance company for blown fuses you can look at about to power supply damage about same with horiz outputs insurance companies will look at the entire damage within your home as one event that means you pay the deductible first and any failures of electronic equipment within days to days of that time are covered by the lightning power surge clause of the contract they don't make you pay the deductible for every piece of equipment only the deductible for one event so yeah you have to have any equipment diagnosed by a tv audio appliance garage door repair company that fails within the next days to months Insurance Fuse (electrical) Life insurance Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Oscilloscope Microeconomics Health insurance Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Transformer Auto insurance Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Videocassette recorder Wind power Uninterruptible power supply Welding Thermal power station Capacitor plague Year 2000 problem Wind turbine Transmitter JVC Circuit design Expert system Best Buy STS-61 Vacuum tube Sears Holdings Corporation Seismic retrofit Wal-Mart Battery (electricity) Reliability engineering Contract Inflation Mortgage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Items in the Metroid series Electricity meter Screw United States Postal Service Unemployment Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Capital accumulation Carburetor De Lorean DMC-12 Gramophone record Floppy disk 2003 North America blackout Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Embedded system Glossary of firefighting equipment Nintendo Entertainment System Lightning Solar power 401(k) Information Technology Infrastructure Library Hybrid vehicle Chernobyl accident Incandescent light bulb Hurricane Katrina effects by region Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.
