how to use a hand net in fishing as i gain more experience fishing i am finding that i am loathe to actually use my hand net although several of the species i am catching really begin to fight after i pull them from the water and netting them would be ideal what i end up with is a terrible tangled mess the fish struggles for a bit and the two treble hooks get hopelessly caught in the net mesh i have spent ten minutes trying to unsnag everything causing possible harm to the fish and sometimes necessitating my snipping small parts of the net what am i doing wrong suggestions when i land a fish i wait til it gets tired out some and when i use a lure with treble hooks i hold the net in one and and my pole in the other and just pull the fish into the boat with the net underneath just in case he or she spits the hook and then it can just fall in to the net if that does by chance happen Fishing Seine (fishing) Trawling Catch and release Angling Suplex Big-game fishing Spider Boxing Fly fishing Poker jargon Gillnet Happy Tree Friends Trapping Professional wrestling holds Common Fisheries Policy Professional wrestling match types Leatherback Sea Turtle Professional wrestling throws Fishery Aerial (dance move) Kitesurfing Animal Crossing USS Thresher (SS-200) Snooker Trolling for fish Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Drowning 2000 Australian Grand Prix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Antarctic krill Dinghy Tag RuneScape Random Events Social rule The Contender (television series) Striped bass Mixed martial arts Characters in the Smurfs Coral reef Seabird Smelt Great Lakes The Old Man and the Sea Operation Market Garden Inuit Flax Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fish Penalty (ice hockey) Salmon Albatross Abortion debate Loudspeaker Second Battle of the Atlantic USS Tunny (SS-282) Aquaman Fly lure Shaggy dog story Remora Textile manufacturing Drill bit Bladderwort Coelacanth Clef Paddlefish Marine aquarium Manual transmission Whitebait Mega Man VII Time Out of Mind Whale song Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish Anchor Magnet 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Turbot War Bocas del Toro Province Water polo Patrick Star Shark Menstrual cup Gordon Banks The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Professional wrestling attacks Jaws (film) Fire fighting Mosquito Carnivorous plant Ice hockey Lakitu Blood on the Tracks Dragon boat Avalanche Captain Thunderbolt Badminton Sailing Elis Prefecture Eldfell Chinese White Dolphin
