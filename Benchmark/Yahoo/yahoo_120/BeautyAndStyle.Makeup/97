has anyone used electrolysis was is successful yes i had electrolysis done on my eyebrows i went to a licensed electrolysis rather than doing it myself and the results are amazing i had to get it done multiple times but my eyebrows are the perfect shape and i never have to tweeze or wax them again it may seem expensive but think of all the time and money you'll save on always getting them waxed or tweezing them it can be a little painful but in the long run it's worth it and really it's painful tweezing or waxing too however if you want to get electrolysis done or your legs or or other large areas i wouldn't reccomend it mainly because it takes a long time and will be very expensive and in my opinion it's easier to just shave but if your getting someone like your eyebrows or upper lip done i would definetely reccommend it hope this helps Depilation Hydrogen economy Cross-country skiing Pubic hair Grid energy storage Casting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phonograph cylinder Kodocha Aluminium Energy development The Amazing Race Moustache Hair Hypertrichosis Dice Conducting Hyperinflation Beard Inflation Fuel cell Backstroke Chlorine Leg shaving Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Electrolysis Laser hair removal CPU design Mnemonic Saxophone Gramophone record Skateboarding trick High-temperature electrolysis Trumpet Hydrogen vehicle Brazilian waxing Airsoft Yoga Sutras of Patanjali American Sign Language The Amazing Race 5 Diving Haircut U.S. presidential election, 2008 Personal finance Drill bit Vlad III Dracula Slint Lunar phase Social rule Pain of Salvation Mutual fund Double the Fist Steganography Enzyme Unibrow Baldness Prostate cancer Shaving $ale of the Century The Amazing Race 7 Equine conformation Frida Kahlo Violin Static Shock Siphon Perl Guinea pig RISC Alternative fuel C__line Dion Saga (band) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Canadian federal election, 1993 CPU cache Dragon Booster W.
