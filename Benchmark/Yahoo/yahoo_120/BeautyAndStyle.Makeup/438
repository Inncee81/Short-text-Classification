make up or no make up i'm going into seventh grade and i want to start wearing make up what should i wear whats too much for my age hmmm what about trying this make up th grade ideas mascara specifically maybelline the pink and green mascara great lash mascara in brown if your eyes are blue and black if your eyes are hazel brown or green the reason for this is these colors make your eyes pop stand out this mascara is classic and used by models but works for th grade for sure one coat works wonders if your eyelashes are flat try an eyelash curler before applying your mascara for a little curl shape blush a real little bit find a natural color in rose pink or peach whatever compliments your skin tone use a good blush brush as opposed to the ones given for free in the blush kit to skim over your cheekbones ever so lightly one or two coats lip gloss or a tinted lip balm clear or natural color something clear or with a tint of color would be great something that is flavored might be fun too the idea is not to color your lips a totally different color but to have moist looking lips and possibly a hint of color that simply accents your look without being too much some of my favorites neutrogena mostiureshine tinted lip balm in glow or natural that should be enough and look amazing thoughts on eye shadow it would look overkill for during the day at school maybe for a school dance but even then go on your lower eyelid only i would start here any more and you might look like you are trying to hard best thing about make up you can try it out and then wash it off so have fun Cosmetics Mascara Eye Color theory Fluorescent lamp Tattoo Diamond enhancement Physical characteristics of the Buddha Pottery Sunglasses Boom Town (Doctor Who) Physical attractiveness Social rule Wood carving Color Eye color Professional wrestling match types Glass Drill bit Material properties of diamond Contact lens Violin Red Light-emitting diode Skinhead Drawing Glasses Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Blue Frans Hals Sinfest Sea-Monkey Milton H.
