eye makeup so i just bought the nyc mod quad and well i need some help i know which one is for the highlighting and the all over the lid is obv but i don't know where to put the contour eyeshadow is that the crease of the eye when applying eye make up generally the middle shade is the all over colour the darkest colour is the contour colour applied to the crease of your eye and the lightest colour is the highlighter applied just below the brow bone you can also use the darker colour on a liner brush and carefully edge it along your lashes over your eyeliner so it widens as you get closer to the outer edge of your eye do the same to the bottom lashes but not quite as wide and only to of the way across add some mascara and a touch of brow liner to define and you are good to go Cosmetics Mascara Eye contact Laws of cricket Drawing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pottery Dominoes Lebesgue integration Knife Hat Colours, standards and guidons Bicycle lighting Mercury Cougar I Ching divination White (people) Customs and etiquette of Japan Snooker Cricket Fast bowling Quark Violin RGB color model Topographic map Color Arsenal F.C.
