what about the caregiver partner i married a quadriplegic because i loved him he married me because i was young strong able to take care of him i didn't get that for a long time if he had ever really loved me we would still be married but he lied to me i divorced him so i could find the love i deserved despite the fact that i wasn't the one who lied i was considered the bad guy because i was what was then called able bodied i left him i was wrong our other disabled friends wouldn't talk to me bigotry doesn't have to be related to color to be wrong why doesn't the caregiver have the same rights to love happiness respect debbie i am so impressed with you most women wouldn't have had the nerve to leave a loveless marriage where you were totally manipulated they would be too wracked with guilt worried about what other people will think so they would stay trapped forever you made the brave choice to move on in spite of what you are going through now the caregiver most certainly has the same rights to love happiness respect you're right about bigotry too and don't forget double standards i'm married and some years ago i became disabled due to illness at first i was on crutches then i was in a motorized wheelchair for the past years i have been bedridden and for the last my husband has been my caregiver we love each other but do you know what people say to him why do you stay with her why don't you leave her so if a man is a caregiver then everyone is understanding if he deserts her i belong to a site with others who have my illness and i know several women whose husbands took off rather than take care of their wives you were right and brave to leave your husband who lied to you didn't love you and my husband is right to stay with me in a relationship where we both love each other and everybody else should just mind their own business keep their mouths shut if my husband tells someone he loves me would never leave me then that person should be glad for him if you tell someone how you were deceived decided to leave that person should be glad for you you should probably still go to a caregivers support group because you are obviously still dealing with issues my husband went to a support group once for a while but it wasn't the right one for him isn't it amazing how full of opinions people are when they know nothing about your personal situation someone once said something to me that i found to be very insightful he said it doesn't matter if i convince them that i'm right it's enough that i know i'm right you know you're right debbie it may mean you lose a few friends and that is sad but you will make new friends move on have your own life probably meet someone who will love you for who you are i am one disabled person who respects you for what you did it's not easy taking care of someone i made sure i read all my husband's books on caregiving i wanted to understand his side of the equation now that i've gotten much sicker people are starting to make comments if he goes out for a hour break critical comments to me about his leaving me alone i will not let them criticize him i tell them what is what my husband's health physical and emotional are just as important as mine we have grown closer through our situation and look after each other do for each other in whatever ways we can and we won't let other people's ideas opinions remarks get to us we support each other we each have people to support us separately you deserve the support you need for what you have lived through for how you were treated in your marriage and now by people who were supposed to be friends i hope you find the comfort support respect you deserve the best of luck to you Theory of conduct Pitaten EastEnders Friends Transsexuality One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Polygamy Divorce Kodocha Social rule Days of our Lives Marriage Shaggy dog story Simone Weil Fathers' rights Phoebe Halliwell Laura Schlessinger Jon Secada Milton H.
