ufc lyota machida what are your thoughts undefeated shouldn't he get better fights lyoto machida is a counter striker waiting for people to make mistakes some may think this is not as exciting and thus not pay to see him but he's beat bonnar franklin and penn yet forrest griffin whom i like btw gets the major fights and is headlined more often if machida were to get the good fights i believe people would become bigger fans either that or he should get on the reality show what do you think convince me otherwise he is going to have a top fight against kazuhiro nakamura at ufc stay away from the reality scene for him it has been great for other people but not machida i think he is a great fighter the reason they push forrest more is he seems to push the action a little more plus the is really stacked right now but if he keeps chipping away he will get his shot soon enough i think the fight agianst nakamura will put him in the top setting up a fight with tito evans babalu or the loser of the chuck jardin fight forrest shogun hendo page they will either one bring him up slow or feed him to some so the other person can get a title fight it wouldn't surprise me if some day we saw him fight bj again if bj get or different ufc belts and if fraklin beats the spider we might see franklin move up to fight lyota after franklin losses the belt for the second time machida has a bright future so no worries mate The Ultimate Fighter Ultimate Fighting Championship B.J.
