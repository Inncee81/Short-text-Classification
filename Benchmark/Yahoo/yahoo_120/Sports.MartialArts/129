martial arts i'd like to learn a martial art i don't know what would be best for me i'm calm and can keep focus even in a variety of situations i never get mad angry sad i know that is a huge bonus in martial arts also i'm big ' lbs keep in mind i'm but i have never really been a good fighter but have been prone to fights i've been in four street fights and hundreds of confrontations where there were no punches but was close i would like to train my body and mind i don't want to go in and kick some ass or anything like that i just want to be stronger also my legs are weak and the slightest hit to my knee knocks it out of place it's extremely painful and i have to go to the hospital i want this to not be able to happen i'm not really worried about defending myself i can diffuse situations pretty easily my ultimate goal would to be more solid just like trying to fight a brick wall i want to be the wall just not be able to be hurt i'm emotionally strong i don't get sad or angry over anything i just want to learn how to be even more emotionally strong and become physically strong have you had your knees checked out as to why they go out so easily weak legs might not explain why they go out so quickly if you can resolve the knee problem first then leg strengthening can be accomplished through body weight exercises as the safest alternative in karate size does not matter a large person can become just as proficient as a smaller person with both gaining the benefits alike strong legs with weak upper body is not so good most styles of karate work you in a manner upper and lower body as to solidity karate also has a focus on strong stances that are easier on the joints strong stances mean your knees are bent and better able to take a hit of course you have to be able to give when struck to better absorb the energy of the blow you sound like an intelligent and thoughtful year old take care of your knees very important a well balanced martial art can help strengthen your whole body and mind Aikido Martial art Tai Chi Chuan Equine conformation Muay Thai Weight training Karate Taekwondo Jujutsu Bruce Lee Wing Chun Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling holds The Book of Five Rings Tenshinhan Chinese martial arts Ranma __ characters Punch (strike) Boxing Lightsaber combat Eskrima Scientology beliefs and practices YuYu Hakusho Vegeta Spanking Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Akuma (Street Fighter) Diving Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move) King Piccolo Saga Hapkido Blood (computer game) Judo Naruto jutsu Professional wrestling throws Goju Ryu Fast bowling Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu PRIDE Social rule Tank Theory of conduct Vulcan (Star Trek) Kick Son Gohan Alexander Technique Kodocha Clinical depression Pacifism Anxiety Chess strategy and tactics Strike (attack) Warrior (World of Warcraft) Geese Howard Characters in Bleach series Pitaten Breastfeeding Shaolin (martial arts) Horizontal bar First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Childbirth One Piece minor characters Kyokugenryu Karate Dragon Booster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kalarippayattu Prostate cancer Kata (martial arts) Force (Star Wars) Grappling Characters of Naruto Tekken Fencing Force powers Kim Possible Unreal Wushu Savate Professional wrestling aerial techniques Dualism (philosophy of mind) Swimming Stomach cancer The Karate Kid, Part III Shoot boxing The Karate Kid Kung Fu Hustle Traumatic brain injury Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost
