question about aikijutsu i've been watching a few videos on it and i'm quite impressed however i've noticed that in the displays the person's attack being reversed is flipping his herself on purpose to avoid getting hurt so i was wondering in a real situation would the attacker's arm actually break since they would not flip on purpose or does it really and work they do flip the flipping is called ukemi or body protection this allows the technique to be performed with a lower chance of injury to the reciever or uke someone who does not know how to fall or perform ukemi would most likely sustain injury most falling injuries are caused by someone trying to put their arm on the mat to catch their fall which results in sprained dislocated wrists elbows shoulders or all three now that said some techniques can be crap when it depends not on uke protecting himself but on uke making the technique look good Aikido Professional wrestling holds Ukemi Professional wrestling aerial techniques Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling attacks Powerbomb Piledriver (professional wrestling) Equine conformation Diving Volleyball Strike (attack) Amateur wrestling Swimming Mattress Mixed martial arts Fast bowling DDT (professional wrestling) Humerus Neckbreaker Weight training Boxing Archery Breaststroke Strappado English cricket team Spinal cord injury Punch (strike) Gesture Tai Chi Chuan Shawn Michaels Hip fracture Skateboarding trick First aid Glossary of climbing terms Dice Martial art Butterfly stroke Compiler optimization Ultimate (sport) Motion capture Tenshinhan Elbow bondage Backbreaker Wing Chun Chair Parkour Swingout Decompression sickness Professional wrestling slang Poker jargon Terminal ballistics Judo Computer animation Table tennis Spanking Drowning Softball Straitjacket Fencing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Coin flipping Piccolo Junior Saga Elbow-joint Glossary of partner dance terms Ice hockey Snowboarding Arm Bondage (BDSM) Shoot boxing Torture Repetitive strain injury The Shining (film) Blackjack Probability Canoe Suicide methods Land mine Alexander Technique Philip J.
