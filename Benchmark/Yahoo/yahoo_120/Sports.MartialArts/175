kung fu or tae kwon do i have a year old daughter and would like for her to begin martial arts training in the near future i trained in kung fu for about years when i was younger and know that it can be extremely difficult my question for anyone who has martial arts experience is if you think i should begin my daughter with tae kwon do which mostly involves kicking defense and you can advance more quickly since she is so young or can i start her immediately with kung fu either way i want her to eventually learn kung fu which is something dear to me thanks you so much for your help yes i know not all schools are equal i tried a different school since i'm in another state and it could not compare to my first sifu and his teaching style it was too relaxed and i did not get any on instruction to help me advance either ha ha i know sometimes my mother made me go to class she was my motivation when i was low on energy because she left me no choice my sifu use to tell us there is really no better style of martial arts it depends on the student and how often and hard they train although kung fu is a bit complicated if the fighter w k f style only trains a few times a week and someone in tkd style trains everyday who do think will win in combat yes i agree tkd and kung fu should compliment each other because tkd uses kicking and distance combat and fighting kung fu is good for close hand to hand combat the difference between asian western cultures is that the asian children are trained to obey so there is no backing out if and when the parent tells them to go attend tkd school so go for kung fu or tkd whatever just do not pull any punches when you have her trained go for the gold never settle for second best but that does not mean subjecting your child to abuse or abusive training it means proper guidance and disciplined training my korean instructor started his own daughter now he has a yr old black belt hope i encouraged you Chinese martial arts Tai Chi Chuan Kung fu Aikido Eagle Claw Jeet Kune Do Karate Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Qigong Hapkido Tenshinhan Eskrima Goju Ryu Bruce Lee Muay Thai Punch (strike) Sifu Shaolin (martial arts) Kata (martial arts) Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Choy Lee Fut Korean martial arts Jujutsu Dog training Xingyiquan Shotokan Zen Piccolo Junior Saga Yip Man Judo Capoeira Education Choi Kwang-Do Double Dragon Black belt (martial arts) Education in the People's Republic of China Tekken characters Sport Lightsaber combat Sub-Zero Boxing Kalarippayattu Education in Germany Hung Gar Education in Taiwan Pushing hands Chan Wah-shun Kick Japanese tea ceremony Past teachings of Prem Rawat Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Vegeta Chuck Norris Kodocha Wang Chongyang Education in Japan Savate Fighting game Genseiryu No Child Left Behind Act Meditation Baguazhang Graduate school Milton H.
