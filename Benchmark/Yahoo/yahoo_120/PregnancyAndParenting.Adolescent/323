should i marry him or would it be throwing my life away i am currently years old and about weeks pregnant with twins this is my second pregnancy but my first was a miscarriage both pregnancies came from the same person he has been my best friend through everything and has never left my side but he wants me to marry him now because we're going to have children however i've seen the show engaged underaged and those marriages don't always work out as planned besides even though we've been together for years and are madly in love with each other i can't picture the two of us growing old together it could be just an influence of fear from television but he is in a really bad situation right now with the people he runs with a gang that is not a huge problem to me though the bigger problem is whether i should say yes to him and get married at would being tied down with a marriage ruin school for me do you think or would it help by giving both of us equal opporitunity with the kids a lot of you are bringing up a good point with the gang situation but the gang is really not that deadly they try to be but in reality they're whack but they're like my family too and i love them all however i do get what you're saying but on that show some of them do most people don't stay together for years especially not when their teenagers and marriage won't make school any harder than taking care of two babies it just means that he'll bether no matter what he'll be living with you helping you but if you don't love him then you shouldn't get married but you said you do so heres what i say if you get married and things don't workout you can always get divorced but if you don't marry him you might later regret it and im sure your kids would be really happy i you got married but make sure your relationship really works do you communicate well does he give you what you need emotionally and physically how often do you fight make sure those little things like that are great before getting married cause those are the keys to a good marriage make a life plan find out anything you don't already know i would really suggests that you live together for a couple of months before getting married that way you really do know whethewr or not you feel comfortable living with him waking up to him and going to bed with him i think you have a really good chance of making it considering youve been together for years and your still a teen that really says how much you care about him think things over and whatever you decide good luck Friends Marriage EastEnders Days of our Lives Abortion debate Neighbours Laura Schlessinger Pregnancy One Tree Hill (TV series) Hollyoaks Knots Landing Social rule Theory of conduct Marilyn Monroe History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Jennifer Lopez Teenage pregnancy Humphrey Bogart Divorce Infantilism Polyamory Sex and the City The O.C.
