is it wrong if i use sparknotes okay so i have to take notes on jane eyre to discuss in class i already read the book months ago but forgot to take the notes the notes are to help me study for the test i dont get graded on them is it wrong if i use sparknotes com to get summaries of every chapter theme ideas and character traits and i re word them to only study from and use in class i mean i'm not getting graded on my notes use them but remember that sparks or cliff notes only talk about the main events and ideas a good teacher will have also read the sparks notes and will make sure that some of the questions on the test can not be answered by people that have only read the sparks notes i know you said you read the book months ago but you will probably want to review certain key parts of it to make sure that you really remember and understand what happened Education Fahrenheit 451 GED Nicomachean Ethics Theory of conduct Socrates A Course In Miracles SAT Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Goodness and value theory Fictional character The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Republic (dialogue) Cliff Richard Philosophical skepticism Federalist No. 10 Church of Christ, Scientist Standardized testing Culture Theodicy Eugene Onegin Classical education God Emperor of Dune Guns, Germs, and Steel Book of Mormon Discordianism Password God Aesthetic Realism Second language acquisition Jeopardy!
