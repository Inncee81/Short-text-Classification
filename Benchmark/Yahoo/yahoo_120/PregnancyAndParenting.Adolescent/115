condoms in schools how do you feel about them i have no problem with high school distributing condoms in schools to adolescents parents and other figures can always tell the kids what they shouldn't do but kids will be kids remember as adults we were once young how do you feel about condoms being distributed in the schools i have been out of school now for a couple of years but during the time i was enrolled we didnt even have a sex ed course i was enraged b c their are so many kids in high school who don't have a clue my mother explained everything to me when i was about ish it was one of the most awkward conversations but guess what i have no kids i have never been pregnant and i have a very enjoyable sex life i have recently learned that my year old cousin who attends the same high school as i did is now months pregnant had she known how to protect herself better yet how to refuse sex this would undoubtedly not be her present condition i can only hope and pray that school systems realise that the rising rate in adolescent pregnancy is not declining i pray that they realise any help in preventing this pregnancy peak will help prevent many children from growing up in unproviding unstable and irresponsible homes therefore please please support the policy of sex ed in the classroom and distribution of condoms through school athorities there is no telling how many lives we can save by preventing unwanted pregnancy and std's Sex education Condom Sexual abstinence AIDS Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anal sex Breastfeeding Birth control Adolescence Teenage pregnancy Roe v.
