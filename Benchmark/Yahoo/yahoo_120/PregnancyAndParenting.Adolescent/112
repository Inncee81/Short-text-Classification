im and i want birth control how do i tell my mom q has been asked but i haven't see any good answers alright as i said im so i cant go to plannedparenthood because you have to be atleast without parent notification i've tried and well i just turned in may so yeah i want that protection now and not when im almost and pregnate anyway i cant tell my mom its for cramps because i've mentioned to her that one of my friends got bc for cramps and she kind of though oh well now you have another slut friend then huh maybe not those exact words but you get the picture anyway she also knows i get barely any cramps i mean maybe once a year they get really bad but other than that i get none at all she told me a while ago that when i wanted to talk to her about this stuff then i just should then she'd break it to my dad in a way that wouldn't get my ass kicked but i dont want my dad to know and i know she cant keep a secret oh and im afraid if i even do ask she will expect me to have already had sex which i have once and she wont let me ever see my bf okay here's the thing i've had my period since i was yrs old so my mom know's my cycle haha so i cant make an excuse with that the asprin guy you are retarded its kind of a sore subject with my mom because my oldest sister has two kids now and she's oldest is and my mom still has to support her even though she's engaged to a huge idiot by the way so if i start talking about bc then she'll never let me see my bf again and i dont want that to happen i really love him and i trust him with absolutly everything i have also my mom wont really like it because my bf is almost and i am even though both my parents like him i know that they'll hate him if i ask so please help many of you have been somewhat helpful already thanx so much the best birth control for any unmarried girl or woman is to take one aspirin put it between your knees and hold it firmly in place my wife was a virgin almost years old until our wedding night when we first engaged in the act of marriage that was the most precious gift she ever gave me a gift a female can give only once for the past years neither of us has had sexual relations with anyone else dear sweet stupid and naive kciwtsob the best thing and our heavenly father's plan btw is celibacy until marriage and monogamy after marriage you can call me names all you want i only have a bachelor's degree in psychology but this information and advice is the absolute truth so i guess that means you also consider our creator god to be retarded too oh yes just one more bit of info from a retarded person depending where one lives in the united states when one of the persons involved is or older and the other one is a minor the adult might be in violation of the law against statutory rape statutory rape is the crime of sex with a minor under the age of consent aoc the age at which individuals are considered competent to give consent to sexual conduct statutory rape differs from other types of rape in that overt force or threat need not be present by law statute any such sexual activity is assumed to be coercive since the minor is considered by law to be incapable of giving consent to the acts from wikipedia Statutory rape Marriage Kyle Broflovski Rape Pedophilia Human sexual behavior Recurring South Park characters Friends Theory of conduct Same-sex marriage Eric Cartman Consensual crime Religion and sexuality Child sexual abuse Birth control Abortion debate Laura Schlessinger Sexual abuse EastEnders Sexual abstinence Divorce Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Zoophilia Age disparity in sexual relationships Contract One Tree Hill (TV series) Incest Sexual orientation Lawrence v.
