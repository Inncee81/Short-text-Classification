my friend has a baby and shes help my friend has a week old baby shes the babys daddy is and hes her best friend when she got pregnant and asked for help from him he denied that it was his baby what can i do to help my friend and to prove to everyone that he is the father sometimes it's better to focus on what you have control over rather than trying to force a boy into a situation he's not ready for or does want to be a part of it can just make things messier i think you should just focus on being supportive of your friend as a new mother it's tough business try not to make a drama out of the baby daddy situation and just stay positive about the precious gift your friend has been given hopefully the father will come around on his own but forcing the situation will only make it worse unless she's looking for child support then i think she'd have to take him to court to get a dna test even so i don't know how that would work for year olds good luck you sound like a good friend EastEnders Tupac Shakur Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prenatal diagnosis Pregnancy Humphrey Bogart Babe Carey Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Billboard Hot 100 Situation comedy Sheryl Crow For Better or For Worse Father Sharon Tate Slow Train Coming Ray Winstone Infantilism Sean Combs Jon Secada Kodocha Shaggy dog story History of As the World Turns (1990-1999) Social rule One Life to Live John Lennon Everwood 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters AFI 100 Years series Ol' Dirty Bastard Love and Theft Bow Wow Wow Knots Landing Childbirth About a Boy Sin City Phil of the Future Fred Phelps Triple J Hottest 100, 2003 Baby Blues David Blunkett Timon and Pumbaa Alois Hitler Sami Brady Hip hop rivalries Laci Peterson Comanche The Beach Boys Phoebe Buffay's songs Pitaten Care Bears Piper Halliwell Breastfeeding The Chemical Brothers Sex and the City The Fairly OddParents Clint Eastwood Abortion debate William Carey Reservoir Dogs The Care Bears (television series) Reggaeton Theodicy The Emancipation of Mimi Great Teacher Onizuka The Jazz Singer Neighbours In vitro fertilisation Elvis and Me Miscarriage of justice Fathers' rights All My Children Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Vernon Schillinger The Family from One End Street Harry Nilsson Los Rold__n Birthday Spice Girls The Ashlee Simpson Show Doug Extreme Programming Ben E.
