i am at camp with my ex hey i am girl and turns out that i am going to camp with my ex bf thing is it's been two weeks and both of us are acting like we don't really exist and i wouldn't mind if that changed a bit would it be weird if i all of a sudden started talking to him thing is things are a bit akward how can i break the ice should i bother he was a jerk but i gues it would be cool to have another friend or somethin the question is what will talking to him do for you do you think that he will be a good friend to you you said that he was a jerk is that the kind of friend that you want you have to ask yourself how will this benefit me i would say don't ignore him but don't go out of your way to strike up a deep conversation with him either if you walk by him put on your best smile say hi ask him how he is and then keep going if you try too hard to be friendly he may think you want to get back together with him good luck Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
