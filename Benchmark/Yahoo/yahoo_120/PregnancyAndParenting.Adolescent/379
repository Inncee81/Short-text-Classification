should boys in school be taught about women's birth control when i was in school sex ed they taught us all about condoms how to put it on the banana etc but after that the boys had to leave the room for break while the girls were taught the deeper stuff pills periods etc do they still do this would you want your son to hear about all the women's stuff too birth control is the responsibility of both sexes they should both be informed men need to know about ovulation birth control pills periods etc because the guys shouldn't assume that the gals know everything the only reason the genders should ever be separated is if it's a younger grade not quite high school and the kids feel awkward asking questions in front of the other sex but they should both be taught the same thing actually i'm slightly appalled by what your school did making boys be ignorant and not give a fair opportunity of learning to both genders if it was a public school i'd get on the school board's as's about that who knows maybe one of the boys would turn out to be really interested in how the female human body works maybe inspire him to become a gyno that's just rude what your school did Birth control Fertility awareness Condom Gender identity Boston Public Homosexuality and transgender About a Boy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Menstrual cycle Feminism Social rule Sexual revolution Sexual orientation One Tree Hill (TV series) Girl Abortion debate Infantilism Transgender Education in the United States Gender-neutral language Emergency contraception Gender role Masculism Avenue Q Human sexual behavior History of intersex surgery Sex Gender Beavis and Butt-head Incarnations of Immortality God and gender Sento Pedophilia The Giver Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bah__'__ Faith and Education Sex-positive feminism Sharon Tate Friends Puberty The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Intersex surgery Cross-dressing Equal Protection Clause Sexual abstinence Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Orgasm Shaggy dog story Heteronormativity Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Urinary incontinence John Money The Invisibles Twin Sexual intercourse Neighbours Woman Sex and intelligence Little Britain Milton H.
