do you think we should be celebrating black history month what are your thoughts on this i know it's in february i'm just asking if we should anyways when it comes up i think we should have an asian history month and a native american history month and a european history month etc etc if we have one we should have them all that would be truly non racist but we already have the black history month in february and the entire country has adopted june teenth which is exclusively a texas thing and the saddest part about that is that the blacks actually think that is the day the slaves were freed no that was about months after the emancipation proclomation day you can't beat an education African American Racism History of slavery in the United States American Civil War African American culture Emancipation Proclamation Racism in the United States Blacks and Mormonism History of the Southern United States History of Texas African American Vernacular English Black (people) African American history South Africa Desegregation Minstrel show Gregorian calendar Confederate States of America White supremacy USS Texas (BB-35) Frederick Douglass Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Juneteenth Colonial mentality Julian calendar Delaware Music of the United States African American literature Texas Abolitionism Hispanic Nigger Afro-Latin American Charles Sumner White (people) Nelson Mandela History of Maryland Christmas Holidays of the United States Eddie Guerrero 2004-05 in English football Slave state Carter G.
