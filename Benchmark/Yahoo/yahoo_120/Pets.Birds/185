i have budgies i was wondering if cockateil can be in the same cage or will they fight are they gonna fight or not i dont know if they will fight but the cockateil may bully the budgies since they are smaller and the parakeets will be scared to death of it at first they will fly around the cage really fast and possibly injure themselves and then they will just stand in one spot for a while cockateils are big at the cheyenne mountain zoo they have an exhibit called budgie buddies and they have lots of parakeets and cockateils flying around together and its not a problem but those are wild birds i think it would be better if you got a seperate cage for the cockateil if you decide to get one because the cockateil may bully or kill one of the budgies Budgerigar Professional wrestling match types Carolina Parakeet RuneScape quests Monk Parakeet Judas Priest Tigon Budgie (band) John Cage Rose-ringed Parakeet Zoo Shawn Michaels Trapping Mario series enemies Hamster Guinea pig Adam Copeland Timon and Pumbaa The Creatures Conure Nicolas Cage Unreal Gerald Durrell SpongeBob SquarePants Domestic rabbit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hulk Hogan Leopard Parrot Columbine High School massacre Liger Non-human animal sexuality Johnny Cage Red-masked Parakeet Extinct birds Lion The Great American Bash Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bully Frankie Laine Paul Wight Blood on the Tracks Ferret Crazy Horse Poker jargon Pittsburgh Steelers Dalek (Doctor Who episode) Jurassic Park III Battle of the Little Bighorn Luke Cage Sitting Bull Panthera hybrid Great Teacher Onizuka Piccolo Junior Saga Bronx Zoo StarrCade Vegeta Chicken Time Out of Mind Timeline of heavy metal Alexandrine Parakeet W.I.T.C.H.
