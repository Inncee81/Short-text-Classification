peachface trouble i just got a lovely two month old peaceface from the petshop and he won't stop chirping and rubbing his beak on his perch is there something wrong with him no matter how much attention i give him he still chirps like mad its driving me crazy he may want a cuttlebone to chew on mine did that for a long time and it turned out that she just wanted her cuttlebone to be vertical some birds are picky it can also be if the bird was just eating because they'll wipe their beak off on their perch if you just got him from the pet store he's just chirping because it's a new place and he's establishing his territory and or telling you that he wants to go back to his old cage at the pet store he does not need a mate this will just cause him to not be tamable and you wont be able to stop the chirping because he wont care about you just give him time to adjust to your home and ignore the chirping when he realizes that noise doesn't get your attention he'll stop Shaggy dog story Hamster Domestic rabbit Chicken Guinea pig Cat Fancy rat Cricket (insect) Bird Garfield Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Chinchilla One Piece minor characters Friends RuneScape quests Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Chirp Eddie Guerrero Radar Dog training The Birds (film) Falconry Breath of Fire III Kakapo Sonar The Trouble with Tribbles Gecko Salad Fingers Silent Night, Deadly Night W.I.T.C.H.
