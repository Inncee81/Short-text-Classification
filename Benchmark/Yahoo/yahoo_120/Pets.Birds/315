handling gloves while i don't promote using gloves to protect hands against birds biting it is acceptable for some things i'm working with a new macaw and he bites i'm not worried about cuts slashes or anything like that it's the shear pressure on my forearm and fingers when he grabs them i teach and play violin so i kind of need my fingers and arms in perfect working order what are the best handling gloves they need to protect more against the pressure of the bite than the sharpness of the beak i was thinking that maybe kevlar would be good but i also kind of liked a pair of gloves on petsolutions com which would be better leather and pigskin gloves or kevlar the reason i don't know much about gloves is because i've never had to use them before i've just taken all the abuse from the birds but this macaw is determined to amputate my arm i know that gloves are usually a no no because they can scare the bird but i figured out how to not scare the bird i found some black kevlar sleeves so that snicker can't puncture or tear my arm and i can hide the sleeves under a shirt so the bird never sees them i'm just not putting my fingers near the cage until snicker stops trying to take off my arm have you tried kevlar i know that many years ago i wrote an article on a kevlar horse blanket that users swore was indestructable owners i interviewed said that their horses could not bite it rip it tear it on barb wire fencing or damage it in any way if kevlar horse blankets could withstand the force of a horse bite i imagine a kevlar glove could withstand the pressure of a macaw beak edit if you are undecided can you afford a pair of each see which ones work best for you or get a pair of one or the other and if they don't work out see if you can get a refund and buy the other type and try them i can't recommend any particular type from personal experience as i am one of those weird people that just can not work with gloves on no matter what type i get or how well they fit i can not properly feel what i am handling and i get frustrated and take them off after just a few minutes Fencing RuneScape quests Milton H.
