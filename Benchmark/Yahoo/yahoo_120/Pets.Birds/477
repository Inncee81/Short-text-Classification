does your parakeet do this my somwhat new parakeet kicks his food out of his bowl and gets it everywhere making a huge mess hes not bored though cause hes got plaenty off toys how can i stop him from doing this and why does he do this all of these answers are good birds can kick out their food because of boredom searching for better food or wanting attention but some birds just like to do this it appears to be a game to some of them the rules go something like this kick out large amounts of food squawk for more food look innocent birds are individuals and some are just messy if you give him lots of toys and attention lots of treats and keep his bowl cleaned of husks and he still kicks out food then there may not be much you can do about it you could try only putting in very small amounts of food several times a day if he gets hungry enough because he kicked out his food a couple of hours ago he will eat first and kick out second later hopefully he might eventually learn to conserve his food but i wouldn't bet cash money on it good luck Piccolo Junior Saga Betting (poker) The Amazing Race EastEnders Garfield Craps Theory of conduct National Football League Japanese tea ceremony Ken Jennings Make money fast Video game music Game show Shaggy dog story Slot machine Press Your Luck Hamster Little Britain Super Bowl XXXVIII Big Brother UK series 6 Super Bowl XXXVI Play Your Cards Right Ron Weasley The Apprentice 2 Binge eating disorder Falconry Spider Budgerigar Quizbowl Famine Let's Make a Deal Social rule Bulk vending Canary Sydney Riot of 1879 Parrot Chopsticks Texas hold 'em Pittsburgh Steelers Gambling Conure Rose-ringed Parakeet Discworld gods Brewery Dog training MapleStory New York Giants Dairy Chinese New Year Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl I Terry Bogard Kibbutz Super Bowl XXXI Winning Streak Jeopardy!
