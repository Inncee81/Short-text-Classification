parakeet grit hi i have had my two parakeets for quite some time now and a friend of mine bought grit for hers can someone tell me what this is for and how you would use it if im correct you just put it in the seed bowl or on the floor of the cage and it helps with digestion but do they actually eat it simple answer is no they do not need it it isnt used for parakeets or parrots althou from somewhere along time ago someone must have decided it was and thrus spreading the word but infact giving a parakeet grit can sometimes prove fatal any bird that hulls it's seed does not require grit birds such as pigeons or doves that eat grain whole need grit to help grind up the hulls i sugest you tell your friend to remove the grit imediatly parakeets will eat it despite and often this will build up in the crop causing impacted crop which requires sugery to fix also when a parakeet is stressed or sick and theres grit in the cage they will often eat the whole lot and die a small amount at the end of the week is fine but its not necessary hope this helps Bird Parrot Hamster Famine Sharpening stone Sorghum Monk Parakeet Carolina Parakeet Guinea pig Conure Livestock Fancy rat Mourning Dove RuneScape quests Flax Alexandrine Parakeet Dodo Hemp Knife Maize Earthworm Peanut Domestic rabbit Extinct birds Jewish cuisine Rose-ringed Parakeet Acorn Stomach cancer Chicken Amateur telescope making Oyster Cereal E85 613 mitzvot Vegetarianism Dove Trapping Newton's Parakeet Nutrition Red-masked Parakeet Grits Flour Budgerigar Genetic engineering Capercaillie Babylonian law Microeconomics Combine harvester Vomiting Plum-headed Parakeet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Barley Quinoa Breakfast DDT Rice Apple Alcoholic beverage Green Revolution Ashton-Tate Seismic retrofit Weed control Mealy Parrot Vitamin C Allan Octavian Hume Pet Equine conformation Chocolate Slashdot trolling phenomena Diarrhea Opportunity rover Psittaciformes Ferret Gristmill White-winged Dove Japanese tea ceremony Bread Spanish verbs YuYu Hakusho Potato Ron Weasley Pikmin Fruit Extreme Programming Beetle Crop circle Genetically modified food Pet store Sibley-Monroe checklist 4 Cuisine of the Southern United States Cat Insulin Jumpstart 3rd Grade RuneScape skills John Cage Cannabis cultivation
