what are perches for birds everytime i hear someone talking about birds i hear or read the word perches what exactly is perches cause i am getting a budgie and they say i should get wooden perches not plasticc but i don't know what they are lol the purpose of hte perch is to act as a tree limb a place for the bird to sit rest the bottom of the cage is not ideal for them because of the shape their claws are designed to hug the braches of trees and such you can buy ready made perches for bird cages or you can buy wooden dowels and cut a slit in each end it's better to have several perches at sever different heights in the cage depending on the size wooden perches often work better but require more maintanence because they are harder to clean and you have to be sure not to get wood that has been treated plastic is easier to clean but then you run the risk of the birds ingesting the plastic if they chew them and they usually don't feel as comfortable or natural Hamster Upholstery Wood Drill bit Chair Bong Equine conformation Knife Canoe Mattress John Cage Violin Wood carving Falconry RuneScape quests Domestic rabbit Trapping Chopsticks Chinchilla Menstrual cup Mealy Parrot Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Leopard Brush Fancy rat Screw Strap-on dildo Archery Wire Boat building Bird bath Table saw Northern Mockingbird Canary Sento Dinghy Shotgun Deforestation Dairy Golf Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Japanese tea ceremony Passerine Clarinet Peafowl Portsmouth Block Mills Guinea pig Salad Fingers Woodworking Kayak Bird flight Lake Burley Griffin Bicycle frame Stairway Mojave people Axe Cello Kashrut Bow (weapon) Beretta 92F/FS Snake Brassiere Ivory-billed Woodpecker Bookbinding Spanking Monopoly (game) Dog agility Angling Mixed martial arts Floppy disk Punt (boat) Soap Radio controlled airplane Lumber Chewing gum Plastic Skateboard Gypsy moth Coconut crab Surveillance Funeral Diamond cut Happy Tree Friends The Cure Wound Diving Anchor Trail blazing Aztec Aikido Seismic retrofit Lathe Professional wrestling holds Windsurfing Hearing impairment Bleeding Ski Hand grenade Perch
