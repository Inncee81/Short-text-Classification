lovebird fleas or preening my new lovebird is constantly scratching itself on its head and preening itself does it have fleas or some kind of mite or is this normal i have never had one before can you buy flea powder for birds birds do preen alot but if it seems like it's constant and it's more scratching than moving the feathers through it's beak it could have mites or lice there are sprays you can buy to spray right on the bird and it's advised to totally clean and disinfect the cage toys nesting materials and keep them very clean well always but especially when trying to get rid of mites as they can live off the host for about a week until the mites lice are gone most are very very very small so a completely positive diagnosis would be to take it to a vet to figure out exactly what type of mite it is or if it's lice Canary Fancy rat Chicken Diseases of the honeybee Flea Allergy Guinea pig Bird Kakapo Biological pest control Hamster Ferret Scabies Louse Mange Lovebird Bulk vending Clothing Head louse Albatross Mealy Parrot Dog agility Moult Capercaillie Hair Dinosaur Stork Hyacinth Macaw Red Hot Chili Peppers Japanese tea ceremony Dog Wheel of Fortune Sterilization (microbiology) Crab louse Genericized trademark Garfield Hand grenade Shotgun Bird of prey Bird flight Turok: Rage Wars Northern Cardinal Tick RuneScape economy Animal communication Chinese food therapy Sesame Street Linked list House dust mite Feather Tweety Bird Tungiasis Isle of Wight Upholstery Gramophone record Grebe __Mucha Lucha!
