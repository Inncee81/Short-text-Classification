stepped on cockatiel feathers my hubby stepped on the tail feathers of our cockatiel because it got in the way all the tail feathers came out the bird does not seem to be upset because of it will they grow back i know i can't let it fly and it's wings had already been clipped the cockatiel is very tame and friendly and plays with us it likes people maybe that is why it gets in the way what can i do about the tail feathers yes they will grow back with no problem cockatiels rarely venture onto a floor in normal situations they realize that they are vulnerable there you might want to ensure that the bird is not allowed on the floor so that he doesn't get in the way again Cockatiel Chicken Moult Feather Bird Capercaillie Peafowl Falconry Cockatoo Kakapo Mario Archaeopteryx Seabird Bird flight P-38 Lightning Equine conformation The Legend of Zelda series enemies Rainbow Bee-eater Characters in Bleach series Haibane Renmei Escape from New York 108 form Wu family T'ai Chi Ch'uan Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Pterosaur Characters in the Smurfs Piccolo Junior Saga Rugby union positions Dog Havanese Minor Harry Potter Beasts Fly lure Cat Pok__mon Colosseum Albatross Archangel (comics) Icarus (mythology) Volleyball European Nightjar Condor Prairie Falcon Parrot Gray Wolf RuneScape quests GunZ The Duel Monster Rancher monsters B-24 Liberator Bedknobs and Broomsticks Hippogriff European Kingfisher Bird ringing B-47 Stratojet Creatures in Bionicle Heinkel He 100 Universal Century Technology Dinosaur The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Glossary of partner dance terms P-47 Thunderbolt Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Bird strike Christmas tree Wa shogi Scarlet Macaw Lyrebird Chocobo RuneScape weapons Buckingham Palace White-tailed Ptarmigan Black-eared Wheatear Pitaten Tengu Flightless bird Red-tailed Hawk Missingno.
