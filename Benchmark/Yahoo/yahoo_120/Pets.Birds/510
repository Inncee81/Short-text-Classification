help i may be getting either a budgie or a weero cockatiel and don't know anything about birds can someone give me advice on the basics of looking after them diet cage vet visits training etc just an outline would be great don't confuse me with to much jargon also it would be hand reared and i already have dogs and cats so would it be ok for the bird to be outdoors or indoors but only in it's cage thanks permanently outdoors isn't a good idea usually the bird has to be kept warm and away from drafts or it'll get sick feed them a mixture of pellets and seeds either kaytee fiesta because it's already mixed and has the fresh fruit that birds need or mix kaytee rainbow pellets with a seed diet because a seed diet will cause them to get fatty liver disease the cage needs to be at least as wide as twice the bird's wingspan bigger is always better take the bird to the vet right away to make sure it has no diseases or other problems but other than that you only have to take it to the vet once a year or so for a check up birds don't show signs of being sick until they're about ready to die so as soon as you see symptoms of illness take it to the vet asap it's best if you can play with the bird outside of the cage also because it makes them happy and live longer just take it into a room with no other animals this is especially important for hand raised babies because they're used to being held and played with so if you take that away from them they may actually get depressed it really depends upon what you want to train your bird to do but here's a great website with tons of training advice http www cockatootrainer com i hope this wasn't too long or confusing if you have more questions feel free to let me know Guinea pig Hamster Fancy rat Chicken Ferret Dog Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hedgehog Livestock Vitamin C Pet skunk Garfield Cat Alcoholism Stomach cancer Poker jargon Folic acid Nutrition Medicine Breastfeeding Housebreaking Prostate cancer Cirrhosis Coeliac disease Bread Vegetarianism Foodborne illness Foie gras Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Shrimp farm First aid Tai shogi Agriculture Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Randomness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kashrut Theory of conduct Traumatic incident reduction The Catcher in the Rye The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Clinical depression Sleep Equine conformation Soap Raw food diet Kakapo Decompression sickness Species Chronic fatigue syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tobacco smoking Care Bears Current teachings of Prem Rawat Diabetes mellitus Fatty acid Mealy Parrot Weight training RuneScape quests Colorectal cancer Tocopherol Capercaillie World Wide Web Fecal incontinence Multiple sclerosis Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Stroke Shotgun Domain Name System Albatross Archery Atkins Nutritional Approach Irritable bowel syndrome Bird Cannabis (drug) In-N-Out Burger Little Britain Coronary heart disease Banana Fasting Oily fish Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Microchip implant (animal) Cancer Disease Mixed martial arts Apple Falconry The Emancipation of Mimi Pretty Good Privacy Aspartame Kodocha Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Lighting
