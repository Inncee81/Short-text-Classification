breeding question please answer i want to get a couple of finches and breed them and when they are old enough my grandmother wants them i'm not giving them to her as a gift she knows about them so don't worry about that can i just get them from petsmart do you think they are healthy enough should i just get a male and female and they will mate or is there anything i can do to uhh i guess seduce them to make them want to mate i know what to do after the egg is layed and all about caring for the babies but i dont know how to get them to mate help or should i try to find a breeding pair of finches i really want to breed birds not much maybe only or clutches at the most so i wont be adding to much to the unwanted pet population because i already have a home for the babies just letting yall know yes i know kjh please just ahead of time dont answer my question if you are telling me not to breed them just letting you know the birds already have a home once they are old enough so do i need a special cage or will a regular cage do last question probably not i already have a female cockatiel will the new birds laying eggs promote her to laying eggs i know that was a lot to read so thanks for listening i'm not familiar with finches but i'm sure they aren't any different from any other bird if you get un bonded finches it may take them a while to actually bond them start mating so in my honest opinion you're better off buying a pair that is proven breeders one's that have proven to lay eggs that were fertile i see no problem in breeding any bird as long as it's done correctly you know exactly what your doing and you breed species that are in demand and i do see allot of people wanting to buy finches now if you said you wanted to breed say canaries i'd have to disagree because i've been searcing the internet allot of online classified ad's and i have not yet found any one wanting to buy canaries and before i got my budgie my bf took me to a breeder he knew that he got all his birds off of when he was into birds several years ago and the man only breeds canaries now and i know there was at least cages if not more stacked up all around a add on room of his garage and each cage had at least canaries in them no one is buying them but finches i see people wanting them all the time i say as long as you truly know what your doing and you've already got good loving caring homes for them good for it if you go here http www drsfostersmith com product navresults cfm n it shows you different nesting boxes and i think the nesting finch tiki hut is kinda cool lookin i'm sure you can find them cheaper some where else or maybe not i just bought a flight suit for my quaker from them and they were the cheapest place i found one but at least it gives you an idea of what a finches nesting box looks like Bird Chicken Canary Hamster Domestic rabbit Dog Platypus Species Kakapo RuneScape quests Emu Non-human animal sexuality Ostrich Chaffinch Budgerigar Cockatiel Theory of conduct Leatherback Sea Turtle Inception of Darwin's theory John Cage Animal communication Peregrine Falcon Falconry Egg (biology) Dragons (Pern) Bobwhite Quail Egg (food) Albatross Hybrid Mallard Charles Darwin EastEnders Condor Pet Guinea pig Social rule Capercaillie Penguin Ferret Bird migration Garfield Discus (fish) Trapping Sesame Street Ant Spider Mixed-breed dog Clownfish Kiwi Pet skunk Sexual dimorphism The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Monogamy Dinosaur The Birds (film) Osprey Mosquito House Mouse Monster Rancher monsters Friends Honeybee Dunnock Beetle Blue Tit The Ersatz Elevator Ocean's Twelve Musk Duck Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Piece minor characters The Origin of Species Rhea (bird) AFI 100 Years series Sexual reproduction The Contender (television series) Nile crocodile Roseate Tern Peafowl Life in the Freezer Bagworm moth Great Bustard Past teachings of Prem Rawat Liger Jennifer Lopez Livestock Africanized bee Aphid Bee One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Darwin from Orchids to Variation Haven (TNG episode) Knots Landing
