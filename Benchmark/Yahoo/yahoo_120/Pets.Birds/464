my new cockatiel is months old and it looks like a female but is it my month old cockatiel is colored like many of the pictures i've seen of adult females but is it for sure a female or could it still change coloring to be a male maybe and i am constantly whistleing to it and i whistle the same thing hoping that it will learn i've had it for about weeks and i've been doing it since i've had it and all it does is making a squaking or chirping sound back to me what age would it start whistling if it is able to it has brightish colors in my opinion for only being months old it is gray and has kind of bright orange cheeks and you can tell that the face is yellowish the true colours of a cockateil don't show till the second maulting about mths of age the cheek patch method isn't all that consistant its very hard for someone to know from them if they don't know tiels very well spend mins a day trying to teach it to whistle or talk it generally takes a couple of weeks to come out with its first imitation i found repeptitive thing such as the phone ringing were the first things my tiel learned to imitate when you are training it don't have the tv on or any distracting noises going on in the background so that the only thing the bird is hearing is you and repeat the same thing over and over when you say the tiel is bright doesn't give us much idea of what colour your tiel is is it yellow or white or is it a grey there are many different mutations and not all male tiels have a yellow face Cockatiel Color Hearing impairment The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Shaggy dog story Kender Color blindness Pitaten Collectibles in Bionicle Horse Reservoir Dogs Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Time Out of Mind AFI 100 Years series Yellow Plame affair Capercaillie Color theory Dragon Booster The Ashlee Simpson Show Jiddu Krishnamurti Great Teacher Onizuka Hair color The Fairly OddParents Humphrey Bogart House Sparrow Lesser Goldfinch Aes Sedai Cro Baroque chess Vegeta Gregorian calendar Television Autism Sonic the Hedgehog Hiberno-English Sant Mat Tin whistle Intelligent design Lauren Bacall The Jazz Singer Marching band Hall & Oates Theory of conduct Douglas Adams Spider Avenue Q Milton H.
