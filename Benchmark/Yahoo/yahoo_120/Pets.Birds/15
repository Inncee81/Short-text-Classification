african grey i am looking into getting my first african grey anyone on here have one that could tell me anything they know about them are they noisy in comparison to other parrots is it better to get a baby what age is a good age toi get the parrot at im aware of what it needs as far as housing and toys and enrichment as far as playing with the bird i have also located a good avain vet thats relatively in my area im just wondering what anyones expierences are with these birds i also know of the many subspecies timneh erithacus and the princeps what can you tell me about each im just trying to get as much info from people that have these birds i have done a lot of research on the internet but first hand expierence from real owners would be greatly appreciated thanks everyone for all the speedy responses i was just wondering if they will be ok with other pets in the house i have a bullmastiff who is very mellow and a legged cat that i rescued they both get along almost to well and was wondering how these birds might react to other pets as far as doing my homework i am very well aware of the specific needs of these animals i am a student at cornell veterinary so yes i have done my homework literally i know of all the things to do to keep the bird healthy as far as dietary needs and medical examinations i am just trying to hear first hand expierences with these birds as far as how they would fit in my family texas haha thats great awesome story susan thanks for the info i never intend to get any animal and leave them in thier cage my bullmastiff was crate trained as a puppy and when i wanted to fold the crate up and just let her have the run of the house she gopt very upset so the only reason my dog still even has a crate is because its her security blanket hahah she is like linus without his blanky i was just concerned that the bird would try to bite the dog or the cat because when i am home i intend to always let the animals have the run of the house the only animals i have that stay put are my fish so the main concern is if the bird is early socialized with the dog and the cat would they be able to get along i dont want to have the dog bark and traumatize the bird and in return have the bird compulsively pull out its feathers susan thanks for the info i never intend to get any animal and leave them in thier cage my bullmastiff was crate

and traumatize the bird and in return have the bird compulsively pull out its feathers i've had one for years now and mine isn't really noisy my conure makes far more racket but he is a talker he picks up everything including some things i wish he'd forget fat chance they've got the memory of an elephant they say africans have the cognitive ability of a year old human child mine certainly does he not only says words but whole sentences and he doesn't just mindlessly repeat sounds like most parrots do he not only knows what to say but exactly when to say it once when i had his cage by a window he pulled the curtain into his cage to play with shredded the damn thing too i pulled it out and bogie went right back and pulled it in again then i moved his cage about a foot from the window and the curtain or what was left of it anyway so he goes back ready to do it again reached the bars and realized he couldn't turned to look at me cocked his head and said well sh t i was practically rolling on the floor laughing he also imitates my wife when she's on the phone our bedroom is right next to bogie's room so he gets a real earful sometimes one afternoon my wife and i were changing the sheets on our bed when we heard bogie in the next room in a perfect immitation of my wife's voice hello oh hi lisa my wife's sister how are you noooooo you're trippin' girl i told my wife she'd never be able to cheat on me as long as bogie was alive he'd rat her out in a new york minute he also does noises other than speech and africans are such perfect mimics it's like that old commercial for recording tape is it real or is it memorex he immitates my wife's dog so well the first time i heard him i thought the dog had gotten shut in bogie's room a bus used to go past our house early in the morning and turned the next corner as soon as it passed it had very squeaky brakes and every morning at we heard the driver apply those brakes right in front of our house you could have set your watch by him well bogie did those brakes so well you'd swear that bus was going down my upstairs hall bottom line you'll never be sorry you got an african EastEnders African Grey Parrot RuneScape
