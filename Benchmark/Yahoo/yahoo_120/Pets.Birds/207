do birds need regular vet check ups i know if they are you are supposed to take them to the vet but do they need like shots and regular vet visits i want to get my first pet bird i don't want nothing fancy though just a parakeet my mom is making me pay for everything so i do have a fairley low budget i'm only by the way also do they need like their nails cut and stuff like that basically do they need anything else besides there basic needs and attention is there anything else i need to pay for throughout its life besides the supplies and the bird hi its good your thinking about the aftercare of the bird and if you can afford everything it'll need later on alot of people dont thats why so many drop down dead parrots do not need any shots so your ok there but check ups yes once every months is fine no they shouldnt need there nails trimmed if you make sure you buy a stone perch it will help keep there nails really small and not so sharp something like in this link http www bird com itemdy asp t xs srccode bshoppng also its advisable to buy new toys and swap them around with the ones in the cage now and again but this shouldnt cost too much also consider the cost of buying a few fruit and veggies every week as they need this with there seed everyday but again this is not much at all i would advise putting money to one side so that if anything did go wrong you know you have the money to take it to the vet goodluck with you new bird when you get it Hamster Fancy rat Ferret Dead Parrot Parrot Canary Publicly funded medicine Internet fraud Pet skunk RuneScape quests Mealy Parrot Garfield Wal-Mart Poker jargon RuneScape weapons HyperText Transfer Protocol Supply and demand Manicure Nine Inch Nails RuneScape economy Ocean's Twelve Budgerigar Guinea pig Blood (computer game) Keynesian economics MapleStory RuneScape cheats The Apprentice 2 James T.
