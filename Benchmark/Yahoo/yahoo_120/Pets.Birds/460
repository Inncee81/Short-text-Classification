can roosters that grow up together stay in the same cage i was ordering some chicks and if they grew up from baby to adult will they get along i have females will they fight for teritory or female or will it be ok if they grew up together your question depends on a few things first are you going to be keeping the roosters together by together i mean will they be in the same cage for the time they are with you if you are then there will not be any major fighting yes the roosters will establish who is stronger and better but you will not have any roosters harmed i kept thirteen roosters in one coop once and they all got along with each other but they were with each other since they were chicks now if you are planning to keep the roosters and separate them and then put them back together when they are older you are going to have some problems if you separate them for any time period sometimes even days your roosters will forget each other and start to fight if you do have fighting issues it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to have chicken dinner the rooster will eventually work it out not many roosters will fight to death so you will not have to worry about that unless you are purchasing breeds that are known to fight what you can do if your roosters start to fight is pick them up and put them into cages not together they each must have their own cage this is a time out for them after an hour let them out again if they still continue to fight repeat this it may seem like hard work but one thing it does is work now another thing you may want to consider is that some breeds are calmer then others thus there will be less fighting among them these breeds include the brahma silkie and cochin these breeds do not include jungle fowl leghorns and most bantams the ideal flock numbers are hens per bantam rooster and hens per standard breed rooster good luck Cock (chicken) Cockfight Capercaillie Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Equine conformation Domesticated turkey Egg (food) Infantilism Friends Factory farming Seabird Roots: The Saga of an American Family Magic (illusion) Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prisoner's dilemma Kodocha True Grit Trapping German Shepherd Dog Cochin (chicken) Extreme Programming Pitaten Phaedo Piccolo Junior Saga Nachman of Breslov God Emperor of Dune Terry Taylor Pysanka Chicken Run Mallard Timon and Pumbaa Father's Day (Doctor Who) Weight training Canary John Cage The Strangerhood Johnny Cage AFI 100 Years series Immortality Apollo 8 Sub-Zero U.S. Acres Firearm Livestock Mixed martial arts YuYu Hakusho Agriculture Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Humphrey Bogart Dog Tenshinhan Hamster Abortion debate Divorce Shaggy dog story Emu Garfield and Friends Hemp Avenue Q The Birds (film) Breastfeeding International League Beagle Bird Battle of the Bulge Kakapo Jack Russell Terrier Contract The Amber Spyglass Ayyavazhi mythology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus My Little Pony Woman RuneScape quests Mealy Parrot Johnny 5 Meme Domain Name System Time Chaos Emerald Trade union Daylight saving time Vladimir Peter Tytla Luck Maya calendar Philosophy of space and time Dachshund Professional wrestling match types Mobile Fighter G Gundam Whitney Houston Species Megas XLR Scouting
