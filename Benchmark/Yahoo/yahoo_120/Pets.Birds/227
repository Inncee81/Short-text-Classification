im going to byu a parakeet but there is a prb im going out to bye a parakeet tomorrow but i want it to be around weeks old so i can train it any advise or ideas i bought mine at a local pet shop family owned i am not exactly sure how old he was but from the website i did all my research on according to it he was under months old they're not expensive birds and they're not noisy either mine chirps and tweets all day in different tones and he never gets loud i'm sure if you had a few of them it may get loud but just one is nothing on noise compared to a quaker parrot i've had mine since may and i don't think i've spent no more then maybe bucks on it i bought it for bucks a cage for bucks food was around bucks i feed mine kaytee select blend and i bought a oz container that i bought in the middle of may and it's not even partially used up yet and i give him fresh food daily a rope perch was around bucks you'll need different sized perches along with different textured for mine i've got different sized dowel rods which both cost like under a buck each and one one i've got a perch cover on it and it helps keep his nails trimmed beak trimmed and he even uses to to scratch parts of his body he can't reach like his head i bought him a cuttlebone at the pet shop for around a dollar the cage already had food and water dishes in it but you can get them fairly cheap as well i bought a big bag of millet spray at wal mart for like bucks but if you want one that young you best bet is to to get one from a breeder because most pet shops like pet smart pet co etc most of the time have no clue how old any of their birds are i have no regrets on buying mine i bought it for my mothers day gift from my kids they are to young to go buy it their self lol i've heard allot of ppl complain about how messy parakeets are but to be honest with you mine is not messy at all i even got a old shower board the thing people put up around their bathtubs showers when they have just plain wood or paneling as their walls so it doesn't ruin them and cut squares out that are just a tad bigger then the cage all the way around and i put it under the cage so when his millet spray thats what what makes the most mess or if his pellets do hit the floor it goes on that shower board and all i gotta do is use a broom and dust pan and if any bird poop gets on it just a wet rag is all that is needed i initially did it to put under my quaker parrots' cage because he's the messiest of the good luck and congrats on your new fid feathered kid they are awesome birds Hamster Guinea pig Chicken Wal-Mart Canary Mealy Parrot RuneScape quests Plastic Humphrey Bogart Parrot Pet skunk The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Neopets Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Chinchilla RuneScape weapons Equine conformation Conure Upholstery Customs and etiquette of Japan Shotgun Cat Garfield Mattress John Cage $ale of the Century Poker jargon Fire fighting Capercaillie Kakapo Toilet humour Budgerigar EastEnders Bulk vending Christmas tree Rod Stewart Floppy disk Animal Crossing Monk Parakeet Dead Parrot Social rule Ferret FoxTrot Professional wrestling match types Blood (computer game) Pet Shop Boys Dick and Dom in da Bungalow Salad Fingers Fan (implement) RuneScape Random Events The Marshall Mathers LP Comanche RuneScape economy Nuclear power Bird The Dalek Invasion of Earth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drill bit Toilet paper Game show The Fairly OddParents Religious Society of Friends National Kidney Foundation Singapore Cruising (maritime) Ayyavazhi mythology Plum-headed Parakeet Music Alexandrine Parakeet Psittaciformes Naval mine Aerial (dance move) Discworld gods RuneScape locations Sento Breath of Fire III Solar power Domesticated turkey Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Discus (fish) Little Britain Press Your Luck Textile manufacturing Hazing Babe Ruth Wheel of Fortune Tooth enamel Breastfeeding Frankie Laine Trapping Pet
