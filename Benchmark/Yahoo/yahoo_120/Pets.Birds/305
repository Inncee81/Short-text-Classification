indian ringneck care my mom just got an indian ringneck today and didn't do any research before hand so my question to everyone is what are the basics that we need to know i've been reading that you need to give them pellets instead of seeds but what kind of pellets do they need any special vitamins and what size cage is best it came with a cage but i'm afraid it might be too small what is the best way to help tame them down and is there any information at all about the care of this bird that anyone can give me i know it was irresponsible of her to get this bird without doing her research i'm just trying to do damage control now and figure out how to take care of it properly the pet store said it is years old and it is a female not very tame here are some pics http www flickr com photos little love sets thanks everyone you're right that it was wrong but i am glad you are trying to make it right that's a good first step pellets there are lots of good brands but zupreem is a very popular and easy to find but do buy some seed to mix in at first i would do at least a mix because of the fact the bird was in a petstore and was probably on an all seed diet http www birdcompanions com indianringnecksfaqs htm a cage at least x x since they are a medium parrot they need lots of space to get good excersice it actually looks like the smaller african ringeck but it could be that the bird is a younger bird from teh pics i would get a new cage and alos more toys and a couple different sized and textured perches right now let her rest and try and destress she's probably not very socialized and therefore even more stressed out then a young socialized parrot give her space and probably leave her in a dim room for an hour or so and then check on her and offer a treat try and get her used to you too realize she may nto seem tame cause of how nervous she is but to help her you'll have to give her space and tlak calmly to her as well as moving slowly around her cage so as not to spook her also after a couple days i would either offer her a dish full of lukewarm or cool water to bathe in or perhaps buy a mister at the dollar store fill it with water and mist her really good she probably hasn't bathed in forever i'd go get a book on ringnecks and leanr even mroe on care i'd find an avian vet in your area and get her checked out also since petstores usually don't keep up on those types of things for a couple days put a cuttle bone in her cage too since she has poor diet she could use the extra minerals for now until her diet is mostly pellets along with fruits and veggies i hope you can turn this situation around best of luck Hamster Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Fancy rat Mealy Parrot Canary Garfield Chicken Bird Prostate cancer Social rule Equine conformation Fecal incontinence Ferret XML Pet skunk Sento Shaggy dog story Tocopherol Falconry Infantilism Ramen RuneScape quests Elephant Blood (computer game) Chinchilla Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Japanese tea ceremony Hash table The Apprentice 2 Futurama (TV series - season 2) Urinary incontinence Strap-on dildo Patricia Ford Fugu Brewery CPU cache Vegetarianism Domain Name System Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma John Cage Chronic fatigue syndrome Floppy disk Theory of conduct Veganism Breastfeeding RISC Customs and etiquette of Japan Bread Care Bears Tofu Pikmin Dog Mattress Folic acid Slot machine 613 mitzvot Stomach cancer Hedgehog Dog training Days of our Lives The Time Machine Organic food Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chile pepper Egg (food) StarCraft: Uprising Tooth Anorexia nervosa 2005 Kashmir earthquake Cuisine of Brazil Soap Ice cream Upholstery Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Dead Parrot Animal rights Doom engine Sea-Monkey Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Solar power Trapping Little Britain Hamburger EastEnders Neopets Debugging Childbirth GunZ The Duel Cat Betting (poker) Glossary of partner dance terms Milk
