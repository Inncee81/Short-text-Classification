is it normal african grey is it normal for my african grey to eat whatever i eat he will be months old in august but he likes to eat everythin from snowcones icetea bacon and egg tacos sandwhiches beans and specially nachos he loves nachos he eats like or chips with cheese or sound very little but for a parrot its not he also likes soup cereal nacho cheese french fries spicy peanuts and chips also i have a pet cockatiel and she sings but the african frey just does the sounds that the cockatiel does he dosnt speak or do anything else he also sleeps in a box laying down and not standing upon the stick is this normal or is he just like that at how many months does his eyes start to change color and also speak oh yeah but i dont think it will hurt him because my aunt has a parrot and he also eats tortillas and junk food the parrot is the ones that have the red or yellow head and he turned out alright i aint complaining how you doin' also we almost always have him out of the cage we just put him in the cage when we go out or when we cook because the last time he bit my internet modem cable also when we put him in the cage he starts to go like a chicken or bull and starts to scratch the box and starts going nuts so now tell me is this normal i suppose it's normal for parrots to want sweet salty or high fat foods mine would kill for a pat of butter directly from the fridge but these are not healthful foods for your grey guy if you could start right now directing him toward a diet of fruits veggies grains etc that have the least amount of preservatives and additives that would be a great step to take i eat broccoli in front of my greys while i make big expressions and say goooooood at least that will get them to at least try the veggies i use cooked oatmeal as a base to add fruits and veggies to you may want to try spoon feeding this to your grey many parrots love warm spoon fed goopy stuff there are cautions though about this once the bird becomes sexually mature my parrots get harrison's pellets zupreem pellets and even some human grade granola bars one grey likes organic cereal for breakfast another one likes celery not the best nutrition wise but provides fiber chewing exercise and fluids i also make stew with veggies and a little chicken or lean red meat all my parrots like this especially with a little crust of peanut butter bread mixed in if you haven't heard of it yet look for the book for the love of greys it's great for grey people and actually has a lot of info that will help with any parrot species google for birdie bread too it's something a lot of grey owners make for their birds good luck i hope this helps joan Food Bread Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Japanese cuisine German cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Tofu Hamster MRE Hamburger Hot dog Soul food Cuisine of Brazil Sandwich Vegetarianism Cuisine of the Philippines Snack food Cuisine of Malaysia Guinea pig Peruvian cuisine Veganism Cuisine of the Southern United States Cajun cuisine Chicken French cuisine Korean cuisine Ramen Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Cheese Chili con carne Peanut butter Cuisine of Africa Russian cuisine Pancake Cuisine of Singapore Porridge Peanut Chocolate Domesticated turkey Omega-3 fatty acid Barbecue Polish cuisine French fries Chinese cuisine Bengali cuisine Mealy Parrot British cuisine Roman eating and drinking McDonald's Cereal Soybean Genericized trademark Butter Joke Kosher foods Food guide pyramid Fast-food restaurant Cantonese cuisine Shark Milk Garfield Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Argentina Granola Dumpling Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Bacon In-N-Out Burger Maize Chicken soup Kakapo Potato Breakfast cereal Tortilla The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cookie Comanche Livestock Full English breakfast Fish and chips Organic food Pet skunk Breastfeeding Rice African Grey Parrot D__ner kebab Dim sum Irish cuisine
