fahrenheit what message you think rad bradbury is trying to convey to us in creating this fictional world there are many messages in the novel the first being that of oppression of the individual by the government bradbury wrote fahrenheit during the cold war in a time when the government was extending their reach into the lives of civilians and when the fear of communism was extreme the novel gives off an anti utopian feel as it shows that the perfect world created by the government was not working censorship and bradbury's belief that it should not exist is also a main theme throughout the novel it seems that this censorship came about in two ways in bradbury's world one is that people were doing too many things that are too stimulating e g watching tv listening to loud music etc to concentrate on books it is important that during bradbury's life condensed book were quite popular the other is that someone wants to restrict the knowledge of those around them the government wants to restrict the knowledge of the population the rich want to restrict the knowledge of the poor books are dangerous because people will read them and perhaps think for themselves deriving ideas different from those in power pay close attention to the use of fire as a symbol and how it changes throughout the course of the story at first it is used negatively to destroy knowledge and books in the end however it is used to burn beatty and win freedom Ray Bradbury Fahrenheit 451 Equilibrium (2002 film) Science fiction Propaganda Fahrenheit 9/11 Simone Weil Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Book burning Censorship Wealth The Martian Chronicles Prior restraint Degree Fahrenheit Summa Theologiae Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Democracy Media bias Science fiction film Numerology Utopia Freedom of the press Malcolm Bradbury Modernism Existentialism Advertising Anthroposophy Deconstruction H.
