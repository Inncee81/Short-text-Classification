proofread my memo date july to donald j beale from desiree a dies subject review of netiquette guidelines for university implementation the purpose of this memo is to give a recommendation of netiquettes guidelines that lsu can endorse for its students the two netiquette guidelines that i will be reviewing were both found online the first one is the website study guide and strategies at http www studygs net netiquette htm the second site i ve found is from linfield university at http www linfield edu policy netiquette html there is basic netiquette that is included in both of these guidelines these netiquette rules include do not send email when angry or emotional never send anything electronically that you wouldn t mind seeing made public be sure that any sarcasm or humor is translated in your words to avoid misunderstandings do not forward chain letters obey all copyright laws keep messages brief do not forward chain letters use distribution lists carefully the study s netiquette guideline includes more information about general informal email usage it address issues such as using all capital letters flaming spam and electronic trails this seems to appeal more to the younger population who has been sending rude and offensive emails at lsu the linfield s netiquette guidelines also address flaming but only in the instance of the student sending them the study s flaming guideline only addresses what to do when receiving the abusive message linfield mentions to not leave email account open at a computer when you are away which is definitely a suggestion that applies to all college students using public computers after careful consideration and comparison between both forms of netiquette linfield and study guide and strategies my choice would have to lie with linfield the netiquette policy at linfield university has already been instituted for their student body this is a policy that has been tailored for college students while this is not as stringent of a policy that one would find in the work place for professionals it is not so lax that students can misinterpret its meaning currently most students use e mail for personal correspondence more than for business correspondence because the student is more familiar with sending an e mail to a friend rather and co worker or boss the knowledge of proper netiquette has not been instilled it is better to start promoting proper practices early on in a students college years rather than sending him or her into the work place without the proper netiquette you have do not forward chain letters twice in this paragraph linfield mentions to not leave email account open at a computer when you are away which is definitely a suggestion that applies to all college students using public computers it should be re worded for example linfield advices you to not leave email accounts open at a etc in this paragraph currently most students use e mail for personal correspondence more than for business correspondence because the student is more familiar with sending an e mail to a friend rather and co worker or boss the knowledge of proper netiquette has not been instilled the words after rather should be than a in this paragraph the study s netiquette guideline includes more information about general informal email usage it address issues such as using all capital letters
