car physics please could you help with this explain why a person should always wear a safety belt while travelling in a car explain your answer by making reference to specific principles of physics any help appreciated to put it simply it's because of newton's first law all objects that are in motion remain in motion unless a force is applied you and the car are moving if a collision occurs a force is applied on the car and it stops moving but you will continue to move forward inside the car unless a force like a seatbelt holds you in place Classical mechanics Newton's laws of motion Seat belt Philosophy of space and time Modern geocentrism Inertia Airbag Car safety Gravity Equivalence principle Fictitious force Speed of light Seat belt legislation Faster-than-light Special relativity Kepler's laws of planetary motion Momentum Glossary of partner dance terms Physics Professional wrestling match types Frame of reference Calculus Swingout Luminiferous aether Falsifiability Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Quantum mechanics Friction Philosophy of science Center of mass Plate tectonics Time travel Crash test dummy Science Entropy Mechanism (philosophy) Collision detection Act of Parliament Energy Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Planetary orbit Force Manual transmission Automobile Atomism Action (physics) Collision Road traffic accident Boxing Skateboarding trick Aikido Modified Newtonian dynamics Roller coaster Physical law Scientific method Isaac Newton Glossary of American football Motorcycle Centrifugal force Car handling Black hole 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Lagrangian mechanics Professional wrestling throws Electric field Comet Tire Zeno's paradoxes Summary judgment Law of value Traumatic brain injury Inertial frame of reference Billiards Celestial mechanics Lift (force) Tide Spatial disorientation Coriolis effect Solar system Light Road safety Motorcycle helmet Spacecraft propulsion Philosophy of mathematics Flood geology Navier-Stokes equations Rules of the road Mercedes-Benz A-Class Supernatural Appeal Contract Richard Feynman Time Human sexual behavior Astrodynamics Rail terminology
