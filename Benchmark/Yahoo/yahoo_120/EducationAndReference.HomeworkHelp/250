what are examples of exponential and linear growth if a population has a constant birth rate through time and is never limited by food or disease it has what is known as exponential growth i think it may help http members optusnet com au exponentialist linear vs exponential htm Exponential growth Exponential function Malthusian catastrophe Exponential distribution Overpopulation Normal distribution Logistic function Limits to Growth Chirp Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Thomas Malthus Lotka-Volterra equation Exponentiation Exponential decay Extrapolation Growth rate (group theory) Poisson process Interest Exponential map Polynomial Raymond Kurzweil Moore's law Large numbers Radiometric dating Derivative Cancer Lie group Linear logic Demography Failure rate Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) The Population Bomb Dynamical system Lorentz group Quantum tunneling Tetration Polarization Heat equation Holomorphic function Doomsday argument Associativity Regular expression Hash table Exogenous growth model Trip distribution Complexity classes P and NP Quantum mechanics Matrix exponential Fluctuation theorem Linear differential equation Harmonic oscillator Logistic map Border Gateway Protocol Legendre transformation Reverse mathematics Elementary algebra Fish farming Big O notation Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease E (mathematical constant) Mathematical modelling in epidemiology Scientific notation Biomechanics Dynamic programming Demographic transition Lie algebra Reproduction Anosov diffeomorphism GNU Scientific Library Monochromator Folic acid Matrix (mathematics) Examples of differential equations Fatigue (material) Trigonometric function Fourier transform Technological singularity Ordinary differential equation Analog-to-digital converter Genetically modified food Spacecraft propulsion Unix time Maximum entropy probability distribution Orthogonal matrix Combinatorial species WKB approximation Antiderivative Domestication Analog computer Green-Kubo relations Experience curve effects Generating function Velocity Exponentiation by squaring Linear transformation Isoperimetric dimension World population Polyomino Sociology of religion Exponential family
