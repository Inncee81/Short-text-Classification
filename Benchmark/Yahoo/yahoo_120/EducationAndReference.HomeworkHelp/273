solve for x x logarithms put log in both side log x log by using power rule xlog log divided log on both side x log log press in the calculator x or without using log rule u could also solve in another way x now u have the same base in bothside x x Logarithm Natural logarithm Common logarithm Slide rule PH Large numbers Orders of magnitude ElGamal encryption Elliptic curve cryptography Operational amplifier Decibel Empty product Quantum computer Logarithmic scale Fast Fourier transform Potentiometer Titration Prime number Information entropy Gamma function Benford's law Principle of maximum entropy Shor's algorithm P (complexity) Separation of variables Factorial Tetration E (mathematical constant) Elementary algebra Acoustics Return on investment Median Polynomial interpolation Recursion Convergence of Fourier series Quicksort Acid dissociation constant Bc programming language Physical information Luminosity Signal-to-noise ratio Fisher information SL (complexity) Interactive proof system Richter magnitude scale Parallax Maximum likelihood Log cabin Quartic equation Apparent magnitude Continued fraction Gibbs paradox Space hierarchy theorem Divisor Exponential function Integer factorization Exponentiation Savitch's theorem Quadratic sieve NP-complete Laplace transform Square root Exponentiation by squaring M__bius transformation Minkowski-Bouligand dimension Polylogarithm Irrational number Celestial navigation Global Positioning System Forestry Normal distribution Absolute magnitude Birthday paradox Cepstrum Dimensional analysis Divide and conquer algorithm Polynomial Lambert's W function Analysis of algorithms Fermat number Thread (computer science) Matroid UK Singles Chart Ackermann function Windows XP Golden ratio Time hierarchy theorem Mode choice Pollard's p-1 algorithm Sound pressure level Vedic mathematics Sawmill P-complete Molecular dynamics Rasch model Haversine formula Fitts' law Low (complexity) Information theory
