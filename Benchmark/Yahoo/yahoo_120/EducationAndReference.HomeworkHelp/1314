my summer reading book is tale of two cities i have weeks to read it before school starts i am kind of freaking out not only cause i have little amount of time left but also i tried reading the frist two chapters and i dont get it at all its so annoying that i dont get the book that i dont even have a will to read it but i have to do any of you have any tips first of all relax and stop taking this book so seriously try and enjoy it and try not to fight it understand that dickens wrote at a time when people had tons of throwaway time to spend on long books people didn't have the electronic diversions then they would spend hours each day reading they didn't multitask the middle classes who had leisure time had long hours to fill up and they couldn't jump around from tv channels to i pods to computers do try and appreciate the mentality of the period that produced dickens the lesson in so doing is as important as the story itself the style of dickens is very leisurely it can be loaded with asides and diversions and philosophy if you want you can speedread right to the plot remember that dickens was popular in his day justas stephen king is today people read him because they loved him not because he was forced on them you should read and reread the first few chapters so that you can follow the later story tale of two cities is really one of dickens' easier more plot oriented works once you get past the early chapters the going will get easier if you stop fighting your assignment chapter if you read nothing else read and memorize that first sentence it is one of the most quoted or paraphrased lines in all of literature it was the best of times it was the worst of times the rest of your life you'll see allusions to this if you read literate works such as good newspapers or watch thoughtful commentary on tv the opening chapter merely sets a mood it draws a distinction between france and england keep in mind that the two cities are london and paris and this book is about the french revolution the exciting and highly dramatic and entertaining french revolution i might add chapter something odd happens here the central character to this point mr jarvis lorry has been traveling on a coach jerry has bizzarly called out from the mist to hail the character with a message he approaches the coach almost threatingly a bizzarre message indeed wait at dover for a woman the message is lorry's response is evern odder recalled to life reader you're supposed to be confused and teased you aren'et supposed to understand what is happening this is a tease and to show that others are equally confused the chapter ends with characters reflecting on the message exactly as you the reader do did you hear the message i did what did you make of it nothing at all that's a coincidence for i made the same of it myself chapter another weird chapter what a strange book this dickens he sure is a tease the messager has his message and get this sentence he was on his way to dig some one out of a grave wow talk about high drama that sentence by the way is the last in the paragraph that begins but though the bank was almost always with him so now he sees a multitude of dead faces and to quote a hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spector that is ghost buried how long almost eighteen years reader you see how exciting this stuff is who needs harry potter or king dickens beat them both to the magic the high drama the mystery now get to that book and start exploring it has wonderful things but are you wonderful enough to dig them out happy reading and by the way now you've got me excited about rereading this book which i myself read outside reading in high school several decades ago we did not have to read dickens at all so the way i see it you are the fortunate one you get to read dickens Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Shaggy dog story The Lovely Bones The Catcher in the Rye Scrooge McDuck Literacy The Tale of Genji Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Goldstein's book Storytelling Harry Potter Milton H.
