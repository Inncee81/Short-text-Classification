maths help graphs websites does anyone know good websites that can walk me through graphs while explaining each feature and concept and or can anyone tell me the differences between cos ans sin graphs how to see wether sin or cos is negative how to draw tan graphs how to get equations of different graphs hyperbola parabola how do i get the domain range and maximum and minimum values thanks its really urgent try ask dr math at the website below i have found them very helpful for my kids when they were doing their homework i have long forgotten cos sin etc as far as your last question the minimum value is the lowest value the maximum value is the highest value and the range is what's in between o good luck to you you have questions that would be tough to answer in this format Parabola Trigonometric function Derivative Trajectory Conic section Complex number Equation of time Trigonometric identity TI-89 series Projective transformation Cissoid of Diocles Glossary of graph theory Hyperbola Graph theory Function (mathematics) Ellipse Hyperbolic function Mathematics Quadratic equation Standing wave ratio Cubic equation Planetary orbit RLC circuit Timeline of mathematics Jeopardy!
