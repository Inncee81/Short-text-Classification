foci for hyperbolas does anyone know how to find the foci in the hyperbola equation x x y y i'm wicked confused man you need to put the equation in standard form for a hyperbola do these by completing the square for the x terms and then the y terms balancing on the right side and watch those signs x x y y becomes x x y y write as squares x y divide both sides by x y now we know that the center is and the foci are located at c and c that's c units from the center and how do we find c remember the pythagorean thm c a b where a and b are the denominators under the x and y terms of the hyperbola so c and c sq rt therefore the foci are located at sq rt and sqrt i hope this makes sense to you it's so much harder to type it out than to show it with pencil and paper good luck Conic section Projective transformation Parabola Hyperbola Quadratic equation Trigonometric function Quartic equation Trigonometric identity Ellipse Pythagorean theorem Triangle Square root Maxwell's equations Standard deviation Quaternion Golden ratio Cissoid of Diocles Complex number Kepler's laws of planetary motion Orbit equation Planetary orbit Pentagram Equation of time Pencil Irrational number M__bius transformation Dirac equation Mathematics Hyperbolic function Path integral formulation Exponentiation Dimensional analysis Real number Manifold Nondimensionalization Linear differential equation Cubic equation Planck units Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Glossary of partner dance terms Tangent half-angle formula Black-Scholes Poker jargon Fran__ois Vi__te Apollonius of Perga Linear regression Meantone temperament Haversine formula Einstein's field equation GED Harmonic oscillator Pendulum Split-complex number Boy's surface Coordinates (mathematics) Force Inner product space Continued fraction Hilbert space John Wallis Quantum harmonic oscillator Nicomachean Ethics N-body problem Astrodynamics Absolute value Similarity (mathematics) Quantum tunneling Gaussian elimination Ruler-and-compass construction Quintic equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Joseph Louis Lagrange Siphon Regular polytope Mass Catalan number Augustus De Morgan Theology Gravity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fibonacci number Continuous Fourier transform Ruffini's rule Dot product Normal distribution Vedic mathematics Contract bridge Tangram United States dollar Frame fields in general relativity Relativistic mass Determinant Generating function Square root of 2 Particle in a box Pi On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences
