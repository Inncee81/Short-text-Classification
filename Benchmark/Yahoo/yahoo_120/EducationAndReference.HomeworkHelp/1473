how broad should an ib extended essay topic be to be within words this is a bit embarrassing but i have to admit i have no idea how long a word essay is because i've never written one i've done a word research paper and a page research paper before double spaced but have no idea how long that was since it was years ago i've narrowed my topic down very significantly i started out with ideas from various subjects and in all different directions so this is an achievement i find jared diamond's book collapse very interesting i want to investigate the issue of why strong civilizations fail is it due to fate and uncontrolled factors such as the environment or due to the decisions of the people themselves i would narrow it down to the vikings colonies in greenland and compare and contrast it to the mayan civilization however i do not know if this topic would extend words and if so would it be better to narrow it down to one civilization like the example they give explanations of the collapse of the mayan civilization i am also working on the ib extended essay i would say choose a side environment or people your question could be something like 'to what extent is the downfall of major civilizations due to environmental factors ' that way you don't have to narrow it down to just the vikings and the mayans you can research them and others with all of the possible civilizations to research words should be easy if not maybe you could do to what extent do both environmental factors and the decisions of the people affect the downfall etc if you have a mentor be sure to clear any of this with them if you choose to use it because i'm not an expert particularly about what ib is looking for Guns, Germs, and Steel Democracy Jared Diamond Second language acquisition IB Diploma Programme Franz Boas The Skeptical Environmentalist Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Social psychology Autism GED The Bell Curve Predestination Microeconomics Graduate school Philosophy of language Bj__rn Lomborg Collapse (book) Sea level rise Appeal Divorce Philatelic investment Race and intelligence Fair use Sexual orientation Economy of Africa Economics MP3 Black hole Academic publishing Cultural relativism Wood Science Gamma ray burst Corporate governance Psychology Infantilism Intelligence quotient Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Species Yuri Knorosov Inflation Biology and sexual orientation Maya civilization Bogdanov Affair David Hume Mathematics Plagiarism Theory of conduct Book of Mormon Tobacco smoking Indigenous peoples Patriotism Cognitive science Magnetic resonance imaging Ecology Theology Benjamin Whorf Asthma Ethics Child sexuality DDT Sylvanus Morley Cyprus dispute Homeschooling Geography A New Kind of Science American liberalism Nutrition Time travel Transsexuality Theory of the firm Thomas Pynchon End of civilization Inuit Animal cognition Human Theodicy Organic food Space colonization Homophobia Logic Francis Crick Expert system Terminal ballistics Voter turnout Duesberg hypothesis Gbe languages History of Greenland Model (economics) Speciesism Civilization Land use forecasting Australian constitutional law Viking Ozone depletion Plame affair
