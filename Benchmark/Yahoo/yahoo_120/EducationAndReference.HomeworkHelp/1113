help please hello i need help with the question that i am stumped on i think i have an idea but i'm not sure here it is hydrogen sulfide is composed of two elements hydrogen and sulfur in an experiment g of hydrogen sulfide is full decomposed into its elements a if g of hydrogen is obtained in this experiemtn how many grams of sulfur must be ontained b what fundemental law does this experiemnt demonstrate c how is this law explained by dalton's atomic theory for b would it be the law of conservation of mass or law of multiple proportions i know the answer for a but not c or b thank you it's the law of multiple proportions the law of multiple proportions is one of the most basic laws of stoichiometry it is related to the law of definite proportions it is sometimes called dalton's law after its discoverer the english chemist john dalton though this usually refers to his law of partial pressures one statement of the law is if two elements form more than one compound between them then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers for part c dalton's atomic theory it was concluded that so far from dalton being led to the idea that chemical combination consists in the interaction of atoms of definite and characteristic weight by his search for an explanation of the law of multiple proportions the idea of atomic structure arose in his mind as a purely physical concept forced upon him by study of the physical properties of the atmosphere and other gases part a which you solved is an example of what the law of multiple proportions is all about John Dalton Hydrogen Atom Explosive material Chemical element Atomism Physics Sulfur Gravity Molecule Mass Sulfuric acid Carbon Stoichiometry Quantum mechanics Nuclear magnetic resonance Hydride Origin of life Helium Temperature Hydrogen sulfide Alternative biochemistry Atomic mass Mineral Nuclear weapon design Solar system Technetium Mole (unit) Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Sulfide Big Bang Titanium Emergence Ammonia Nickel Physical science Aluminium Avogadro's number Supernova Organic chemistry History of chemistry Silver Rocket fuel Equivalence principle Flue gas desulfurization Subatomic particle Periodic table Hydrogen economy Physical cosmology Oxygen Chlorine Dmitri Mendeleev Timeline of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and random processes Particle physics Alcohol Isotope separation Atomic orbital Atomic mass unit Sodium Philosophy of language Vacuum Neutron Battery (electricity) Solar cell Timeline of quantum mechanics, molecular physics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics Antoine Lavoisier Hydrochloric acid Gasoline Haloalkane Entropy Force Orbital hybridisation Electron Teller-Ulam design Phase (matter) Classical mechanics Radium Iron Mass spectrometry Dynamical system Internal combustion engine Normal distribution Covalent bond Hydrogen atom Nuclear fusion Photosynthesis Science History of the periodic table Permian-Triassic extinction event Jupiter Hydrogen chloride
