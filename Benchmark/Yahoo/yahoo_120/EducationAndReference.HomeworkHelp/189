can someone help me figure out this problem i am solving for coordinats and the vertex x x y y i think you mean x x y y which rearranges to give the equation of a circle to rearrange you have to complete the square x x y y x x y y x x y y x x y y x y x y this is the equation of a circle with center and with radius i've never heard the term vertex associated with a circle before so this is as far as i can go Conic section Triangle Archimedes Cissoid of Diocles Glossary of graph theory Flag of the People's Republic of China Circle Dynamic programming Catalan number Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace 24-cell Trigonometric function Planetary orbit Volume Torque Complex number Ruler-and-compass construction Kepler's laws of planetary motion Pascal's triangle M__bius transformation Graph theory Geodesy Pi Dual polyhedron Leonhard Euler Z-transform Quadratic equation Aliasing Sphere Dirac equation 5 (number) Regular polytope Simplex algorithm Desargues' theorem IP (complexity) Formal power series Longitude Hamiltonian path Signed graph Haversine formula Galois theory Loop-erased random walk Platonic solid Renormalization Great circle Geometry Dynamical system Circular motion Modified Newtonian dynamics Collision detection Projective transformation Stereographic projection Parabola Neighbourhood (mathematics) Polynomial Dijkstra's algorithm Graph coloring Trilateration Planar graph Reuleaux triangle Escape velocity Euler's formula SL (complexity) Quaternion Einstein's field equation Area (geometry) Hipparchus (astronomer) Sudoku NP-complete Dividing a circle into areas Joseph Louis Lagrange Recurrence relation Line at infinity Sun Astrodynamics Descartes' theorem Linear programming Matroid Angle Quartic equation Ordinary differential equation Literate programming Tessellation Spherical trigonometry Sim__on Denis Poisson Hyperbolic geometry Dimensional analysis Curve Nondimensionalization Equation of time Squaring the circle Exact solutions in general relativity Savitch's theorem Stress (physics) Algorithm Hamiltonian mechanics Map projection
