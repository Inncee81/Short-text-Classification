algebra question solving for variables if x y and x y what is the value of x answer x would someone please show me step by step how to get that thanks i assume the is supposed to be an and you hit the shift button ok since x y you can multiply both sides of the equation by to get x y then you can subtract this equation from the first and the y variables will cancel out x y x x x Elementary algebra Quartic equation Ordinary differential equation Gaussian elimination Trigonometric identity Vedic mathematics Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Two's complement Square root Algebraic geometry Formal power series Separation of variables Discrete Fourier transform Exponentiation State space (controls) Linear equation Complex number Microeconomics Cissoid of Diocles Boolean algebra Derivative Mathematics Dimensional analysis Newton's method Bayes' theorem Linear algebra Quadratic equation Linear differential equation COBOL Cube root George Peacock Irrational number Cubic equation Galois theory Heat equation Kalman filter Diophantine equation Linear regression XSL attack Ruler-and-compass construction Polynomial IP (complexity) Partial fraction Prime number Keynesian economics Binary numeral system Exponential function Algebra M__bius transformation Function (mathematics) Exponential family Lambda calculus Dirac equation Clifford algebra Numerical analysis Matrix (mathematics) Basis (linear algebra) Recurrence relation Projective transformation Arbitrary constant of integration Joseph Louis Lagrange Lagrange multipliers Newton's identities Land use forecasting Quasigroup Orthogonal matrix Slide rule LU decomposition Sturm-Liouville theory Variance Verlet integration Doomsday rule Standard deviation Infinity Determinism Navier-Stokes equations Examples of differential equations Mathematical model Quaternion Two-body problem Conic section Buckingham Pi theorem Laplace transform Wheel of Fortune Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics) Elementary arithmetic Cholesky decomposition PID controller Division (mathematics) Stochastic process Inequality Planetary orbit Complexity classes P and NP Fibonacci number Basel problem Renormalization Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Quantum logic
