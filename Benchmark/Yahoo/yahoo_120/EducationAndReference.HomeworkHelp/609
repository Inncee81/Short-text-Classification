can you give me a few reasons why it is good to have capital punishment thanks i am writing a compare and contrast essay about capital punishment i need details of why it is good to have capital punishments that is definitely the tougher side to argue most of the arguments for the death penalty are emotional in nature how can you let a person live who just drowned her three children there was also a recent study which said that for every prisoner executed x number of murders were prevented but from what i understand that study did not stand up very well to scrutiny from a logical standpoint the anti capital punishment stance wins hands down by far the most compelling reason is this sometimes the legal system gets it wrong look at all the people who have been released after years of imprisonment because they were exonerated by dna evidence unfortunately dna evidence is not available in most cases no matter how rare it is the government should not risk executing one single innocent person really that should be reason enough for most people if you need more read on because of the extra expense of prosecuting a dp case and the appeals process which is necessary see reason it costs taxpayers much more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life the deterrent effect is questionable at best violent crime rates are actually higher in death penalty states this may seem counterintuitive and there are many theories about why this is ted bundy saw it as a challenge so he chose florida the most active execution state at the time to carry out his final murder spree personally i think it has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murder by killing people the government becomes the bad parent who says do as i say not as i do there s also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst of our criminals let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell and think about the freedom they don t have until they rot of old age when ted bundy was finally arrested in he told the police officer i wish you had killed me the u s government is supposed to be secular but for those who invoke christian law in this debate you can find arguments both for and against the death penalty in the bible for example matthew insists that violence shall not beget violence james says that god is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice leviticus warns against vengeance which really is what the death penalty amounts to in john jesus himself says let he who is without sin cast the first stone Capital punishment in the United States Murder Abortion debate Miscarriage of justice Rape Appeal Theory of conduct Sin Mumia Abu-Jamal Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Ted Bundy Plame affair Serial killer Ten Commandments Arguments for and against drug prohibition Gun politics Henry Lee Lucas Resurrection of Jesus O.
