if the given values are cos a and a im trying to find the hypotenuse any info would be helpful let the triangle be abc with the right angle at b then a c b cos a hence c b using pythagoras c b substitute from for c in b b b b b sqrt sqrt Trigonometric function Triangle Trigonometric identity Pythagorean theorem Trajectory Pentagram Cissoid of Diocles Ellipse Coordinates (mathematics) Angle Trigonometry Complex number RLC circuit Boy's surface Pendulum Particle in a box Dot product Spherical harmonics Tetrahedron Harmonic oscillator Conic section Great-circle distance Multiple integral Square root Haversine formula Golden ratio Parabola Cubic equation Pentagon Quaternion Absolute value Coordinate rotation Hyperbolic function Compton scattering Parallel postulate Kepler's laws of planetary motion Heron's formula Linear differential equation L__vy C curve Gloss (material appearance) Mathieu function Circle Projective transformation Methods of contour integration Pi Prosthaphaeresis Ruler-and-compass construction Crystallographic restriction theorem Debye model Standard model (basic details) Imaginary unit Grover's algorithm Bessel function Quartic equation Josip Plemelj Autoregressive moving average model Proper time Higher-order function Tsirelson's bound Ordinary differential equation 3D projection Euclidean space Quaternions and spatial rotation Absolute magnitude Elliptic integral Phase-locked loop TI-89 series Gas in a box Impedance Planck's law of black body radiation Normal distribution Inner product space Jacobi's elliptic functions Phonon Green's function Euler's formula Orthogonal matrix Semi-major axis Regression analysis Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Nondimensionalization Recurrence relation Altitude Snell's law Generating trigonometric tables Schwarz-Christoffel mapping Roman surface Quantum tunneling Congruence (geometry) Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Laplace transform Vector (spatial) Tetration Alternating current M__bius transformation Airy function Horizontal coordinate system
