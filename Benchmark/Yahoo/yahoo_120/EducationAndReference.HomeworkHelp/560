can anybody give me the names of chemist's and their contributions i need this before august for school a little research on the internet and you could have found this also lorenzo romano amedeo carlo avogadro count of quaregna and cerreto august july was an italian savant chemist most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight as a tribute to him the number of elementary entities atoms molecules ions or other particles in one mole of a substance x is known as avogadro's number the sabatier reaction or sabatier process involves the reaction of hydrogen with carbon dioxide at elevated temperatures and pressures in the presence of a nickel catalyst to produce methane and water optionally ruthenium on alumina makes a more efficient catalyst it is described by the following reaction co h ch h o it was discovered by the french chemist paul sabatier louis pasteur was born on december in dole in the region of jura france his discovery that most infectious diseases are caused by germs known as the germ theory of disease is one of the most important in medical history his work became the foundation for the science of microbiology and a cornerstone of modern medicine pasteur's phenomenal contributions to microbiology and medicine can be summarized as follows first he championed changes in hospital practices to minimize the spread of disease by microbes second he discovered that weakened forms of a microbe could be used as an immunization against more virulent forms of the microbe third pasteur found that rabies was transmitted by agents so small they could not be seen under a microscope thus revealing the world of viruses as a result he developed techniques to vaccinate dogs against rabies and to treat humans bitten by rabid dogs and fourth pasteur developed pasteurization a process by which harmful microbes in perishable food products are destroyed using heat without destroying the food lloyd augustus hall june january an industrial food chemist lloyd augustus hall revolutionized the meatpacking industry with his development of curing salts for the processing and reserving of meats he developed a technique of flash driving evaporating and a technique of sterilization with ethylene oxide which is still used by medical professionals today marie curie pioneered radioactivity research she was the first two time nobel laureate and the only person to win the award in two different sciences linus pauling won chemistry and peace she was the first woman to win a nobel prize marie curie was the first female professor at the sorbonne ernest rutherford discovered and named alpha and beta decay and coined the terms alpha beta and gamma rays he demonstrated radioactivity was the spontaneous disintegration of atoms and was the first person to artificially disintegrate an element he identifed alpha particles as helium nuclei rutherford's gold foil experiment helped describe the nuclear structure of the atom the deflection of the alpha particles implied the existence of a dense positively charged central region containing most of the atomic mass in he hypothesized the existence of the neutron sir joseph john thomson discovered the electron emil abderhalden is known for a blood test for pregnancy a test for cystine in urine and for explaining the abderhalden kaufmann lignac syndrome a recessive genetic condition peter agre born january is an american medical doctor and molecular biologist who was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry which he shared with roderick mackinnon for his discovery of aquaporins svante august arrhenius february october was a swedish chemist and one of the founders of the science of physical chemistry the arrhenius equation and the lunar crater arrhenius are named after him Radiometric dating Science Iron Abiogenesis Sulfur Nutrition Ruthenium Nuclear power Cracking (chemistry) California Institute of Technology Fusion power Manhattan Project Biology Supernova Protein Diabetes mellitus HIV Gravitational radiation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Molecule Ammonia Enzyme AIDS reappraisal Chemical reaction Nuclear explosion Bacteria Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Methane Sun Radionuclide
