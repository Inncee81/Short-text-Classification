help me with this problem please teach me how to do find the points of intersection for x x and x y it is probably written wrong in order to have points of intersection you must be able to plot both equations on the xy axis there is no y in the first equation perhaps the first equation is x x y then adding the two equations together give you x x x x or x and x then substitution in the equation y x give you the intercepts and Cissoid of Diocles Conic section Ordinary differential equation Quadratic equation Projective transformation Astrodynamics Aberration in optical systems Parabola Cubic equation Equation of time Joseph Louis Lagrange Cournot competition Slope Collision detection Dirac equation Elementary algebra Hyperbola Line at infinity Bessel function Trajectory Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Roman surface Curve fitting Desargues' theorem Polynomial Ellipse Bose gas Geographic coordinate system Trigonometric function Diophantine equation Equation of motion Kepler's laws of planetary motion Point groups in three dimensions Geodesy Recurrence relation Longitude Dynamical system Keplerian problem Coordinates (mathematics) Huzita's axioms Special relativity Complex number Pendulum Random walk Path integral formulation Ruler-and-compass construction Exact solutions in general relativity Arthur Cayley Covariance and contravariance Duality (projective geometry) Cartesian coordinate system Semi-major axis Particle in a box Quartic equation Porism Planetary orbit Diffraction Sturm-Liouville theory Ecliptic Moment of inertia Fran__ois Vi__te Equation solving Linear equation Einstein's field equation Equinox Sundial Gr__bner basis Incidence (geometry) Gaussian elimination Orthogonal matrix Polynomial interpolation Torque Microeconomics Modern portfolio theory Linear differential equation Apollonius of Perga Archimedes Numerical analysis Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Elliptic curve Boy's surface Root-finding algorithm Quintic equation Simplex algorithm Tangent half-angle formula Coriolis effect Year Euclidean plane isometry Geometry Horoscope Derivative Nondimensionalization Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Algebraic geometry Adjoint functors Luminiferous aether Perturbation theory Phase space Supply and demand Stereographic projection
