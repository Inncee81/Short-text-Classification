th grade students and alluminiz please i need project help hi every i am a th grade student i desperately need a gud topic for chem project i will be soo gr ful if u could please be kind enought to help me out do sugggest some topics and also how to do them please fast you'll probably need a tripod stand for this get three different types of food like cheetos or cheese nips then get a metal cup can and drill two holes on either side near the top place a nail through each hole and set it on a bunsen burner stand so that the nails are balancing the cup measure a certain amount of tap water in them take a thermometer and take the temperature of the water weigh one cheeto food product on a electronic balance get a pair of tongs hold the piece of food in the tongs and light the piece of food on fire while holding it under the cup of water let the piece burn until it's as much burned as it can be weigh it on the scale once more take the temperature of the water after the food is done burning do with a couple of other pieces of food subtract the amount of the piece before and after find the difference between the temperatures also there should be an equation available by your chemistry teacher involving temperature temperature changed moles the grams of the difference between the food of before after and the volume of the water this experiment helps you show how much energy you burn from food Temperature Explosive material Energy Motor oil Mole (unit) Mass Carbon dioxide Welding Heat Photosynthesis E85 Ecology Forge Screw Solar cell Hydrogen Diamond Transformer Mercury (element) Acid Calorimeter Diode Furnace Hydrogen sulfide Bunsen burner Japanese tea ceremony Nuclear power Global climate model Bong Hand grenade Concentration Robot Master Superconductivity Chemical reaction Dairy Ocean thermal energy conversion Thermocouple Solar power Hydrogen economy Portable stove Avogadro's number Liquid crystal Opportunity rover Casting Resistor Circuit design Dieting Steam engine Spark plug Pottery Methanol Entropy Atkins Nutritional Approach Handloading Coffee Technetium Alcohol fuel Omega-3 fatty acid Acetic acid Plasma (physics) Water (molecule) Titanium Hydroponics Magnesium Chemistry Campfire Planck units Incineration Aluminium Standard enthalpy change of fusion Gravity Porosity Brewery Breakfast Hydrogen peroxide Physics Combustion Fire fighting Sulfur Seismic retrofit Harp Cold fusion Radiometric dating Iron Big Bang Renewable energy Optical fiber Energy development Supernova Thermodynamics Metalworking Nuclear reaction Portland cement Dimensional analysis Fire Oxygen sensor
