help i just spilled water all over my laptop keyboard what should i do i have a notebook laptop and i spilled a glass of water on the keyboard i dried as much as i could turned it off and opened everything to dry it out when i tried to turn it on the power worked and the screen flashed the notebook logo but then it went black i turned it off and everytime i turned it back on the power came on but the screen was black i had this exact same thing happen to me with a powerbook unfortunately mine never worked properly again but what i learned might be able to help you i think the best thing to do is to open the laptop up turn it upside down and just let it dry out for about a week there is probably some moisture somewhere inside that is causing a short if you keep trying to turn it on like i did it could cause permanent damage if you get really desperate you might try drying it out with a hair dryer good luck Laptop PowerBook Hard disk Apple Macintosh Universal Serial Bus IBM PC compatible Floppy disk ThinkPad Serial Macintosh Portable Apple Computer Personal computer Battery (electricity) Desktop computer PowerBook G3 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina First Battle of the Atlantic PowerBook G4 Tofu Touchpad Desknote Upholstery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Wi-Fi Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
