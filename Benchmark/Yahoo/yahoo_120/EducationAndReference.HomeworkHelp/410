plzzz help me w these problems find the height and the volume of a regular hexagonal pyramid with lateral edges inches and base edges inches show all work the measurements of the sides of a triangle are consecutive even integers and the perimeter of the triangle is inches find the length of the sides and find the area of the triangle show all work find the volume of a prism that has a height of centimeters and an equilateral triangle for a base where each base edge measures centimeters show all work for this one you need to draw it and you have to know the formula i can't help you with it here since they are consecutive even integers side x side x side x perimeter is in so x x x x x so the sides are and in by heron's formula the area of a triangle is a sqrt p p a p b p c where p is half the perimeter and a b and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle plugging into heron's formula to get the area a sqrt sqrt in the volume of a triangular prism is just area of the base x height to find the area of the base we can use heron's formula again perimeter so by heron's formula a sqrt sqrt cm so the volume of the prism is v a x h cm Triangle Tetrahedron Area (geometry) Polyhedron Circle Trigonometric function Johnson solid Heron's formula Pi Trigonometric identity Lattice (group) Volume Simplex Octahedron Cissoid of Diocles Multiple integral Golden ratio Complex number Monochromator Pentagram Combinatorics Angle Crystallographic restriction theorem Regular polytope Square root On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Pythagorean theorem Archimedes Ruler-and-compass construction Irrational number Great Pyramid of Giza Continued fraction Hexagonal lattice Catalan number Platonic solid Metre Diamond cut Fibonacci number Tessellation Golf club (equipment) Distance Norm (mathematics) Lagrangian point 300 (number) Collision detection Hyperbolic function Glossary of graph theory Reuleaux triangle Sphere packing Pick's theorem Point groups in three dimensions Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Stirling's approximation Pentagon Geometry Analytic geometry Speed of light Determinant John Wallis Square root of 2 Icosahedron Semiregular polyhedra Oceanic trench 200 (number) Astrodynamics Cellular automaton Langmuir probe Riemann integral Vector (spatial) Euclidean geometry Traveling salesman problem Koch curve Stairway Tire Sea level rise Pappus of Alexandria 400 (number) Abdomen 1000 (number) Dispersion (optics) Dimensional analysis Sierpinski triangle Haversine formula Euler characteristic Pyramid Parallax Ramsey's theorem 120 (number) Debye model Violin Josip Plemelj Andreini tessellation Quartic equation 500 (number)
