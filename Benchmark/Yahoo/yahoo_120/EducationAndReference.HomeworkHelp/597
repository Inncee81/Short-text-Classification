what is the relationship the united states has to the issue of glabal warming question on a research project man is not causing global warming check nasa and other observers and you will find mars is experiencing warming as well as earth unless someone is exporting year old automobiles to mars and the martians are driving them a lot then we aren't causing this the planet s climate oscillates it goes through cycles in the it was global cooling scare and we all lost freedoms associated with government regulations and the reason was because we would all freeze to death by the last mini ice age was about years ago when all the people on earth burned wood and drove horses in the s and s we were killing the ozone layer and we would all die by from skin cancer that cost us the freon we used in our air conditioners now we have another less efficient less effective gas that is trying to work as well and failing do you know what ozone is it is breathing oxygen on steroids breathing oxygen is o ozone is o the sun energy at high altitude fuses these atoms the sun makes ozone so unless you have a big fire extinguisher you are not going to stop ozone production the people who are perpetrating this nonsense are politically motivated the leader of the current chicken little screaming bs is a man named al gore he was vice president under president clinton he was heard to lay claim to inventing the internet and now claims to be a world renowned climatologist he didn't invent the net and he isn't a scientist he is a politician interested in having greater control over you and emptying your wallet a bit faster a real climatologist the one considered by many to be the father of the science of climatology call the whole scare bogus i have done my part to curb global warming according to the radio if i replace light bulbs with those ugly weak florescent bulbs i will have done the same as removing cars from the road i think i am slightly over a million now so everything will be fine please be careful when someone starts screaming the sky is falling because while you are looking up they are tying your ankles together and stealing your wallet if this is for grade school and you want a good grade you will have to claim america is totally responsible that has to be a fact regardless of the fact that china puts out more than we do oh but they only pump out the poison because we buy manufactured goods from them so that s our fault too accept full blame for the whole bogus issue and your teacher will love you btw grazing animals produce more co than automobiles Carbon dioxide Ozone layer Solar variation Air conditioning Haloalkane Mars Effects of global warming Ecology Tropical cyclone Earth's atmosphere Energy development Renewable energy Fire fighting Carburetor Future energy development Kyoto Protocol Scientific opinion on climate change Nuclear power E85 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Moon Global climate model Fluorescent lamp Urban heat island Vacuum tube Air pollution Greenhouse effect Turbocharger Welding Incandescent light bulb National Aeronautics and Space Administration Terraforming Global cooling Water (molecule) Ultraviolet Global warming and agriculture Solar system Exploration of Mars Lighting Permian-Triassic extinction event Fuel cell Petroleum STS-62 Spirit rover Fire Space disaster Carbon dioxide sink Extraterrestrial life Jet engine Hydrogen peroxide Paleoclimatology Richard Lindzen Ionosphere Peat Solar power Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gliding Greenhouse gas Sewage treatment Planetary habitability Causality Mars Exploration Rover Vacuum Astronomy on Mars Alcohol fuel Sea level rise Automobile Tire Earth Battery (electricity) Battery electric vehicle Mercury (planet) Great Depression Ocean thermal energy conversion Chernobyl accident Opportunity rover Helium Gasoline Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Toyota Prius Al Gore Wind power Nintendo The Day After Tomorrow Unidentified flying object Gravity
