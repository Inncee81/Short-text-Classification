where can i find a argumentive essay on juvenile boot camps i am looking for a website that can help me with a argumentive essay on juvenile boot camps the pros and cons in the following viewpoint eric peterson contends that boot camps for juvenile criminals which provide military style discipline and physical training can have positive results he asserts that participants' academic skills improve and that many of these youths find jobs after leaving the camp in addition he claims boot camps are less costly than traditional confinement while peterson concedes that these programs are not as successful as more traditional programs at reducing recidivism he argues that boot camps can achieve their goals if they follow certain guidelines peterson is a program manager in the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention's ojjdp research and program development division as you read consider the following questions according to peterson what was the program completion rate in cleveland in the author's view what population should be targeted for boot camp what services should aftercare programs provide according to peterson in response to a significant increase in juvenile arrests and repeat offenses over the past decade several states and many localities have established juvenile boot camps the first juvenile boot camp programs modeled after boot camps for adult offenders emphasized military style discipline and physical conditioning the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ojjdp has supported the development of three juvenile boot camp demonstration sites this viewpoint describes those demonstration projects their evaluations and lessons learned that will benefit future boot camp programs highly structured programs in ojjdp funded three juvenile boot camps designed to address the special needs and circumstances of adolescent offenders the programs were conducted in cleveland ohio denver colorado and mobile alabama focusing on a target population of adjudicated nonviolent offenders under the age of the boot camp programs were designed as highly structured month residential programs followed by to months of community based aftercare during the aftercare period youth were to pursue academic and vocational training or employment while under intensive but progressively diminishing supervision ojjdp undertook impact evaluations for all three sites that compared the recidivism rates for juveniles who participated in the pilot programs with those of control groups the evaluations also compared the cost effectiveness of juvenile boot camps with other dispositional alternatives reports of the three impact evaluations are available the evaluations of the mobile and cleveland programs are interim reports that present data from the earliest cohorts as neither program had stabilized when the data were collected ojjdp is considering expanding the evaluation to include the remaining cohorts the denver program is no longer active success and failure most juvenile boot camp participants completed the residential program and graduated to aftercare program completion rates were percent in cleveland percent in mobile and percent in denver at the two sites where educational gains were measured substantial improvements in academic skills were noted in mobile approximately three quarters of the participants improved their performance in reading spelling language and math by one grade level or more in cleveland the average juvenile boot camp participant improved reading spelling and math skills by approximately one grade level in addition where employment records were available a significant number of participants found jobs while in aftercare the pilot programs however did not demonstrate a reduction in recidivism in denver and mobile no statistically significant difference could be found between the recidivism rates of juvenile boot camp participants and those of the control groups youth confined in state or county institutions or released on probation in cleveland pilot program participants evidenced a higher recidivism rate than juvenile offenders confined in traditional juvenile correctional facilities it should be noted that none of the sites fully implemented ojjdp's model juvenile boot camp guidelines and that some critical aftercare support services were not provided lessons learned several significant lessons have emerged from the pilot programs the appropriate population should be targeted boot camps should be designed as an intermediate intervention at one site youth who had been previously confined were significantly more likely to recidivate while youth with the least serious offenses were also more likely to recidivate facility location is important cost issues and community resistance were major obstacles to securing residential and aftercare facilities to increase attendance and reduce problems aftercare facilities should be located in gang neutral areas accessible by public transportation staff selection and training needs are critical to reduce staff turnover fill gaps in critical services and ensure consistent programming the screening selection and training of juvenile boot camp and aftercare staff must be sensitive to the programmatic and operational features of a juvenile boot camp this is particularly important with regard to youth development issues the importance of aftercare moreover continuous treatment between the residential and aftercare phases should be integrated philosophically and programmatically particularly through staffing aftercare programs are challenging to implement successful aftercare programs require attention at the outset to develop a comprehensive model with the flexibility to respond to local needs and concerns aftercare programs are unlikely to succeed if their participants fail to receive the full range of services prescribed for them aftercare programs must be broad based and flexible enough to meet the particular educational employment counseling and support needs of each participant the aftercare component should form dynamic linkages with other community services especially youth service agencies schools and employers coordination among agencies must be maintained all three sites experienced difficulties in maintaining coordination among the participating agencies considerable attention should be paid to building and maintaining a consensus among participating organizations concerning the program's philosophy and procedures evaluating the results effective evaluation begins with planning to assess the program's successes and failures quantifiable data should be collected about participation in treatment by juveniles in the boot camp and in the control group measures of program success should include a broad spectrum of outcomes recidivism measures should capture all subsequent delinquent activity not simply the first new adjudication and data on new offenses should include information on the origin and circumstances of the complaint to determine whether there is a monitoring effect in which the intensity of the supervision causes an increase in recorded offending when boot camps are used as an alternative to confinement savings can be achieved communities often implement juvenile boot camps in part to reduce costs the experience of the pilot sites indicates that when boot camps are used as an alternative to traditional confinement costs can be reduced considerably because of the significantly shorter residential stay however if boot camps are used as an alternative to probation savings will not be realized juvenile boot camps embrace a variety of objectives reducing recidivism improving academic performance cutting the cost of treating juvenile offenders and inculcating the values of self discipline and hard work in attempting to reach these objectives ojjdp is collaborating with the office of justice programs ojp to enhance program models policies and practices of juvenile boot camps as a result many of the lessons learned from ojjdp's three demonstration sites have been incorporated in the ojp boot camp corrections program
