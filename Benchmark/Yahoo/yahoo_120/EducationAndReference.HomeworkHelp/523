biology homework help please polymerization is a process that a creates bonds between amino acids in the formation of a peptide chain b involves the removal of a water molecule c links the phosphate of on nucleotide with the sugar of the next d requires a condensation reaction adenine and guanine are the man who determined the amino acid sequence of insulin was a pentose joined to a nitrogenous base and a phosphate group is called membranes are composed of a bilayer of thanks to anyone who helps i know it's a lot of questions but i couldn't find the information in the book for number another answer could be e involves all of the above only one is a blatant answer yes i'm one of those evil mom types lol i compiled this list in less than four minutes search engines and wikipedia are a student's best friend Francis Crick DNA Amino acid RNA Origin of life Genetic code Cell (biology) Deoxyribose Nucleic acid Protein Insulin Polymerization Photosynthesis Protein kinase Polymerase chain reaction Transfer RNA Messenger RNA Glycosidic bond Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids Whole proteome analysis Protein sequencing Miller-Urey experiment Primer (molecular biology) Cellular respiration Maillard reaction Timeline of biology and organic chemistry Ammonia Lipid Hydrolysis Nutrition James D.
