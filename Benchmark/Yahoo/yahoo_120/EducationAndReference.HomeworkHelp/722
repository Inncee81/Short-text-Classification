please help me with these math problems what is the area of a square inscribed ina circle with radius what is the area of an equilateral triangle with perimeter leave in square root form if the radius is then the diameter is if a square is inscribed in a circle then the diameter of the circle is the same as the diagonal of the square since you know the diagonal of the square you can find the length of the sides let x length of the sides of the square then x the area of the square and x x x divide both sides by x therefore the area is i'm not sure what background you have you can either use trig to find the height or algebra if the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is then each side has length you can form a right triangle to find the height the resulting equation comes from the pythagorean theorem and it is h h h h sqrt the area is b h sqrt sqrt sqrt because the sqrt can be written as sqrt sqrt Triangle Pythagorean theorem Pi Circle Square root Trigonometric identity Cissoid of Diocles Area (geometry) Pentagram Complex number Quartic equation Square root of 2 Quadratic equation Archimedes Golden ratio Ruler-and-compass construction Hipparchus (astronomer) Multiple integral Heron's formula Ptolemaios's theorem Fibonacci number Exponentiation Haversine formula Angle Tetrahedron Geometry Spherical trigonometry Reuleaux triangle Standard deviation John Wallis Linear differential equation Inner product space Kepler's laws of planetary motion Norm (mathematics) Dimensional analysis Normal distribution Escape velocity Quaternion Crystallographic restriction theorem Quadrilateral Conic section Wallpaper group Polygon Pentagon Pascal's triangle Platonic solid Cholesky decomposition Length of an arc Boy's surface Ellipse Ruffini's rule Euclid's Elements Timeline of mathematics Dirac equation Regular polytope Tessellation Pappus of Alexandria Semi-major axis Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Great-circle distance Constructible polygon Frame fields in general relativity Matrix (mathematics) Linear regression Distance Real number Lattice (group) Heat equation Parallax Combinatorics Lagrangian point Methods of contour integration Hilbert space Symmetry Langmuir probe Mathematics Convergence of Fourier series Polynomial Determinant Metric tensor (general relativity) Proper time Euclidean distance Josip Plemelj Parabola Octahedron QR decomposition Rotational symmetry Examples of groups Sphere Napier's bones Vector (spatial)
