sum of x and y intercepts find the sum of the x and y intercepts of the line csc alpha x sec alpha y assume that alpha is a constant for x intercept put y x cosec alpha sin alpha for y intercept put x y sec alpha cos alpha sum sin alpha cos alpha answer because sin x cos x Trigonometric function Trigonometric identity Projective transformation Hyperbolic function Bessel function Basel problem Taylor series Ordinary differential equation Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Theta function Formal power series Lorentz group 3D projection Cubic equation M__bius transformation Multiple integral Particle in a one-dimensional lattice (periodic potential) Fine-structure constant Vector field Ellipse Integration by parts Cissoid of Diocles Pascal's theorem Fourier series Triangle Green's function Quaternions and spatial rotation Kepler's laws of planetary motion Regression analysis Quaternion Debye model Harmonic oscillator Sturm-Liouville theory Pendulum Prosthaphaeresis Finite deformation tensors Arbitrary constant of integration Self-adjoint operator Lagrangian Planck's law of black body radiation Bose gas Josip Plemelj Coherent state Linear differential equation Elliptic integral Moir__ pattern Frequency mixer Euclidean plane isometry Series (mathematics) Integral RLC circuit Natural logarithm Three-phase QR decomposition Tangent half-angle formula Pentagon Dirac equation Uses of trigonometry Derivation of the partition function Mercator projection Radius of convergence Chain rule Pentagram Angle Equation of time Coordinates (mathematics) Jacobi's elliptic functions Single-sideband modulation Euler's formula L'H__pital's rule Proper time Altitude Curvilinear coordinates Damping Chebyshev polynomials Particle in a box Doomsday argument Heat equation Product rule Roman surface Deriving the Schwarzschild solution Logarithmic spiral Diffraction Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Sphere Group action Complex number Linear regression Impedance Rotating reference frame Tangent Polarization Derivative Standing wave ratio Mathematical logic Newton's identities Power series
