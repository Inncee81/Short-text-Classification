oral ideas on monday i have to have an oral presentation ready for one of my languages afrikaans the language isn't important now what i need is a good idea we are allowed to do it on anything we want to seriously anything but we need something with it other than the speech like teaching my class how to cook a specific meal and then showing it to them high pathetical example which im not doing any ideas please anything most welcome if you know how to braid hair or do different things to hair you could show the class how to do that if you have any pets or favorite animals you could give a brief report on the species where they live what they eat etc bring in a picture of it or even a stuffed animal if you have it think of something that you like to do and tell the class all about it you could demonstrate how to do it if it requires demonstration and even try to persuade the class to get involved in it speeches are hard enough to do but if you can think of something that will get the class involved it'll be more fun for everyone even you the time will fly by Garfield Comanche Guinea pig Ranma __ characters Ojibwe language Great Teacher Onizuka Graduate school Tooth enamel Philosophy of language Cheetah Dog Peter Singer Kodocha Objective-C Hunting GED Behaviorism Tomato Restaurant English grammar Squidward Tentacles Tooth Dog training Negima RuneScape skills Kuzari Logic 613 mitzvot Recursion Pet skunk Spanish verbs Inheritance (computer science) Human Education in Germany Esperanto grammar Pitaten Kosher foods Terri Schiavo Abduction Phenomenon Acorn Where's Wally?
