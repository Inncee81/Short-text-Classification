i need help with my math hw in rst p is a point on rt such that rs congruent sp if m rsp and m stp find c m tps d m pst c since rs is congruent to sp that means triangle prs is isosceles using the definition of isosceles you will find that angle rps is since angle rps and angle tps form a straight line that means the sum of their measures must add to thus angle tps d triangle pst is made up of angles pst pst and tps therefore their sum must be we just found angle tps angle stp is given therefore angle pst angle pst angle pst Triangle Angle Similarity (mathematics) Trigonometric function Pythagorean theorem Euclidean geometry Euclid's Elements L__vy C curve Congruence (geometry) Lattice (group) Parallel postulate Parabola Pi Hyperbolic geometry Cissoid of Diocles Square root of 2 Trigonometric identity Regular polytope Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Geometry Circle Spherical trigonometry Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Polygon Josip Plemelj Complex number Vector (spatial) Quadrilateral Politics of East Timor Irrational number Wallpaper group Symmetry Semiregular polyhedra Trigonometry Area (geometry) Euclidean plane isometry Affine geometry Archimedes Billiards B__zier curve Tiling by regular polygons Circumcircle CIE 1931 color space Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Opportunity rover Ellipse Conic section Rational trigonometry Inner product space Orthogonality Logo programming language Apollonian gasket Delaunay triangulation Snooker Aberration in optical systems Platonic solid Astrodynamics Projective plane VHF omnidirectional range Wassily Kandinsky Symmetry combinations Bicycle frame Triangle (instrument) On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Affine transformation Slope Time zone Mathematics of general relativity Existence Real number Napier's bones Boy's surface Orthogonal matrix Logarithmic spiral Quaternion Stairway Point groups in three dimensions Force Fibonacci number Exponentiation Curve World line Phong shading Dot product Navigation Local hidden variable theory Parallax Map projection Modular group 3D projection Atmospheric reentry Modular arithmetic Einstein-Cartan theory Prosthaphaeresis Torque Fenway Park Spline (mathematics)
