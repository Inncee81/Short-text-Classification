need info on albert einstein eloborate some of his good qualities albert einstein march april was a german born theoretical physicist he is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically mass energy equivalence e mc einstein received the nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect einstein's many contributions to physics include his special theory of relativity which reconciled mechanics with electromagnetism and his general theory of relativity which extended the principle of relativity to non uniform motion creating a new theory of gravitation his other contributions include relativistic cosmology capillary action critical opalescence classical problems of statistical mechanics and their application to quantum theory an explanation of the brownian movement of molecules atomic transition probabilities the quantum theory of a monatomic gas thermal properties of light with low radiation density which laid the foundation for the photon theory a theory of radiation including stimulated emission the conception of a unified field theory and the geometrization of physics works by albert einstein include more than fifty scientific papers and also non scientific books in einstein was named time magazine's person of the century and a poll of prominent physicists named him the greatest physicist of all time in popular culture the name einstein has become synonymous with genius http en wikipedia org wiki albert einstein here everything u wanna noe about einstein Photon Electromagnetism World Year of Physics 2005 Scientific method Max Planck Equivalence principle James Clerk Maxwell Photoelectric effect Physical cosmology Light Speed of light Luminiferous aether Quantum optics Mass Gravitational radiation Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Physical science Faster-than-light Timeline of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and random processes Temperature Thermodynamics Planck units Maxwell's equations Electromagnetic radiation Fundamental interaction Heim theory Dirac equation Dark energy Sun History of science Linus Pauling Spin (physics) Particle physics Timeline of quantum mechanics, molecular physics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics Entropy Electron Quantum computer Mathematics of general relativity Wave-particle duality The Feynman Lectures on Physics Brownian motion Science Quantum field theory Quantum gravity Kaluza-Klein theory Gauge theory String theory Multiverse Bell's theorem Timeline of scientific discoveries EPR paradox Uncertainty principle Wolfgang Pauli Electromagnetic field Zero-point energy Plasma cosmology Vacuum Phase (matter) Neutrino Nuclear magnetic resonance Non-standard cosmology Physical paradox Action (physics) Unified field theory Arthur Stanley Eddington Modern geocentrism Interpretation of quantum mechanics History of chemistry David Bohm Pp-wave spacetime Theory Philosophy of space and time D-brane Hydrogen Renormalization Paul Dirac Quantum mind Graviton Chemistry
