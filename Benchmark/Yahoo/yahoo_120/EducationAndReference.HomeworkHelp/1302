how do i do this algebra problem p s the answer must be in fraction form aka eighteen and four sevenths minus three and eleven fiftheenths sorry im a bad speller ok first you need to have the fractions with a common denominator so in this case multiply times then multiply times and you end up with for the first mixed fraction then you multiply times giving you since is bigger then borrow one whole from the giving you subtract from and from and you get since you can't reduce it any further that would be your answer Vulgar fraction Computer numbering formats Continued fraction Binary numeral system Division (mathematics) Elementary arithmetic Egyptian fraction Money supply Vedic mathematics Two's complement Egyptian mathematics George Peacock Elementary algebra Gaussian elimination Mental calculation Complex number Partial fraction Numeral system P-adic number Proof that 0.999... equals 1 Napier's bones Golden ratio base COBOL M__bius transformation Orthogonal matrix Addition Time signature Vector (spatial) Quadratic equation State space (controls) Decimal Multiplication Recurring decimal ___1 (number) Ideal class group Projective transformation Commutative ring Local ring On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Order of operations Renormalization Real number Exponentiation Multiplication algorithm Set Microeconomics Matrix multiplication Irrational number Apollo Guidance Computer Multiplicative inverse Finite field arithmetic Identical particles Matrix (mathematics) Modular form Egyptian numerals Lambda calculus Mnemonic Gravity Two-body problem Z-transform Dimensional analysis Representations of Clifford algebras Fourier transform Method of complements Calculating the day of the week Trigonometric identity Fibonacci number Mathematics Sobolev space Hyperreal number 24-hour clock Joseph Louis Lagrange Kernel (algebra) Grade (education) Rocket fuel GED Binary GCD algorithm Surreal number Phase-locked loop Duodecimal DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Kalman filter Formal power series Exponential function Rational number Porosity Ordinary differential equation Simon Stevin Bayesian inference Riemann zeta function Simply connected space Cross product Calculator Maya calendar Clifford algebra Age of the universe Cissoid of Diocles Plus and minus signs Polynomial
