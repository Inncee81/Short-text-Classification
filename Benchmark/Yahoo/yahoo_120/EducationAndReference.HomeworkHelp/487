maths a man throws three fair dice find the probability that all the three numbers are different all the three numbers are different if the first die is a one then there are x ways of getting the values on the other two dice different from the first one based on this there will additional cases from two through six hence the total number of ways will be x x based on the original sample space of x x the required probability will be x x good luck in your studies mitch Dice Probability Craps Principle of indifference Dither Fischer Random Chess Normal distribution Hardware random number generator Backgammon Mathematics Randomness Fuzion Stochastic process Simulated annealing Principle of maximum entropy Quicksort Uncertainty principle Maximum likelihood Lebesgue integration Probability distribution Risk (game) Monopoly (game) Double counting Pearson's chi-square test Doomsday argument Measure (mathematics) Andrew Dice Clay Poker probability Storyteller System Memoir '44 Random variable Maximum entropy probability distribution I Ching divination Luck Median Fighting Fantasy Game Books Randomized algorithm High Rollers Bell's theorem Tri-Stat dX On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Expected value Gambler's fallacy Checking if a coin is fair U.S. Electoral College Sampling (statistics) Derivation of the partition function Blackjack Board game Quantitative marketing research Fibonacci number Probability theory Orders of magnitude (numbers) Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics) Markov chain Combinatorics Central limit theorem Hero System Estimation theory Miller-Rabin primality test Inverse gambler's fallacy Statistics Particle filter Poisson distribution Phase-shift keying Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Confidence interval MaxEnt thermodynamics Identical particles Annuity Specified complexity Pai gow poker Prior probability Pascal's triangle Artificial neural network Mabinogion Martingale Matrix (mathematics) Trip distribution Mahjong Softball Standard deviation Game mechanic Probability density function Bloom filter Fisher's exact test Hardy-Weinberg principle Prostate cancer Bayes' theorem Bayesian inference Exponential distribution Analog-to-digital converter Genetic algorithm Exponentiation Warhammer 40,000 Probable cause Poisson process Clauser and Horne's 1974 Bell test PaX Fair use
