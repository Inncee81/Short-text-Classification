can you help me to write an essay about my classroom party sure you need to come up with a theme what is it that you would like to say about the party then you need to come up with some examples that support your theme start with a nice little introduction that captures the reader's attention and introduces your theme make sure your examples describe what happened and also support the idea you are trying to express conclude with a summary and some sort of general application of your idea such as whether you are looking forward to future parties and why here's an outline of an example but you have to write your own to fit your party so i'll pick a party theme that you probably didn't have my class' pilgrim party advanced our education in a fun way we had to research ourselves to plan our costumes and the food we learned a lot about how to accomplish things by splitting into groups to plan and carry out the party actually seeing and touching and feeling the results helped us to better understand the experience of the pilgrims conclusion taking responsibility ourselves helped us learn much better than just reading a textbook the fun games and original costumes will help us remember how well we worked together to understand the pilgrims' world that we had delicious snacks and laughed and played wasn't bad either now come up with your own theme about your own party and the essay shouldn't be tough Theory of conduct IBM PC compatible The Apprentice 2 Extreme Programming Transactional analysis C.
