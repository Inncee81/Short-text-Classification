how much does a professional painter get paid per hour just wondering if you're asking about house painters i can tell you that most of them from my experiences here in california texas washington maine etc don't usually bid jobs by the hour or charge by the hour the price they charge is based on a bid for the whole job the only way you can calculate a per hour rate would be by how quickly and hopefully how well you did the bid job less the cost of materials it's pretty much the same with all contractors they bid a job of how long they think the job will take how much they think the building materials will cost and they factor in any hired labor costs they will have to pay for helpers it you're asking about artists then very few of them unless it's a commissioned work like a public mural could ever ask for or expect to receive per hour pay for a painting art work is only of real value to the seller and buyer so there is no way you could ever gage the art on a per hour basis example if i sell a painting for and it took me four hours to paint does that mean i charge an hour what if i can only get for the painting it's still the same painting so how do i gage it's per hour value you really can't what if i sell it for and it's value goes up to after i've sold it i didn't get a an hour for painting it by the way i've painted houses and i paint on canvas so i've had plenty of experience in both areas Wal-Mart Microeconomics Economics Option Real estate broker Painting Mortgage Supply and demand Inflation Unemployment Surplus value Christo and Jeanne-Claude Ford Motor Company Monopoly ITunes Music Store Stanton Macdonald-Wright Auction Insurance Diego Vel__zquez Housing cooperative Mutual fund Capitalism Construction Arbitrage Price discrimination Economic inequality Hyperinflation Islamic banking Art forgery Value added tax Karl Rove Minimum wage Leonardo da Vinci Art Oil-for-Food Programme Wassily Kandinsky Frans Hals New Deal Efficiency wages Raytheon Oxford English Dictionary Education in the People's Republic of China Economic rent Day trading Rembrandt Illegal drug trade Rational pricing Rufus Porter The Apprentice 2 Surplus labour Futures contract Pablo Picasso Vincent van Gogh Insider trading Artemisia Gentileschi Gross domestic product Fuel injection Mural Internet fraud Teresa Heinz Kerry Mid-levels Taxation in the United States Life insurance Willem de Kooning Wayne Corporation Gustave Courbet Art in Ancient Greece Electronic Arts Computer Piet Mondrian Gold standard Martin Sharp Raphael FairTax Hillary Rodham Clinton Caravaggio Tintoretto Final Fantasy XI Stock Chinese painting Academic art Andrea Mantegna Production, costs, and pricing Dividend Francis Bacon (painter) Carl Barks Florida Central Voter File Georges-Pierre Seurat Andy Warhol Pierre-Auguste Renoir Economy of Russia Outsourcing William Blake Art theft James T.
