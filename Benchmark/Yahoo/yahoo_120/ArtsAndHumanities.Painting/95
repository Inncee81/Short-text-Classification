if you buy a painting is it ok to take a picture of it and make it into a note card to send to friends or do you need to get the artist's permission you will want to ask the person you bought it from i mean like if its a very old painting then no one actually owns it but if its a new painting then someone probaly has it copyrighted and so unless you bought the rights to it then i'm pretty sure you can't but then again i'm not sure about private use but in my option and i'm not telling you to do this if your not making a profit and your just sending it to a few friends then they won't know and they probaly won't care United States Postal Service MAME Neopets File sharing L.
