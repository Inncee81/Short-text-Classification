do you like drawing do you like drawing or painting did you like drawing or painting when you were a child why why not do you think drawing or painting is difficult do you think a person can teach him or herself how to draw or paint do adults draw or paint very often what do you think about adults drawing or painting what are the benefits of drawing or painting to draw or paint well what factors do you think are important i do like to draw i love drawing and painting when i was a child i asked my mom to enroll me in painting classes when i was it is only difficult if you don't have the drive and there are just people that no matter how much you teach them they just can't draw but i think that when you really want to do something you can a person can definitely teach themselves how to draw i would recommend studying the human and animal anatomy and possibly find a studio where you can take life drawing classes adults who like draw they do it very often i think that if it's one of your passions or hobbies than i think adults drawing or painting is a wonderful thing my dad never went to art school but he absolutely loves to draw and i think it's great the benefits depend of what you want to get out of the drawings or painting if you are just doing it for the sake of doing it and you love it then it's great if you do it because you are going to be or are an artist that's also excellent i think whatever your reason for doing it is it should be something that you love to do drawing and painting that is because if you don't love to do it then it's pointless in my point of view i think that it is an important factor if you want to do something with your life that requires that skill i think anyone could learn i just don't think anyone should because some people really don't have the passion for it so to me it's only a skill that you need or want if that is one of your passions in life doing it as a way of making a living just for fun or hobby i don't think everyone should learn how to draw it's nor vital like reading and mathematics i hope this answers you questions and helps you out take care GED Current teachings of Prem Rawat Abortion debate Past teachings of Prem Rawat Science Theory of conduct John Howard Yoder Economic inequality Second language acquisition Homeschooling Human Intelligence quotient Motivation Brett Whiteley Social rule Ludwig Wittgenstein Altruism Transactional analysis Expert system Figure drawing Aesthetic Realism Infantilism Art The Amber Spyglass Education in the People's Republic of China Meaning of life Avenue Q Aikido Human sexual behavior Leonardo da Vinci Boy Scouts of America Great Teacher Onizuka Nicomachean Ethics Eastern Orthodox Church Martial art Storytelling Justification (theology) Socrates Gifted Sexual orientation Roy Lichtenstein Education in the United States Philosophy of education Kender Philosophical skepticism Mental retardation Lie Kitsch Michel Henry Charles Grandison Finney Religion Supernatural Alexander Technique Rudolf Hermann Lotze Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Richard Feynman Adult attention-deficit disorder Pitaten Education in Hong Kong Ontological argument SAT Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Property (ownership right) Bah__'__ Faith and Education Hearing impairment Nurse A Course In Miracles Albrecht D__rer Education reform Kyle Broflovski Infant baptism Community college Scientology beliefs and practices Scientific method Summa Theologiae The Adventures of Pete & Pete Polyamory Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Evil Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Plame affair Sex education __douard Manet Graduate school Trigun Medicine Happiness Determinism Theodicy Joke Fathers' rights Autism Tom Phillips (artist) Growth hormone treatment
