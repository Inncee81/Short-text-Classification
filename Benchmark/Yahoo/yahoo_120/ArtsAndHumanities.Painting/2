in the process of painting on a canvas need help now i have painted a red woman on a pice of canvas with a black background but it looks a bit boring not dry yet but i would like to add some more coulor without making a mess of it please help it has to be done for next monday any thoughts of what i could do to it the painting might pop if you add a colour that's an opposite to what you've got an opposite to the red would be a pthalo blue or pthalo green however you can't paint it directly on the black or red because it will mix with the underpainted colours and turn dark my guess is you're painting in oils liquin will help them dry a little faster first paint white let it dry then go over with the other colour to get a purer shade good luck on time constraints for drying Color theory Color Black Snooker Wassily Kandinsky Arsenal F.C.
