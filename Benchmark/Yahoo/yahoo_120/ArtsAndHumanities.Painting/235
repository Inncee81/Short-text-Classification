stupid question would painting one wall black in my room look weird and does anyone know any good decorating room sites okay the other colours would be a light purple lime green red but not all three no it would not look weird at all depending upon your personal style you could choose a few different options the first being a modern high end look and the second being a more funky artistic melange mix for the first room i would paint the remaining walls in a silvery grey colour the trim work doors and ceiling would be in a warm white to play up to and dramatize the matt black painted wall i would incorporate these next three elements consistently throughout the space glass and crystal silver metal stainless steele and a combination of dark and cream furniture the fabric choices should be a mixture of stripes circular patterns and well executed plaids and incorporate florals or fauna for a woman and bold graphics for a male cushions drapes chair seats and if in your bedroom bedding with crisp white sheets with a black profile around the edges fabrics should be of different weaves and textures to create a layering effect with visual and tactile interest ex material silk fine wool cotton etc texture nubby soft smooth and raised fabrics your lamps should be of brushed stainless or glass bases with black shades you could have a modern silver pendant lamp hanging from the ceiling or a cream chandelier again with black shades if you allergy permits a nice simple biege rug with a black border after all this is accomplished you would need to purchase the same stlye and colour of frames for artwork that you love they do not have to be as monochromatic as is the theme of this type of room stripes in an alternating matt shiney finish would look great in this room too stencils like these in either decor would look great very graphic and well done http www stencil library com for room version two black matt wall ceiling and trim work the three remaining walls in your choice of ethier a grey mauve silvery blue or rustic orange from there your picture frames are black with bolder and brighter pieces of art work your rug will have the colours that are in your art work and will co ordinate with your lamps and other do dads and objects in your space your fabrics should not be the focal point in this situation you art work should be so keep them as close as possible to the colour of your wall on which it will be near ie black fabrics black wall and so on the texture rule suggestion applies to this scenario as well you can incorporate plastic plexi glass various metals silver and black or coloured and coloured glass into the room so your table lamps vases and decor would be of these materials lampshades can still be black to retain some cohesion in the room furniture is nuetral to show case the more artistic elements in the room nothing too light though good decorating websites are below for you to browse through http www hgtv com hgtv decorating hgtv
