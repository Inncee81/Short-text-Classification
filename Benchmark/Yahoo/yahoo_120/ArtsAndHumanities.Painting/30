do you know the forms of stencilings and the materials used can you also add where they are applied on stencils are usually made of either a flexible plastic that you can use over and over again or thick cardboard like paper most office supple stores and art supply stores sell both types stay away from the paper stencils once they get wet they rarely hold their form very long you can use just about any type of artistic materials from paint to ink to water colors to pencils to spray paint when using stencils i've used them with acrylic paint when i've wanted to add perfectly formed lettering to some of my paintings the only thing to consider is if you're going to be using a fluid liquid like ink or water color because the colors might seep under the stencil and 'bleed' onto whatever materials canvas or paper or whatever your using if you're using liquid with the stencils you'll need to press the stencil firmly against the material while you work so that you won't get any unintended 'run' under the stencil any onto your artwork Surrealist techniques Screen-printing Printmaking Drawing Paint Casting Typewriter Mimeograph machine Traditional animation Painting Printed circuit board Polymethyl methacrylate Piet Mondrian Rubber stamp Art Duplicating machines Plastic Polymer clay Leather Watercolor painting Inkjet printer Pottery Vitreous enamel Fire extinguisher Stucco Ink M.C.
