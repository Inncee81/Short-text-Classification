my moms friend was painting and left the bucket of washed paint water in my washroom my moms friend was painting my house wall and left the bucket of full water which was used to wash the paint brush roller now the bucket is full of dirty paint water with the brush in my washroom and its near my room im afriad it might cause health problems so i wanna ask if i should cover it up with a bag or something cause i told my mom to move it out of the washroom but she said her friends going to use it soon so dont touch it and got all mad so yeah my question is should i cover the bucket and the brush loaded with dirty paint water with a bag thx extra details the probem is my mom is weird and doesnt want me to move the brush with the bucket of water in the garage because she said the brush roller needs to be in water and wont let me touch it i know the question is weird and hard to answer but please no bad comments like what kind of question is this thanks alot before you get all excited and cause undue and needless friction between yourself and your mom you might want to find out what kind of paint your mom's friend is using first if it's latex paint and i'm pretty sure it is or he wouldn't have left it in a bucket of water you have nothing to worry about latex paint acrylic water based paint is completely harmless to you your lungs or the environment even if it's an oil based paint it's not very likely that it will cause you any harm because it's simply a diluted mixture of harmless residue left over from the paint and the fact that it's emerged in water takes away the possibility of any harmful fumes there is not enought paint on a diluted washed out roller sitting in a bucket of water to cause anyone any harm Paint Bong RuneScape quests Toilet Menstrual cup Brush Thermal power station Washroom Jumpstart 3rd Grade Glossary of climbing terms Blood on the Tracks Dairy Tag Avenue Q The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hey Arnold!
