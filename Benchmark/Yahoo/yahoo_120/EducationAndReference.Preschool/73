year old boy cannot write is this a cause for concern he can recognize the letters and numbers but tracing them is a chore also coloring within the lines in pictures nope he's not developmentally there yet this is normal sure some kids start writing and reading that young but it's pretty rare keep playing with him reading to him allowing him to scribble and minimize or eliminate tv time he'll be fine pushing a young child to do something they are not developmentally prepared for frustrating for the parent and child and takes time away from other things you could be doing together there are tons of books available with fun activities to do with toddlers and preschoolers or you can search online for free ideas most children who are ahead in the preschool years even out with their peers in elementary school there is a school of thought that you can sit your toddler down and drill them with flashcards to make them brilliant this theory is thought of as utter hogwash by most early education specialists as well as psychologists and neurologists when kids are forced to learn a new skill before they are developmentally ready it either disappears or is learned in a different part of the brain than it would be if they waited until they were ready reading is a prime example of this for example you could sit down with your year old for minutes a day for quite some time and teach them how to read a clock they would eventually get it if you did nto reinforce that skill it would be forgotten think of all of the wasted time that could have been spent on nature walks or reading stories together if you wait until that child is older it will take about minutes to explain how a clock is read it's not like the kid is going to need to keep track of his appointments at or years old i understand the desire to enhance your child's learning but all he really needs is a safe loving environment with stimulating toys and activities as well as plenty of downtime to relax and explore on his own to flourish to his full potential Montessori method Autism Infantilism Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Second language acquisition Asperger syndrome Milton H.
