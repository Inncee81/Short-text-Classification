what do u think about this on my profile i have my yahoo mess name i answerd a question and the person who asked it had im me no big deal because i really do not mind chatting with people on there but i do not go any farther than that as in giving my full name phone number or even met them well like i said he had im me and not even two min into it my boyfriend came over and so i told him that i was getting off because i wanted to spend time with the bf he go all mad and said we should not talk anymore i told him that my bf and i both chat with other people and it was not a big deal he told me that he thought we thought we might end up in a relationship i was freaked out so have you ever dated someone that you met thru an im i am not thinking about doing that at all just was curious thanks people online tend to fanasize that just b c someone talks to them and is nice to them that they're in love it's immature and quite silly if you wish to keep meeting strangers online warn them in advance that it's no more than just chatting and always say you're in a serious relationshhip even if you're not that should prevent them thinking they're falling in love with you Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show About a Boy Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Avenue Q Pip (South Park episode) EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Little Britain Humphrey Bogart The Inside Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) MSN Messenger Extras (sitcom) Theory of conduct The Smoking Room Fight Club The Lovely Bones Garfield Cybersex Friends Big Brother (USA TV series) The Catcher in the Rye Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dead Like Me Something Positive John Kerr Recurring South Park characters Online dating service Fancy Crane Knots Landing Rose (Doctor Who) Instant messaging Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Surveillance Miss Saigon Closer (film) The Emancipation of Mimi Full House Quarashi Lois Griffin Muraqaba K' Ocean's Twelve Please Save My Earth Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Incarnations of Immortality St. Elmo's Fire (film) Phoebe Halliwell W.I.T.C.H.
