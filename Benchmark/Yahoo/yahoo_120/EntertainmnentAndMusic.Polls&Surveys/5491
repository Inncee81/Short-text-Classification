why ask why when you stop questioning others and you stop questioning yourself you effectively die the day a person thinks they got it all figured out and they stop asking why they may as well go off into the woods alone like a dog and take their final resting spot you can burn on the fuel of what you already know or what others tell you for just so long life doesn't end til it is over so until that day i will question everything and everyone most of all myself now you can get pretty far out and twisted doing this some folks make it their life mission to take on the strangest things and that is fine if you don't want to veer off into certain directions you better ask why and take an active role in figuring out what you wanna do in life because if you don't life will take you on it's own ride depending on economics and circumstance or just plain luck does not guarantee a person anything but what's coming straight at 'em pow most will find themself in tough places at one time or more and if you don't know how to handle it or know which way you want to go you will get swept up turned out packed up and shelved all i know for sure is life is a lot of what you make it no one has complete control and there does come a time when you truly can appreciate and laugh at the fact that the more you know the more you realize just how much you don't know that is why i continue to ask why even when it seems futile and silly a person can learn something new everyday then you have to ask yourself what you are gonna do about it and if you and those among you will be better off or worse off from the action you may choose of course i am pretty much a loner and don't interact with people very much except to get my needs met you could say i got a long road to walk to make it out there among you and i probably won't ever make it because i don't want to not on the terms that this world asks of me and i'm willing to pay the consequences for my choice so a little more than i needed to say but i guess i felt like it maker have mercy your question certainly has given me much to think about and perhaps even stuff i need to re think 'cause some of what i have written though it is the way i feel right now does not sit right with me and no i ain't sorry for my answer being so long people can decide before even reading it wether they want to skip it or not ha Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Time Out of Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sexual orientation Humphrey Bogart Monty Python Transactional analysis Avenue Q Love and Theft AFI 100 Years series The Amber Spyglass Theodicy Social rule Goodness and value theory Incarnations of Immortality Scrooge McDuck Milton H.
