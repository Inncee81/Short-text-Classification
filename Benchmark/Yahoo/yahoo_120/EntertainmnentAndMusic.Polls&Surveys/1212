rally round the flag boys and girls does your country's flag hold importance to you i salute the stars and stripes wherever i am whatever i am doing it is dear to me interesting this is not appearing on the long list of questions on ya it does hold tremendous importance for me something strange has happened in the last few years though i am beginning to feel almost as strongly about the union jack and the canadian maple leaf i think it has to do with seeing flag draped coffins coming home from the middle east and knowing that the canadians and the english are truly our brothers and sisters in arms my feelings for the stars and stripes has not diminished one bit but the other two flags have started to have a lot more meaning to me when a soldier of theirs dies he or she is no longer theirs he or she is mine too but i digress i love my flag i especially like to see the really big ones on a windy day when it flies and makes a snapping noise having lived in other countries i can tell you that there are few things like going to the us embassy and seeing marines in their dress uniforms and seeing that flag flying so proudly i have alarmed marines before because as they are checking me in at the embassy gates i always start to cry they think there's something wrong and i always tell them i am not crying from distress but rather from love and bless those men they always understand luckily they also understand when i throw my arms around their necks and thank them for serving in uniform i try to not mess up their uniforms but it's hard when you are crying Colours, standards and guidons Flag of India Flag of South Africa United States Marine Corps Flag of Canada Royal Standard Medal of Honor Shaggy dog story Friends Canadian Armed Forces Union Jack 2004 Republican National Convention Miss Saigon Flag of Hong Kong Maritime flags Warrant Officer The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Military slang Pitaten Jam (TV series) Governor General of Canada Milton H.
