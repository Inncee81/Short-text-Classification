have you ever been in love star if you have please was the love returned yes everyone has been in love at some point or another i've been in love more than once each time it ended in the worst way my heart was broken in a million pieces and just like it takes a lifetime to love it takes a lifetimes to repair it the hardest part is the love being returned in my curent case i love my baby daddy with all my heart he is the best father in the world i just get the feeling sometimes that he doesn't love me the same way we've known each other for almost years now and our beautiful son was months old friday we have always been there for each other but we have had our differences they never cloud the love we have for each other though there's just a lack of understanding each other we are best friends so we are free to see other people but i just wish it wasn't like that you can't make a man make a committment to you he must do that on his own time and that's the way i would want it that way you know he really loves you and cares about you and you have a chance of making your relationship work i have yet to find my soulmate all i know is right now i can't live without my mother or my son a mother's love is the best love anybody can have whether you know it or not Jon Secada Knots Landing Friends Kodocha EastEnders Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Fathers' rights Charmed Pitaten Sex and the City The Amber Spyglass The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Henry Fonda Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Polyamory Everwood Interpersonal relationship Ten Commandments Care Bears Current teachings of Prem Rawat Soulmate Mina Mongoose Grief One Tree Hill (TV series) Liam Gallagher Shaggy dog story Whitney Houston About a Boy Mother Teresa Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Zoophilia Infantilism Humphrey Bogart Kimi Finster Cigarette Smoking Man The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Fathers' rights movement in the UK Hollyoaks Cliff Richard Characters in the Smurfs Abortion debate Blood on the Tracks Bleed Like Me Garth Brooks Will & Grace Honey and Clover Harry Potter (character) Luke and Laura Spencer Athrun Zala W.I.T.C.H.
