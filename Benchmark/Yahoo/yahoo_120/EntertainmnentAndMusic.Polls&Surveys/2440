how did you meet your significant other we were teenagers and he worked at pizza hut my sister was dating his best friend and when she met him she kept insisting that i meet him i kept telling her i was not interested in getting into a relationship at that time but she wouldn't hush we went into pizza hut to see him we didn't want it to be completely obvious so we thought we should order something we had just ate dinner so we decided to order a coke when i first saw him i was mesmerized at his good looks and his warm smile i decided that i couldn't just order a coke and leave i wasn't ready to be away from him yet so i told him i wanted to order a pizza my sister thought i was crazy i stood at the counter and watched him make this pizza and there was just this connection between the two of us i'd never had that spark or feeling with anyone else before he made the pizza i paid for it and left when i got out to the car he came running out there to ask me for my number i gave it to him and he called me that night after he got off work we talked for hours that night until am we never ran out of things to say to each other and i loved talking to him we started dating after that and we've been together ever since if you know my husband you would know how special that was for him to have the nerve to ask me out he is very shy and i cannot believe he ever had the nerve to tell me he liked me come out there and get my number i'm sure glad he did though i love him very much The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing EastEnders The Catcher in the Rye Philip J.
