maybe i was out of line i recently went to my inlaws th wedding anniversary when the dinner was about to be served i quickly went to the bathroom i tipped the bathroom attendant a dollar to keep quiet while i changed when i came back i was wearing a cape and a large set of plastic gopher teeth my mother in law immediately began to started sobbing and crying she said that i looked just like her dead father who had died driving a truck load of walnuts to the d c area my question is was it good manners to tip the bathroom attendant why certainly it was using good etiquette to keep the bathroom attendant quiet while you changed into costume he could have asked you for more if he thought that there would be a good pay off for him this might had led into a dispute with the bathroom attendant where you would have to bind and gag him just to keep him quiet about it perhaps the tears of your mother in law were happy memories of her deceased father the cape and gopher teeth served as a reminder of how much she has missed him since the accident that day when the truck he was driving jack knifed and hit another oncoming truck carrying a cargo of dried fruit as a result of the accident both the driver of the other vehicle and your mother in law's father who we'll call chip for the record died on the scene however the dried fruit and walnut company merged together that year and began a new fruitcake company in time for the christmas holiday Shaggy dog story EastEnders Knots Landing Days of our Lives Funeral Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Columbine High School massacre The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Shining (film) Sport utility vehicle Rules of the road Friends Manual transmission The Parting of the Ways 613 mitzvot The Human Stain Cuisine of Denmark Pickup truck School bus The Amber Spyglass The Lovely Bones Drill bit Dutch Schultz Paul Is Dead Kenny McCormick Kill Bill Miss Saigon Good Times Combine (Half-Life 2) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dead Like Me Poker jargon Coronation of the British monarch Kodocha Blood Simple Ambulance Fruitcake Sin City Knife Avenue Q Luke and Laura Spencer The Family from One End Street Car handling Whose Line Is It Anyway?
