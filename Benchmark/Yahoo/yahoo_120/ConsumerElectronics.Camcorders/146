camera conversion p how do you convert your camera's frame rate to p i dont noe if its possible iown a sony dcr hc minidv camcorder i would like to know how to convert the frame rate to p please you can make the coversion but you might not be happy with the results if the subject is moving or the camera is moving there will be bad artifacts the first comes from de interlace your i frame is actually made up of two fields both fields capture the entire picture at slightly different time this off set causes the moving objects to be in slightly different position in field and field so when combined to make a frame there is blur the second comes from the reverse telecine operation in order to make frames out of you have to throw out frames each second which is done by removing every th frame this results in a stutter step jerkiness in what should be smooth motion a program that speciallizes in the frame rate conversion will do a slightly better job as it will combine de interlace with reverse telecine to interpolate a smoother finished frame sequence pro sound is sampled at k which allows the audio samples do be divided smoothly over various frame rates and generally that can be converted without a lot of artifacts potentially a loss of sync can eventually occur if not corrected by the software but that is no more difficult than what it does when adding a k sampled cd to the soundtrack Frame rate Digital video Interlace Movie projector High-definition television Video 3D computer graphics Digital photography 8 mm video format Anamorphic widescreen Camcorder Computer animation Traditional animation MPEG-2 Deinterlacing Digital camera Persistence of vision Atari 8-bit family Laserdisc Original Amiga chipset Compression artifact H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Digital cinema Television Screenshot Analog-to-digital converter Motion capture MP3 Synthesizer PAL Oscilloscope Sampling frequency Compiler optimization Mouse (computing) Telerecording Videotape Dither Frame of reference Warez Compact disc Digital cinematography Faster-than-light Geographic information system Audio data compression Film Federal Standard 1037C Motion blur Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Software-defined radio Video codec Swingout General relativity Super 8 mm film Secure Digital card Stereoscopy Broadcast television system Floppy disk Time dilation Depth of field Magnet Gravity Motion compensation Nintendo 64 Konica Minolta Speed of light Luminiferous aether Amstrad CPC 720p Computer Charge-coupled device Sony Digital Hubble Space Telescope Explosive material Sampling (statistics) Bullet time Sun VHS Apple Computer 1080i Automatic number plate recognition IMAX Horse gait Video game music Beatmania IIDX Computer virus Low-pass filter
