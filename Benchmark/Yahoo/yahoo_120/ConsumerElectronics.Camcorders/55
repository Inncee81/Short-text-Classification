on a digital camcorder what is a led light a led is a light emitting diode just a light bulb really it could be a light to show that something's switched on or it could be to help the autofocus in low light levels Light-emitting diode Diode Autofocus Vacuum tube Lighting Incandescent light bulb Headlight Fluorescent lamp Laser Transducer Laser diode Organic light-emitting diode Semiconductor device Light gun DV Transistor Stage lighting Camcorder Konica Minolta Logic gate Mercury-vapor lamp Covert listening device Mouse (computing) Light Charge-coupled device Light pollution Switch Current source Quantum dot Digital cinema Digital photography Electromagnetic spectrum Modem Flashlight Philips Traffic light Barcode reader Mercury arc valve Gamut Bicycle lighting Ultraviolet Nikon FM2 Infrared Digital camera Electric light Schottky diode Canon EOS Gallium arsenide Electrodeless lamp Audio level compression Thermionic emission Nixie tube Electronic amplifier Color temperature Dimmer Transistor-transistor logic Compact fluorescent lamp Nikon Corporation Contax Photometry (optics) Alternator Battery (electricity) High-voltage direct current Pulse-width modulation Photodiode Solar cell Phase-locked loop Leica Christmas lights Overvoltage Infrared photography Cathode ray tube Negawatt power X10 (industry standard) VCSEL Professional video camera Scintillator Voltage regulator Fluorescence S-VHS Liquid crystal display Valve sound Planetary nebula Frontlight Flash (photography) Black body White Musical Instrument Digital Interface CPU design Street light Photoelectric effect Synchronous optical networking Bullet Digital Light switch Particle accelerator Federal Standard 1037C Nikon FA Videotape Nikon FM
