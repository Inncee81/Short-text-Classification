i'm looking for the right camcorder or video camera i don't know the difference i am going to use it to film my soccer games for college reasons so i want it to be good quality with enough room to film long games i also want to be able to make copies of the tape so that i can send them to relatives to watch on their televisions hopefully there is something out there that fits all of my criteria i agree with the st response in that a camera with a hdd hard disk drive will give you the most for your money i would avoid using a refurbished camera as you don'yt know why it was refurbished and you don't know if that problem or another problem with teh camera will present itself again warranties on refurbished units usually aren't as lomng as the original manufacturers warnings if you can afford it wait until a jvc or a sony model goes on sale at best buy and seriously consider the year service plan it covers everything from maintenance to accidental damage due to dropping well beyond what the warranty will cover also you should note that the cameras start at about gb and will give you hours of excellent video not or on a gb unit that you were told as far as copying them for others you will get a standard av cable in the unit that will allow you to copy the video from the harddrive directly to a vhs tape or to a dvd recorder if you choose plus you wont have to worry about buying the right dvd as there are some compatibility issues with the dvd r and dvd r and their related media hope this helps DVD Camcorder VHS Hard disk Videocassette recorder Digital photography High-definition television Laserdisc Videotape Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting 8 mm video format JVC PlayStation 2 S-VHS Floppy disk Blu-ray Disc PlayStation 3 Xbox Warez IBM PC compatible DV Surveillance Television S__CAM Digital video IBM PC Photography Betacam Doctor Who missing episodes Betamax Compact disc Pornography MSX USB flash drive Windows XP FireWire Back to the Future TiVo Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Live Aid Computer and video games Enterprise content management Fahrenheit 9/11 IBook First-sale doctrine Sega Dreamcast Digital rights management Universal Serial Bus Video CD Digital video recorder Grey market Nintendo GameCube Anamorphic widescreen Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Gramophone record Warranty Modchip Atari 8-bit family Nintendo Amstrad CPC Computer virus Copyleft Sound recording MiniDisc Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xbox 360 Video codec Video game crash of 1983 PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Walkman Western Digital Windows Vista Nintendo 64 Commodore International Atari ST Sega 32X The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Cable television RCA Video game music Digital8 SCART Punisher MP3 Internet fraud Escape from New York Stereoscopy
