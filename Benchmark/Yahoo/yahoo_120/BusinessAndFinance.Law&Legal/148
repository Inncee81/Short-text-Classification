doctors note for employer i called in sick due to a migraine headache one day my employer called me back stating they want a doctor's note stating i have a history of migraines i think this is stupid i told him that i can't drive to pick up the note because my head is hurting and i get sensitive to light they said it cannot be faxed they want it tomorrow is this harrassment in my own experience working as a normal employee and as a person in human resources notes were only asked for from those that called in sick often or more than normal especially from those that routinely phoned in ill on fridays or mondays it's entirely legal not harassement if you truly are so incapacitated that you aren't able to drive yourself to the doctors ask a friend to drive you there are medications one can get for migraines and most employers who you let know you are now in possession of such medicine will help you out in terms of time off mine does for medical conditions that a doctor has verified i myself miss more than a normal person does of work due to my vision problems but my employer knows absolutely everything that is going on with my vision and when my next specialist appointment is and the results of each visit i keep my supervisor informed so when i'm not there a friday each month they know i'm not out shopping or at the river or lake or beach they know i'm at the eye doctors usually getting medication injected into my eye so i can continue seeing that's the key keep your employer in the loop and show that you are trying to get medical help for the condition you are taking time off for good luck in getting to the doctors for the note Migraine Health insurance Chronic fatigue syndrome Epilepsy Multiple chemical sensitivity Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medical prescription Decompression sickness Medicine Terri Schiavo Color Medical cannabis Medical record Headache Color blindness Urinary incontinence Surveillance Hal Trosky Unemployment Jam (TV series) Prolactinoma Addiction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma M__ni__re___s disease Insulin Sexual harassment First aid Traditional Chinese medicine Father's Day (Doctor Who) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Juris Doctor Soap opera Alternative medicine Prostate cancer Medicare (Canada) Fasting Beavis and Butt-head Cannabis (drug) Church of Christ, Scientist Clinical depression STS-62 Chlorpromazine Multiple sclerosis Diabetes mellitus Insurance HIV test Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Saturday Night Live Keratoconus National Health Service Charles Darwin's illness Homeopathy Vitamin C National Library for the Blind Hepatitis C LSD Humphrey Bogart Tension headache Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Sant Thakar Singh Disease Abortion Propranolol Kodocha Probation officer Shaggy dog story Drug abuse Plame affair Project MKULTRA Pharmaceutical company The Five Doctors Publicly funded medicine Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Ebola Bipolar disorder Wheel of Fortune Radiation poisoning Ketamine Dizziness Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hearing impairment Driver's license Sin City Back to the Future timeline Ocean's Twelve The Shining (film) Modem Simone Weil Combat stress reaction Dyslexia One (Voyager episode)
