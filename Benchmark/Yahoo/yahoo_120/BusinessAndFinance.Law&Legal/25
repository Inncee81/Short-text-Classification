is k a low starting salary in the washington d c area the job is an entry level associate at a md firm it is a md law firm and the position is for an entry level associate meaning i just received my j d that's a really good starting salary for the dc area in my opinion but you can do your own research by looking at the local washington dc newspapers to see starting salaries for similar positions now you didn't say if that job was in downtown dc or in the maryland suburbs off of a metro stop or in the northern virginia suburbs off of a metro stop that really matters because if it's close to a metro stop you may not need a car and all the expenses that go with owning an automobile you'll also have to consider these other factors do you have a lot of college loans to pay off you'll have to consider these in your budget what about housing if you want to live in a safe neighborhood that close to a metro stop you'll be paying a premium and you will want to live in a safe neighborhood there are just too many neighborhoods in dc that are run down and crime ridden home to drug dealers and junkies you do not want to live in those war zones apartments in downtown dc are expensive will you have a roomate s or do you want your own apartment apartments in the suburbs close to a metro line are less money than downtown dc but they're still expensive dc has one of the best metro systems in the usa you will not need a car unless you plan on doing a lot of driving on weekends you do not want to drive a car to commute to work in downtown dc automobile traffic especially on the capitol beltway is horrendous during morning and evening rush hours the best way to commute is by the dc metro maryland state virginia state and the district of columbia income taxes are high very high they'll take a big chunk of each paycheck another plus about living in the dc area well two pluses living in near the us capital the heart of dc is beautiful the museums the smithsonian the memorials all of them are awe inspiring living in this part of maryland virginia the history and the landscape i worked outside of baltimore maryland for years until i retired i've always live nw of baltimore it's a beautiful area i'm close to gettysburg and other civil war sites in pennsylvania maryland and northern virginia and west virginia the potomac and shenadoah rivers the great falls of the potomac the chesepeake bay everything in this area is so close by within a few hours drive if you have a car i'm sure you'll love this region and having a starting salary at k that should be find good luck in what ever you decide ken Washington Metro Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway) Baltimore, Maryland Maryland Beltway sniper attacks Hartford, Connecticut Interstate 95 Wall Street Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia) Public transport Montgomery County, Maryland Interstate Highway Tram Grand Forks, North Dakota Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Potomac River Bay Area Rapid Transit Alexandria, Virginia Light rail Milwaukee, Wisconsin Rapid transit Virginia Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Rail transit in Baltimore, Maryland Muni Metro Transportation in Richmond, Virginia 14th Street Bridge (Washington, D.C.)
