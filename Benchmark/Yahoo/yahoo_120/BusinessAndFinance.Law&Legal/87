is the dob necessarily required to do a background check i went on an interview recently and i signed the disclosures to do background check however no where on those forms did it say to include my dob they have my name and s s isn't that more than enough i got a call today from my potential new employer that they need my dob to do my background check however i did not get the call from the actual third party company they hire to do the background checks requesting this information so to summarize should i give it to them or are they just trying to find out how old i am to base it on whether they will give me the job thank you for your responses most were very helpful i just had that little doubt b c it's true they are not allowed to ask for dob during interviews but i wasn't too sure if they could after the interview it is a bit of a catch isn't it it's illegale to ask about age and martial status during interviews but in order to get the job you need the background check that exposes all i am sure they really don't care about your age its really about protecting their assets employees and clients overall i think its a good thing it makes things safer for you too it should weed out possible cooky co workers Plame affair Drug test Background check Probation officer Corporate governance Plame affair timeline Karl Rove Trade union Classified information Mach kernel Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Enterprise content management Wal-Mart Poker jargon Identity theft Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Insurance Theory of conduct Unemployment Outsourcing CPU cache Debugging Jeff Gannon Cheating in Counter-Strike Datatype Social rule Unlawful combatant Cross site scripting Organic farming SCO-Linux controversies Customer relationship management Contract Patent application HTTP cookie 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Arguments for and against drug prohibition Baseball John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004 Google Pretty Good Privacy Domain Name System C plus plus AppleTalk Computer virus Kasparov versus The World Shinn Asuka Epistemology Employment Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Security clearance Information Services Procurement Library Avenue Q Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Transmission Control Protocol Open access Illegal immigration Freenet Lawyer Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Surveillance Microsoft 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Trademark Steve Jobs Check (board game) HyperText Transfer Protocol Quantitative marketing research Internet Relay Chat Bank fraud Union shop Friends 2004 Republican National Convention Harry Bridges Intellectual property Conflict of interest Prolog Pitaten Whistleblower USA PATRIOT Act FairTax George W.
