north carolina court ordered arbitration if someone decides to sue me and it is court ordered to arbitration arent i suppose to be informed beforehand that i am being sued i received something in the mail saying my case has been referred to arbitration and i was never informed that i was being sued on anything i thought when you file a lawsuit that you need to serve the other party papers isnt that correct what should i do any suggestions thanks in advance if this is a large amount of money ask a lawyer if this is a small amount of money and arbitration is easier than going to court to argue about whether you were served with papers who cares whether they should have served you also make sure you are the right person sometimes things get screwed up and the wrong person receives something in the mail Contract Lawsuit Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Appeal Tort reform Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Supreme Court of the United States Ethics Medical malpractice United States district court Negligence Dred Scott v.
