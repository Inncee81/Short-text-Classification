my question posted earlier about the old bag retiring i want to advise everyone who was ugly to me the entire situation so that maybe you would understand where i am comming from this woman is very mean with regards to talking trash about other co worker lots of stuff thats not true she makes me do alot of her work for her and at the same time taking the credit for it when the boss is not going to be there she intentionally comes in hr sometimes hrs late now before you start judging me you should have all the facts thank you i just read both of your posts and as an hr director consultant trainer i'm going to offer you some constructive feedback and you can choose to get upset or you can choose to take it for what it's meant to be help keep in mind that it's your choice first and foremost it's also your choice in how you deal with this person how you refer to this person how you control your own emotions etc you can't blame the old lady for your own bad attitude you may be legitimately frustrated but it's still your choice in how you deal with it you are very defensive to everyone who judged you and didn't have all of the facts yet you are the one who posted a question asking for advice and failed to provide all of the facts to begin with at the same time being very derogatory in reference to someone's age it's attitudes like that in which we can't read your mind but you poorly choose your words are why people like me are brought in to clean up your mistakes in a harassment situation whether you care to admit it or not or whether you realize it or not that is exactly what you are creating if you are referring to this person in such a manner in the workplace as one poster stated you don't have mandatory retirement however there is age discrimination and protection for older workers and you could legitimately place yourself and your company in a position to get sued please take that very seriously so when you carelessly throw out comments like you did in your original post and that's not judging you you were careless in your writing and you don't back up your statements with fact vs emotion then people are going to respond as they did i'm not going to make assumptions about your work environment but the other thing i will caution you on is that in addition to age disrimination harassment lawsuits there are also what are called constructive discharge lawsuits in which someone quits because the work environment is so hostile that any reasonable person in a similar situation would be forced to quit you may think i'm referencing that as an option for you but i'm not when i say that i'm talking about your asking how you can get rid of the other person even if someone is treating you poorly you treating the other person poorly in return won't help the situation and could as one other poster responded cost you your job another thing to keep in mind is if this person is established and gets away with this stuff your boss may be aware of it and accept it in exchange for the loyalty blackmail whatever you won't know the reasons there may be nothing you can do about the situation and you might need to look for another job if it bothers you that badly i say this from experience i've been the employee co worker and even as the hr director in organizations that had that same kind of person and there was nothing i could do about it sometimes you just have to suck it up however i will suggest that there are some resources that may help you in dealing with the situation a little more effectively if you want to continue working there you have got to make the decision though to be the bigger person in this situation and remove the name calling age references etc from your vocabulary there are two books that are easy to read and considered some of the best resources for dealing with interpersonal work relationships they are written by a group of business professionals and there are training seminars all over the country using their material they also have a website in which they have an email newsletter in which people submit their questions to the author and get professional feedback vs yahoo answers feedback and you could possibly get some great help by seeking them out but again you will have to rephrase your question with facts basic respect to get any respectable answers if you are open to reading the books the books themselves could possibly give you the tools you need to learn how to approach your boss about this person or perhaps how to approach this person directly or even how to adjust your behavior so as not to let this person get to you so much the books are crucial conversations and crucial confrontations and the website is www vitalsmarts com the premise behind these books is that if people knew how to properly have crucial conversations especially in business how much more successful we could be as people but also the companies themselves that benefit a classic example is with enron worldcom arthur anderson assuming you are familiar with their downfall people in those companies knew there were things wrong but no one knew how to effectively speak up and have those conversations that could have possibly saved those companies more than you asked for or wanted i'm sure but hopefully you can take it for what it's worth as an attempt to help you figure out a
