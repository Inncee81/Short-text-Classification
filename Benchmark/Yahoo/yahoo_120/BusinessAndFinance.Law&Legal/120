good reason for leaving a job when asked why i left my last job is this a good response i do not agree with the companies business ethics and procedures what do you think what would be a good response the company is awful i have a boss who does not talk to me and they do not pay their bills on time which makes my job difficult and of course nothing is their fault i have people telling me to do the same thing different i just need out and need a professional way of saying it thanks i absolutely agree with you if your company is irresponsible and unethical and your quality of life and work suffers for it then you absolutely have every right to leave that job and find one that values you as an employee and an individual i feel the best way to state your concerns and reasons for leaving are to be honest for my personal assurance i would wait until i found another job before leaving that one and either call a meeting with my boss or write a letter that states that i cannot work in an environment that supports irresponsibility and unethical behavior and have taken a better opportunity elsewhere state that you've tried to discuss these issues with management and have been continuously denied and feel you are worth more than that as an employee and an individual inform them you are leaving this workplace in favor of an enriching and responsible environment best of luck Ethics Goodness and value theory Business ethics Workplace democracy Theory of conduct Value system Libertarianism Infantilism Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rick Santorum American individualist anarchism Religious Society of Friends Labor theory of value Economic inequality Ethical consumerism Management Scientology beliefs and practices Capitalism Abortion debate Social rule Termination of employment Strategic management Outsourcing Worldwide green parties John Howard Yoder Sexual harassment Objectivist philosophy Alignment (role-playing games) Transactional analysis Unemployment Externality Microeconomics Beetle in an Anthill Economy of the United States Procrastination Divorce Sexual orientation Contract Polyamory Nicomachean Ethics Sweatshop Liberalism Australian industrial relations legislation, 2005 Privatization Corporate social responsibility Autism rights movement Call centre Friedrich Schleiermacher Negligence Profession Librarian Customer relationship management Criticism of libertarianism Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Anarcho-capitalism Science Principal-agent problem S__ren Kierkegaard Paralegal Mental Health Act 1983 Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Coercion Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) ISO 9000 Economics Capital accumulation Offshoring Sydney Riot of 1879 Warren Buffett Health insurance Individualist anarchism Reliability engineering Audiophile Democracy Information Technology Infrastructure Library Occupational Medicine Pitaten Annuity Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Bernard Williams Theodicy Insurance Past teachings of Prem Rawat Non-aggression principle Freeters Patent Abortion Social justice Social psychology Killian documents Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Poker jargon Anarchism and society Homo economicus
