at will position states i must give weeks notice how can this be the mock contract states employment is at will either party may terminate with two weeks notice how can it be at will and require two weeks notice there are no length year etc terms on the contract does the employer usually require weeks notice from the employee good answer je please please please understand that employment at will contract are two different things are not synonomous you can't have both either you are an at will employee or you have an employment contract all but states unions and the railroad industry as a whole are employment at will so unless you are in one of those categories a teacher or similar profession education in high level sales or exec management odds are that you are an at will employee just as your post states therefore you don't have a contract however if your employer is naive enough to refer to your at will status as a mock contract or contract then you could have what is called an implied contract and push the issue based on company policy a lot of companies state as a matter of company policy not as a matter of law that you are required to give a weeks notice if you fail to give the appropriate notice then they are at liberty to write terms into their policy not their contract that they may not pay out vacation which is correctly stated by another posted not to be a required benefit or not to consider you eligible for re hire the catch to this is if they apply this policy consistently to all employee's who fail to give a week notice if they don't then you may have recourse the caveat to you is what is that 'penalty' for failure to provide notice and is it worth it to you is it worth it for a future employer to check your references only to be told you are ineligible for re hire just for failing to give weeks notice even if you are were a stellar employee remember at will is a matter of law whereas the weeks notice is simply company policy Contract Trade union Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Insurance Life insurance Microeconomics United States Postal Service Immigration to the United States Monetary policy Inflation Keynesian economics Administrative law of the United States Public domain Trademark Minimum wage Affirmative action Civil rights Lawyer Blackjack Intellectual property Graduate school Poker jargon Arbitration Wal-Mart Extreme Programming Corporate governance Article One of the United States Constitution Copyright Arturo Frondizi No Child Left Behind Act Appeal Juris Doctor Supply and demand Democracy UK Singles Chart Estoppel Unemployment Apprenticeship Leasehold estate American Civil Liberties Union Quizbowl Treaty Politics of Russia Plame affair Contract bridge Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Software engineering Mutual fund Classified information Unlawful combatant Democratic Party (United States) Education in the People's Republic of China Politics of Hong Kong Password Domestic partnerships in California CPU cache Advance fee fraud National Insurance Equal Protection Clause Business ethics Education in the United States Indian nationality law Same-sex marriage Judicial review United Kingdom corporation tax National Football League Billboard Hot 100 Government of France Air traffic controller Social contract Redundant array of independent disks Employment discrimination Scholarship Health insurance Constitution of Ireland Privatization Same-sex marriage in the United States Intelligent design Abortion debate British House of Commons Congress of the United States Economic inequality Workplace democracy Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Glossary of American football Taxation in the United States Florida Central Voter File Planetary nebula Evidence (law)
