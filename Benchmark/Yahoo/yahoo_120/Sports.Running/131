if im thinking about joining my hs xc running team do i need to get sum trail shoes i was thinking along the lines of an asics or saucany shoe yes generally there should be a movable back heel so you get more grip on the ground and it moves with the different terrain to help keep you stable if you're running in that kind of environment like hiking trails and stuff it should be fine if you're running on more flat ground they might be too heavy i would switch to a more cushioned and lighter weight shoe just make sure you find a heel cup to hold your foot in place so you don't roll your ankle Skateboarding trick Equine conformation High-heeled shoe Professional wrestling holds Hiking Casualty lifting Rugby union Snowboarding Fast bowling Aerial (dance move) Badminton Sailing Trail Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Marching band Railroad switch Glossary of climbing terms Lindy Basic Billiards Backpacking (wilderness) Punt (boat) Snowboard Bicycle Ski Kurt Angle Professional wrestling attacks Rail terminology Irish dance Car handling Trapping Suplex Professional wrestling throws Anchor Professional wrestling slang Cross-country skiing Swingout Figure skating Glossary of American football Running National Football League Lore Contredanse Volleyball Parachuting Glossary of partner dance terms Mountain bike Foot Tennessee Walker Tap dance Tire Golf Softball Fencing Horse gait Footwear Mouse (computing) Boot Horse Clean and jerk All-terrain vehicle Knife Inflation Tennis Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Roller skating Flat feet Snowshoe Telemark skiing Bass drum Skateboard Skateboarding Paragliding Mattress Trail running Horseshoe Pickup truck Long Path Mechanical advantage Canadian football Narrow gauge Iliotibial band syndrome Reebok Trail blazing Death Valley National Park Glossary of ballet terms Kokoda Track Campaign Armored Core Iditarod Parade (military) Empire Burlesque Peleliu Triathlon Chair Charles Ashenoff 1957 World Series Broomball Recumbent bicycle Appalachian Trail Opportunity rover
