quick way to improve mile time i've been at a week camp all summer for science we worked out maybe days a week if that but i had to walk to classes which averaged probably about miles a day not including afternoon activities so it wasn't just a lazy summer however i got back about a week ago and have been working out running squats lunges etc like crazy because soccer try outs are next week to make varsity we have to run laps mi in mins i ran last night my lap times was around i don't think i was running my hardest though do you have any ideas of how to improve that time in a week aerobic conditiong sprints nutrition advice etc sorry miles lol if you could run miles in minutes you'd be an amazing runner that works out to for k which is quite a bit faster than the current world record with one week there isn't much you can do it takes two to three weeks for training to have much effect if you can run by yourself you will be able to run quite a bit faster when you are running with your teammates i'd focus on basic conditioning that will help you throughout the soccer season to minutes of easy running every other day should be plenty in addition to whatever soccer practice you're doing be careful about exercising too much otherwise you will just be sore and your time will be worse one harder workout you may want to try is a pace workout at the target speed for laps miles works out to for two laps try the following warm up and stretch run laps m at don't run faster than this jog or walk for minutes repeat and three times for a total of m runs stetch and cool down do this workout preferably days before the time trial but if you must days before it will train you to run the goal pace without the complete stress of running the entire laps at once go easy the two days before the time trial stay hydrated eat a good diet and get plenty of sleep Weight training Running Indianapolis 500 Marathon (sport) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Triathlon Middle distance track event Swimming Equine conformation 24 Hours of Le Mans Seabiscuit 2005 Iditarod Baseball Aerobic exercise Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Babe Ruth Ben Johnson (athlete) The Amazing Race Stomach cancer Clinical depression Haile Gebrselassie Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Ayrton Senna Tony Stewart First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bodybuilding Sprint (race) Fast bowling Unreal Atkins Nutritional Approach Breastfeeding Ernie Irvan Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Drill instructor Lance Armstrong Medicine Fecal incontinence CPU design Andr__s Galarraga Central processing unit Chronic fatigue syndrome The Citadel (Military College) American football Iditarod Heart rate Iliotibial band syndrome 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Tire Ravi Shastri World Series Tour de France Climate of the United Kingdom Horse gait Welding Volleyball Tung Chung Electrophysiology Athletics NASCAR Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder RISC Violin IBM PC compatible STS-62 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pittsburgh Steelers Certified Nursing Assistant Lake Speed Dieting Detroit Tigers 2005 United States Grand Prix Norway national football team Education in the People's Republic of China Fanny Blankers-Koen New York Giants Physical fitness Dog agility Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Football (soccer) Michael Schumacher Hendrick Motorsports Mario Kart 64 Compiler optimization The Cure Hypertension
