getting contacts soon help im getting contacts in about weeks can anyone give me some tips advice info on them is it hard putting them in helppp thanks jim i would suggest geting soft contacts they are easier to put in are less noticeable and you can wear them longer when i first got my contacts my doctor wouldn't let me leave before i could put my contacts in take them out and then put them back in again it took me about an hour to even get one contact in but now it's a breeze it only takes about seconds to put both contact in some important information about soft contacts there are two sides to a contact soft contacts can flip back and forth so make sure you check to see if you are putting your contact in the correct way when you hold your contact up it should look like half of an orange not like an umbrella your doctor should show this to you but if they don't just ask it's important to clean your contacts when you take them out and when you put them in nothing hurts more then putting a contact in that has a piece of dirt or a hair on it don't go swimming when you have your contacts in if you go underwater although i find that taking a shower with them in is okay it's not very comfortable in a lake or a pool the chlorine in the pool can make your eyes burn too this is kind of obvious but i still do it sometimes without even thinking don't rub your eyes when you are wearing your contacts your contact can pop out or worse get caught in the corner of your eye it's even possible for your contacts to rip this has never happened to me but it has happened to one of my friends take your contacts out when you go to sleep funny for me to offer this advice because i rarely do but it's bad for your eyes if you don't if you forgot to take them out or couldn't for some reason keep a bottle of eyedrops around when you wake up your eyes will be very dry and it can be quite painful it's easier just to take them out plus your eyes need a break just like the rest of your body finally change your contacts as needed if you wear daily contacts make sure to change them everyday the same goes for days one month your contacts can go bad just like food and there is no point in wearing them if they are bad as for putting in your contacts you'll have to experiment and see what works for you i personally only use one finger to keep my eye open but my friend can't do it without two your doctor should offer you some advice when i first got my contacts i didn't want to wear them because it took so long for me to get them in the more you practice the easier it will be i love contacts although they can sometimes be a hassle i would never go back to just wearing glasses i hope this helps you out Social rule The Shining (film) Contact lens Mattress Diving Breastfeeding Volleyball Fecal incontinence Violin Milton H.
