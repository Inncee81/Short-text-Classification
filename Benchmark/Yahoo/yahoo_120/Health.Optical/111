wear contacts okay so i wear contacts instead of eye glasses and its my first time to ever have contacts so my contacts are tin and they are the flexable ones i also wear clear contacts so my contacts are suppose to expire in week do you think if i still keep on wearing them after they are expired it might hurt my eyes or do something to it or do you think i shouldn't wear them i would have bought more contacts but my job did a mistake with my check so thats the reason i couldn't by more contacts i would highly recommend not wearing them past the one week it wont hurt you too much if you use them a couple of days but not another full week the reason being is that they start to deteriorate and will bother your eyes much more than before also wearing them longer can cause permanent damage to your eyes what you my want to consider is contacting your doctors office and telling them what happened most of the time they will give you a trial pair free since you have to go back and get more anyway i have had to do this before and they were always very nice about it i went in explained my situation ordered the new ones box for each eye and they gave me a couple pairs to tide me over Social rule The Shining (film) Theory of conduct Contact lens Ocean's Twelve Plame affair Colony in Space New York Giants Roswell UFO incident Diving Fancy Crane Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rei Ayanami The Parting of the Ways Avenue Q The Five Doctors Day of the Daleks The Contender (television series) Solar cell Marilyn Monroe Infantilism Father's Day (Doctor Who) Pitaten Sin City Glasses Starfleet ranks and insignia Boom Town (Doctor Who) Battle of the Bulge The Empty Child High-heeled shoe Leeds United F.C.
