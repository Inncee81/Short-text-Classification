why do my eyes hurt i have been wearing contacts for years now today i opened a brand new packet and when i tried putting them in my eyes my eyes hurt like hell and went red i checked if they were backwards and they werent everything was clean too why is this happening please help there are certain conditions under which you shouldn't wear your contacts do you have a cold or the flu i find that if i've tried to wear mine with a cold my eyes just seem to reject them and go all sore and red alternatively could the contacts be out of date though an unopened packet is there any way they could have expired i suggest that you give your eyes a rest for a day or two keeping your eyes moist with eye gel or drops and then try putting them in again if you experience the same problem don't try putting them in again just make an appointment with your optician they should advise you on whats going wrong Social rule Contact lens Common cold The Shining (film) Herpes simplex virus Theory of conduct H5N1 Diving Conjunctivitis Glasses Homer Simpson Blood (computer game) Jam (TV series) Teen Girl Squad Condom Sunglasses Menstrual cup Professional wrestling throws Alcoholics Anonymous Influenza Apollo 8 Jon Secada Domain Name System Royal Assent Futurama (TV series - season 5) Chess strategy and tactics Daylight saving time Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Judas Priest Carburetor Eye Plame affair Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Time Out of Mind Mouth ulcer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Diabetic retinopathy Paul Is Dead Aerial (dance move) HTTP cookie Chronic fatigue syndrome Oral sex Eyeglass prescription Samuel Goldwyn Myopia Diseases of the honeybee Netfilter/iptables Keratoconus Killian documents Through the Looking-Glass Universal Serial Bus Shaggy dog story Wound Equine conformation Error correction and detection Pitaten Monty Hall problem A Day in the Life Japanese toilet Nuclear power phase-out Marathon (sport) Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Eye contact Quality of service GoldenEye W.I.T.C.H.
