need glasses or a second opinion last week my year old daughter had her physical and i was told that her vision was however her left eye is the doctor insisted that i have her checked next year i was thinking that i should have her tested again by an eye doctor any suggestions side bar i don't want to get glasses too early as she will become dependent on them on the other hand i don't want her bumping into walls she already has two left feet d if bad eyesight runs in the family i would go ahead and get her eyes checked honestly the results that you get during a physical will likely be different then what your child will see in an optometrists office the optometrist will be able to tell if your child has an astigmatism or any other vision problems that need to be addressed and rather than thinking about the potential of your daughter becoming dependent on eyewear that will help her see better i would think of the good that would come from her getting adjusted to lower prescriptions that could potentially be stronger in the future of course that is if she even has a need for eyewear on a personal note my oldest daughter was when i got about the same results your daughter did during a physical i took her in to the optometrist i worked for at the time and her visual acuity was and a little different then during the physical he prescribed a in both eyes now years later she is wearing a in both eyes i was glad that i started her so young because then it wasn't such a shock as her prescription increased Glasses Eyeglass prescription Optometry Eye Myopia Snellen chart Bates Method Glaucoma Diving Medical prescription Visual acuity Amblyopia Keratoconus Clinical depression Diabetic retinopathy Physical examination Stomach cancer Contact lens Diabetes mellitus Blindness LASIK 2000 Australian Grand Prix Medicare (Canada) Inflation The Unquiet Dead Eye examination Theory of conduct Stereoscopy Goggles Ultraviolet Multiple sclerosis Dyslexia Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Mach kernel Visual perception Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Extreme Programming Addiction Urinary incontinence Division of labour Orthoptics Cannabis (drug) Wolfrider Target Corporation The Shining (film) Traumatic brain injury The Doctor Dances Abortion debate Keynesian economics Internet troll Methamphetamine Psoriasis Medical record Autostereogram Father's Day (Doctor Who) Eyepiece Hypnosis Fecal incontinence Social rule Equine conformation Milton H.
