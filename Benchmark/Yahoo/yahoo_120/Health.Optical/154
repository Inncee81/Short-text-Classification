how comfortable are contacts what is the best brand to get i have been wearing glasses most of my life and want a change im thinking of getting contact so when i go out i don't have to worry about them falling out and wearing glasses for home what is the best brand are they comfortable plus when i go home i just want to fall into bed are they that high maintenance well i just started wearing contacts weeks ago they are a lot of maintenance at first it still takes me about minutes to get them in in the morning i can now take them out very quickly but the first week i really struggled with that part i do love them though now that i am used to them you barely feel them throughout the day and i can see way better with them opposed to my glasses since they are right on the eye it just takes some practice and patience at the beginning most contacts are fda approved for overnight wear but i wouldn't recommend it i tried it at first so i wouldn't have to bother putting them in in the morning they did not feel so good when i got up anyway if you have patience for the first few weeks you will love them and who knows you may be able to pick it up quicker than me good luck Time Out of Mind Social rule Mattress About a Boy Customs and etiquette of Japan Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blood on the Tracks The Emancipation of Mimi Extreme Programming Scenes from a Memory Slow Train Coming Oh My Goddess!
