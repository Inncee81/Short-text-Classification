i need to see a picture of a person with astigmatism i wish i can see a picture i been asking these for months lol yes honestly people with astigmatism look just like everyone else actually astigmatism is more common then you may think many people have it i have a fairly mild astigmatism but i am not sending you a picture of myself lol i assure you i look normal tho astigmatism is due to your cornea or lens inside your eye being shaped more cylindrical like a football rather then spherical like a baseball this causes the light to be focused at different points of your retina which creates blurry vision this is definitely something you cannot see with the naked eye Astigmatism Eyeglass prescription Contact lens Eye Glasses Cornea Keratoconus LASIK Lens (optics) Intraocular lens Aberration in optical systems Eyepiece Autostereogram Myopia Diabetic retinopathy Telescope Bates Method Stereoscopy Refractive surgery Color blindness Perspective projection distortion Iris (anatomy) Presbyopia Philosophy of perception Sun Albinism Pupil Wavefront Thomas Young (scientist) Visual system Anamorphic widescreen Trilobite Depth of field Schmidt camera Eye surgery IMAX Eye examination Optical cavity Laser Visual perception Retina Visual loss Red eye (medicine) Red-eye effect Tuatara Perspective (graphical) Stage lighting Sensation Macro photography Cinematography Eye contact Photorefractive keratectomy Uvea Retinal detachment Compound eye Spatial disorientation Tocopherol Movie projector Welding Nuclear explosion Reflecting telescope Eye color Octopus Sunglasses View camera Night vision Floater Ritchey-Chr__tien telescope Photographic lens Naked eye Microscope Panavision Multiple integral Fusor Macular degeneration Coordinates (mathematics) Teleological argument Persistence of vision Homunculus History of telescopes Chalazion Single-lens reflex camera Panoramic photography Black hole LOL (Internet slang) Amblyopia Color Nystagmus Chlorpromazine Technicolor Nuclear weapon design Parallax Solar eclipse Conjunctivitis Hypertensive retinopathy Shaped charge Light
