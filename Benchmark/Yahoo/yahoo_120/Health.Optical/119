any tips or suggestions i just got contacts i used to have contacts but now my eyes get too dry for some reason i have not figured out yet make sure you clean them everyday if they are that kind take them out at night or when you are sleeping they will be much more comfortable the next day wash your hands before you do anything with your eyes or contacts if there is a lot of wind or dust close your eyes so you don't get dirt in them carry eye drops with you in case they feel dry you can moisten them while they are right in your eye i got so good at this i could even put drops in while i was driving using one hand at first i had trouble getting them on the front of my eye and then i discovered that when you are putting them in look in the mirror at your eye not at the contact and finger coming at you if you look at the contact coming at your eye you will be more likely to blink if you drop it in the sink stop everything and look for it don't move it will be in the most unexpected spot that's about all i know they are so much more comfortable to wear than glasses Eye Social rule The Amber Spyglass Contact lens Time Out of Mind Electrophysiology Volleyball Stereoscopy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Skateboarding trick Milton H.
