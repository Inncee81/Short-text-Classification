i just got back from the eye doctor i have huge pupils and i see very poorly hi guys i went to the eye doctor this morning to check my vision everything was fine and they dropped some eye drops into my eyes so that they would dilate and so they could check for anything abnormal apparently the assistant forgot to tell me that we had to come back to the office so i wasn't checked so i was dilated for nothing anywho my pupils have been huge and my vision has been poor for the past hours is this normal when will it go away it might take the rest of the day for the dilation to go away it's normal to have huge pupils and have unclear vision when your eyes are dilated i hope you wore sunglasses when you were coming home from the optometrist not wearing sunglasses can cause some eye damage since the dilation makes your eyes much more irritated by light well really you needed the sunglasses outside and they might have been important inside if you were using any really bright lights Diabetic retinopathy Glasses Glaucoma Iris (anatomy) Sunglasses Eye Eye examination Pupil Hypoglycemia Intraocular lens Childbirth Medical prescription Traumatic brain injury Turner syndrome Deadly nightshade Intact dilation and extraction Contact lens Red eye (medicine) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Breech birth Binoculars Sunlight Methamphetamine Diabetes mellitus Optometry Cat Red-eye effect Eyeglass prescription Migraine Multiple sclerosis Time dilation Stroke Blonde on Blonde Saint Nicholas Solar eclipse Equine conformation Speed of light Keratoconus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Intracranial pressure Cyclops (comics) Stereoscopy Atropine Street light Combine (Half-Life 2) Slit lamp Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fecal incontinence Autonomic nervous system Iritis Poker jargon Eye color Binocular vision Bret Hart Milton H.
