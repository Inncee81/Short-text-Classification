to all with ear piercings and tattoos from desparate parent my teenage girl wants to put 'stretcher' in her ear i urged her to wait until she's to do something so permanent that might hinder future job prospects however she says she wont regret getting it when she is older so i was wondering if there were people out there who have or had an ear stretcher or tattoos and do or dont they regret getting them and why thanks in advance okay i am a year old girl and i personally i like piercings and tattoos but i think that is a little drastic i wouldn't let her do it like you said it might hinder her job opportunities in the future plus if she regrets it it will be difficult and costly to undo she should at least give it a lot of thought before she gets it done no one really ever does something thinking wow i'm probably going to regret this later so obviously she doesn't think she will regret it i myself have my tragus part of the ear pierced which isn't as drastic as what your daughter wants but i still think i should have given it more thought before i got it done it was pretty spur of the moment so basically the year old girl who likes piercings and tats agrees with the mom wow this is a first haha Earring Charmed Theory of conduct Futurama (TV series - season 5) Naruto jutsu Body piercing Atomic Kitten Calvin and Hobbes Friends Knots Landing Characters in the Smurfs About a Boy EastEnders Great Teacher Onizuka Humphrey Bogart Kurt Cobain Kodocha The Death Gate Cycle YuYu Hakusho Ken Chu Little Britain Social rule Characters of Naruto Fruits Basket Body modification Nine Inch Nails Zits Series finale My Life as a Teenage Robot Stewie Griffin The Fairly OddParents Megan Griffin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Angelina Jolie Invader Zim Questionable Content The Catcher in the Rye Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow Marilyn Monroe Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Kylie Minogue Time Out of Mind Karl Rove Badly Drawn Kitties God Emperor of Dune Shaggy dog story Ashlee Simpson Kevin and Kell The Human Stain Negima Recurring South Park characters Tenchi Muyo!
