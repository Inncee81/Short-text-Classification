son's toilet troubles i have a son who turned in july for about the last months he has started pooing himself this does not happen everyday but i do not know what to do some people have told us to ignore him and just get on with it as he is doing it for attention but i cannot understand why it happens and why it is not happening everyday for instance we went camping with friends over the weekend friday and saturday was fine sunday he done it four times once was minutes after we cleared him up it is like he goes to the loo but does not wipe himself properly when he does go he does tell us and we check him to make sure he has wiped properly which never seems to be a problem but this is just like he cannot be botherered to go has anyone else experienced this i have an yr old boy and a yr old girl and it never happended to them can someone give me some pointers please i think your son may have some sort of bowel problem it may be that he suddenly gets the urge and isn't able to hold it in properly this could be to do with his diet or could be anxiety related but it does sound like he just isn't able to get to the toilet in time either that or he knows he needs to go but doesnt want to and is trying unsuccessfully to hold it in i'd take him to the doctor to rule out any more serious medical issues but you also need to talk to your son about this tell him to go as soon as he feels the urge and that whatever he is doing can wait if he is just doing this because he doesn't want to go to the toilet then perhaps the suggestion that his school friends would be horrified will be enough to make him change his behaviour don't embarrass him though relative had a child with similar problems at age Urinary incontinence Milton H.
