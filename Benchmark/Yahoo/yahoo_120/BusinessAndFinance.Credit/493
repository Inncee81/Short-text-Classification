does buying a new car affect your credit like right away or do you just looze points for having it pulled i just recently bought a car well days ago and i was just curious to know weather it automaticly dropped my score or did my score go up because of it or will it really not even show up on your credit till after a year ok here's what happened yes your score went down several points because of the inquiry when you applied for the loan depending on whatever else you owe and how much your score may drop because of the additional debt from the car loan that's added to whatever else you owe but your score will start increasing once payments start reporting which can usually take a year or so Credit score Student loan Debt Mortgage Great Depression Bond Credit card Deflation (economics) Government debt Taxation in the United States Derivative (finance) Asian financial crisis Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Monetary policy Money Auto insurance Interest Credit history U.S. public debt Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy United Kingdom corporation tax Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Schabir Shaik Trial Money supply Short selling Social Credit Annuity Security (finance) Primerica Financial Services History of the United States (1918-1945) Debt levels and flows Microcredit Bank Ford Motor Company Supply and demand Tour de France Personal finance Collateralized debt obligation Microeconomics Marshall Plan SAT Rugby union Life insurance Insurance Credit default swap Identity theft Islamic economics Developing countries' debt 2005 United States Grand Prix Capital accumulation Islamic banking Ravi Shastri Hyperinflation Economy of Pakistan $ale of the Century Predatory lending Canadian Pacific Railway Refinancing Economy of the United States Jeopardy!
