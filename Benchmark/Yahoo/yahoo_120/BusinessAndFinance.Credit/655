question about credit score i have outstanding accounts that have gone into collection long story at any rate are under the other one is about here's my dilemma right now i have the money to pay off the smaller accounts or the larger account if i pay off the the larger one will have to wait or vice versa what would be most beneficial when it concerns my credit score or does it even matter i forgot to add that i have negotiated and have received in writing that the accounts will be deleted from my credit report thanks dave i listen to clark howard he is awesome gonna hurt either way i would knock off the smaller ones first all will show up on the report i think it would be better to show that you are getting rid of you debt and having only outstanding would look better thatn just my opinion though don't know for sure like i said though your score will already be hurt just got to show that you can get out of it and keep it that way good luck Bond Credit card Deflation (economics) Mortgage Rich Mullins Government debt Sydney Riot of 1879 FairTax Social Security (United States) Prisoner's dilemma Tax Credit score Keynesian economics Money Game show Finance Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Derivative (finance) Plame affair Microeconomics Theory of conduct Monetary policy Corporation Gold standard Mergers and acquisitions Supply-side economics Debt levels and flows Margin of error Economy of Russia Cincinnati Bengals Personal finance Dave Ramsey Credit history Animal Crossing Health insurance Major League Baseball television contracts Ra (board game) The Amazing Race Hyperinflation Neopets Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Article One of the United States Constitution Law of value Edward R.
