i want to pay off my debts i need advice on how to raise my credit score i have two accounts in collections both and avg of i want to pay them off as soon as possible but i also want them to reflect as good on my credit report im finally getting it cleaned up yes i know that i racked up the debt im obligated to pay it its no ones fault but my own bla bla bla spare me the lecture im trying to do the right thing now my questions are do i pay in full or settle the debt how can i get them to remove the negative tradelines off of my credit report once its paid what do i say to negotiate the removal of negative marks as a stipulation just to make my question a little clearer im will pay both of the debts i just want to know what is the best way to go about it so that i and my credit can maximize the benefits the most i also have the money and ready to settle or pay in full i dont need a payment plan first of all settling your debt is like declaring bankruptcy the only difference is that you still have to pay something you don't want to do that your best bet is to pay off your balance in full once you do this use your credit card for general spending never spend more than you can pay off for a month this will slowly build your credit back up you need to establish a record of spending and paying off your debts i'd also ask around about some of the credit repair services available to you most are a scam but i've talked to people who have had good experiences as well the unfortunate thing here is there really isn't an overnight solution you just have to spend responsibly and establish good credit again Credit card Bond Credit score Debt Government debt Economy of Russia Microeconomics Gold standard FairTax Child support Poker jargon Student loan Bank fraud Social Security debate (United States) Mortgage Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Tax U.S. public debt Derivative (finance) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Money Primerica Financial Services Credit repair Personal finance Keynesian economics Betting (poker) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit history Debt consolidation Inflation Dave Ramsey U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Law of value Externality Taxation in the United States Craps Monetary policy Tax protester Estoppel Collateralized debt obligation Great Depression Schabir Shaik Trial Bank Unemployment Public transport Legal tender Live 8 Pension Fiat money Interest Capitalism Value added tax Marshall Plan Aztec Tom DeLay Gross domestic product Assignment (law) History of the United States (1789-1849) Graduate school Athenian democracy Commodity markets Weimar Republic Avenue Q Internet fraud Divorce Enron Corporation Corporation Minimum wage Reparations for slavery Security (finance) Anarchism and capitalism Social Credit Payroll Finance Kyoto Protocol Neville Chamberlain Flat tax Hyperinflation Credit card fraud Euro Economy of the United States Copyleft Municipal bond History of the United States (1918-1945) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Contract
