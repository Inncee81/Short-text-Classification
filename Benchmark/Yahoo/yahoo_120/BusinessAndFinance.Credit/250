is anyone planning on paying their mortgage i mean if others will get help for not paying why should anyone pay because that assistance is limited if everybody stopped paying the assistance would collapse overnight not to mention what would happen to the real estate market as a whole i hear your frustration though why should you have to stand on the sidelines while those who got in over their heads get financial help it is unfair but you will benefit from it believe me if those properties go into foreclosure it will very likely have a negative effect on the value of your home when appraisal time rolls around if these people can stay afloat it will prevent the equity in your property from disappearing this is a messy situation and won't be fixed any time soon so sit tight the ride is just getting started Mortgage Deflation (economics) Allodial title Insurance Real estate Predatory lending Government National Mortgage Association Real estate bubble Property tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Mortgage-backed security Real estate broker Great Depression Flat tax Taxation in the United States Debt Housing cooperative Income trust Bond FairTax Foreclosure Trust (Law) USA Public transport Microeconomics Personal finance Concurrent estate Poker jargon Real estate developer Construction Corporate governance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Federal National Mortgage Association Security (finance) Intellectual property California Proposition 13 (1978) Common Agricultural Policy Derivative (finance) Donald Trump Assignment (law) Islamic banking Minimum wage Primerica Financial Services Estoppel Capitalism Inheritance tax Public policy Leasing Asian financial crisis New York Giants Tariff Annuity Trust (Law) non-USA Mutual fund Keynesian economics 401(k) Title insurance Externality Gold standard Financial services Unemployment Real estate appraisal British property bubble History of post-Soviet Russia Fee simple Tax Oakland Athletics Monopoly (game) American football strategy Personal property Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Affirmative action Natural monopoly Easement Worldwide ERC Debt levels and flows Student loan Leasehold estate Wells Fargo Dogpatch USA Salary cap History of the United States (1918-1945) British residential property market Government of Maryland Futures contract ACORN Thomas de Littleton Kyoto Protocol Inflation Economy of Russia Schabir Shaik Trial Health insurance Variable universal life insurance Warren Buffett Annual percentage rate Shaggy dog story New Deal Copyright Glossary of American football
