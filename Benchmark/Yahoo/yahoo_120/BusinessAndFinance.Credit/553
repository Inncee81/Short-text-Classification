i currently have a bank loan with payment protection supplied by hsbc the bank im with would there be any chance i could stop the insurance then get that money back and get independant payment protection which would be cheaper i doubt they would refund the premiums for credit insurance you have already used think about asking your health insurer to refund premiums becasue you were not sick unless you prepaid a significant portion of the insurance on a side note credit life and disability insurance is a complete ripoff you will probably never collect even if you have an incident warranted by your policy sep what types of insurance do you really need there is a lot of confusion these days over what types of insurance you really need there are only three but first let s discuss the kinds of insurance you don t need one kind of insurance you should never buy is credit life insurance also known as croak and choke mortgage life insurance is the technical term the salespeople pretend it s a great idea claiming that if you die your debts are paid off but how important is it to pay off your debts when you re gone basically with this insurance the bank gets paid off and gets your money instead of your heirs in addition the premiums are about times as high as traditional types of life insurance mortgage life s cousin is credit life insurance and you are pushed to get this when you buy a car or other big purchase these are sold as protection for you but really they provide protection for the bank so it s essentially like putting lipstick on a pig maybe it looks better but it s still a pig another popular item is the variable annuity it s almost never a good idea to buy one of these because there are monstrous commissions what about cancer insurance if you get cancer you need health insurance and term life insurance and that s it and if you can t work and need replacement of your income you want disability insurance those are the only three you need all the others you can chuck what about your car you don t need rental insurance when renting a car first of all if you get in an accident you ll owe regardless of whether you have insurance and usually your credit cards or auto insurance company has some type of temporary rental car coverage pec or personal effects coverage which covers things stolen out of your rental car is not necessary either Auto insurance Health insurance Mortgage Annuity Bond Bank Citigroup Publicly funded medicine Personal finance Islamic banking Debt Credit card Predatory lending Money Primerica Financial Services Taxation in the United States Contract Great Depression Commodity markets Security (finance) Home insurance Interest Economy of the United States Financial services Unemployment benefit Variable universal life insurance Title insurance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Tax Term life insurance Student loan Finance Wal-Mart Social Security (United States) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Financial markets Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Derivative (finance) Internet fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Octopus card Credit score HSBC FairTax Health maintenance organization Concurrent estate Monopoly (game) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Capital accumulation Medicare (United States) Cooperative Government debt Lloyd's of London Universal life insurance Social security United Kingdom corporation tax Federal National Mortgage Association Economy of Russia Pension Adverse selection Leasing Inflation United States Postal Service Irish Life and Permanent Real estate broker Islamic economics Gold standard Money supply Payroll Gross domestic product Hyperinflation Savings and loan association Renting Confidence trick Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 US health reform under FDR Fractional-reserve banking Toronto-Dominion Bank Bank fraud Medicare (Canada) Poker jargon Sears Holdings Corporation Mortgage-backed security Popular, Inc Intellectual property Tesco Credit card fraud Neopets Real estate bubble
