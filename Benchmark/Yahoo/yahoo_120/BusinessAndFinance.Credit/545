how do i get my free credit report if i don't live in the u s anymore i suppose i am a little naive when it comes to how this credit thing runs as i moved away from the u s to europe when i turned i have never opened any kind of account whether it be credit cards or bank accounts etc i never changed my surname from my maiden name to my married name with the credit agencies i now have strong reasons to believe that someone in my family in the u s is using my maiden name to open accounts i need to access my free annual credit report but i don't know how to do that i can't even go to the credit report site as it does not allow access for people outside the u s i can't print out the application as the address space is only for u s addresses so what do i do now if anyone has any suggestions then that would be great i can't pay for them online because i do not have a credit card daman as much as it makes me sound like a stupid person i didn't even know what credit was or that credit reports existed until my sister told me about it i had really no reason to know i went from being a high school student to a housewife and my husband who is not american handles all our finances here like i said i am pretty naive when it comes to this i'm trying to get everything sorted now p s you can't call numbers outside the u s try using the contact us address from the website to provide a suggestion or make comments about the annual credit report request service send your correspondence to annual credit report request service po box atlanta ga Identity theft Plame affair United States Postal Service Credit card Cross site scripting Phishing Gmail Stopping e-mail abuse Family name Student loan Domain Name System Surveillance Bank fraud Advance fee fraud IP Multimedia Subsystem Money Virgin Mobile Theory of conduct Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Credit card fraud Mail-order bride GSM services Credit score Global System for Mobile Communications Data retention Public-key cryptography IBM PC compatible System/34 Octopus card 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Credit repair Mail fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hash table Copyleft Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Denial-of-service attack Iron Maiden Apple Open Collaboration Environment E-mail spam Mail Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda Financial services Windows 2000 CPU cache Common Unix Printing System Neopets Credit union Skype RuneScape cheats Bluetooth E-mail Password Star Trek Customizable Card Game Windows XP Xbox Live Spam (electronic) Electronic commerce System/36 Mathematics Classified information History of the Internet Whose Line Is It Anyway?
