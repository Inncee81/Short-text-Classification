after day late payment hits your credit then what im assuming that my soon to be ex is just behind on his payments but what if he continues to pay every month after that late payments are a major score killer they will remain on your credit reports for years from the date of the late you definitely need to speak with your soon to be ex and find out what is going on you didn't mention what type of account it is if it's a credit card account and you are a joint user you might request that your stb ex get a loan to pay the account off then close it if it is a vehicle and you are on the loan you might request that he sell it and pay the note off or get another loan in his name only without listing every type of loan or credit you can see my point get your name off of the account if it is an account where you are only an authorized user dispute the account with the cra's as not having the account in your name since legally it is not your account once you get your name off of the account you might send the creditor a goodwill letter and explain the reason behind the late payment request that they remove the late payment notation from your reports if you are an authorized user or the account gets paid off and closed you may lose the entire tradeline when disputing with the cra's or requesting the creditor to remove the late notation if that happens you would probably take a hit on your scores for losing the account but it would be much better than living with a late notation for the next years keep in mind that as long as your name is on the account if he eventually defaults on it it will go on your credit reports as a default and you may be held liable for it Credit card Annuity Mortgage Islamic banking Bond Credit score Insurance Debt Cheque Bank United Kingdom corporation tax Plame affair Concurrent estate Money Bretton Woods system Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Schabir Shaik Trial Fractional-reserve banking Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Corporation Internet fraud Credit repair Credit derivative Bank fraud Japan-United States relations Life insurance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Octopus card Legal tender Gold standard Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Estoppel Euro Article One of the United States Constitution Derivative (finance) GNU General Public License Primerica Financial Services Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Phishing 401(k) Government debt Economy of Russia Credit default swap Xbox Live Timeline of the Enron scandal Financial audit Mail fraud Food Stamp Program Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Contract Credit risk Double-entry book-keeping History of the Jews in England Canada Health Act Bank of China (Hong Kong) Wachovia HTTP cookie Alex Ferguson Accounting methods Social Security (United States) Copyleft Short selling Canadian National Railway Mortgage-backed security Credit history Playing card E-ZPass Economy of Argentina Developing countries' debt Identity theft Mensal__o scandal Spyware E-mail spam Oxford English Dictionary Taxation in the United States Gmail Universal life insurance Stock Password Government National Mortgage Association PayPal London Congestion Charge Citigroup Tennessee State Constitution Animal Crossing SCO-Linux controversies LiveJournal Advance fee fraud Toll road Trust (Law) USA E-mail Currency Social Credit Neopets Usury Fiat money David Beckham
