do i have to pay for anything when signing up for paypal plus credit card i recently had to verify my paypal account but i had choices to do it add a bank account or sign up for paypal plus credit card for security reasons i just signed up for the credit card i don't plan to use the credit card or do anything in which i will have to pay a fee so my question is this even if i don't use the credit card will i still have to pay for anything according to the paypal website there are no annual fees for just having the card so if you never use it you won't have to pay anything note that if you do use it they can charge you a monthly fee of per every in average monthly debt plus interest fees according to their faqs at paypal com so you should be ok if you stash the card away and never use it good luck ed Phishing Mortgage PayPal Internet fraud Liberty Dollar Credit card fraud Skype E-gold Virgin Mobile Personal finance Student loan Social Security (United States) Electronic commerce Electronic money Micropayment Interest Debit card Xbox Live Money Citigroup Octopus card Automatic teller machine Neopets Bond Television licence Surveillance Taxation in the United States Short selling Donald Trump EFTPOS Credit score U.S. public debt Mutual fund Primerica Financial Services No Child Left Behind Act Bank fraud Password Economy of Russia Predatory lending Identity theft Euro Identity document London Congestion Charge E-ZPass The Amazing Race Plame affair National Insurance Hyperinflation Debt consolidation British national identity card Financial services MasterCard American Express Trust (Law) USA MMORPG Advance fee fraud Morgan Stanley United Kingdom corporation tax Gold standard Schabir Shaik Trial Monetary policy Ocean's Twelve Corporation Insurance GNU General Public License Law of value Health insurance Annuity Interac Israeli settlement FairTax SmartRider Refinancing Monopoly (game) MapleStory Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Legal tender Financial audit 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Smart card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Poker jargon H-1B visa Life insurance Government debt Bretton Woods system Debt Second Life Public-key cryptography Credit union Cable television Open access Derivative (finance) Social Security debate (United States) Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Fiat money Double-entry book-keeping Verizon Wireless
