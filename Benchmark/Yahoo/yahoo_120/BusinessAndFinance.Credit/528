will hubby's bad credit affect mine i just got married my credit is stellar my hubby's not so much my question is will the debts that he had before influence my credit score will the debts that he's incurred since we got married influence my credit score if he fails to make timely payments we don't have any joint credit cards or accounts we keep our money separate yes i know it's strange but it works for us i know that crediors can come after me for any debts he's gotten into since we've been married if he defaults on payments but i wonder if it's affecting my score in the mean time it shouldn't affect your credit score and depending on where you live they might or might not be able to come after you for debts he incurred since you've been married not having joint accounts sounds like a real good idea Student loan Credit score Government debt Credit card Debt Derivative (finance) Money Mortgage Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Bank fraud Gold standard Bond Bank Micropayment Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Corporate finance Social Credit Islamic banking Personal finance Developing countries' debt Microeconomics Economy of the United States December 2001 riots (Argentina) U.S. public debt Interest Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Commodity markets Credit card fraud Octopus card Mensal__o scandal Credit default swap Taxation in the United States Mortgage-backed security Divorce Schabir Shaik Trial Fiat money Social Security (United States) Credit history Economy of Russia DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Economy of Pakistan Financial capital Theory of conduct Capital accumulation Credit derivative Jack Lang (Australian politician) Financial services DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX 401(k) DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Finance Annuity Scrip Legal tender Copyleft Tax cut Tax History of the United States (1918-1945) Predatory lending Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 FairTax Insurance Marshall Plan Xbox Live Child support Mutual fund Law of value Dave Ramsey Arthur Laffer Reparations for slavery Securitization Password DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Sheepshead Estoppel Concurrent estate Debt consolidation Baccarat Credit risk Money supply Babylonian law Beatmania IIDX Deficit spending Opportunity cost Balance of payments Anarchist economics Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Divine grace Economy of Nigeria Great Depression Financial audit Social Security debate (United States) Electronic commerce Credit repair Short selling Cheque Internet fraud Assignment (law) Technocratic movement
