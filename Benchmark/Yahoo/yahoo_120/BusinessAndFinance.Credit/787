help i'm dealing w almost non exitant countrywide customer service re getting removal of report on credit my hubby is not good at small details and really screwed up bad i am left find out how fix this issue we own rental homes of the mortgages are thru c on only of the homes our impound account went up a mo due a large insurance increase we pay electronically from our bank every mo with this in place tim doesnt open monthly paper bill statements was not aware of the increase he had paid months of payments before cwl called us to say that they had been declining our original payment and that we are months past due in foreclosure my hubby paid total due within days i regret we didnt negotiate that any derogatory credit statements made would be removed from credit cwl didnt even let the ink dry on our check before they really dinged our credit keep in mind we were paying accts on time for years when we call them about it they have literally left us on hold for hours waiting speak the department rep still no answer while i appreciate your input it sounds as if you are questioning the facts to my question twisting my statement would not be to my advantage as i am on yahoo questions trying to get help from those who truly have insight to this issue if i was not at my writing limit i had planned on questioning their decision to return a sure thing payment they could have added the mi my additional escrow needed this you pay once a year to settle up any money your are over budget for in this day of so many foreclosures i think they would want anything they can get getting a house back is a time money loser for them not to mention we have another mortgage with them as for the couple counseling i have been onto him for years to always read financial statements promptly they are all sent to our po box in which he is in charge of you must pick your battles he is paying for his mistake by my bitching at him for this big mess plus the financial hard hit in your situation i would first tell you the fact the ach payments were being declined by cw in the first place is non sense they should by all means accept your ach payment your escrow account or impound account is only a part of your agreement with the bank for your leisure and their guarantee you will have your property insured and your taxes paid having that said it in no way is part of the binding loan agreement mortgage with the lender they can not require you escrow or impound your taxes or insurance therefore to reject your payment because it didn't include the increased escrow or impound amount is inevitably not within legal mortgage protocol i think the fact you so quickly paid the account to current only shows good faith on your part and should only aid in your bargaining with cwl with regards to having the erroneous reporting removed from your records lastly to get a hold of someone at cwl i would recommend either being a trooper and waiting it out on hold or contacting the attorney general in your state they would be able to guide you on how to contact cwl to resolve the problem as well as be able to file a formal complaint against cwl for public record if worse comes to worst call the main number and just keep pushing if you do that usually the automated system assumes you're either elderly or unable incapacitated and otherwise don't have the ability to dial the right numbers options this will in turn put you in the priority hold queue for a real person to speak with you about what you need make sure to document the time and date you called every time you speak with them how long the call lasted how much of the call you were on hold anything you were guaranteed or promised from the representative and lastly make sure to get their name and either their extension or operator employee number nothing worse than being promised something by an inept moron then have what was promised you not happen and then not be able to hold their feet to the fire for it good luck hope this helps Life insurance Bank Credit card Student loan Social Security (United States) United Kingdom corporation tax Call centre Taxation in the United States Great Depression
