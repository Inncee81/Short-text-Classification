repost collection agency withdrew money w o authorization can i get it back now that the debt is paid i'm reposting hopefully it will be less confusing i had a tuition debt go into collections i lost my job and moved to another state i had to keep my out of state bank account open so my previous employer could deposit my severance pay i agreed to pay month the agency debited the on the th of the month for months i received my severance pay in early march i asked the agency if i could make my march payment early and for them not to debit on the th as i'd be opening a new account in a local bank they agreed i was clear not to withdraw on the th they rec'd their payment on the th i opened my new account and transferred all but into it i left in it in case i needed until the funds cleared at my new bank they attempted to debit on the th th th of march i was hit with an insufficient funds fee at attempt when i questioned them about it they demanded the full amount i paid this debt in full could i get my back my bank wouldn't help me just gave a form to fill out ya know they agreed not to withdraw on that date they got that months payment they wouldn't accept anything but auto payments no checks money orders etc i still have the statement i want to call them everyday and give them the this is an attempt to collect a debt any information obtained will be used for that purpose line it's the principle of it after i paid the debt in full i sent a letter to the school which i originally got my degree from i explained the situation to them and they sided with me and removed all evidence of this debt from my credit report i just want revenge and badly i really don't care about the money it would be worth the entertainment okay this is a bit more clear as to what you did it will still come down to your word against theirs that you did not want to have the payment done on the th however you may have some circumstancial evidence that this is what they aggreed to if you have proof that the payment was made on the th you could make a case that they agreed that the payment on the th was the payment for the month and they were not going to debit on the th without knowing every little detail this would be a reasonable conclusion enough to win a case though you don't need to get a lawyer or anything the simplest thing would be to file a small claims case against them you can file it in the county you live in and not where they are located you can either go to your county courts web site or down to the court itself and they will be able to tell you how to file a case if you win you could also make any claims for punitive damages but since the listing is actually removed from your report the chances of getting any would be small for there is a chance they won't even show up and you would win by default Credit card Bank fraud Internet fraud Estoppel Student loan Bond Cheque Plame affair Debit card Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Money Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Debt Bank Article One of the United States Constitution Advance fee fraud EFTPOS Contract Appeal Child support Schabir Shaik Trial Legal tender Gold standard Surveillance Mortgage Mensal__o scandal Taxation in the United States SCO-Linux controversies Social Security (United States) Microeconomics Poker jargon Federal Reserve Mail fraud Medical malpractice Security (finance) Copyright Bretton Woods system Automated Clearing House Identity theft Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Hyperinflation Financial audit Open access Health insurance Derivative (finance) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Economy of Russia Karl Rove National Kidney Foundation Singapore Government debt FairTax Oil-for-Food Programme Scientific method Fractional-reserve banking Monetary policy Money supply Terri Schiavo Katelyn Faber Credit card fraud Password Trust (Law) USA Schapelle Corby Life insurance Credit repair Electronic money Canada Health Act Craps American individualist anarchism Graduate school Capital accumulation Interest Finance Probation officer CPU cache Lawyer Unemployment benefit Tom DeLay Israeli West Bank barrier James Hanratty Automatic teller machine Commodity markets Octopus card Secretar__a de Inteligencia Enron Corporation Intelligent design Economy of the United States Payroll Treaty
