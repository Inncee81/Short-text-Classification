bankruptcy how do they know if you take out rrsp's after bankruptcy when they are supposed to get the funds ok we went into bankruptcy and our rrsps were funds we could get anytime because of this they said if we withdraw them they are supposed to go to him now my question is this how do they know if we say take half out do they followup is there a message with our rrsps to notify him reason is i have some bills to pay and need to take some out please help please only if you absolutely know answer most of the time rrsps are treated like assets and are liquidated during a bankruptcy however there are some exceptions first if your rrsp is locked in due to previous employment the trustee is not permitted to take the rrsp an example of this would be an employee who works for a company with a pension plan when the employee leaves for retirement the accumulated pension entitlement is transformed into a locked in rrsp the term locked in means the employee cannot cash in the rrsp or take money out of it until he or she retires if the employee is unable to get the money usually a trustee would also be unable to get it confusion often results from the term locked in sometimes people make a payment to an rrsp at a bank and the funds inside the rrsp are a locked in investment a guaranteed investment certificate for instance it can be locked in for several years to allow the investor to develop a higher interest rate if you file for bankruptcy the trustee could cash in your five year accumulation to distribute to your creditors another type of rrsp that cannot be liquidated is an rrsp that has a life insurance component this exception can be complicated so it is wise to consult a bankruptcy trustee to discuss the matter bill c which was passed in november of proposed that most rrsps be exempt in a bankruptcy unfortunately the bill is still being written and has not yet been declared part of the law it is very important that you discuss rrsps with a licensed bankruptcy trustee before going ahead with bankruptcy it is essential that you get help in determining the current laws in halifax Annuity Life insurance Bond Social Security (United States) Mutual fund Insurance Debt Bankruptcy Bank Registered Retirement Savings Plan Article One of the United States Constitution Trust (Law) USA Pension 401(k) Mortgage Tax Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Security (finance) Economy of Russia United Kingdom corporation tax Deflation (economics) Enron Corporation SCO-Linux controversies Income trust Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fractional-reserve banking Interest Government debt Taxation in the United States Social Security debate (United States) Trusts and estates Microeconomics Individual Savings Account FairTax Trust (Law) non-USA Inflation Bankruptcy in the United States Variable universal life insurance Derivative (finance) Islamic banking Primerica Financial Services Dividend Surplus value Capital accumulation Appeal Hedge fund Institutional fund management PE ratio Economy of India Pretty Good Privacy Corporation Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Privatization Keynesian economics Ponzi scheme Retirement plan Citigroup Collateralized debt obligation Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Bretton Woods system Asset Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Lloyd's of London Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Bank fraud Electronic money Estoppel Stock Poker jargon Finance Microsoft Contract Open access Public domain Gold standard Classified information National Kidney Foundation Singapore Labor theory of value Monetary policy Investment Temasek Holdings Usury Treasury security Municipal bond Commodore International Euro Yield curve United Airlines Corporate personhood Student loan Money
