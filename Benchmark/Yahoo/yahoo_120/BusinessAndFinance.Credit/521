visa credit card classic this is my first time applying for a visa so i need some tips of how to use it carefully its a limit classic visa from cibc okay so my question is sure they gonna be chargin me dollar a mounth but heres what i dont understand lets said if i spend on my visa right will my bank charge me the exact amount of money that i spend from my limit classic visa which is o will my money drecrease or will it stay the same so i will have something like or will it stay the same because its only for me to spend less than no more than i can spend all i want and they will charge me like r or from my visa or will they charge me the exact amount that i spend from my visa this is really confusing for me because after all im just its my first visa so anyone out there please help me with a credit card where you have a limit if you charge the full one month but pay it entirely when you get the statement you will be able to charge up to next month and so on and so on if you charge more than the and it does happen pretty easily the credit card company will in addition to the minimum payment charge you an over the limit fee normally so your payment that month would be for example the over the limit fee for building your credit the important thing to do is don't over spend and pay the entire amount of your card off each month if you're not going to be able to don't buy whatever it is that you are about to buy if you have a pre paid credit card and you pre load or deposit and then use the card to buy worth of something you will then have to pre load or deposit more money to be able to use the card again for more information on student related cards see http www studentsandcredit com more student credit cards htm for more information on pre paid cards see http www how is your credit info pre paid htm Credit card Octopus card Visa (document) Debit card Student loan EFTPOS Bank Money Bank fraud The Amazing Race Advance fee fraud Credit card fraud Mutual fund Internet fraud Betting (poker) Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Life insurance Electronic money Graduate school Annuity Minimum wage Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Hyperinflation Poker jargon Scrip Mortgage Personal finance Bond Auto insurance Enron Corporation Smart card H-1B visa Donald Trump Insurance Taxation in the United States Surveillance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Citigroup Identity theft Gold standard Gross domestic product Certificate of deposit Debt Mail fraud Cruising (maritime) United States Postal Service Electronic commerce Automatic teller machine Oyster card Islamic banking Monetary policy Corporation Schabir Shaik Trial PE ratio MMORPG Health insurance Social Security (United States) Monopoly (game) Money supply Cheque Micropayment Tax Public transport Phishing Interest Short selling Liberty Dollar Legal tender Baccarat Virgin Mobile Domain Name System Estoppel Primerica Financial Services Driver's license Copyleft Social Credit Craps Credit history Campaign finance reform RuneScape quests Credit score Wheel of Fortune Neopets MasterCard Finance Financial services Gold as an investment Tom DeLay Marshall Plan HyperText Transfer Protocol Slot machine Keynesian economics Toronto-Dominion Bank Telephone booth
