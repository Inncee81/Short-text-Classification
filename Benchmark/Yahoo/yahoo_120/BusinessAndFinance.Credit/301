what are my options medical collections etc i have multiple medical collections about to be exact one civil judgement in relation to the medical issues and having been evicted see below and two other derogatory accounts one from a previous landlord when i was sick for days with a 'mystery virus' which is also the major reason behind these medical collections and one from tcf bank when i was much younger the total of these bills is approximately and i have some other medical bills that i have been paying since then about k i have a 'ok' amount of disposable income at the moment but have a child on the way what are your suggestions currently i am a consumer loan specialist so i understand the scenario which i am in but how do i dig myself out if noone wants to give me a personal loan any advice is welcome and needed as a note most of the collection agencies want payment in full for example the collection agency that is coming after me for the amount on the eviction wants to collect they will settle for but only if i pay every two weeks this is definately out of my range i could theoretically afford month but a month is pretty hefty in my opinion settle with your creditors pay it off for less than you owe most of them will settle for about if you argue right and its no worse for your credit that the collections that are on there in response credit collection agencies buy your debt for pennies on the dollar of course they want it paid in full they will normally try to bully or scare you into payment if you will just play nice but be stern that you cant afford anything else they will play ball i have dont this for myself before you want paid and i want done with this right great i can afford 'x' if you will settle today if they say i just cant do that play the game twist their words cant or wont or try well can i speak with someone who can you get the point you have to be as aggressive as they are about it Credit card Bond Student loan Great Depression Mortgage Deflation (economics) Insurance Annuity Legal tender Estoppel Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Taxation in the United States Government debt Microeconomics Money Credit score Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Bretton Woods system Security (finance) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of the United States History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of Russia Life insurance Gold standard Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Debt Monetary policy Child support Interest Bank Stock Health insurance 401(k) Social Security (United States) Pound sterling Cheque Debt levels and flows Hyperinflation Capital accumulation Money supply Credit repair Unemployment benefit Social Credit Wheel of Fortune United States dollar Poker jargon Anarcho-capitalism Euro Publicly funded medicine Developing countries' debt Leasehold estate Baccarat National Kidney Foundation Singapore Schabir Shaik Trial Surveillance Mensal__o scandal Predatory lending Bolivia Public transport Margin (finance) Credit derivative Personal finance Article One of the United States Constitution Unemployment Volleyball Weimar Republic Prisoner's dilemma Derivative (finance) Islamic banking Rick Santorum Microcredit Primerica Financial Services U.S. public debt Reparations for slavery Contract Jack Lang (Australian politician) Inflation Anarchism and capitalism Same-sex marriage RuneScape quests Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Golf Jack Thompson History of the United States Constitution Internet fraud Appeal Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Economy of Argentina Keynesian economics Nuclear power phase-out Citigroup Supply and demand Flat tax
