how long does debt stay on a credit report i am helping my best friend clear up her finances and she has many many old collection notices on her credit report that are helping to drag her rating down they are probably years old do these ever fall off or get written off it seems like they just keep transferring them to other agencies she also has a household bank credit card in collections should this be paid first or the old debt she tried to make arrangements with the collection agency for household but they wanted much more a month than she could give them and they refused to make arrangements so right now they are getting nothing help i am not sure where to start negative items remain on your credit report for years from the date of the negative item so if the account was charged off it will remain on the report for years from the date of the last delinquency missed payment it does not mean the debt goes away it just means that the creditors can no longer report it to the credit reporting agencies transunion experian equifax creditors and collection agencies can not re age a debt so it does not matter how many times they transfer it the date that matters is the original delinquency date if she has debts that are more than years she needs to send a dispute to the cra's to have it removed now there is another item called the legal statute of limitations this is a point after which they can no longer force you to pay by filing a suit against you this is usually years depending on the state you live in so if she has them in the year range there is a good chance they are outside of the sol and can not take any legal actions the link below gives you a break down by state if she does want to pay them off only communicate through the mail never negociate over the phone have her send her offer with what she can pay each month also include that once she pays it off that they remove the collection account do not send any money to them until they have an agreement in writting from them that they approve Bond Credit card Credit score United States Postal Service Mortgage Annuity Debt Credit repair Student loan Taxation in the United States Legal tender Article One of the United States Constitution Bankruptcy Deflation (economics) Security (finance) TransUnion United Kingdom corporation tax Estoppel Islamic banking Social Security (United States) Surveillance Euro Appeal Money Poker jargon Contract Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Interest Insurance Bank Debt consolidation Tom DeLay Derivative (finance) Schabir Shaik Trial Child support Trust (Law) USA Government debt Internet fraud Microeconomics Identity theft Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Economy of the United States Cheque Financial audit Octopus card FairTax Advance fee fraud Debt levels and flows Mail fraud Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Divorce Gold standard Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Fractional-reserve banking Economy of Russia Bankruptcy in the United States Public transport Virgin Mobile Gambling Primerica Financial Services Commodity markets Drug test FidoNet Tax Tax protester Experian Data retention Fiat money United States Department of the Treasury Credit derivative Developing countries' debt Capital accumulation Financial services Gross domestic product Life insurance Mail History of the Jews in England Copyright Mensal__o scandal Short selling Toll road Cyprus dispute Social Credit Government of Maryland Stock Federal Reserve Personal finance International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Money supply Economy of Romania
