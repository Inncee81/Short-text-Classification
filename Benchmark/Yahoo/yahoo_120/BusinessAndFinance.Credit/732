help my best friend is in big financial trouble her and her husband got into debt for thousand dollars in different credit cards and they can not pay them any more because they have a house payment of a month they recently bought it and can not refinance nor sell it she said she wanst to die even though their credit is good but they can not go on without any money left for food or for their children i'm sorry i can not help her with any money because i don't have any property does any of you know how to help her or does anyone knows where can she get a loan this big to have just one monthly payment so they can go on i have seen her so desperate that i feel so bad not been able to help her thanks for your serious answers no jokes please it's clear that if they are at the point where they have no food they must take drastic action at once to offer specific advice would require knowing more about their situation for example if their annual income is then they can recover with a little time but if their annual income is then they need to consider bankruptcy between the credit cards and the house payment they are probably looking at payments of around a year whether they can avoid bankruptcy is going to depend on their income and other assets if they have no k or retirement savings or other assets they can sell to use towards the credit card bills and there is no possible way they can make the payments today on their current income then another loan is not going to solve their problem i can understand why they would want another loan but it is not going to help i suggest they contact a bankruptcy lawyer to fully evaluate their situation it might be the best thing for them but no one can say for sure without knowing more details Credit card Personal finance Student loan Mortgage Money Bank Monetary policy Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Deflation (economics) Social Security (United States) Economy of Russia Government debt Donald Trump Life insurance Interest Microeconomics Debt Taxation in the United States Primerica Financial Services Credit score Annuity Capital accumulation Enron Corporation Gold standard Bank fraud 401(k) Marshall Plan Insurance FairTax Economy of India Tax Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Debt consolidation Security (finance) Divorce Social Security debate (United States) Surplus value Mutual fund Hyperinflation Mortgage-backed security Octopus card Financial services History of the United States (1918-1945) Bankruptcy Gross domestic product Credit derivative Micropayment Islamic banking Economy of the United States Asian financial crisis Predatory lending Dividend Citigroup Small business Money supply Mensal__o scandal Commodity markets Refinancing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Africa Economy of Chile Economy of Pakistan PE ratio 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Cheque Derivative (finance) Capitalism Productive and unproductive labour Collateralized debt obligation Securitization Schabir Shaik Trial Great Depression The Amazing Race Warren Buffett Common Agricultural Policy Theory of conduct Temasek Holdings Advance fee fraud Freeters Income trust Anarchist economics Legal tender Real estate bubble Copyleft Health insurance Yield curve Mergers and acquisitions Microcredit Annual percentage rate
