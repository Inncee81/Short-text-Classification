when i can back to normal credit i got bankruptcy last month can anyone tell me when i can back to normal life i mean eg when i can mortgage loan credit card it's seven years before the bankruptcy is off your credit report until then you may have trouble getting a loan and or mortgage there are credit cards you can get but most will require you to deposit a sum of money against which you can borrow if you make on time payments they will eventually let you have credit without the deposit you may also be able to get a high interest loan or even a mortgage but they will want a cosignor with sterling credit and the interest rates will be way more than you usually would pay the key to getting your credit back is to be sure and make on time payments on everything and keep very low if any balances on credit cards you may be able to get if you do this for a year or so your credit will improve and you will be able to get better terms on cards and be eligible for a decent loan but its going to take a while and very careful spending good luck Student loan Bank Credit card Interest Bond Debt Money Deflation (economics) Mortgage-backed security Personal finance Credit score Savings and loan association Money supply Islamic banking Debt consolidation Collateralized mortgage obligation Life insurance Refinancing Government National Mortgage Association Gold standard Bretton Woods system Predatory lending Economy of Russia Financial markets Insurance Savings and Loan crisis Economy of India Credit history Social Security (United States) Government debt Bank fraud Interest rate Annuity 401(k) Derivative (finance) History of the United States (1918-1945) Citigroup Annual percentage rate Credit union Finance Betting (poker) Real estate bubble Food Stamp Program Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Federal National Mortgage Association Taxation in the United States Municipal bond Euro Short selling Economy of the United States Money creation Marshall Plan Fractional-reserve banking Great Depression Subsidy Futures contract Central bank Wells Fargo Poker jargon Small business Hyperinflation Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Microcredit Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code United Kingdom corporation tax Charles Ponzi Cheque Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Certificate of deposit Leasing Social Security debate (United States) Debt levels and flows Consumer finance Corporate finance Article One of the United States Constitution Mutual fund Usury Social Credit Donald Trump Collateralized debt obligation Capital accumulation Money market Islamic economics Octopus card Fiat money Keynesian economics Federal Reserve Gross domestic product
