problems with prepaid card ok i have a card through netspend it's convient for me and days ago i have paid my obgyn bill on it but the medical biller ran the wrong amount through so she cancelled the transaction and put a credit through and ran the correct amount through the correct amount was taken and my credit has not posted yet it is still pending i called netspend times and each time i have been told something different they are very unprofessional and i asked to speak with a supervisor and i was on hold for mins and one supervisor told me to have the medical biller send a fax stating why i need my money back the date etc she did this twice and they still are saying that its the correct way to do things what can i do legally to get my i am so frustrated probably you'll just have to be patient as many pre paid cards use outside contractors for processing sometimes it can take up to days for a refund if worse comes to worse you can sue in small claims court or go through binding arbritration if they have that clause in your contract you'll also want to look at the contract for things like under the laws of certain state because then you have to sue in small claims court or equivalent in certain state Contract United States Postal Service Credit card Schabir Shaik Trial Article One of the United States Constitution Appeal Internet fraud Insurance Surveillance Poker jargon Public domain National Kidney Foundation Singapore Mail Bush v.
