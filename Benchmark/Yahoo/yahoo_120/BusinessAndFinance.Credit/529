will hubby's bad credit affect mine i just got married my credit is stellar my hubby's not so much my question is will the debts that he had before influence my credit score will the debts that he's incurred since we got married influence my credit score if he fails to make timely payments we don't have any joint credit cards or accounts we keep our money separate yes i know it's strange but it works for us i know that crediors can come after me for any debts he's gotten into since we've been married if he defaults on payments but i wonder if it's affecting my score in the mean time we live in texas yikes does that change anything his credit will not directly affect you in any way we all have one credit score and it is attached to our ssn so your info does not merge with his unless you live in one of the following states they cannot come after you for anything other than his medical bills that your name is not on arizona california idaho louisiana nevada new mexico texas wisconsin washington these states are community property states and in those states they can come after you for any debt in his name even if your name is not on that debt still until it is reported to your credit report it will nto affect your credit score it does affect you in other ways indirectly because he has bad credit and you good does he expect you to provide him with credit cards if he defaults on those cards it would affect you negativly not saying he does or would just considerations to make when it comes time to buy a house or a car if his name is on it with a bad credit score he would probably need you to cosign this in and of itself would not bring down your credit score but the more items you have in your name the more your debt to income ratio is affected and that inturn would affect your credit worthieness so you need to watch that kind of thing the biggie will be when you are ready to buy a house if his credit is poor it could affect your interest rate especially if you need him on the mortgage to buy the house ie because of dti Debt Mortgage Credit score Student loan Credit card Bond Monetary policy Derivative (finance) Deflation (economics) Bank Citigroup FairTax Personal finance Insurance Taxation in the United States Interest Predatory lending U.S. public debt Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Mortgage-backed security Debt consolidation Financial services Bank of America Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Annuity Estoppel Donald Trump Internet fraud Arbitrage Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Primerica Financial Services Commodity markets Capital accumulation State university Gold standard Poker jargon Social Security (United States) Mergers and acquisitions Allodial title Western United States Child support Divorce Schabir Shaik Trial James K.
