a couple owes me twelve thousand dollars could an individual sue to garnish their wages or only companies can i lend thousand dlls to a couple six months ago with the purpose of catching up on their mortgage payments i made them sign a notarized letter of repayment and havent seen one cent yet can i take them husband and wife to court and garnish their wages since they're both working and looks like thats the only way to get them to pay me anything or did i just lost thousand dollars than you for your help yes you can but it won't be easy first you have to sue them since this is k you probably don't want to use small claims court if your state allows small claims for k that's your best bet but they probably don't so you have to go to 'real' court you may want to consider getting a lawyer to represent you it may seem that you have an open and shut case but if they get a lawyer it's surprising how much crap they can pull once you go to court and win you get a judgement then you have to enforce the judgement the other party may try to declare bankruptcy in which case you are screwed if they don't you can bring them back to court to garnish their wagers or force them to sell assets adam Bond Divorce Bankruptcy Taxation in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mortgage Insurance Deflation (economics) Concurrent estate Appeal Child support Poker jargon Article One of the United States Constitution Donald Trump Lawsuit Enron Corporation FairTax Schabir Shaik Trial Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam Lawyer Bank Leasing The Source (magazine) Blackjack Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy U.S. public debt United Kingdom corporation tax SCO-Linux controversies Gambling Derivative (finance) Monetary policy Judiciary of Hong Kong Islamic banking Bankruptcy in the United States Supreme Court of the United States Economy of the United States Tax protester Estoppel Intellectual property Scientology controversy Democratic Party (United States) Scientology Money Attorney at Law Plame affair Credit card Fair Game (Scientology) Article Three of the United States Constitution Economy of Russia Security (finance) Bretton Woods system United States Constitution Timeline of the Enron scandal Mensal__o scandal Mortgage-backed security Betting (poker) Trust (Law) USA 613 mitzvot Gold standard Government debt Minimum wage Microeconomics 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Unlawful combatant Karl Rove Microsoft Fred Phelps 50 Cent McLibel case Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code Surplus value Wal-Mart First-sale doctrine Hyperinflation Dred Scott v.
