who would like to share their tax credit nightmares with me they have just overpaid me by many many pounds i know that in a few weeks time they will demand it back i have phoned them and they assure me it is a 'one off payment' for special circumstances in this case my daugters birthday being noted wrongly at their end its a complete nightmare and really really needs looking into once and for all yes i've transferred it into my savings in order to do that but it just seems like they are teasing me with it i could really do with some extra and not for niceties but to move house etc so its hard to see it sitting there when things are so tight yes this has happened to me before and i did keep hold of it then let them take it back montly just to be awkward lol they insist they cannot provide written evidence of what they have told me as far as the reasons etc altho the calls are recorded think i will ask for a recording this is happening to so many people it should really be looked into but with it being a government agency i doubt that will ever happen and would they admit wrong doing me thinks not even when they are taking it back they wont take a lum sum you will have to pay in in stallments so i would advise to spend it because it happened to me and i was giving it back and they wouldnt accept the full amount i asked for phone calls that they had recorded and they said they coudnt find them Plame affair Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Time Out of Mind Life insurance Annuity Money She Loves You Bond James Hanratty CPU cache Gross domestic product United Kingdom corporation tax The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Public transport I Want to Hold Your Hand Bretton Woods system Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Poker jargon Gold standard Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Surveillance Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Blood on the Tracks Avenue Q Estoppel Microeconomics Schabir Shaik Trial Debt Mortgage Keynesian economics Deflation (economics) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Shaggy dog story Economy of Russia Plame affair timeline John Kerr FairTax The Family from One End Street Contract IBM PC compatible Pitaten United Airlines Flight 93 Arthur Laffer The Inside Mojave people Hyperinflation Social Security (United States) Theory of conduct Roswell UFO incident Graduate school Tom DeLay Student loan Bank fraud Alcoholics Anonymous Virtual Realm National Insurance Ocean's Twelve Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Government of Maryland Friends The Contender (television series) Jizya Article One of the United States Constitution Pump It Up Taxation in the United States Fathers' rights The Death Gate Cycle Extras (sitcom) What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
