how can one get items removed from the major credit agencies that are false entries i have written them wit i have supplied them with the documentation and they still will not remove it help if you have disputed the item and the credit bureau is still reporting it it is either because they did not recognize your letter as a dispute or because the creditor reported that the information was accurate when you disputed the item you should have received an acknowledgement of the dispute and then a resolution to your dispute if you did not receive these items then the credit bureau didn't recognize your letter as a dispute so start the dispute process over following the directions for a written dispute like address to write to etc given on the credit bureau's website send the letter 'return receipt requested' so you have proof that the credit bureau received the dispute if you did get an acknowledgement and a resolution what does the resolution say it probably says that the creditor confirmed that the information is correct in that case you will need to work with the creditor to remove the information as the credit bureaus will not remove information if the creditors say it is accurate good luck Credit repair Plame affair United States Postal Service Cyprus dispute Probation officer The writing of Principia Mathematica Downing Street memo Social Security (United States) Bond Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act SCO-Linux controversies Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda RFID Financial audit Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Surveillance Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Filioque clause Accounting methods Article One of the United States Constitution Identity theft UN Security Council Resolution 242 Corporate governance President of Ireland Babylonian law Joseph C.
