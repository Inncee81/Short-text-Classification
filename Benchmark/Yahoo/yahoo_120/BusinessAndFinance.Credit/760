my son is getting turned down for a loan due to my bad credit rating how can i correct this i want my son to have a good credit rating in his own right for a start hun it may not be you that is giving your son a bad credit rating get a copy of his report from equifax creditexpert com have a free day trial online at the mo and have a look and see what is on there what companies don't tell you is if you make more than credit applications every months that automatically gives you a bad credit rating so if you son has applied for loans and say credit card the next time he applies he will automatically get turned down through this reason alone if this doesn't apply to him and the credit report shows no late payments on anything trying not to be patronising here so forgive me a little green circle is a payment made on time a yellow a late one and red means no payment made then what you can do is to have him dissassociated from your house but before you do that you have to look at his credit report and how old is your son bear in mind if he's only there's a highly likely chance that he won't get credit automatically because no credit is worse than bad credit if you've gone through every possibility and you're absoloutely sure that it is because of you than you can either contact your or your son's bank manager or give equifax themselves a call and they'll tell you how to go about disassociating him from you but that is obviously a last step good luck xx Credit score Student loan Credit card Bank Mortgage Credit history Bond Bank fraud United Kingdom corporation tax Octopus card Internet fraud Deflation (economics) Social rule Credit repair Credit rating agency Citigroup Blackjack Debt Annuity Theory of conduct Bretton Woods system Primerica Financial Services Keynesian economics Interest Auto insurance TransUnion Financial services Identity theft Micropayment Islamic banking The Amazing Race Poker jargon Skype David Beckham Credit card fraud Monetary policy Life insurance Government debt Draw poker Sheepshead United States Postal Service Corporate finance Snooker Backgammon Certificate of deposit Microcredit Copyleft Economy of El Salvador Galactic Civilizations Mergers and acquisitions Hyperinflation Wheel of Fortune Gold standard Government National Mortgage Association Refinancing Social Credit Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Tour de France FairTax Insurance Virgin Mobile Wachovia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Finance Windows XP Digital rights management Prisoner's dilemma Monopoly (game) Call centre Payday loan A Course In Miracles Craps Business performance management ELO rating system Health insurance Experian Credit default swap 401(k) Deficit spending Cheating in poker Pump It Up Lottery Derivative (finance) New York Knicks Knife Corporation Electronic money Collateralized debt obligation Beatmania IIDX Appeal Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
