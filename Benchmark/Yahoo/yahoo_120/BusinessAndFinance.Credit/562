bad credit affecting job search i understand why an employer would be leery of hiring someone who is behind in their bills shows irresponsibiltiy and the fact that the person may steal or whatnot but is it the end all to jobs i am a few months behind on my credit card bills and have some payday loans that are unpaid and i am having a very hard time finding a job i have a ba and am having difficulty getting a job at any place i recently applied to a store that i worked at for five years prior and did not receive a call back also would it be good to mention it in an interview be like i know my credit isn't the best right now but that is one of the reasons i am in search of a new job one that pays more money maybe not worded like that but you get the idea thank you i wouldn't bring any attention to your credit score if people aren't hiring you based on your credit score they need to notify you in writing that that is the reason why you were not hired again i wouldn't bring it up in any interviews but that is your own prerogative the job market is not the greatest right now and if you keep looking you will find the right job now if you are trying to be financial adviser or work at a bank or something i can see why they might not hire you but again they should provide you some notice about the credit report being used as part of their decision it is the law Unemployment Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Plame affair Credit card Student loan Bond Credit score Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Monetary policy Theory of conduct United Kingdom corporation tax Insurance Predatory lending Deflation (economics) Internet fraud Appeal Social Credit Royal Assent Cross site scripting Karl Rove Outsourcing Say's law Mortgage Bank Evan Mecham Bank fraud Labor theory of value Corporate governance Supply and demand Money supply Payday loan Graduate school Identity theft Minimum wage Anarchism and capitalism Unemployment benefit Interest Compensation of employees Affirmative action Life insurance Economy of Russia Finance Citigroup Wal-Mart Usury Steve Jobs Inflation Gold standard Babe Ruth Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Whose Line Is It Anyway?
