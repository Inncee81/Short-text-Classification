first time credit card i just recently got a credit card and i'm wondering if having the apr that i do have is because this is my first credit card i'm a student with no credit anyway i know this is a ridiculously high apr but will i still be able to build credit as long as i pay off the bill each month last question someone told me that one way to build credit faster is to pay the minimum for one month and then pay the rest the next month is that true while availing a credit card it is necessary to check the credit card rate this rate plays an inevitable part as based on this rate your payment amount is decided various credit cards are available with different rate every time consumers try to choose a credit card at a lower interest rare most of the time it is seen that while choosing a credit card people generally check whether the rate is low or not but a low rate cannot be the only consideration in availing a credit card besides rate a consumer should heed in other factors as well remember though various credit card companies entice consumers with low interest rates at the same time they include various hidden costs and charges with a credit card as well so do not only verify the interest rate but also consider other things while availing a credit card many a time credit card companies offer low rate for a specific period of time such low rates are considered as an introductory offer of various companies in such cases check how long the offer will last after the period is over verify what the interest rate will be whether it will be affordable for you or not etc in case of rare use a consumer should try to get the card where no annual or monthly fee is charged in such cases if the interest rate is a bit high still the option will be beneficial read more from http www credit card gallery com article credit card rate better opportunity at the best rates Student loan Blackjack Publicly funded medicine Insurance Life insurance Microeconomics Bank Mortgage Predatory lending Minimum wage Auto insurance Taxation in the United States Capitalism Credit history Interest Food and Drug Administration Mutual fund Deflation (economics) Internet fraud FairTax Broadband Internet access Annuity Monetary policy Octopus card United Kingdom corporation tax Public-key cryptography Food Stamp Program Certificate of deposit Credit card fraud Refinancing Bond Primerica Financial Services Annual percentage rate Unemployment Citigroup CPU cache Economy of Russia Redundant array of independent disks Debt Debit card America Online Microcredit Futures contract British national identity card The Amazing Race Wind power Verizon Wireless Price discrimination Apple Computer Education in the United States Virgin Mobile Poker jargon Public transport Betting (poker) Supply and demand Bank fraud Phishing Euro Education in Germany Gross domestic product Payday loan Secure Digital card Micropayment Debt consolidation Compact disc Flat tax Digital audio broadcasting Welding Cheque Baccarat Financial services Biodiesel Surveillance Corporate finance Hearts (game) Inflation Tax Illegal drug trade Graduate school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Electricity meter 401(k) Open access Short selling Yield curve United States Postal Service Wal-Mart Social Security (United States) Economic inequality ATI Technologies Identity theft Digital photography Health insurance Draw poker
