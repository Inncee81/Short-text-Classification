i have heard that you can call a credit card company and request a cheaper interest rate is this true i did it i went from my first card to i called and said that i wanted to talk to someone about my interest rate when i told them i wanted a lower rate they said no then i told them that i was getting offers of lower rate by other companies and i hated to switch but would if they could not lower my rate i told them i would simply transfer the balance to a different company it worked but it only works if you have a good history with them and you don't have more than or so of the limit used good luck it doesnt hurt to try sometimes if the first person doesn't do it you can call another day and get someone else who might Credit card Bank Citigroup Interest Mortgage Bluetooth Credit score Plame affair Good Times Octopus card Auto insurance Social rule Floppy disk Euro Redundant array of independent disks Ocean's Twelve Debt consolidation Refinancing FairTax Security (finance) Good Morning, Vietnam Deflation (economics) Credit history Insurance Student loan The Amazing Race Keynesian economics Deficit spending Alignment (role-playing games) Capitalism Arbitrage Saints and Soldiers 401(k) Say's law Wal-Mart Bond Ann Coulter Bank fraud James T.
