credit report question there are different companies showing up on my credit report for the same debt i disputed it with each of the report bureaus but they all came back said that the debt was verified should it be on there twice i want to pay it off but i don't know who to pay it's for an old utility bill and neither of them are the original debtor when you disputed the entries did you point out that it was a duplicate collection agencies are not allowed to re age a debt contact the newer of the two listings and ask them to mail you verification of the debt you can negotiate a settlement but make sure to get it in writing before you pay you can ask that they remove the negative completely but they may not agree a paid negative is always better Debt Credit card Article One of the United States Constitution Credit score Credit repair Mortgage Estoppel Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Debt consolidation Bond Money Deflation (economics) Debt levels and flows Evan Mecham Social Security (United States) Surveillance Mail High-yield debt Corporate finance Security (finance) History of the United States (1789-1849) Mergers and acquisitions Backup Child support IP (complexity) Derivative (finance) Paul Martin Plame affair Government debt Phishing Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Public-key cryptography Live 8 Financial audit GSM services E-mail spam Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Government bond Advance fee fraud Trade union U.S. public debt Evan Montvel Cohen Probation officer Finance Stopping e-mail abuse Islamic banking Nuclear proliferation United States Department of the Treasury Bankruptcy Commodity markets Drug test Student loan Internet fraud Microeconomics Debt bondage Falsifiability Temasek Holdings 1995 Quebec referendum FairTax Primerica Financial Services Florida Central Voter File Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Animal Crossing 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Karl Rove Taxation in the United States Israeli settlement Brady Bonds Craps Bretton Woods system Tom DeLay 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Hyperinflation Shays Rebellion Bankruptcy in the United States Inflation On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences United Airlines United Kingdom corporation tax April 2005 in Canada Marshall Plan Robert Walpole Winter of Discontent Credit default swap Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Barbara Boxer Poison pill 2004 U.S. election voting controversies Identity theft Tertiary education fees in Australia Food and Drug Administration Contract Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Externality Neville Chamberlain Anarcho-capitalism Corporation Cyprus dispute 2004-05 NHL lockout Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy
