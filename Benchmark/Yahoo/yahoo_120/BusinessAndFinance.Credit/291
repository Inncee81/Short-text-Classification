what is the best and fastest way to build my credit score i have good credit but not much of it and i want excellent credit everybody's talking about what to do to build up the score but i think that it would help even more if you knew what actually made up your score to give you a better idea payment history total debt vs available credit length of time establishing credit average age of accounts types of accounts established inquiries new accounts with all that said now what you can do is this review all your credit reports and dispute anything that you know's not correct with the credit bureaus incorrect information someway somehow winds up on reports bringing down scores if you have any accounts in collections make arrangements to get them taken care of here's a link that i posted to a website that explains in detail on how to setlle debt with collectors read the entire article closely there are parts to it and whatever open accounts that you do have make sure that you pay on time if don't have one already open a checking account and take advantage of their online banking with billpay feature like i mentioned earler payment history counts more than a of your score so pay on time if you have credit cards try to pay the balances on them to where they're around or below the available credit at any given time having cards that are maxed or close to it hurts your score also after you've cleaned up delinquencies and paid down your balances ask for an increase to give more cushion to your available credit if you have old accounts that you're not using start using them instead of closing them the longer you've had an account the better since this would be considered a seasoned account especially if it's been opened longer than years start cancelling accounts and it will give the appearance that you've established credit more recently than it actually has don't apply for unecessary credit each time you apply it creates a hard inquiry that can drop your score several points regardless if you're approved or not and it can take anywhere from months to a year for your score to increase if you are approved once the new account starts reporting if you don't have any open credit lines and you're needing to establish credit the easiest option would be opening a secured credit card which are offered at a lot of credit unions and at some banks you can think of ths as building credit with a savings account because that's basically how it works a deposit is placed upfront usually linked to a savings account that's used as collateral to establish a credit line of the same amount for example you place a deposit of then the credit line would be you still would receive a statement and have to pay for whatever's used on the card since the deposit is only for collateral while placing a deposit may seem like a disadvantage there's more hidden advantages like the deposit gaining interest while you're building credit and the ability to increase the credit line by adding to the deposit and a tip to using the card is to make small purchases month that can be paid off every month to keep the balance on the card in check usuall anwhere after a year or so of paying on time and keeping the balance low or even at the card either converts to a regular card or a better card is offered and best of all you get the deposit back with some added interest i posted links to several secured credit card companies you should have anywhere from major credit cards and department store card to start out with of course you can get more but it's not wise to load up on credit cards alone student loans furniture loans appliance loans car loans boat loans motorcycle loans and mortgages all are example of installment credit and it helps to have of those to create a balanced mixture of credit i know that it's a lot of information but i'm confident that it will help you out a lot Mortgage Student loan Bond Bank Annuity Surveillance Credit score Money supply
