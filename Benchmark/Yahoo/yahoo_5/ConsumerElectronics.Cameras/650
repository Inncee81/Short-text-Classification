which camera is better sd sd sd i am not a professional photographer just looking for a good camera to use at events or family things in that group rule out the sd because it doesn't have an optical viewfinder and it's almost too small to use the sd is easily beats it in its own class between the others you are looking at a critical analysis of the image quality on one level the larger sensor in the sd gives it a better image and this is the camera that i chose for myself i have some slr's to use when i get serious though on another level the image stabilization of the sd is makes a real difference in fact if its predecessor sd is had been available when i was shopping for a camera i was going to buy that and not the sd the sd is gives a little but more telephoto reach also for your purposes the sd is is probably the best choice examined under a microscope the sd images may give more detail and allow for bigger enlargements but examined at arm's length on a normal print this advantage goes away you gain the advantage if image stabliization and that's where i think you should put your money you are going to get mostly x or x prints and they will be excellent even a full frame x will be quite good if i was buying today i'd get the sd is i can talk out of both sides of my mouth with this example but today i'll see it from your point of view see http www flickr com photos samfeinstein as you view it in the first size on the screen you don't see a whole lot of difference do you the sd is is very similar to the sd is click all sizes on my screen it's about x when you do that that's bigger than any print you'd ever get from a shot like this but see how little difference there is even if you cropped a x out of the center to show the people on the dock either side would give you an acceptable print if you click on original though you will see the difference but cropping the center out of either one is not going to be the highest quality any more my point is for all but a x poster or similar magnification the image stabilization is more important than the pixel count or the sensor size for your purposes Digital single-lens reflex cameras Stereoscopy Leica Single-lens reflex camera Photographic lens Macro photography Photography View camera Parallax Digital camera back Digital camera Widescreen Konica Minolta Anamorphic widescreen Mouse (computing) Contax Medium format Movie projector Digital cinematography Panoramic photography Cinematography Canon EOS Telescope Aspect ratio (image) Pixel Zoom lens Geographic information system Panavision Opportunity rover Circle of confusion Binoculars Equine conformation Canon T90 Schneider Kreuznach Rangefinder camera Aberration in optical systems Motion capture PNG Gross domestic product Advanced Photo System Charge-coupled device Computer vision Image file formats Nikon Corporation Clementine mission Four Thirds System Microeconomics Autostereogram JPEG Cinerama MapleStory Betting (poker) Lens (optics) Deep Impact (space mission) Surveillance Microscope Reflecting telescope Eye STS-114 Photographic film Digital cinema Hubble Space Telescope Traditional animation Windows Vista Inflation Magnification Enlarger Economics Internet fraud Cascading Style Sheets MP3 Gramophone record Oscilloscope Machinima Cyberspace Mars Exploration Rover Nicomachean Ethics Canon EF lens mount Art Digital video Craps The nature of God in Western theology Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Supply-side economics Screenplay Photojournalism Color Ray tracing Ebook Laserdisc
