how do i get my photos out of burst mode once they've been taken sony dsc t have a bunch of photos from my sony cybershot dsc t camera that a family member took in burst mode the preview shows the group as one photo with photos x photos how to i break up the burst mode photo so i can get a print of one shot i'm pretty sure hubby put it in multi burst since there is like photos per image when i downloaded to my computer what a shame they're photos of the kiddos getting an award using burst mode means that the camera takes a number of separate shots in quick succession so you will not have just one photo but a number of photos that look almost identical you should be able to select whichever photo you wish to print have you tried uploading your photos to your pc but i see from the review below that your camera also has a multi burst mode which is what your photos might have been taken in using this mode will compile all the shots you take into a megapixel image this is not a large enough size to print a decent photo anyway here is a description of multi burst mode the multiburst mode lets you record up to sixteen frames at high speed the capture rate is selectable for fps fps or fps via the menu these images are merged into one finished image when the image is played in camera it is animated in sequence it is most useful in recording an athletic movement such as a golf swing or tennis stroke for later evaluation when reviewed in camera the images can be viewed frame by frame or as a continuous sequence so if you used multi burst mode then i think you will be out of luck and it will be difficult to seperate each shot don't forget these are only in a tiny resolution of x each but if you used burst mode then you can print whichever shot you want good luck Pixel Screenshot PlayStation Portable Frame rate Photography Digital cinematography Stereoscopy Digital cinema Digital camera Mouse (computing) First-person shooter Video Movie camera View camera Resident Evil (video game) Halo: Combat Evolved Resident Evil 4 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Windows Vista Quake III Arena Motion capture Tennis Movie projector Hot Shots Golf (series) Panoramic photography Camera Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March IPod Items in the Metroid series Universal Serial Bus Traditional animation Unreal Tournament 2004 Perl History of computer and video games Counter-Strike Pump It Up Fast bowling Galileo spacecraft Filmmaking Machinima Photographic film Leica High-definition television Cheating in Counter-Strike Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Golf Apollo 8 The Big Break GunZ The Duel Computer animation Secure Digital card Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Camcorder Tribes 2 Computer printer BZFlag Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME CPU design Game controller Digital video Konica Minolta Memory Stick Computer and video games Bullet time Table tennis Widescreen Doom 3 Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 MiniDisc Snooker Tungsten Handheld Photo sharing DV Bluetooth Compiler optimization Hubble Space Telescope Guilty Gear Cinematography Multiplayer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Bubble Bobble RISC Natural Selection (computer game) Anamorphic widescreen Golf club (equipment) R-Type JPEG Panavision Sound Blaster Technicolor Web page
