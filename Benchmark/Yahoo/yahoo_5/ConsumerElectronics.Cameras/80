is the canon sd is's time lapse mode any good is the canon sd is's time lapse mode any good i want to be able to record a still image as a separate file every once in a while seconds would be ideal i want to do it in a night shot mode especially like second exposure time a salesman told me the canon's time lapse mode only records to a movie file how well does it work is there a compact digital camera with a better time lapse mode it sure seems to be a rare feature the sd is is an excellent point shoot camera however it has very limited manual controls and it's time lapse mode is not really right for your needs here is an excerpt from canon the time lapse movie mode enables users to capture changing scenes such as drifting clouds or a bustling city street for accelerated playback as smooth vga quality movie clips captured at one second or two second intervals a scene of two hours duration can be condensed to a fluid eight minute or four minute movie file what you need is a camera with an intervalometer the ability to take a photo at set intervals canon has some older models that can do this the s is is one example but unfortunately it's update the s is does not have this feature though you should still be able to buy an s is from somewhere my husband has the s is and the intervalometer can be set to shoot images every to minutes and from to images can be shot the camera has full manual controls and you would need to use m manual mode or tv shutter priority to select your second exposure time it works well i have this feature on my old canon g the camera will take the first shot then power down till the next shot is due the lens will remain extended the whole time it's obviously best to have the camera powered by an ac adapter if you intend to take many shots this way good luck Camcorder Camera Leica Photography Movie projector Canon T90 PlayStation Portable Canon EOS Stereoscopy Konica Minolta Time-lapse View camera Single-lens reflex camera Digital cinematography Cinematography Compact disc Canon PowerShot G Canon EF lens mount Enlarger VHS ITunes Rangefinder camera Digital cinema Digital single-lens reflex cameras Floppy disk Binoculars ATI Technologies MP3 Shutter speed Canon T70 Bluetooth DVD Mouse (computing) Walkman Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Nikon FA Windows Vista Windows XP Gramophone record Film Domain Name System Motion capture Television Secure Digital card GunZ The Duel QuickTime Atari 8-bit family Amateur astronomy GunBound Mercury Atlas 6 Hard disk Bullet time Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Stage lighting Contax Point and shoot camera Quake III Arena Medium format Nikon FM2 Parallax Digital camera Metering mode Apollo 8 Pinhole camera Laserdisc IMAX BZFlag Street photography Nikon FE2 Macro photography Musical Instrument Digital Interface Manual transmission Galileo spacecraft Warez Machinima Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
