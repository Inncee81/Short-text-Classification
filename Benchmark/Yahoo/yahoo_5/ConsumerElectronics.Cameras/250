why do people have red eyes in flash photographs the light of the flash occurs too fast for the iris of the eye to close the pupil light is focused onto the blood rich retina at the back of the eye and the image of the illuminated retina is transmitted to the camera resulting in the red appearance of the eye on the photo this principle is used in fundoscopy an eye examination used to examine the retina by using an opthalmoscope wherein a positve ror or red reflex is a normal finding the effect is generally more pronounced in people with grey or blue eyes and in children this is because pale irises have less melanin in them and so allow more light to pass through to the retina children despite superficial appearances do not have larger pupils but their pupils are more reactive to light and are able to open to the fullest extent in low light conditions Eye Eye color Pupil Albinism Eye examination Color Diabetic retinopathy Retina Sun Stereoscopy Nuclear explosion Melanin Visual system Night vision Uvea Single-lens reflex camera Fluorescein angiography Digital photography Macular degeneration Explosive material Glaucoma Cat Autostereogram RGB color model Digital camera Light Retinal detachment Traffic light View camera Floater Heterochromia Eye contact Iridology Binocular vision Sensation Welding Gamut Tocopherol Flash (comics) Eyepiece Cat coat genetics Entoptic phenomenon Perspective projection distortion Criticality accident Photographic lens Aberration in optical systems Human skin color Hair color Hypoglycemia Depth of field Light-emitting diode Technicolor Philosophy of perception Glasses Photography Red eye (medicine) Myopia Lighting Cosmic Era human enhancements Compound eye Hypertensive retinopathy Telescope Saccade Macro photography Contax Camera Lightning Shark Parallax Red dot sight Evidence of evolution Laser Hypertension Binoculars Lens (optics) Cytomegalovirus Crocodilia Rainbow Chlorpromazine Color temperature Eyeglass prescription X-ray Konica Minolta Opportunity rover Intraocular lens Stage lighting Biometrics Persistence of vision Stroke Visual perception Monochromat Optic nerve Sleep Speed of light Aurora (astronomy) Cinematography
