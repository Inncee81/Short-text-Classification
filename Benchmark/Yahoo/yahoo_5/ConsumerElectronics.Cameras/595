sd cards for a digital camera hi i have a canon digital camera and i will be going on a trip to europe for weeks i am planning on taking a ton of pictures and i was wondering if anyone new any sd cards with really good memory my card can only hold around but i need a lot more plus im looking for a reliable card i heard online that someone took pics on a trip got home and all just dissapeared i can't have that happen know of anything thanks i bought an sd memory card from www tigerdirect com for my canon camera and it works just fine if you are going to take only still pictures then a or gigabyte memory card will let you store several hundred pictures but if you are going to record movies then perhaps you should get an gigabyte memory card perhaps that person who lost pictures from europe on his sd memory card didn't handle his memory card properly and accidently erased the pictures there even sd cards are vulnerable to static electricity and if you take out an sd card touch its electical contacts and there is a static electricity spark that goes from your fingers to the sd card then all information on that card may be erased to avoid such an accident you should avoid touching the electrical contacts on your sd memory card to find out what kind of an sd memory card you need for your camera you can search by the model number of your canon camera at this site http www ec kingston com ecom configurator new lines asp root linkback manufacturer can Secure Digital card Digital photography Hard disk Computer Surveillance Flash memory Windows Vista File Allocation Table Road-rule enforcement camera Digital Nintendo GameCube Central processing unit History of computing hardware Universal Serial Bus Stereoscopy CompactFlash Cross site scripting PHP CPU design USB flash drive Domain Name System XD-Picture Card Electronic commerce High-definition television IBM PC compatible Sony Nintendo 64 Enterprise content management Read-only memory Gmail Photography Contract bridge History of radio Smart card Windows 2000 DVD Xbox 360 Canon EOS Konica Minolta Floppy disk Pixel Bluetooth Camera Hewlett-Packard Memory (computers) Computer forensics Automatic number plate recognition Internet fraud Phishing IPod Non-volatile memory Sound Blaster Television Video game music Virtual memory Xbox Federal Standard 1037C Sega Saturn Password 64-bit Cessna T-37 Card game Ajax (programming) Patricia Ford Radio Gramophone record UNIVAC Apple II family Creative Zen 8 mm video format World Wide Web 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Gigabyte DV MRAM Website Memory Stick Electrostatics Web server Synthesizer Punch card Game controller IBM PC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Pinball Movie camera CPAN Atari 8-bit family Telephone exchange Automobile Schindler's List British national identity card TiVo Privacy Credit card Octopus card
