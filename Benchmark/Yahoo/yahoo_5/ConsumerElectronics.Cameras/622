d or rebel xti with extra lens which would be better the d or the rebel xti with the ef mm f macro usm lens there are a couple of other questions about whether canon or nikon is better so take a look up and down the list from your question for some discussion on that some people will like nikon me and some will like canon tom any right thinking person from either camp will also admit that either camera will give good results and you have to consider what you want out of a camera to make your decision here is my stock answer where i defend nikon's honor take from it what you will as both nikon and canon came out above the others in this market segment the february issue of popular photography has an article where they compared the top mp dslr's i took the scores and ranked the cameras similar to the way formula gives championship points i just gave for st place down to for last place splitting the difference when cameras tied in their catagories they evaluated image quality giving this twice as much weight as anything else ease of use control and system flexibility the final order and my scores are nikon d points best in image quality control and system flexibility canon rebel xti d points tied for best in system flexibility pentax k d points tied for best in ease of use samsung gx points tied for best in ease of use sony alpha points last in image quality ease of use and system flexibility then again this is the same magazine that put the sony alpha dead last in this comparison named it the camera of the year in the previous issue in a follow up to this seeming error pop photo published the explanation that only the d and the sony had been tested by the end of year deadline for choosing the camera of the year sony won on the strength of low price and built in image stabilization the other that beat sony in shoot out were not tested until after the camera of the year was selected because they were not yet available go to the original question and read the responses for more opinions http answers yahoo com question index ylt aig ehyd oq b x j jiulzy ix qid aahwjy if you want to get the best for the real world consider the nikon d or canon d if you can afford it for about less look at the results of the recent popphoto test and choose from that list according to your taste personally i use a nikon d and would recommend it without hesitation to someone who has some knowledge of photography for someone who wants the best but is starting with somewhat of an entry level knowledge base i'd suggest the nikon d there are people out there who will state their preference for the canon cameras and i will not argue with them the canon d and d are excellent cameras as well you would have to visit a camera store or camera department and pick them up and see what you think this article is available online at http www popphoto com cameras mp dslr shootout html here's another reference from outside the photographic press consumer reports compared the nikon d canon rebel xti and sony alpha personally i'd say that the nikon came out on top here also it beats the sony in noise free iso with an acceptable rating at iso kind of optimistic i think compared to the sony's iso it beats the canon in my opinion by having a spot meter that the canon does not offer http www consumerreports org cro electronics computers news electronics computers

a head to head to head digital camera review htm note the navigation menu near the top of the review the next thing to consider is what lens to start with and where you go from there if you are new to
