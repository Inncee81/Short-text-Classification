taking photos through the lcd of a digital slr camera hi there i have just pruchased a nikon d slr i have had a fujifilm for years and have just upgraded is it not possible to take photographs with the d through the lcd screen if you can how do you turn it on i know i'm probably being dense but i just assumed that it would work the same as non slr cameras i mainly use the viewfinder to take photos but i find the lcd useful when doing close up photography or using a tripod many thanks nathan no nearly all dslrs only show the image on the lcd after you've taken the photo no light is falling on the detector until the mirror flips up with you press the shutter just like an slr there are advantages and disadvantages to this type of operation you've found one of the disadvantages olympus makes dslrs that offer a real time lcd output you might want to look at them check out the e or e they really are excellent cameras Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital photography Konica Minolta View camera Canon T90 Stereoscopy Rangefinder camera Nikon Corporation Digital camera Photography Camera Contax Canon EOS Pentax Nikon FM2 Advanced Photo System Twin-lens reflex camera Nikon FE Liquid crystal display Nikon FM Nikon FE2 Canon EOS-300D Macro photography Digital camera back Olympus (company) Street photography Four Thirds System Television Shutter speed Full frame digital SLR Canon EOS-20Da Photographic film Medium format Eastman Kodak Gamut Panoramic photography Charge-coupled device Secure Digital card Point and shoot camera Road-rule enforcement camera Persistence of vision Binoculars XD-Picture Card Shutter (photography) Oscilloscope Photograph Nikon D70 Game Boy Cosina Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Floppy disk Game Boy Advance PlayStation Portable Danger Hiptop 135 film Closed-circuit television Photojournalism Color Organic light-emitting diode Telescope Cinematography Praktica Pinhole camera Raw image format Film Camcorder Ebook Parallax Bluetooth Instant camera Large format Windows XP Exposure (photography) Pixel Circle of confusion Light-emitting diode IMac Exakta Canon Inc.
