whats the best choice sony canon or panasonic i'm looking for an digital camara between and optical x zoom the pixels are also important i'll be here waiting for your advice it depends on what you're planning on doing with the camera if you're just looking for something to point and shoot on family vacations or the like then i'd say go with a midrange model sony they're pretty decent at that if you're looking for professional quality photos and are willing to put the time into learning what it takes to take them then nothing beats a canon you can check ebay and find a digital rebel for about what you're looking to spend and that's one of canon's better cameras Digital photography Camcorder Photography Canon EOS Digital cinema Charge-coupled device Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital camera Digital cinematography Camera DV High-definition television Zoom lens Konica Minolta Stereoscopy Videotape Canon Inc.
