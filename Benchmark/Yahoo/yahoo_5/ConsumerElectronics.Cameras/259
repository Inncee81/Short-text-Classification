what is the difference between a normal sd memory card and a ultra sd memory card i want to buy a new memory card for my camera kodak z i just use it to take pictures of my kids and family functions do i really need an ultra memory card or will a normal one do just fine i have a normal one now and it works just fine but i didnt know if i get a gb if it would change it can make a difference ultra ii have a faster write speed than a normal kingston why does this matter we are now at a point were most of our point and shoot cameras will out preform traditional sd cards you would notice a difference when using the burst mode or movie mode you may see a busy message on the camera the reason is that most new digital cameras can capture images faster than memory cards can save this is also why you will notice that the price of memory has came down so much because most cameras they will be slowed down the memory if you are a person who will never ever use a burst mode or movie mode there is no benefit otherwise it will give you longer movie recording and will keep up to burst mode of your camera Digital photography Digital camera Photography Panoramic photography IBM PC compatible View camera Cinematography Secure Digital card Overclocking Technicolor Hard disk CPU design Motion capture Computer Movie projector Digital single-lens reflex cameras Camcorder Sprite (computer graphics) Bluetooth 8 mm video format Stereoscopy Memory Stick 3dfx Dynamic random access memory Nintendo 64 Radeon RISC USB flash drive PlayStation 3 Panavision XD-Picture Card Digital cinema Atari 8-bit family Redundant array of independent disks PlayStation Portable Yu-Gi-Oh!
