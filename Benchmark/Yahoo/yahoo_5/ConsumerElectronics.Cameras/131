i read so many reviews from cnet about casio ex z they said the quality of picture is not good is it true yes it's true casio is into electronics and gadgets they're not into photography first of all i'd buy a camera from a camera maker not an electronics company you wouldn't go to a lumber yard to buy a tv so why go to an electronics supplier when you want a camera camera makers understand how photographers operate and they usually provide the tools you need not only to get outstanding pictures but also to set the camera quickly frankly casio sucks they're into electronics and gadgets not photography camera makers that are around include nikon canon pentax olympus and kodak these companies understand cameras and photographers kodak builds only simple cameras that have limited functionality and are priced low unfortunately they have been known to have reliability problems i've known many with a kodak digital and they all replaced them eventually if you look through all the questions here you'll also find more about inoperative kodaks than any other brand kodak is great if you want to spend as little money as possible and don't mind getting only a year of average pictures out of it their strengths are simplicity and low price olympus reliability isn't that good either and they use proprietary products so when you buy their memory cards you can't use those cards in any other camera except an olympus this is not usually a good situation to be in you may eventually want to replace it with another brand so you don't want to have to buy your memory cards all over again pentax builds a relatively good camera and offers the best bundled software available for handling your images pentax is someteims eliable and sometimes not but it's certainly better than olympus and kodak nikon and canon build the best point and shoot cameras and both use standard memory cards they're reliable and produce outstanding pictures i use a canon point shoot a powershot g which is an amazing camera that is highly reliable and incredibly well built in addition to being replete with features i also use a nikon d slr which is also an incredible camera you really can't go wrong with either of these brands i hope that helps a little Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photography Konica Minolta Nikon Corporation Eastman Kodak Leica Digital camera Pentax Canon EOS View camera Computer Nikon FA Camera Nikon FE2 Nikon FM2 Single-lens reflex camera Canon T90 Digital camera back Rangefinder camera Nikon FM Nikon FE Windows Vista Camcorder Full frame digital SLR Photographic film Canon Inc.
