got my disposable camera wet pix ok my mom told me it was waterproof but i dont think it was becasue when we took it to the beach today and got it wet it still took pictures but the flash didnt work and water was dripping out of it i really hope they come out because the pictures will be hilarious underwater disposables usually don't have a flash so i'm guessing that yours was not a waterproof camera if the camera got soaked then the film is wet as well no lab will run wet film because the emulsion will flake off in the processor and make a mess causing the lab to dump and remix chemistry an expensive and time consuming procedure be sure to mention when you take it in for processing that it may be wet inside Camera Photography Disposable camera Underwater photography Digital photography Technicolor Photographic film Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Plastic Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind RISC Film Town gas Laboratory IA-64 Paint Acorn Computers Anamorphic widescreen Underwater welding Opportunity rover Movie projector Widescreen Seabird The Ashlee Simpson Show Xbox 360 Internal ballistics Game Boy Thermal power station Collateral (film) Cinematography Cisco PIX Nickel-cadmium battery Camcorder Energy development Point and shoot camera Cookware and bakeware Canon EOS Scuba set Computer animation Tokusatsu Lightning Dry cleaning Diving suit Carnivorous plant Digital camera Television Francis Crick Welding Hay CDC 6600 MAME Spirit rover Shrek 2 Dairy Supercomputer The Curse of Fenric Diaper Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mercury 4 Drowning Sound card Single-lens reflex camera Wet and messy fetishism Sodium hydroxide Raw food diet Nintendo Revolution Methamphetamine Aluminium Sonar Caving Rebreather Pebble bed reactor Reservoir Dogs Irrigation Bullet time Fire extinguisher Sega Saturn Fluorescent lamp View camera Panoramic photography Battery (electricity) Surrealist techniques Screenshot Hilary Duff Disc jockey Color temperature CPU design Smallpox Emulator Sand art and play Late Night with Conan O'Brien Towel Burroughs B5000 Titanium Road-rule enforcement camera 135 film Swamp cooler Konica Minolta Casablanca (film) Shaggy dog story
