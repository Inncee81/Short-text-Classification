canon a vs a is is the worth the extra if so why these two cameras are almost identical however the a is has some extra features which make it the better choice in my opinion it would be my pick of the two for the extra you are getting an optical image stabilizer which is worth the extra cash alone this stabilizer means less blurry shots especially in lower light or when using slower shutter speeds you are also getting full manual controls aperture shutter priority you still have the standard auto setting but you also have the option to select your own shutter speed and aperture this will allow you to be more creative with your photography by giving you more control you are also getting a slightly stronger flash good luck and don't forget to buy a decent high speed sd card to go with the camera you will need this especially for shooting high quality movies sandisk extreme iii is my recommendation Leica Canon T90 View camera Digital photography Konica Minolta Camera Movie projector Shutter speed Photography Cinematography Secure Digital card Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photographic lens Floppy disk F-number Single-lens reflex camera Canon PowerShot G Depth of field Nikon FE2 Canon EF lens mount Street photography Panoramic photography Nikon FA Contax Canon T70 Shutter (photography) Automatic number plate recognition Beatmania IIDX Anamorphic widescreen Film Winning Streak Canon EOS Nikon FM2 Exposure (photography) Time-lapse DVD Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Frame rate Mouse (computing) Poker jargon Digital camera Rangefinder camera Film speed CompactFlash Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Widescreen Enlarger Charge-coupled device Nikon Corporation IMAX Oscilloscope Inflation Shutter angle Bluetooth Photographic film Canon FD PlayStation Portable Eyepiece 35 mm film Redundant array of independent disks Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure M16 (rifle) NTSC Memory Stick Explosive material Panavision Laserdisc Ethernet Gramophone record DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Golf club (equipment) Messerschmitt Bf 109 Need for Speed GunBound Point and shoot camera DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Technicolor High-voltage direct current Persistence of vision Bullet time $ale of the Century Amateur astronomy Filter (optics) Zone system Pentax Ra (board game) Cinematographer Astronomical seeing Galileo spacecraft Wheel of Fortune Overclocking Telescope Professional video camera
