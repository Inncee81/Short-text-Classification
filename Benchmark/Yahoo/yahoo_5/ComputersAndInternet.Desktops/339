the volume button is disappeared on my computer and when i went to sound and audio it said i had no audio please help if you understand what im trying to say here i am assuming you checked by going into start control panel sound and audio devices icon when you open this icon there should be pages one for volume sounds audio voice hardware look at the st page volume there should be a section called device volume check off place volume icon on the taskbar hit apply and say okay this will place the volume icon back on the taskbar for you if you are still having problems i recommend you try re installing your audio drivers go to your computer's manufacturer's website and utilizing your model number find the drivers and install them again try the initial step again if this still does not work your sound board might have gone bad or a wire might be loose this however rarely happens if it does though you will need to take it to a professional try pricing sound boards prior to taking it to someone to avoid getting ripped off best of luck Windows XP Object Desktop Windows 2000 Atari 8-bit family Synthesizer Modem Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis AmigaOS Taskbar Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows Vista Universal Serial Bus Bluetooth IPod Loudspeaker Screenshot X Window System Control Panel (Windows) Apple Computer Central processing unit Windows Mobile Laserdisc ZX Spectrum Embedded system Redundant array of independent disks Floppy disk Apple IIGS Vacuum tube CPU cache Hearing aid Sound recording Device driver OpenGL Linux Mach kernel Nintendo Entertainment System Audio level compression DVD Multitrack recording Windows 95 Blue screen of death Disc jockey Debugging Computer Video game music Audiophile Internet protocol suite Fischer Random Chess Hardware random number generator Copy protection Digital audio workstation Booting GSM services Cheating in Counter-Strike PlayStation 2 System 7 (Macintosh) Windows 3.x Sound Blaster Mouse (computing) IBM PC compatible Microsoft Windows Mozilla Firefox History of the graphical user interface Nintendo GameCube Voice over IP Computer and video games Prank flash Sound card Dance Dance Revolution Effects unit Sound effect USB flash drive Toyota Prius Xbox 360 Digital photography Xbox Podcasting IMac Mixing console Medical prescription Information Technology Infrastructure Library Karaoke MP3 Apple Macintosh Computer virus Digital circuit CPU design Collision detection Stardock Atari ST NX bit PlayStation Portable Best Buy Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple II family Impedance matching SCART
