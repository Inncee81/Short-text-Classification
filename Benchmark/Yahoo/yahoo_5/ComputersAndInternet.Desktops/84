my computer is slow do know how to make it faster please help me hello peter it'd be helpful if i knew more about your computer but going on this question blind i'll tell you there's generally three things that attribute to slowing down a computers performance integrated video with shared ram this sort of integration takes power away from the cpu and becuase of it's place on the motherboard has a slow data path so your video is slow making the pc slow these sort of systems also have shared ram and that takes essential resources away from the system how to solve this buy a dedicated video card with its own video ram the type of card you will need will depend on your motherboard insufficient ram next to video card the next important issue for any pc is making certain it's got enough ram to operate efficiently again this depends upon a number of factors and begins with what os operating system you're using a pc with xp works very well with mb ram processor depending on your motherboard there may be room for improvement by upgrading your cpu i'd say this is the least important factor in speeding up your system and is often not worth the cost unless your system is old enough so the cpus are cheap i once upgraded a p system from a mhz chip to mhz for only so to me it was worth it it was an old dell system and i increased the ram from to mb along with a nvidia x agp video card this brought my old dying dell up to speed and made it faster than many newer systems coming out of the mega stores even three years later i hope this has given you some insight if you have more specific questions about your specific machine i'd be happy to answer them my email is open ciao marcos RISC Central processing unit Overclocking PowerPC ATI Technologies Personal computer IBM PC compatible CPU cache Apple Macintosh Computer Opteron Atari ST PlayStation 3 CPU design Athlon NVIDIA 3dfx Northbridge (computing) Graphics processing unit Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis AMD IMac Commodore 128 Power Macintosh G3 Acorn Computers PlayStation 2 Windows XP Redundant array of independent disks PC motherboard Front side bus TRS-80 Color Computer Cyrix Commodore 64 Apple IIGS Apple II family IBM PC Microprogram Atari 8-bit family Motherboard Accelerated Graphics Port Amiga Celeron Compiler optimization Windows 2000 Random access memory VIA Technologies Radeon BBC Micro Microprocessor Super Nintendo Entertainment System Hard disk 64-bit PC Engine Laptop AmigaOS Data General Nova MOS Technology 6502 Atari 2600 MSX MIPS architecture USB flash drive Amstrad CPC Cray-1 Desktop computer Mach kernel Mainframe computer Acorn Electron Moore's law Stream processing Dual-core Sinclair ZX81 Risc PC Distributed computing Capacitor plague Commodore PET EMac Read-only memory PowerBook DDR2 SDRAM History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Timeline of computing 1990-forward Nintendo GameCube Computer architecture History of Microsoft Windows Neo-Geo Thread (computer science) Motorola 68000 SIMD
