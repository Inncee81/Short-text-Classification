which amd clock speed i am currently considering purchasing an amd x duel core cpu i am stuck whether to opt for the ghz or the ghz sounds like a stupid question but i'm on a really tight budget and if i invest more in the cpu i won't be able to spend as much on a graphics card any advice welcome by the way i am intending to game with this pc also like to add that i live in the u k if you are on a budget then you should definately invest the money in the graphics card much more important for gaming than the cpu amds are actually better for the money at the moment unless you plan to overclock then you can get more out of the intels do try to get one with a good amount of cache though because in fact that is fairly important for gaming AMD Pentium 4 Celeron Athlon Overclocking CPU cache Microprocessor Cyrix RISC MIPS architecture Front side bus Computer Clock rate Xeon IBM PC compatible Pentium III PlayStation 3 Opteron Athlon 64 Pentium D Duron Cell (microprocessor) PC motherboard CPU design PR rating Itanium 2 Pentium M VIA C3 X86 Xbox 360 AMD 5x86 GeForce 6 Series Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis VIA Technologies Dual-core NForce4 Atari ST Computer workstation ATI Technologies Northbridge (computing) Windows XP Radeon 3dfx NVIDIA Transmeta Nintendo Revolution Xbox Nintendo GameCube PlayStation 2 64-bit Far Cry Apple Intel transition IMac Zilog Z80 CPU electrical consumption Athlon 64 X2 Personal computer PowerBook AltiVec Counter-Strike Pentium AMD64 AMD K6-2 FLOPS History of Microsoft Windows Montecito HyperTransport Atari 2600 Computer bus X86 assembly language IBM POWER Computer and video game industry Symmetric multiprocessing Amiga Windows Vista Nintendo 64 BBC Micro Intel 80386 Gross domestic product Graphics processing unit Windows 3.x Commodore 64 AMD 29000 Timeline of computing 1990-forward ZX Spectrum Atari 8-bit family Sempron Wintel DDR2 SDRAM Intel Microsoft Windows History of computing hardware IBM PC
