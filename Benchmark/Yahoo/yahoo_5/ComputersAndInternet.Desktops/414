thinking of building my own computer ok i want to build my computer can i use the computer case that i have now like the this computer i am typing on for this question basicly can i just gut this think and put in spankin new hardware the comp i am usin' is a compaq presario it has been good to me over the years but i want an entertainment gaming monster that i can say i built with my own hands i would have to make sure all parts are compatible how would i do this would say on the package it comes in or would i have to do research for that and is building comp really just making sure you have a good power supply and making sure the parts are compatible is installing everything really big hastle alienware makes out to be i just want a computer with very good gaming cuality and good for editing or making videos with kick ass memory and stuff oh if you know how coul you tell how to build my own cuality computer case i am still searching for a comp store so dont worry bout that thanks thanks for all your help but i forgot what tools would i need for building one cant believ i forgot to add that first off you need to know what is the classification of your casing so that you'll be sure that your new motherboard will fit atx cases are the common cases today if you can't readily classify it just measure it and bring the measurements when you buy your parts a good research will always be needed for your new cpu contrary to your statement it is not really just about making sure all parts are compatible first you need to determine the primary purpose of your computer the amount of speed and computing capability is reliant on this if you will be a hardcore gamer video editor i would strongly recommend an intel core duo or core quad if your budget permits you can research for benchmarks to compare processors a decent board that supports core quad dual ram channeling and at least x gig ram a high end video cards for games a spacious hard disk more than gig for future investment and a reliable power supply you can throw in an lcd monitor for minimum power consumption and a good sound system basically it depends on your interest if you'll going to enjoy the process or not especially since for me building a new cpu doesn't mean that i'll just be buying from a single store it is a lot of hard work and price comparisons but its all worth it Computer RISC Central processing unit Atari ST Personal computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis CPU design Laptop AMD CPU cache IBM PC Xbox 360 PlayStation 2 Windows XP Overclocking Commodore 64 Amstrad CPC Sega Saturn TRS-80 Color Computer Windows 2000 PlayStation Portable Universal Serial Bus Microprocessor Apple Macintosh PC motherboard Apple II family Redundant array of independent disks Commodore 128 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) PowerPC Windows Vista ATI Technologies Mac OS X Amiga Timeline of computing 1990-forward 64-bit Linux Hard disk Commodore International PC Engine Apple Computer TurboGrafx 16 History of Microsoft Windows INMOS Transputer Sega Dreamcast Atari 2600 AmigaOS Super Nintendo Entertainment System Embedded system Sound card 3dfx Nintendo GameCube Random access memory NVIDIA MSX GeForce 6 Series Microsoft Cyrix Commodore PET Floppy disk Dynamic random access memory Motorola 68000 Computer and video games Acorn Electron System 7 (Macintosh) PowerBook Video game music Celeron Desktop computer Wintel IMac Virtual memory Computer hardware Supercomputer File Allocation Table Sound Blaster Password NX bit NeXT Memory (computers) Graphics processing unit Nintendo DS Nintendo Revolution Compaq Linux kernel BBC Micro Computer case Forth programming language
