amd or intel which processor is better i plan to use it for web surfing videos some games amd minor programs nothing to extensive i want the pc to be under dollars has any one heard of the amd's burning up intel is generally considered to be the better processor by people in the it industry while it is true that amd processors used to have their problems with overheating and other operational limitations in the early days of the company most of those flaws have been corrected now and the processor is generally problem free however intel processors usually process instructions faster due to their hyper threading technology and dual core processing whcih means that they process instructions on dual channels at the same time to give you twice the speed of a normal cpu not to mention that intel is the more popular and are the more well known cpu with a longer proven track record also most pcs usually have intel chips in them including dell computers hewlett packards and macbook pros therefore if you have the choice between to comparable computers of the same or similar prices most professional and home computers users would select the computer with the intel cpu over the amd however from what it sounds like you are going to be using the computer for your focus should probably be which computer is more affordable and practical for you to buy instead of which processor is best most home users never even notice the difference or utilize the cpu to its fullest extent good luck with your research and i'm sure you will be fine whatever you decide Pentium 4 Cyrix CPU design Microprocessor Computer workstation Computer MIPS architecture X86 Windows XP Athlon Celeron PowerPC History of Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh Linux kernel Personal computer X86 assembly language Timeline of computing 1990-forward Wintel Overclocking Atari ST Microsoft Windows Dual-core Apple Intel transition Mac OS X History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Atari 8-bit family NVIDIA IBM PC Opteron VIA Technologies Intel MOS Technology 6502 Sun Microsystems AMD64 Mach kernel Athlon 64 X2 GeForce 6 Series Xeon Transmeta ATI Technologies Supercomputer Pentium Pentium III Intel iAPX 432 ARM architecture Linux Mainframe computer Hewlett-Packard Windows Vista Zilog Z80 Thread (computer science) Graphics processing unit Laptop Symmetric multiprocessing Compiler optimization Moore's law Cell (microprocessor) Apple II family VIA C3 MP3 Clock rate IA-64 Athlon 64 Digital Equipment Corporation Buffer overflow Acorn Computers Burroughs B5000 Operating system Field-programmable gate array NeXT ZX Spectrum Pentium D DragonFly BSD Embedded system MOS Technology INMOS Transputer PlayStation 2 SIMD Computer multitasking Commodore 64 CDC 6600 Amstrad CPC CP/M Front side bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Mac OS X v10.4 PDP-11
