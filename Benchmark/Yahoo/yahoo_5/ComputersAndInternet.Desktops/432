computer will not turn on worked fine last night this morning the tower is dead no lights blinking and on the moniter it says check connections and powerw suppy did all that more than once still no light blinking front of tower no light on on back no fan running thanks for any help it sounds like the power supply if there's no lights at all first thing to check is the cord in the wall make sure the power strip is on and that the light on the strip is on if there isn't a strip and you're plugged straight into the wall then try an entirely new plug that you've tested with a light once you know the plug works and you plug in check the power supply that's the socket where the tower plug goes in it's usually triangular and sometimes it looks plugged in but it's slipped out just a bit if you still get nothing it's time to open the case when the case is open with the power supply on and plugged in then you should see a red or green light on the main board of electronics if there isn't one it's time to check the power supplies connection to the board itself that sometimes comes unplugged if that's not it the only other hope is that you have a nd computer that you can borrow the power supply from and test the computer then you should know if you need to buy a whole new power supply they only cost about for one that will run the best systems around so it's not a huge expense Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Personal computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Universal Serial Bus Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Jack plug Power strip Nintendo Entertainment System Fuse (electrical) Embedded system Modem Bicycle lighting Thermal power station Three-phase electric power Spark plug System/36 Traffic light D-subminiature Laptop Commodore 64 Alternating current Wire wrap Movie projector USB flash drive STS-61 Debugging Atari 8-bit family Electrical wiring (UK) Telephone exchange Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster IBM PC compatible Carburetor Television NVIDIA Strap-on dildo Residual-current device Solar power Computer forensics Apollo Guidance Computer Commodore 128 Sears Holdings Corporation Airport Gender of connectors and fasteners X10 (industry standard) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mains electricity Power cord Battery electric vehicle Distribution board Sinclair ZX81 CPU cache Docklands Light Railway Lighting IPod Drag racing Power supply Audiophile Capacitor plague Advanced Technology Attachment Reading spark plugs for racing Nintendo 64 Violin Electric motor Musical Instrument Digital Interface Mach kernel Transformer Acorn Electron Digital circuit Oscilloscope TGV Cheating in Counter-Strike Fencing Dundas Square Extension Cord Vacuum tube Overclocking Incandescent light bulb Christmas lights Fluorescent lamp Athlon Europlug Two-stroke cycle Conan the Barbarian Poker jargon Computer and video games Canon T90 Socket Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Wood Public-key cryptography Hearing aid SCART Mahjong AT form factor Money supply Electricity meter Diesel engine Mouse (computing)
