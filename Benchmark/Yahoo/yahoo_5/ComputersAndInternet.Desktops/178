is windows xp will be void i am planning to change my motherboard because one of the memory slot seems to have a problem does not detect one of my stick if i changed my mobo will i still be able to install my windows xp please dont tell me to call microsoft service center because i am in mideast and don't seem to know the answer i have mem slot but the rd slot won't detect my mushkin gb stick i tried swaping the sticks to the first sec and fourth slot but they are ok except for the rd slot i still have the xp cd activation key evrything but i also know that onced i activate my win xp over internet it will register my hardware config or save with this product key something like that so a major changes in hardware like changing motherboard will ask me to reinstall win xp so if i activate this new hardware config with the same old product key maybe it will tell me that this product key is already been activated to some pc if i call microsoft in mideast they seem not to know they said oem cannot be reused ok i could be wrong but i am almost positive that changing your motherboard will require a re install of the win xp operating system or at a minimum a reactivation of the os anytime that the os notes a major change in the system hardware such as a motherboard change it will try to do a reactivation if i remember correctly you will have up to three times after doing a major hardware change for the os to do an automatic reactivation after the third time though you will need to call microsoft to do it i don't think that there is any way to get around that as long as you have your win xp original install disk and the product key you should have no problem with your re install if you have the win xp install disk but you've lost or misplaced your product key there is a way to retrieve the product key from the system prior to doing your mobo change and os re install there are software programs that will assist you in locating the product key on your computer btw the number listed under my computer properties is not the product key that is the serial number and it will not help you in your re install if you need instructions on how to retrieve the product key shoot me an email also are you sure that it is the memory slot that is bad and not just the memory stick have you tried swapping the memory sticks around or just reinstalling them one at a time to see if the culprit is the slot or a stick it is worth trouble shooting that first Windows XP Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible Computer virus Virtual memory Copy protection Personal computer Apple IIGS Computer Blue screen of death PlayStation 2 Amiga Apple Macintosh Windows registry PlayStation 3 BIOS Computer hardware Modem Apple II family Windows Vista Atari 8-bit family Thread (computer science) Commodore 64 Novell NetWare Operating system Windows Server 2003 TRS-80 Color Computer Booting History of Microsoft Windows Computer bus Computer forensics Nintendo Entertainment System Patch (computing) Linux C programming language Forth programming language Password Buffer overflow Spyware Computer multitasking PC motherboard Java programming language Atari ST FreeDOS Digital circuit Library (computer science) Modchip Next-Generation Secure Computing Base NX bit Kernel (computer science) Mozilla Application Suite Hard disk Partition (computing) Xbox CPU cache Digital rights management Universal Serial Bus Timeline of computing 1990-forward ZX Spectrum Disk cloning Screenshot Hash table Btrieve Emulator PDP-11 Slot machine Emacs USB flash drive Original Amiga chipset CPU design Device driver Knoppix Amstrad CPC Windows 3.x Database Palm OS Trusted computing Mozilla Firefox Page table Floppy disk Linux distribution Information Technology Infrastructure Library MSX Server History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Sorting algorithm 64-bit Perl CP/M Nintendo GameCube
