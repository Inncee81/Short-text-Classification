please suggest a solution for this computer problem when i switch on my computer there is light in the mouse and a beep sound as if the windows is starting to load but suddenly the light in the mouse goes and computer does not start i keep waiting for a few minutes and again press the button on my cpu and the computer starts when i repeat this process for three or four times what problem does it have and how can i correct it there could be a number of reasons why this is occurring first make sure your mouse and keyboard are plugged in snugly also make sure your power chord is in good and tight after you turn on your pc see if any lights blink from your keyboard and mouse and put your hand behind the back of your pc by your power supply fan to make sure you feel the fan is working your power supply or other might be bad if you have another mouse and keyboard try swapping them out just to see if that helps you could try booting up in window's safe mode by pressing your f key right after you power on your computer and before windows starts if your pc runs okay in safe mode it could be a driver issue with your mouse or other device lastly if you click on your start button then right click on my computer then click properties then click device manager then click hardware look at your keyboards and mice settings to make sure the settings look okay i hope some of this helps Mouse (computing) Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Windows XP Universal Serial Bus IBM PC compatible Embedded system Personal computer Sega Dreamcast X Window System Screenshot Thread (computer science) Atari 8-bit family IMac CPU design Apple Macintosh Atari ST ZX Spectrum Virtual memory Computer multitasking Game controller Upper Memory Area RISC Windows 3.x Blue screen of death Commodore 64 History of Microsoft Windows Ethernet Computer History of the graphical user interface Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Control Panel (Windows) Computer and video games Apple Computer Central processing unit Linux X10 (industry standard) Object Desktop Redundant array of independent disks Architecture of Windows 2000 USB flash drive KIM-1 Modem Kernel (computer science) Xerox Alto Hello world program Cheating in Counter-Strike Commodore 128 Power-On Self Test Desktop computer Windows Vista Computer keyboard Unicode Toyota Prius Jumpstart 3rd Grade Opera (web browser) Device driver System/34 Digital Amstrad CPC Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Double-click (computing) Control-Alt-Delete OS/2 PlayStation Portable Spyware PowerPC Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster SAM Coup__ Apple IIGS TRS-80 CPU cache Minesweeper (computer game) Apollo Guidance Computer Super Nintendo Entertainment System PDP-11 Compiler optimization System/36 64-bit Sinclair ZX81 NX bit Keyboard technology Computer and video game genres Floppy disk GunZ The Duel Computer terminal Enigma machine Apple Desktop Bus Xerox Star Keyboard layout 2000 Australian Grand Prix Advanced Technology Attachment Palm OS
