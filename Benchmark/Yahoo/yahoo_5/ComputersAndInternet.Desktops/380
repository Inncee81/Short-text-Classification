computer is switching off hi please help i switch my computer on it boots up ok then it switches it self off again just keeps doing this over and over but sometimes its stays on for a short time i get on the net then a message pops up needing to close any advice would be welcome all the answers up to know are valid solutions but it could be any of these so my advice is try these in this order first run a anti virus and anti spyware scan to cancel out any malware infection this should allways be your first port of call when problems of this nature start happening on your p c then open you case and first give it a good spring clean starting with your c p u fan this gets clogged up with the most dirt and in some cases can stop the p c from booting up correctly i recently fixed a p c with a similar problem to yours it would boot up for minutes and then say it had to shut down to avoid any further damage the reason for this was a blocked cpu fan that the fans would not spin if the p c would continue to boot the cpu would probally fry so this is the reason for some shutdowns also clean the rear fans and any other fans in your p c including the graphics card fan especially check all the cables wires and leadsmmake sure they are all fitted properly and all power leads are correctly fitted have you recently added some new hardware if so your power supply may be struggling especially if its a graphic card in this case upgrade your p s u to a watt model to clean your p c use a air duster which is basically compressed air in a can its easy to use and dosent contain any solvents safe to use after you have checked all this right click my computer advanced start up and recovery then uncheck the box that says automatically restart and press ok this will stop any shutdowns however you still need to find the reason why the p c is shutting down in the first place it sould be a simple fault like a incompatible memory module so check the memory again has this happened since you have upgraded your memory its a case of checking everything until you locate the problem its a long drawn out process but its the only way you will find the problem any problems let me know good luck mate Mach kernel Windows XP Spyware Windows 2000 CPU design Atari ST CPU cache Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Floppy disk ZX Spectrum Amiga Malware Thread (computer science) Atari 8-bit family Booting AmigaOS IBM PC compatible Debugging Modem Oscilloscope Apple Macintosh Blue screen of death Windows Vista Redundant array of independent disks Central processing unit Buffer overflow Universal Serial Bus Personal computer INMOS Transputer IPod Visual Basic Linux Acorn Electron Computer forensics SAM Coup__ X Window System Second Battle of the Atlantic Embedded system PlayStation Portable M16 (rifle) Microsoft Windows Toyota Prius Commodore 64 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Virtual memory Sinclair ZX81 TRS-80 Cheating in Counter-Strike Space Shuttle program Digital circuit Computer System/36 E-mail spam PlayStation 2 Overclocking Nintendo Entertainment System Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Amstrad CPC Carburetor Tandem Computers Sega Dreamcast Pretty Good Privacy Computer bus Knoppix Federal Standard 1037C PaX Apollo Guidance Computer USB flash drive Spring operating system NX bit Compiler optimization Power-On Self Test Motorola 68000 Commodore 128 File Allocation Table Apple IIGS Emulator Exception handling MDAC 64-bit High-definition television Xbox Xbox 360 PowerPC Motorcycle Rootkit Field-programmable gate array The Amazing Race Pirate decryption Java programming language
