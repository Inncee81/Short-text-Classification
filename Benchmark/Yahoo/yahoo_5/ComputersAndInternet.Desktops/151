what is the benifit of the integration of northbridge and memory controller in amd processors and since that what is the advantage that amd processors will take rather than intel core due by this property it basically increases the amount of bandwidth between the cpu and ram because there is no longer the bottleneck caused by having to go through the front side bus despite this advantage the core duos are still faster due to other architectural benefits Front side bus Opteron CPU cache CPU design Pentium 4 RISC Microprocessor Athlon PC motherboard Dual-core Northbridge (computing) MIPS architecture Celeron IBM PC compatible AMD64 Sempron IA-32 PowerPC Overclocking Athlon 64 IBM PC NX bit VIA C3 Transmeta Pentium Cyrix HyperTransport NVIDIA AMD K6-III VIA Technologies Intel Symmetric multiprocessing X86 Pentium III AMD K6-2 Intel i860 GeForce 6 Series Compiler optimization Windows XP Super Nintendo Entertainment System Data General Nova Intel iAPX 432 Wintel X86 assembly language Clock rate Microprogram Cell (microprocessor) History of Microsoft Windows Computer Athlon 64 X2 Xeon Von Neumann architecture 3dfx Embedded system Word (computer science) Apple Macintosh Vector processor Motorola 68000 Linux kernel PR rating History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Microcontroller Field-programmable gate array Microsoft Windows PowerPC G4 DDR2 SDRAM Pentium D PA-RISC family Sound Blaster ATI Technologies AMD K6 Pentium II NForce4 Risc PC Intel i960 Amstrad CPC IA-64 INMOS Transputer Intel 80386 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Rambus Am386 DragonFly BSD Buffer overflow Power Mac G5 Computer bus Sequent Computer Systems Stream processing Xbox 360 Power Macintosh G3 AMD 29000 Memory-mapped I/O
