shutting my computer down how often people have told me never to shut down my computer but i think thats a bunch of bs i left my old computer on all the time and it burned out i just want to know officially how much you should shut it down i always get different opinions also i keep it in the attic and during the day it gets to be like degrees up there is that bad for it too i'm assuming yes also in the winter it gets to be around degrees up there is that bad too that heat will kill your computer you must find some place cooler or get a cooling system up there a computer should never operate at more than about degrees f unless it was specifically designed to do so even storing your pc at that temperature with it powered down will destroy some of its parts the shutdown question is like the old chicken egg debate my pc hosts several web sites so i need for it to be on all just about all of the time but personally i do shut it at least once a day then turn it back on after a minute not the re start but shutdown power down for about one minute and then turn it back on one thing this does is clean out the page file or the windows cache file you have to set this to happen this is not the default setting for windows i will admit though that this is probably a little harder on the power supply than leaving it on but power supplies are pretty cheap good luck and happy surfing troy as far as you computer burning out because of leaving it on i would say that the pc more likely burned out from being constantly over heated not from being left on you really do need to move it to a much cooler place Windows 2000 Domain Name System Windows XP Turbocharger Cache Solar power Hard disk Virtual memory Motor oil ITunes Spacecraft propulsion Mouse (computing) Universal Serial Bus Personal computer Embedded system Pretty Good Privacy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Theory of conduct Thermostat Computer CPU cooling Library (computer science) Computer forensics Password Air conditioning The Inside Fire fighting Windows Server 2003 The End of the World (Doctor Who) Blue screen of death Shutdown CANDU reactor Toyota Prius Opera (web browser) Nuclear reactor National Weather Service 64-bit Apple Computer SL-1 File Allocation Table Diesel engine Heinkel He 100 Overclocking Emacs Redundant array of independent disks HTTP cookie Architecture of Windows 2000 Pressurized water reactor Gnutella Screenshot CPU design Thread (computer science) RISC NX bit Web browser Furnace Microsoft Windows Server MP3 Fossil fuel power plant Booting Windows 3.x Web hosting Gas compressor USB flash drive Space Shuttle program Armored Core File system Three Mile Island System/34 Climate of the United Kingdom Classified information Charles Goodyear Mercury Atlas 6 Carburetor Hydrogen economy Pebble bed reactor History of Microsoft Windows Autonomous building Malware E-mail spam Linux Kazaa Glossary of firefighting equipment Thermal power station BitTorrent Luck MIPS architecture Social rule Central processing unit Debugging The Star Wars Holiday Special Gmail JADE programming language
