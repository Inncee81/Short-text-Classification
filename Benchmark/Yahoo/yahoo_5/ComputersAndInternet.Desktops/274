gbs of rams and gaming bit issue i'm supposed to be getting either or gigs of ddr rams the point is when regarding the gb it doesn't read completely on bit xp and vista systems mosly reads i can get a hold of both bit oss but what's on my mind is that if they have to use the wow to emulate pretty much all the games available doesn't that mean bit rules are applied and not only will that make gigs of ram available but will confuse the daul channel of the second set of rams x and maybe messup the whole clock if there's anyway around it in either or bit thats great if my whole theory about games using bit os rules to emulate please tell me thanks yup wow sorry it's wow wow is for emulating bit applications in a bit operating environment to answer your question you can't in a windows environment in any meaningful way get around the limit on bit addressing spaces it's a limit that all bit operating systems have not just windows the linux world has the best workaround for that issue however there is really no substitute to a bit environment i get what you're asking though if you're running a bit application in a sixty four bit environment will it take advantage of the full amount of ram available when running plus gigs of ram in a bit environment the answer is no at least i'm pretty sure of it although i'm not a hundred percent positve great question though it's a good question not typical of the drivel you normally see on yanswers do some research on it Windows 2000 Windows XP Virtual memory PaX 64-bit NX bit RISC Emulator IBM PC compatible Dynamic random access memory X Window System Kernel (computer science) Modem Xbox 360 History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Sinclair ZX81 Linux Domain Name System Central processing unit Spring operating system Acorn Electron Theory of conduct AMD64 Motorola 68000 MIPS architecture Apple Macintosh Original Amiga chipset History of operating systems Expert system Atari ST Operating system Microprocessor Computer virus Embedded system PowerPC Super Nintendo Entertainment System Plan 9 (operating system) NTFS X86 MAME Mac OS X Microprogram Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Commodore 128 Wine (software) Error correction and detection Library (computer science) Computer numbering formats System 7 (Macintosh) TRS-80 Redundant array of independent disks USB flash drive Upper Memory Area MMORPG Commodore 64 Atari 2600 MP3 Visual Basic Forth programming language X86 assembly language File Allocation Table Modal logic MSX Land use forecasting Virtual machine Hard disk DOS Fritz-chip Computer Nintendo GameCube Amiga Quizbowl Flash memory Thread (computer science) IPod Windows Server 2003 Windows Vista OpenOffice.org Hash table PlayStation 2 Sound Blaster Pocket PC H.264/MPEG-4 AVC RISC OS Timeline of computing 1990-forward Page table
