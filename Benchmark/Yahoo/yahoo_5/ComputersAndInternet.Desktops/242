need advise on p processor hi guys i need some advise i got asus p p x ghz gb geforce gt mb i realize after having gt i still got lag at times so im wondering if i buy a proccessor ghz will there be a difference which is increase in my fps fps wont go below and btw my fps isnt constant for example i play dawn of war dark crusade i got fps later dropped to when lots of enemies attacking and in vga chart it say gt can get fps if so can any recommend a good proccessor for me suit my asus p p x do i had to change psu if i change new chip mine is watt i think hope some expert can help in thks you forgot to tell us about your ram and if you are using the fsb you see if you have gb or more ram your computer would be speedy visit http www coastmemory com and get more they guarantee that it will work but this is not the fastest upgrade keep in mind that this motherboard takes a socket p northgate prescott cpu so if you picked a faster cpu chip that supported fsb then you would get the ram to match so pick the right processor and ram to match at the higher bus speed if you got that thing working with only watts great but you might consider a watt power supply your asus p p x is ok but if you are into spending any real money you might get an all new motherboard cpu and ram that is much faster if i was a gamer i would be looking at an amd chip and faster motherboard i'd build up with gb of ram so instead of buying all new ram and cpu get the motherboard too when you are playing be sure to use task manager to kill all unused applications get the screaming up by turning down the other demands on your system keep in mind that if you are playing on the internet that it can be slow too get to faster game servers and increase your internet connection good luck and happy computing Opteron Overclocking Athlon RISC IBM PC compatible Pentium D PC motherboard 3dfx AMD VIA C3 PowerPC Central processing unit Personal computer Apple Macintosh PlayStation 3 TRS-80 Color Computer Xeon ATI Technologies Atari ST INMOS Transputer Power Mac G5 Pentium III Apple IIGS Commodore 64 Computer bus GeForce 6 Series Cyrix First-person shooter Doom 3 Xbox 360 MIPS architecture 64-bit CPU design Super Nintendo Entertainment System VIA Technologies Sound Blaster Nintendo Entertainment System Commodore 128 History of Microsoft Windows Timeline of computing 1990-forward NVIDIA X86 Microprocessor Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Dual-core Embedded system Duron IMac Distributed computing PR rating Athlon 64 ZX Spectrum NX bit Natural Selection (computer game) Redundant array of independent disks Counter-Strike IBM PC Mouse (computing) PlayStation 2 Supercomputer MOS Technology 6502 Computer and video games Cell (microprocessor) Radeon Sega Dreamcast Microprogram Transistor Vector processor AMD K6-2 IBM POWER BBC Micro Advanced Technology Attachment Cheating in Counter-Strike Acorn Electron Atari 8-bit family GeForce 4 Itanium 2 NForce4 IA-32 AMD 5x86 Apple Intel transition PlayStation Portable Xbox MMORPG DEC Alpha Amiga AMD K6-III History of computer and video games Montecito Acorn Computers
