who can i file a consumer report with about a dispute with a satellite tv provider i recently switched from one provider to another because of the promise of a better deal and channels that were supposed to be available with provider b that provider a didn't offer access to now that the switch has happened provider b isn't delivering what it promised and is giving me a hard time about resolving the problem with what agency should i file a report better business bureau is a way for members to self police if you report something bad to the bbb the incentive is the member company will want to fix their tarnished reputation but there is no real enforcement there's no requirement to be a member either the fcc controls the satellite companies and they might be able to act on your behalf in the case of fraudulent misrepresentation or bait and switch schemes especially if this is happening to others your state's attorney general is also a good source to champion your cause sometimes nothing works better than some good ol' fashioned pressure from the media see if they have some sort of news unit that would investigate and publicly humiliate companies that refuse to take care of their customers they might just take care of your case to get the media to keep quiet Plame affair Better Business Bureau Cable television Federal Communications Commission Killian documents Contract Wells Fargo Corporate governance 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Credit repair Trademark Lawyer United States Postal Service Musical Instrument Digital Interface Copy protection Health insurance Best Buy Attorney at Law Internet fraud Copyright Broadband Internet access Identity theft Satellite television Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act MP3 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Windows XP Mozilla Firefox Atari 8-bit family Karl Rove Computer virus Microeconomics System/36 Satellite radio W.
