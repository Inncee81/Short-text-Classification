starbucks coffee ok so i am a huge starbucks addict and the other day as i was watching fox news they said that starbucks announce that they will be increasing cents on all there coffee products this is because the rising price of there dairy products is affecting them now i think that is a little stupid to raise their prices i mean its already expensive as it is and making coffee is cheap i think the most expensive bill that comes out of starbucks and any coffee store is water because they make theie coffee on water not milk so just because they are not making that much profit as they use to they raise prices isn't that just stupid i mean is not that i'm cheap or anything i would totally agree if they raise the price on their coffee because they'll be paying more to the farmer that produces the beans of coffee because in case you didn't know from my dollar coffee the farmer only gets cent so i think i might not go to starbucks anymore what do you think would you still go oh god no i'm not loosing sleep or being cheap i'm just saying dunkin donuts announce that they are not raising prices nor is gloria beans or seattle's best its not supply and demand its not gas prices indirectly affecting dairy you know what it is it's greedy corporations that need to make boat payments they need six more mantions and more rolls royces that and they probably have lawyer bills to pay they're higher ups' are greedy simple as that Microeconomics Coffee Starbucks Supply and demand Dairy Soy milk 1973 oil crisis Wal-Mart Tariff Inflation Tax Hyperinflation Dairy farming Coffeehouse Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Common Agricultural Policy Agriculture in Australia Hydrogen economy FairTax Bank Gross domestic product Gold standard Solar power Economy of Mexico Deflation (economics) Economy of Russia Monetary policy Oil depletion United Kingdom corporation tax Biodiesel Commodity markets Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Economy of the United States Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Nuclear power Implications of peak oil Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Euro Agricultural policy Nuclear power phase-out Bond Subsidy Organic farming Frappuccino Grid energy storage Publicly funded medicine Economy of Colombia Kyoto Protocol Economy of Africa Future energy development Hubbert peak theory Law of value History of the United States (1918-1945) Petroleum Economy of Venezuela Poker jargon Peet's Coffee and Tea Price discrimination Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internet fraud Free trade Economy of India Software patent debate Milk Chocolate Protectionism United States dollar New Deal Dairy cattle Energy crisis Live 8 Externality Monopoly Value added Instant coffee Labor theory of value Keynesian economics Cheese Dunkin' Donuts Taxation in the United States History of Brazil (1889-1930) Asian financial crisis Estoppel Organic food Natural monopoly Energy Policy Act of 2005 Economy of Haiti Barnes & Noble Cable television Target Corporation Futures contract Economy of Cuba Microsoft The Price Is Right Fairtrade labelling Bretton Woods system
