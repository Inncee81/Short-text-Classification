form a corporation in oregon can a minor form a corporation in oregon if so how would one do this serious answers only please also please don't give advice just answer the question thank you corporations in any state have specific laws that govern how they are created they must have a board of directors and stock holders and hold meetings that are recorded and file corporate taxes as a minor your problems in this area are that you cannot be bound by any contracts so i don't think there is a law which specifically prevents you from forming a corporation but it would be difficult to transact business as a minor and a stockholder of your corporation generally trusts are set up with administrators if you need to have a corporation if you want to find out the exact steps to set up a corporation and determine the type of corporation i recommend you start with the oregon secretary of state's website on starting a business in oregon http www filinginoregon com business starting a business htm you can give them a call and find out the specifics on what you can do as a minor or talk with a corporate attorney about the legalities i am not an attorney and any public forum is the wrong place to ask for legal advice unless you are emancipated in which case you are legally an adult and have already shown a judge you can support yourself Corporation Lawyer Contract Plame affair Controlled Substances Act Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Attorney General Domain Name System Enron Corporation Conflict of interest Supreme Court of the United States Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Tom DeLay Same-sex marriage in the United States Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Taxation in the United States Mediation Corporate personhood Expert system Government of Maryland Trademark Timeline of the Enron scandal Attorney at Law Trust (Law) USA Legal research Stock Bush v.
