why do some people get freezing at the dentist i just focus on a spot on the wall and don't feel anything i prefer no freezing or gas because then i know what the dentist is doing to me and it doesn't hurt when i look at a spot and think only of it some call it self hypnosis but it works whatever you call it congratulations but not everyone has that ability i had kids without an epidural too but i don't suggest that for everyone in the end it's more important to get the dental treatment than to avoid it because you can't be a tough guy it's the result that's important not how you get there i don't get gas but i do appreciate the numbing gel all the same but i won't fault those who want the gas Dentistry Hypnosis Epidural Mouth ulcer Anesthesia Transactional analysis Halitosis Milton H.
