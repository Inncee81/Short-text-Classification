does invisalign work i've seen the commercials about invisalign and i'm getting braces soon but i'm wondering if invisalign really works and makes your teeth straighter yes but it's a long process invisalign is a system of retainers that eventually straighten out your teeth you go through several retainers before you see results after i had braces i had retainers similar to those of invisalign and they were obnoxious and you can't eat with them in braces are easier Dental brace Orthodontics Drill bit Dentistry Scoliosis Tooth Tooth enamel Bracket C programming language Barbed wire PostScript Woodworking Linux Osteoclast High-speed rail Canoe Saxophone Dental caries C.F.
