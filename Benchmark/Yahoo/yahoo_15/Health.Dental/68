bad breath in children my daughter is almost she has had very bad breath for several years now no amount of brushing has ever helped it no dentist ever mentioned it but then again i never had mentioned it to one of them i always attributed it to her caps she had put on her molars at a young age from early tooth decay we at one time lived in the country had un floridated well water she had floride treatments at every dentist visit when we lived there now though her capped molars are falling out she has lost almost all of her baby teeth yet the bad breath is still there is getting worse she hasn't seen a dentist in years due to money issues at home my husband makes too much money for gov assistance yet not enough for us to be able to pay our co pays i insist that she needs to see a dentist or maybe even a doctor for this problem does anyone have any ideas on what it could possibly be so i might be more convincing in my arguement please dont say infections it isnt infection btw she flosses every day brushes at least x a day doesnt eat much sweets has a very balanced diet your daughter needs to floss everyday and brush after every meal especially if she has caps on her molars and food is being stored inbetween her teeth there will be an order if the caps are old so is the cement that was used to bond the cap to the tooth the cement could be leaking causing a break in the seal are the caps stainless steel also the foul smell in her mouth can be a stomach problem i would consult the dds first and then her ped doctor to rule out anything wrong relax and get it checked out you can contact me anytime Tooth Halitosis Dental caries Dental brace Dentistry Oral hygiene Tooth enamel Wisdom teeth Stomach cancer Medical prescription Breastfeeding Fancy rat Fecal incontinence Cat Crown (dentistry) Gingivitis Elephant Domestic rabbit Pneumonia Oral sex Guinea pig Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Gastroesophageal reflux disease Bruxism Babe Ruth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Foodborne illness Coeliac disease Hydrogen peroxide Fluoride therapy Hamster Root canal Kodocha Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Fugu Hypoglycemia Days of our Lives Adjustable gastric band Plame affair The Dentist Cirrhosis Hiccup Terri Schiavo Egg (food) Mouth ulcer Diabetes mellitus Glossitis Gastroparesis Dieting Vernon Schillinger Insulin Microeconomics Common Agricultural Policy Folic acid Dental floss Adolf Hitler's medical health Methamphetamine Theory of conduct Procrastination Salary cap Orthodontics Famine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Garlic AIDS pandemic Stuttering Keynesian economics Dairy Medicine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Betting (poker) Medical malpractice Cotton candy Autism Minor Discworld characters Bong Diving Hydrogen sulfide Le Malade imaginaire Obesity Tire 613 mitzvot World Series Domestic violence Cystic fibrosis Happy Tree Friends Glen Jacobs Aspartame History of medicine Fluoride Dog Surgery Water
