what has your experience been with having wisdom teeth removed if you have gotten your wisdom teeth removed i would like to know what your experience was do they give you anesthesia how is it administered if by needle did it hurt was the actual procedure painful during after i'm having mine removed soon and i'm just a little nervous i would like to know what to expect thanks in advance the anesthesia most dentists use is local which means they inject into the gum jawline it is uncomfortable but necessary for the extraction the only thing i found i didn't like during the procedure itself was the pressure of pulling pushing on the tooth itself but no it didn't hurt it was just weird you can request to be given gas but it is not easy to persuade most dentists to use this you hear the breaking of the tooth smell the burnt bone smell when they are trying to drill off portions to make the extraction easier but that is a given my dentist took two out from one side then the other two out on the other side days later not all four at once after the first two were out i had major swelling couldn't eat drink rinse anything i went back to my dentist and apparently while my cheek was still under the anesthesia i chewed on the inside of my cheek causing a sore and infection which caused the swelling the pain came several days later because the trauma was so bad the shock of it was delayed just place some warm salt water in the area don't try to swish just let it lie there for as long as you can stand it for up to a minute if possible then just open your mouth and let it drain out do not spit this will create a suction and draw more blood and could create a dry socket which is why the warning not to smoke after dental procedures this is what i did for the infection just in case for you laying on an ice pack or iced towel on affected side for mins on mins off take two hand towels soak and put them in plastic bags put in freezer after frozen take towel in bag out wrap in dry towel lie down on it or gently place it on jaw after minutes remove place towel bag back in freezer minutes later get other towel bag and repeat the process repeat this for about an hour after an hour wait another hour then try again while you are using one towel bag the other is refreezing so you won't be without one Tooth Wisdom teeth Dental caries Menstrual cup Bong First aid Cocaine Breastfeeding Halitosis Mouth ulcer Local anesthesia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion Dentistry Tooth enamel Bleeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Anesthesia Drowning Methamphetamine Body piercing Dentures Carpal tunnel syndrome Wound Manicure Fire fighting Dairy Tattoo Naruto jutsu Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Textile manufacturing Intravenous therapy Dental brace Paget's disease of bone Massage Shaggy dog story Tobacco Epidural Milton H.
