invisalign does invisalign give good results would u recommend it how good is invisalign compared to metal braces advantages the main advantage of the treatment is cosmetic the aligners are completely transparent and difficult to detect this makes the method particularly popular among adults who want to straighten their teeth without the unflattering look of traditional metal braces which are commonly worn by children and adolescents in addition the aligners are marketed as being more comfortable than braces according to the company invisalign aligners are more comfortable than metal braces as they may not irritate the soft tissue of the mouth as much as traditional braces due to the removable nature of the device various food types can be enjoyed without the encumbrance of metallic braces disadvantages despite the considerable cosmetic advantage of invisalign the product also has many disadvantages the very fact that the aligners are removable means they are not continually correcting the teeth they are largely dependent on a patient's habits and their consistency in wearing the aligners with fixed braces the treatment is also dependent on patient compliance the aligners must be removed for eating they and the teeth should be cleaned before re inserting afterwards this can be troublesome for people who are constantly snacking and may mean the patient has to clean their teeth up to six times daily however this tends to discourage snacking which some people might find useful this is the same for patients with fixed braces as with traditional braces if a patient grinds or clenches his or her teeth during the day or while sleeping the aligners or braces can become damaged in these cases a new aligner may be required or it may be suggested that a patient switch to a metal retainer also aligners or braces may cause a slight lisp at the beginning of treatment however this lisp also usually comes along with the traditional metal braces this usually disappears as the patient becomes used to the treatment Orthodontics Drill bit Tooth Carpal tunnel syndrome Dental caries Intravenous therapy Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Urinary incontinence Tooth enamel Acne Cancer Coeliac disease Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Scoliosis Contact lens Hamster Breastfeeding Sleep apnea Scar Androgen insensitivity syndrome Epilepsy Growth hormone treatment Malignant melanoma Equine conformation Associative array Breast cancer Lung cancer Fecal incontinence Stroke Sewage treatment Chronic fatigue syndrome Colorectal cancer View camera Tattoo Hearing impairment Slide rule Acromegaly Bulk vending Radiation therapy Table saw Radiosurgery Dentistry Plastic surgery Intersex surgery Traumatic brain injury Mattress Medicine Floppy disk Land mine Psoriasis Stereoscopy Cascading Style Sheets Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Crohn's disease Earring Drug test Surveillance Adjustable gastric band Folic acid Dentures Transsexuality Stuttering Antiretroviral drug Bipolar disorder Menstrual cup Bruxism Redundant array of independent disks Oral hygiene Gastroesophageal reflux disease Scheme programming language Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Trimipramine History of intersex surgery Cephalic disorder Typewriter Female genital cutting Cocaine Diabetes mellitus Medical analysis of circumcision Intensive insulinotherapy Indent style Prolactinoma Paget's disease of bone Osteoarthritis Hydrogen peroxide Insulin Paracetamol Allergy Gas metal arc welding
