should i use alcohol free mouthwash or with alcohol well i had the alcohol one and i use just alittle to much and it burned my gums it looked nasty white yellow slimy but i felt worse i couldn't eat or drink anything cause it hurt to much the denist couldn't even do anything so now i use alcohol free and probably always will and want to and there is a difference for me either get burned or not get burned but every person's mouth is different so this may and probably won't happen to u there isn't really a difference Bong Halitosis Alcoholics Anonymous Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hypoglycemia Mouth ulcer Alcoholism Theory of conduct Tooth One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Social rule Dental caries Humphrey Bogart Mothers Against Drunk Driving Philosophical skepticism Bob and George Cocaine Piccolo Junior Saga Free will Breastfeeding Out-of-body experience Traumatic incident reduction Prohibition Hangover Ron Weasley Fecal incontinence Tooth enamel Drinking culture Hustler Magazine v.
