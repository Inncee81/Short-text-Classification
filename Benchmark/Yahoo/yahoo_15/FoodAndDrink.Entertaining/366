cook yourself or get it catered my daughters christening is in weeks and i am so undecided on a food menu and i dont know if i should cook everything myself or have the event catered i am having it in my backyard and there will be about guests which way sould i go and what kind of food should i have have it catered trust me i love to cook but you sometimes underestimate the timing and fall behind and end up cutting some items out you don't have to hire a professional caterer that have extra charges etc see if there are any restaurants around that have party packages or dishes that they can drop off and you just place them on the table you can also cut some costs by getting a veggie tray meat platter cheese fruit tray from a local grocers if you have a more gourmet grocers around they may offer some nice dips etc also remember that just because your having people you dont have to get every dish serving people you can tweek it to just serve people on some things etc something that serves people is assuming your only have that one dish good luck French cuisine Cuisine of Denmark McDonald's D__ner kebab Hell's Kitchen (television) Hamburger Food Barbecue Chinese cuisine In-N-Out Burger American Chinese cuisine French fries Korean cuisine MRE Cajun cuisine Roman eating and drinking Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of the Philippines Salad Saimin Fondue German cuisine Cincinnati chili Peruvian cuisine Hot pot Kosher foods Jewish cuisine Hot dog Irish cuisine Japanese tea ceremony British cuisine Ramen Pizza Cuisine of Singapore Chili con carne Pancake Tofu Dim sum Cantonese cuisine Kitchen Fast food Bengali cuisine Jennifer Lopez Cuisine of the Southern United States A&W Restaurants Cuisine of India Slot machine Curry Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Kebab Vegetarianism Meal Cuisine of Africa Dumpling Chinatown Fajita Buddhist cuisine Recipe Cuisine of Vietnam Potato Sushi Pie Soul food Street food Menu TV dinner Vegetarian cuisine Italian beef Soup Celebrity chef Cuisine of Austria Steak n Shake Foodborne illness Bento Fugu Pea soup French toast Ice cream Egg (food) Thomas Keller Conveyor belt sushi Dietitian Dai pai dong Sauce Pizza Hut Idli Kuching Taiwanese cuisine Balti (food) Pasta Cafeteria Nabemono
