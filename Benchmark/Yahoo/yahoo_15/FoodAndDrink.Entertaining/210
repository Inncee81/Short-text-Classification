i'm having a party not at my house this year at a restaurant should i charge for tickets here's the situation it's my th annual party and i'm not having it at my house this year we'll play games and i have bought s in prizes and door prizes it'll be at a local mexican restaurant around lunchtime on a saturday their meals are from should i tell my guests they have to pay for their own meals but i will cover the tip or should i charge admission like a ticket and have that pay for the overall cost of meals tips i'm throwing at the restaurant because the atmosphere fits my theme actually i think now that i'll wait to see how many people rsvp for this party first i may pay for of everyone's check to make it easier it's just my th annual party and i wanted to do something special rather than being at my house again plus i'm bisexual and my mother doesn't know so by inviting people to a restaurant i can invite my gay lesbian friends too it's going to be in early november so outdoors is out of the question okay i've made my final decision i'm going to say that i'll pay for their lunches drinks not included and that donations will be accepted i would cover the whole thing if that is doable and have them pay for their own drinks try also a buffet there or just trays of h'ors d'eovres out on a table where people can mingle i would not charge your guests however you know them better than i and if you think that they would be okay with it thats great to help i would ask a couple of your closer friends and see what they think also in the future you may want to co host with another person or two so its split way either way it will be a fun time Poker jargon Meal Tip Friends Restaurant DisneySpeak Anderson Cooper Little Britain Public house Bisexuality Cha chaan teng French cuisine Hell's Kitchen (television) Sexual orientation Abigail Folger Wheel of Fortune Social rule Drag queen Supply and demand Yum cha Gay Thanksgiving The Price Is Right Public transport Whose Line Is It Anyway?
