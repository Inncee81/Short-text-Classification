what kind of cake is good for a b'day party i just ordered at costco a vanilla cake with strawberry mousse filling and cream cheese icing for my daughter's first b'day party i am not sure if this will be a good choice any suggestions comments if she's only i don't think she'll be picky though i admit i don't know any toddlers with a sweet tooth for strawberry mousse filling i'm sure it will be fine though but maybe next year you might want to go with something a little bit simpler like vanilla chocolate my favorite or a mixture like marble or half and half anyways i hope it goes smoothly have fun Cold Stone Creamery Cuisine of Denmark Breakfast Cake Cheesecake Chocolate Polish cuisine Yoplait German cuisine Bagel Cuisine of the Philippines Oreo Ice cream Japanese cuisine In-N-Out Burger Kit Kat French cuisine Pancake McDonald's Strawberry Shortcake Pop-Tarts Vanilla Jewish cuisine Pie Mochi Opinion Pizza Cuisine of Austria Cookie Naples Wine Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de S__vign__ Spidey Super Stories Radio Bart Pocky Soft drink Mooncake Heath bar Sundae Apple pie Strawberry Fields Forever Genericized trademark Coffee The Apprentice 2 Twinkie Pecan pie Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Red velvet cake King cake Pavlova Cuisine of Argentina Tofu Bengali cuisine Cocoa Yoghurt Strawberries Single Transferable Vote Cream the Rabbit Cuisine of the Southern United States Dairy Doughnut Last meal Glycerin Hansel und Gretel Potato pancakes Nestl__ Nesquik Milkshake Bread Waffle Darryl Strawberry Vanilla Ninja Turmeric Dumpling Portuguese cuisine Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.
