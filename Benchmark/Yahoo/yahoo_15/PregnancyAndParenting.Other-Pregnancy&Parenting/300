child custody please advice okay i am pregnant right now and the dad's saying its not his well i told him that rather he beleives it or not its his and i am putting his name on the birth certificate well his response was if i did he would have a dna test done i already planned that and get custody of the baby how likely is it that he can do this if i am not unfit i have a clean house i am currently not working but checking into a work at home thing the reason i am not working is cuz i can't lift what are the chances he will be able to get full custody of the baby i'm not real worried about it but he does have more money than i do highly unlikely parents don't get sole custody without a reason the majority of judges won't go for that in all honesty he's just saying that to scare you out of doing the test if dna tests prove it's his he'll have to pay child support and it sounds like he will do anything possible to keep from having responsibility in this he's not going to go for full custody he doesn't even want to be named the daddy Child support EastEnders Fathers' rights Friends Father Divorce 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Jon Secada Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prenatal diagnosis The Fairly OddParents Polyamory Ocean's Twelve Infantilism Child custody Charmed Street-Legal Humphrey Bogart Fathers' rights movement in the UK Androgen insensitivity syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Lord Chancellor Abortion in the United States Characters of Lost History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Los Rold__n Adoption Status of religious freedom in Malaysia David Blunkett Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Grandview, U.S.A.
