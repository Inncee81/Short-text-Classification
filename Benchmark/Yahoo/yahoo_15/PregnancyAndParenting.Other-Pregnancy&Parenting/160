what do you do when your child throws a fit do you ignore them give them what they want what any tips you do not give an age so what you do really needs to be appropriate to their understanding and level of development as a mother of two boys and i will tell you that based on my personal experience and what i have seen with others never ever give in to your children when they throw a fit because what seems like a quick and easy solution will come back to haunt you in a big way all kids will try to push the boundaries as a way of developing independence and younger children often act out because they cannot express themselves so keeping that in mind try not to react in anger if they dont get a reaction out of you they are usually less likely to use this method so basically start by ignoring the behaviour as long as they are not in physical danger let them be and let them know when they are ready to behave ask nicely apologize or fill in the blank you will be waiting over there wherever as long as you have visual contact and are within safe distance that alone might startle them into behaving and you may get some stares depending where you are but people who have children or deal with them will actually be quite sympathetic and understand exactly what you are doing so dont feel embarrassed when it is done first acknowledge that they are angry frustrated i see that you were very angry just now because you didnt get second let them know that this is unacceptable and that they will not get what they asked for because of their behaviour third let them know what they need to do or if old enough ask them what they can do next time do not tell them they are bad just their behaviour hope this is helpful Transactional analysis God Emperor of Dune Social rule Autism Theory of conduct Karen Horney Magical thinking Electrophysiology Human sexual behavior Domestic violence Stuttering Internal ballistics Aikido Anger management Attachment theory Characters in the Smurfs The nature of God in Western theology Dog training Poker jargon Childlove movement Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Classical mechanics Prisoner's dilemma Explosive material Pitaten Narcissism Spanking Child sexuality Kodocha Psychology Anger Current teachings of Prem Rawat Aerial (dance move) Grief Religion Software engineering Justice (TNG episode) Child sexual abuse Ranma __ characters Urinary incontinence Richard Rahl Object-oriented programming Shaggy dog story The Empty Child Sant Thakar Singh Piccolo Junior Saga Hikikomori Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Entropy Neuro-linguistic programming Asperger syndrome Motorcycle Blood (computer game) Fathers' rights Psychosis Conspiracy (TNG episode) Singlish Transsexuality Anorexia nervosa Past teachings of Prem Rawat Ethics Symbiosis (TNG episode) Avenue Q Punk ideology Coming of Age (TNG episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Traumatic brain injury Newbie Sexual orientation Beetle in an Anthill Volleyball Reiki Self programming language Fast bowling Extreme Programming Bubble Bobble Human nature Sydney Riot of 1879 Epilepsy Dog Weight training Nicomachean Ethics Ocean's Twelve Second language acquisition Randomness Determinism Altruism False memory Autostereogram Richard Feynman Defence mechanism Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Tag Economics Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Psychotherapy
