am i pregnant i had my perido on june nd i skipt all of july i took to home pregnancy tests already they were negative i went to the dr they did a urine test it was negative but my period is still not coming what shoud i do i use to have menstrual problems but maybe its been like or months that i was fine until now the dr told me to go in days for a blood test but he was pretty sure i wasnt pregnant any opinions a lot of times just the stress of am i pregnant is enough to keep a womans period away if you skipped all of july a home pregnancy test and a doctors urine test would have shown a positive at that point you would be almost weeks pregnant which would have enough of the pregnancy hormone used to detect pregnancy good luck to you xoxo Menstrual cycle Pregnancy test Urinary incontinence Fertility awareness Miscarriage Endometriosis Cytomegalovirus HIV test Drug test Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Prolactinoma Human chorionic gonadotropin Prenatal diagnosis Abortion Hyperprolactinaemia Coeliac disease Diabetes mellitus In vitro fertilisation Turner syndrome Psoriasis Ectopic pregnancy Twin Folic acid Infertility Endometrial cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Spina bifida Childbirth Birth control Amenorrhoea Postpartum depression Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Acne Premature birth Breastfeeding Diabetes insipidus EastEnders Hypertension Abortion debate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diabetic retinopathy Ben Johnson (athlete) Breast cancer Emergency contraception Tetrachloroethylene Ovarian cancer Ovulation Tocopherol Haloperidol Doxepin Lupus erythematosus Polycystic ovary syndrome Chemical abortion Guinea pig False negative Anemia Morning sickness Estrus cycle Cephalic disorder Tour de France Big Brother UK series 6 Blood type Cancer Gynecologic hemorrhage Teenage pregnancy Insulin Glucocorticoid Abortion in the United States Urinalysis Menstrual cup Pneumonia Dorothy L.
