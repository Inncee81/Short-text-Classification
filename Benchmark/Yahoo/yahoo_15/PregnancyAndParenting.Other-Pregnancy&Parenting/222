modern parenting a blessing or a curse i'm one of those emotionally sensitive people you know who is always thinking of being fair and understanding of others i've had my moments sure my mom on the other hand is the opposite she hardly ever shows emotion to me and she says whatever pops into her head she's been a good mom but i wouldn't wanna be that kind of mom to my kids she always used that whole i'm the parent your the child thing as a reason for why things had to be she told me i didn't deserve privacy or consideration because i was a child and children don't get those privileges she never gave me second chances if i sassed a bit she immediately punished me and i got grounded for weeks second chances were unheard of now i'm pregnant with my first child and i feel my parenting techniques will be more modern hence the exact opposite of my mom so instead of hitting my kids with a belt cane or anything available i'd rather use the time out strategy what's everyone else's opinion on it i was raised much like you we are raising our children with attachment parenting and it works wonders our son doesn't want to disappoint us and is easy to discipline my parents at first didn't understand it but now because he is nearly say it works attachment parents do not let their kids run the show we use consequences consistency and we are firm yet there is a lot of love touch and hugs in between we have spanked in the past but it didn't work with our son what works better is taking things away as a toddler putting the toy where he could see it but not reach it he is well mannered behaved and a sweet kid our daughter is being raised the same way i recommend the discipline book the baby book and the breastfeeding book all by sears that parenting style doesn't work for all but it does for us Spanking Abortion debate Theory of conduct Breastfeeding EastEnders Corporal punishment Recurring South Park characters Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
