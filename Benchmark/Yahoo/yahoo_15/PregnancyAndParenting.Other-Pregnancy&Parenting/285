i want to plan my pregnancy when should i stop taking birth control pills i'm recently married and almost if you are ready to start having a family i would say go ahead and stop your pills the problem is it is different for everyone for me i was off of the pill months and got pregnant i got off the pill when my husband was deployed and got pregnant right upon his return so i don't know if i would have gotten pregnant sooner since i wasn't having sex i was on the pill for years so i didn't think months was that bad although i know for some women it is much longer either way i would say go ahead and get off of them now as long as you are ready because it could happen right away best of luck to you Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Abortion debate Knots Landing EastEnders Depo Provera Neighbours Psoriasis Friends Tocopherol Endometriosis Days of our Lives Teenage pregnancy Guinea pig The Children of Men Sharon Tate Boston Public One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Marriage Breastfeeding Abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Lucille Ball Spina bifida The Virgin Suicides Miscarriage Roe v.
