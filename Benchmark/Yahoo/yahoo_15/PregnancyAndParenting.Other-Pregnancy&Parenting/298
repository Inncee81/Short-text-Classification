do you think this will play into effect with custody if the father is saying the kids not his to begin with do you think tht later on in court that will play into effect that the only time he said it was his is after i have a dna test done and b hand he wants nothing to do with the baby i have emails and text messages and such that show that he does not claim the baby he says that he will take responsibilty but to get custody of the child i think hes trying to scare me into not saying the babies his my sons dad is claiming the same thing telling me that my baby isnt his son i must have slept around and all this crap so i filed for child support requested a dna test upfront that way he'll have the test before we ever go to court i talked to a friend of mine who is a paralegal and she said that none of that really makes much difference in court they look at the bigger things like does either parent have any felonies either parent a drug addict which parent is more financially stable etc in my case the father has only spoken to me once since september when i told him i was pregnant and my friend said that the judge looks at things like that she said that he'll see that the father hasnt been around the entire pregnancy or months of his sons life and that will play a big part in their decisions i dont see where a judge would give a man custody of a child hes never been around i suggest getting a phone book and looking up lawyers call a family law lawyer see if they have free consultations if they do set one up you can sit with a lawyer tell them the situation and they can tell you what they think your not obligated to hire the lawyer after that consultation some states even have legal advice offices where they'll give you free legal advice if you message me i can help you find one of those offices Divorce Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal Child support 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Plame affair Schapelle Corby Fathers' rights Lawyer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Child custody O.
