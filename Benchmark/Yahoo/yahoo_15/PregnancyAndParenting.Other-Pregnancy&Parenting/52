i need idead asap when i got pregnant i am currently weeks i got the entire family history on my mothers side from my grandma within about an hours time period one of the things she mentioned was that her brother was born a mongloid because my great grandma came in contact with someone who had german measles he then died about a week after he was born from natural causes after hearing this i did some research online so i had an idea what i needed to be looking for that way if i got it i knew rather sooner then later anyhow this morning at work i m a receptionist a lady came in with red bumps all over her face you could tell she had been scratching them her face was all bleeding now i didn t want to be rude and ask her what those were from but that is one of the first physical signs of the german measles now i again i don t know for sure if she has that or not but what do you all think i should do if in fact she did i want to make sure i didn t catch it any ideas i wasnt trying to be rude by what i had called him that is just the name that the doctors gave him when he was born i didnt know how else to tell you what he had without saying it like that but no i wasnt trying to be rude in anyway from what i was told my great grandma caught it at the end of her st trimester i know that you have to have touched some form of droplet from them to contact it but she had blood all over her fingers from the scratching and i had to take something from her i m not trying to be over dramatic but this is my nd pregnancy with my st ending in a miscarriage so i really can t help but worry about things you should ask your mom if she knows if you were ever vaccinated for it it's a very rare occurance that a pregnant woman contracts it because most people these days have been vaccinated if you haven't been vaccinated for it there still is a very good chance you will not get it it isn't as contageous as say chicken pox or other kinds of measles it is spread in an airborn droplet form so the lady probably had to actually sneeze on you for you to get it from what i understand symptoms don't show up until or weeks from exposure so you really won't know if you contracted it or not for a while if i were you i'd contact my doctor and tell him about it at the very least your doctor will be able to ease your mind more than any of us could and watch you for symptoms but like i said it is very rare i really wouldn't worry too much about it best of luck edited to add i just read your added details and that is soooo disgusting how could that woman just sit there with blood on her hands passing things back and forth to people god only knows what's in her blood geesh some people are just ridiculous it sounds like you need a stash of rubber gloves and hand sanitizer when dealing with our clients they obviously have no respect for other people's health and you don't have to explain about why you're worried about this you're just trying to protect your little bundle there's no shame in that whatsoever i wish you the best of luck with the rest of your pregnancy i'm sure it will be a very healthy successful happy pregnancy with a perfect little cutie once it's all over with if you need anything else feel free to email me i have an month old and another on the way take care Smallpox Miscarriage Pregnancy Measles Ebola Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct EastEnders Childbirth Menstrual cycle Abortion debate Breastfeeding Autism Cytomegalovirus Obstetrics Abortion in the United States Prostate cancer Group A streptococcal infection Abortion AIDS Milton H.
