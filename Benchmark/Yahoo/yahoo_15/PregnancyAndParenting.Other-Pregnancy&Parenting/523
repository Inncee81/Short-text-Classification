should i have a baby by a woman who already has a child with another man ok here is the situation i was in a relationship with this female about years ago we didn't end on a bad note or anything we just lost contact for a long time she recently came back into my life when she saw me she told me that she had been trying to find me and that she still loved me she also kissed me in public i told her i loved her and missed her too anyways i understand that after our relationship ended she had a child by another man baby is a year old she told me that she doesn't deal with him anymore and she wished i was the father of her child instead now i have had plenty of women in my time but i always told myself that if i ever wanted to have a child it would have to be with her the problem that i need an answer to is would that be too much of a problem to follow through and have a child with her or should i move on and find another woman to start a family with please give me honest answers because i don't want to make a mistake p s i'm years old she is your story kinda hits home with me let me take you down a little path from the past my finace and i have been together for years soon after dating he got a phone call from a starnge girl that he hardly had any memory of turns out she was a girl he had a one night stand with a few months prior to us getting together she was pregnant and tracked him down wanted to let him know it's been a rough road she is a hard person to deal with and in fact had cheated on her boyfriend with my finacee and ended up pregnant they broke up but started dating again right before she was due to have the baby he would never come to events that i or my finacee were at because it was too hard for him he wished the child was his and i actually saw them in public several times where he was playing daddy to the child my finace was furious anyways being with a person who has a child is very hard it's even harder if the other parent is still involved but the parents don't get along my situation you are lucky that the father isn't involved you don't have to deal with that stress one of my best friends got married a few years ago and she has a child with another man the man wasn't involved and the man she ended up marrying actually adopted the child as his own after the wedding if you guys are as serious as you say and are in love and you end up together and getting married you can adopt the current child as your own just because the child isn't blood to you doesn't mean you can't love it as a biological parent would it also doesn't mean that you and the girl can't have children of your own EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neighbours Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart The Ashlee Simpson Show Something Positive Good Times Shaggy dog story George Costanza Cliff Richard Luke and Laura Spencer Pitaten Miss Saigon Social rule Phoebe Halliwell Billboard Hot 100 History of As the World Turns (2000-present) About a Boy Avenue Q Sin City Everwood One Life to Live Sex and the City Fathers' rights Days of our Lives The Lovely Bones Boston Public Polyamory Past characters (Neighbours) Charmed Incarnations of Immortality Hollyoaks The Fairly OddParents Another World (TV series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Theory of conduct Jennifer Lopez Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Mina Mongoose Leo Wyatt Futurama (TV series - season 5) Transactional analysis Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Human Stain My Parents are Aliens Poker jargon Blood on the Tracks The O.C.
