sorry another circumcision question for you that have circumsized your son's i am weeks pregnant with a little boy and plan on doing it i was just wondering is it hard to take care of afterward or is it like the umbilical cord in a way i have a daughter so i know about that do you have to do anything special so that it doesn't stick to the diaper when do they do it i am being very serious i just wanted to hear some experiences i want it done and we are getting it done i'm just having mixed feelings on that hurting him the last thing i want is something to hurt my son right after he's born it's very easy to take care of you really don't have to mess with it much the cap will fall off in a few weeks they do it the same day or the day after your baby is born you might put a little ky jelly on it to help it from sticking to the diaper but only if your doctor tells you to it will hurt him but only for a moment they put your baby in a special chair and strap him down so he doesn't move much then the put a numbing gel on his private so it's not that bad he will cry but after you can pick him up and comfort him he will be fine the whole process takes less than minutes good luck with everything and congrats on the baby boy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Breastfeeding Frankie Laine Friends Infantilism Jon Secada Pregnancy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth Blood on the Tracks Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Pitaten Strap-on dildo The Inside Time Out of Mind The Shining (film) Diaper Professional wrestling match types Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Milton H.
