what is suitable access to a young baby and what is right was left at three months pregnant and have not seen partner since two months before birth he asked to be involved with a series of demand like being at the birth etc even though he was dating other women who were not aware of the child coming i suggest to show commitment he pay towards prams cots and essentials he refused he turned up with i was in hospital demanding his rights when i was in the high dependecy unit the nurses refused as the by nature it is very selfish he has refused to pay any maintenance and even denies paternity in a quest to delay paying and revenge for not naming him on birth certificate but he was uncontactable and does not give me his address or occupation as he has moved he wants access what is the correct time and protocol for this do i provide all the equipment etc for him even though he does not pay a penny he never even bought a present for the baby should i buy them for my baby kidding on they are from his dad who supplys the car seat for his car im asking this as i know so many of you are let the father see the child regardless of whether he fufils his responsibilities i am on the understanding he want to see the baby when he mum and nan visits only for someone to entertain them with i would not let him have what he wants unless he commits himself perhaps you couls force him to take a paternity test before you let himanywhere near the baby this will not only shut his lying mouth but give you legal ammunition to ensure that he does his duty in regards to supporting your child until he sees that he is the father and behaves like a rational human he should not get closer than a pane of glass away from your baby if he has any legal rights he has legal responsibilities and vice verse of course you might want to ask yourself if the potential financial support is worth putting up with such a cad he is obviously a lying manipulative freak either he thinks that he is the father or he does not if he does not he would not be demanding 'his rights' if he does he has no business ducking his responsibility personally he does not sound like the sort i would want around my child EastEnders Breastfeeding Knots Landing Father Fathers' rights Alois Hitler Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus In vitro fertilisation Divorce Fathers' rights movement in the UK Pregnancy Marriage About a Boy Abortion debate Abortion in the United States Estoppel Paternalism Baby transport One Tree Hill (TV series) Hillary Rodham Clinton Friends Transsexuality Childbirth Humphrey Bogart Incarnations of Immortality National Kidney Foundation Singapore SCO-Linux controversies Phoebe Halliwell Corporate governance Rais massacre Microeconomics Motion picture rating system Nurse Plame affair Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005 Nuclear proliferation Keynesian economics Rosa Parks Cyprus dispute Same-sex marriage Person Sharon Tate Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Kyoto Protocol History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Kodocha Warren Buffett Unemployment Objectivist philosophy Information warfare Appeal Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Extreme Programming Vernon Schillinger Sin City Adoption Coercion Advertising Expert system Infantilism Simone Weil Midwifery John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Hera Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Family name History of British nationality law Hollyoaks 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Corporation Public transport Diana, Princess of Wales Bene Gesserit Days of our Lives Child custody Legal aspects of transsexualism Yusuf al-Qaradawi Polygamy Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Wheel of Fortune Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Medical record Life insurance United Nations Protection Force The Inside Paternity George Galloway Terri Schiavo Social rule Civil unions in the United Kingdom Cornelia Rau Coeliac disease Eddie Guerrero 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Parliament of the United Kingdom Past characters (Neighbours)
