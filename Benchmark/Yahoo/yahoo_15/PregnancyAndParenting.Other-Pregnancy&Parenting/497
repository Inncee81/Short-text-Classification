should my daughter who is pregnant continue with her college schedule i've advised her to continue on and not quit facing the difficulties that are ahead of her even though she's going to have it tough for a period of time in the end she'll come out on top but i suggested to take online courses to make it easier on her for when her son arrives would anyone take this approach yes kudos to you for giving her good advice as long as her health permits she should keep taking classes and try to take as many credits before the kid arrives i used to teach when i was in grad school and it was really hard for people to get back in the swing of things if they've been out of school for more than a year or so my advice as a former lecturer would be to stay in school and keep taking classes even if it's just one online class my advice as an economist is to stay in school and keep taking classes since the kid would benefit from the mom's increased income and social status more than it would from spending extra hours a day with her Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Breastfeeding Education in Japan Daylight saving time Education in the United States Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany Education in Portugal Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME The Adventures of Pete & Pete Avenue Q Kodocha Aerial (dance move) Charmed Capitalism Unemployment Education Alexander Technique Game programming Humphrey Bogart Teachers (film) Community college Recess (TV series) Tag University of Houston College Marriage Juris Doctor Girls Aloud DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Prostate cancer Education in Romania Economics Volleyball Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Saved by the Bell The Amazing Race Alternative medicine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hearing impairment Economic inequality Grade (education) Secondary education in the United States Progressive tax Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Friends Columbia University Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Gross domestic product Emergency Medical Services Master's degree Franklin D.
