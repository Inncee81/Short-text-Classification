using gimp to turn a pic into a sketch i am at this site http www gimp org tutorials photo to sketch and im stuck on number they have those five options masked highpass and etc but mine only has one in there and i cant figure it out will someone help or at least give me a site that teaches easier y'know it's kind of a shame that someone puts the effort into such a nice tutorial and doesn't bother to step through it themselves they omitted some obvious steps or at least glossed over them when you get to step and you see those options that you mention those are layers if you're not familiar with the concept each layer is like a perfectly clear sheet of paper that you draw on and they're all stacked together for the complete picture layers on top cover lower layers the bottom layer is the 'background' layer and as it has nothing underneath it it has no need for anything to be transparent so it's not that's what they mean by alpha each pixel in a picture has a certain amount of transparency and if it's transparent i e it has an 'alpha' then the layers beneath it are visible when the author says 'make a copy' he means 'make a copy of the layer' right click on a layer and choose duplicate layer if you click on the eye next to a layer it turns it on and off visible invisible be careful that you're on the layer you want to work on you can also delete the background layer or put a layer beneath it i suggest you try using some of the gimp forums for questions like this you might get a better response PNG Traditional animation GIMP Windows XP Mouse (computing) Stereoscopy 2D computer graphics Gramophone record Macromedia Flash Poker jargon Rendering (computer graphics) Internet protocol suite Wireless Application Protocol Photographic film Minesweeper (computer game) HTTP cookie Opportunity rover IPod Mozilla Firefox Domain Name System Gaia Online Philosophy of language Screenshot Translation Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Redundant array of independent disks Independent Media Center Glacier History of the graphical user interface HyperText Transfer Protocol Inkscape Brewery On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences XML GIF Mattress EIA-708 Halo: Combat Evolved Uniform Resource Locator Ice core Cascading Style Sheets JPEG Geographic information system Netfilter/iptables HyperCard Humphrey Bogart Nintendo 64 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Morse Code Solar cell Theory of conduct Windows Vista Digital photography Slashdot subculture DVD Dance Dance Revolution Ethernet Scene graph Expert system Liquid crystal display Moir__ pattern Extreme Programming Mars Stairway Windows 2000 Nintendo DS PostScript Knoppix Manifold OpenBSD Virtual memory Mach kernel Quest for Glory Ajax (programming) Transport layer Glass Deconstruction BitTorrent C plus plus Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Sea ice Cheating in poker Copy protection Olduwan Solar variation One-time pad City of Heroes Floppy disk Common Unix Printing System Super Nintendo Entertainment System Solar eclipse Beatmania IIDX PHP
