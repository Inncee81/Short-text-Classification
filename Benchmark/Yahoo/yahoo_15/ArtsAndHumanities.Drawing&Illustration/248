dilemma which idea do i pick for a comic graphic novel for university i need a portfilio to show i can draw even though i want to do computer animation you still need to be able to draw because thats where all the planning is done but i want to demonstrate my abilities as an artist to show i can do more than just a picture and that i understand visual concepts as well so im putting together a comic graphic novel or the starts of really to show i understand these concepts but i keep hitting this brick wall of what to do i have tons of ideas but i cant figure out which one would be best or if you have suggestions yourself of an idea im open to it hopefully if finish something ill put in on the net to read on yahoo or myspace when its done but dont hold your breathe its going take a while rite the ideas a man troop caught up in world war a pair of assasins in a distopian future city trying to make a living a group of university students animated drawn diaries or any of your own suggestions will help as well more details no problem the man troop are complied by guys and girl the troop leader was an us army ranger until the us had sanction placed on them by the un and so had their forces over to nato of the guys one black chilled out kind of raver and one white slightly nerdy guy are drafted by the britsh army to work for nato as they have special talents as soldiers the girl who is also british joins willingly she was training to be a sniper but it got cut short due to demand set the are all sent to hong kong on request from the hong kong government from the chinese armed forces the second is of a guy who hjas turned to crime due to the murder of his family recently he not seeking revenge but is trying to relieve his hatred of all criminals the other is a girl who was going to become a doctor but was landed with a criminal record she started to make a living as a hacker but kind of becomes interested in this guy who is an assasin its set in the future around in a world of complete dominance by corperations and the criminal underworld where i dont know yet the last one is meant to be a bit of a sitcom but drawn instead between university students who leave in a shared apartment the characters are boys and girls guy is layed back and chilled out but very intelligent guy is shy and nervous particually around girls but is an animator the last guy is a dj that is a bit to loud and over confindent girl is also intelligent but is quite dull she doesnt want to do to much in one go girl is also shy and the shy guy fancies her and she fancies him but both are to sacre to ask the other out the last girl is intelligent but slow so a lot of the humour is derived from her not being all their even though she is smart if you want some great distopian future stuff i've always found that you don't need a whole lot of action a lot of the great graphic novels about that kind of stuff are actually more mystery thirllers i would stay away from guns and explosions myself what if your second and first ideas were somehow combined and it was about how completely screwed the future corporate governments are while they are waginging war on eachother i think if these soldiers were members of some kind of underground resistance rather than assasins it would add another layer of depth to their characters a good assasination plot against whoever theis head ceo president person is would be intersting i love totolitarian future government type stuff anything from orwell's to the manga for akira wuld be good refference material try to do something interesting viusally too maybe a limited color palate or lots of full spread images it's not just about the story but how it flows i'm sure if you're making a graphic novel you have an interest so i won't tell you how to do your art you may also want to pick up understanding comics by scott mccloud it's like a text book for comic book graphic novel artists it was amazingly helpful to me even after college classes Manga Comics Ghost in the Shell Sin City Aerial (dance move) Hentai Sonic the Hedgehog Grant Morrison City Hunter Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus War Friends Computer animation Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Ultimate Spider-Man Star Wars Punisher Nerd The Catcher in the Rye M16 (rifle) Drill bit Digimon DC Comics Theory of conduct The Scout Association of Hong Kong Neil Gaiman Trigun United States Army KaBlam!
