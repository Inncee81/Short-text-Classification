can i become a manga artist even though im spanish american i've been drawing since preschool seriously and im years old im a very great artist and since rd grade i've been learning how to draw manga now im going to seventh grade and im a little more serious about drawing and nervous i asked my self many questions untill it came to one that brought down my confidence in becoming a manga ka will i be accepted as a manga ka even though im spanish or from america please answer t t im losing confidence here and i need some answers t t ok thanks if answer d it depends are you looking to be a manga artist in the us or japan the two biggest markets if japan or another asian country where is popular like korea or china obviously you'll need to learn that native language there's a high percentage of manga artisits in these countries but for the most part they're assistants and they get worked like dogs but it can lead to bigger better things the main thing is to keep drawing and then attend an art school you may have natural talent but school will teach you the more technical details of the art business i e perspective storyboarding storylines etc school is also a great place to make connections with people in the industry and will help you get a foot in the door you may also want to consider putting yourself out there as much as possible you can do this by putting up a portfolio of your work on line or maybe starting a web comic of some sort remember the more work you put out there the more likely someone will see your work and maybe hire you who knows you may even develop a following on line and be able to support yourself off of your own projects you wouldn't be the first one to do this Manga Comics Education in the United States Education in Taiwan Education in the People's Republic of China Yu-Gi-Oh!
