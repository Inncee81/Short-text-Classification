how do you judge a manga i heard that some people judge a manga by their drawing style or how tidy the drawing are i don't know which of them are the best frankly speaking i don't really care much about the drawing style it's the plot that gets me no matter how beautiful the drawings are if the story's all cliche then it's no use however a brilliant mix of the story plot including the flow of the story and the artwork would be the best criteria in judging a manga Manga Megatokyo Anime Hentai Transactional analysis Time Out of Mind Ghost in the Shell Trigun InuYasha Maria-sama ga Miteru Dragon Ball Comics Harry Potter Judge Dredd Mary Sue Urusei Yatsura Mamoru Oshii Rurouni Kenshin Seramyu CG artwork Pitaten Academic art One Piece Chobits Gekiga Yu-Gi-Oh!
