am a male and my age will be on september what diet and exercise is required to grow height am now i don't believe there to be miracle food and exercise program that will guarantee height growth however the healthier you eat the easier it is for your body to absorb what it needs making you healthier and more prone to reaching physical goals a low sugar high fiber protein diet is a good start avoid sweets and greasy type fats and instead focus on getting a pleantiful amount of fruits vegetables meats yogurt brown rice hard boiled eggs nuts seeds avocados and fish will give you powerful doses of omega fatty acids which are good and you should take a multi vitamin in addition to eating meals a day you should attempt to eat a hearty snack in between those meals oh and drink tons of water this oxygenates your cells and helps them out take half your weight and that should be the number of ounces that you drink of water a day so if you're lbs you should drink ounces of water a day or more as far as excersice any activity that elevates your heart rate for a sustained period of at least minutes is good you might try running biking hiking i think any pysical activity is beneficial the number one thing you can to do promote height is to get a lot of sleep it's only when you sleep that your body produces processes growth hormone if you're not sleeping enough it makes it difficult for you body to achieve this also if you're on ritalin or smoke try to cut back or find alternatives because those both can stunt growth i know quite a few people who stay at a certain height until they're and then suddenly grow by leaps and bounds a lot of this is genetic and only a small portion is based on what you do physically or dietary but if you get a lot of sleep eat healthy and exercise moderately you'll be giving your body all the armor you can to aid in the growth process Omega-3 fatty acid Healthy eating Hypoglycemia Coronary heart disease Food Weight training Insulin Milk Folic acid Atherosclerosis Alcoholic beverage Bodybuilding Prostate cancer Vegetarian nutrition Fecal incontinence Egg (food) Vitamin C Puberty Obesity Tooth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Crohn's disease Hamster Breakfast Cancer Anorexia nervosa Food guide pyramid Breastfeeding Vitamin Low-carbohydrate diet Diabetes mellitus Organic food Soybean Peanut Food preservation Sleep Nutrient Fancy rat Cheese South Beach diet Stomach cancer Ramen Vitamin D Glycogen storage disease type I Colorectal cancer Bread Chronic fatigue syndrome Protein Cuisine of Denmark Raw food diet Agriculture Alzheimer's disease Guinea pig Chicken Tofu German cuisine Urinary incontinence Cuisine of the Southern United States Tooth enamel Cuisine of Malaysia Soul food Rice Chocolate Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sugar substitute Hamburger Oily fish Dog Human height Coeliac disease Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Brazil Jewish cuisine Caffeine Cholesterol Genetically modified food Domestic rabbit Growth hormone treatment Fugu Protein-energy malnutrition Chlorophyta Cocaine Watermelon Osteoporosis Antioxidant Anemia Alcohol fuel
