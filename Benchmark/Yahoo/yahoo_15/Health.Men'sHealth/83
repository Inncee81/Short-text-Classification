is it good or bad to masturbate with no lube if not ok where can i get a lube at store what are they called it isn t necessarily bad tro masturbate with no lube even if you are circumcised but if circumcised it does tend to create a lot fo friction between yoru hand and the glans head which may be uncomfortable as well that much freiction on a regular basis can 'toughen up' the glans and make it less sensitive so if you are circumcised or have foreskin but retract it out of the way for masturbatrion i would suggest applying a nice lubrication to make things glide more easily as for what to use there are many commercial products available for lubrication ky probably being the most widely known but if you aren't quite up to buying one of the store bought lubes check out the kitchen for suitable substitutes personally i think extra virgin olive oil is great but any liquid vegetable oil will do the trick very smoothly some swear by vaseline others by baby oil just don't use soaps or shapmoos since they are actually abrasive and can harm the sensitive head of the penis oh don't use an oil based lube when having sex they will damage the condom Masturbation Penis Condom Oral sex Foreskin Phimosis Motor oil Medical analysis of circumcision Glans penis Anal sex Strap-on dildo Gliding action Smegma Circumcision Human sexual behavior Human sexuality Sex toy Foreskin restoration Gay slang History of male circumcision Safe sex Prostitution Friction Ridged band Female genital cutting Violin Sexual arousal Menstrual cup Breastfeeding Balanitis Tire Infant baptism Lionel Corporation Social rule Thermal power station Birth control Drill bit Circumcision advocacy Biodiesel Manual transmission Petroleum Child sexuality Prostate cancer Sex organ Olive oil Plastic Intersex surgery Balanitis xerotica obliterans Microeconomics Penis removal Clitoris Soap Gross domestic product Hamster Pornography Frenulum Ceramics Explosive material Mouse (computing) Kyle Broflovski Anal masturbation Theory of conduct Margarine Handloading Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vulva Fisting Kosher foods Sexual abstinence Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Child sexual abuse Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Diesel Kashrut Cervical cancer Capital accumulation Genital integrity Upholstery Glycerin Equine conformation Floppy disk Die (manufacturing) Fire extinguisher Child pornography Knife Erection Essential oil Virgin Grease (lubricant) Motion picture rating system Textile manufacturing Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Eastern Orthodox Church Ice cream Gramophone record Hypospadias
