why many kids start playing instruments and go into their adulthood with no carpal tunnel while some of us who kind of did that piano since young computer since aged and now age we are suffering with bad carpal ulnar nerve i find it interesting that many musicians i've seen do so much move their fingers so fast and it doesn't seem like they suffer from hand problems is it all about some people having good genes and some not having my mom has played the piano since she was in her preteens and the clarinet since she was in middle school she's now and doesn't that i know of suffer from any kind of hand injury although lately she said her left hand gets numb sometimes so maybe she does have it my dad played trumpet in school and even had an office job for a few years he doesn't complain about anything like that i am worried about typing though i've always been kind of paranoid about stuff like that i try to keep my hands shaken out and not type for more than minutes at a time unless i'm doing a report or something so hopefully we won't all go around wearing hand braces from using keyboards Carpal tunnel syndrome Repetitive strain injury Clarinet Carpal tunnel Equine conformation Sergei Prokofiev Fast bowling Peripheral nervous system Piano Wrist Adolescence Nerve conduction velocity Carpus Traumatic brain injury Humphrey Bogart Transposing instrument Volleyball Metacarpus Harmonic series (music) Shaggy dog story Brian Jones (musician) Self Portrait 1957 World Series Anatomical terms of location Double bass Prostate cancer Pet Sounds Trumpet Mouse (computing) Player piano Musical works of Mozart Sun Ra Teachers (film) The Fairly OddParents Blonde on Blonde Ben Johnson (athlete) Marching band Hornbostel-Sachs Musician Harp Dixieland Social rule Pitaten Radiohead Spina bifida Acupuncture Saxophone Bitches Brew Intelligence quotient Black Sabbath Massage Cleveland Browns Musical ensemble Blues Concerto Doug String instrument Diabetic neuropathy Hey Jude Brachial plexus Game controller Timpani Recurring South Park characters Lil Hardin Armstrong Aerial (dance move) Songwriter Chick Corea Anton Webern Hamate bone Charles Mingus Sin City Accordion Musical Instrument Digital Interface Finger The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Whose Line Is It Anyway?
