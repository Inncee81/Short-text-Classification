is my workout schedule ok i workout days a week doing mainly weight training the reason why i can continue doing heavy weight training that many days in a row is because i swtich off between pushing muscles and pulling muscles everyday i also run times a week in the mornings and bike a lot to train my legs anyway i read on the internet that hours of rest is sufficent between workouts if i isolate the muscle groups well enough i believe i can aviod stress on areas i'm not working out in other words i can work out everyday and still get about hours of rest for that muscle group since i workout at pm everyday the math works out that way by the way i get sore but i'm not in pain and can put up my maxium weights each session so i don't feel like i'm harming my body do you think this workout plan is ok i love going to the gym but some people think i need more rest if you're a semi serious weight lifter or trainer i would appreciate your advice yeah your work out plan is awesome thats really smart i honestly dont think it hurts you to work out the same muscle groups daily i do it i lift days a week and always do exactly the same workouts and i havent hurt my self yet ive been doing it for yrs but its better to play it safe if your body isnt used to it but naa your work out program is great nice schedueling Exercise Bodybuilding Triathlon Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Equine conformation Marathon (sport) Swimming Babe Ruth Childbirth Bon Jovi Professional wrestling holds Clinical depression Muscle Diving Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Clean and jerk Fecal incontinence Andr__s Galarraga Bicycle The Adventures of Pete & Pete Weightlifting Massage Boxing training Running Horse Sport rowing Jon Secada Deadlift Self-harm WCW Power Plant Glossary of climbing terms Theory of conduct Stress fracture Post Polio syndrome Anorexia nervosa Local anesthesia Milton H.
