british accents do you have some trouble to understand each other hi i was wondering if english people have some trouble to understand scottish people or welsh people and mutually definitely yes some accents in the british isles are very strong with specific regional dialect words that are not commonly known outside the area where they are used i find it can be very difficult to understand the broad geordie newcastle tyneside ne england the glasgow accent can be complete gobbledegook to every one except another glaswegian i once had a girlfriend from east wall dublin a charming irish coleen but i would get rather embarrassed when i'd ask her for the third time to repeat what she had just said because i could not understand her accent and the belfast dialect 'wadeeowdynaee' can be translated as 'what do i do now' to end there is the famous cockney accent from east london with its rhyming slang and the sing song liverpuddlian accent from liverpool that is delightful to hear but sometime very difficult to understand eg 'gorra cob onyer avyer ' can be translated as 'are you in a bad mood ' this rich variety of british accents may be disappearing to be replaced by 'estuary english' heard on british tv the 't' has been completey abolished 'b er' for 'better' etc and the short anomatopaeic anglo saxon words are becoming much more popular in every day speech a living language changes but i hope the rich variety of regional british accents will survive English English English language American English Geordie Languages in the United Kingdom Australian English Hiberno-English United Kingdom Cockney West Country dialects Germanic languages Cockney rhyming slang Old English language Non-native pronunciations of English Southern American English History of the English language German language Mandarin (linguistics) Dutch language Swedish language Slang Quebec French Standard Mandarin Ulster Scots language Dialect New York-New Jersey English Danish language Celt English-language vowel changes before historic r Greek language British Isles Irish language Singlish New Zealand English British English Polish language Yorkshire dialect and accent Varieties of Arabic British Isles (terminology) Scottish Gaelic language American and British English differences Esperanto Dictionary Northern Ireland Scouse Subjunctive mood Trap-bath split Boston accent Dialects of Mandarin Glasgow Chinese spoken language Offensive terms per nationality Acute accent Languages in Star Wars Welsh language Wales South Tyneside African American Vernacular English Scots language Slovak language Formal written English - regional differences Portuguese language Cornish language Wars of the Three Kingdoms South East England Newfoundland English Scanger Brummie Sanskrit Culture of the United Kingdom Australian English phonology Slovenian language Anglo-Saxon literature Standard Cantonese Old Norse language Canadian English French language Hindustani language Hungarian language Spanish language Grave accent Proto-Germanic language Hebrew language Welsh English Arabic language Newcastle United F.C.
