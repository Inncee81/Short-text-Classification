is french a hard language to learn im taking it next year as a freshmen and im just wondering if im going to have a hard time learning it so far i speak english and only english it's not so bad i took it for all four years of high school and enjoyed it my problem is that the last two years were independent study so i have very bad habits when it comes to pronounciation french i is just the basics and may not seem that important but retain this information keep a notebook and alway save your basic verbs and more importantly the basic conjugations spelling sorry if you continue to pursue french it is important to have those basic forms solid in your mind as your knowledge of french grows you'll see that all the basics are tweaked later for different sentence structures and whatnot which can confuse you greatly if you aren't certain of the basics i would recommend going to the cheapbins at stores and looking for dvds that have french as subtitles some even have french audio tracks you can mix and match the audio with the subtitles and it will help it helps more if it's some movie that you've never even heard of you don't make assumptions on what is going to be said good luck email me if you'd like a little more discussion on the matter English grammar Esperanto as an international language German language Non-native pronunciations of English Greek language Spanish verbs Korean language Slovak language English language French language Interlingua Shit Quebec French German grammar Dutch language Grammatical aspect Gerund Burmese language Science Newfoundland English Japanese language English verbs Japanese grammar Singlish Translation Hungarian language Transformational grammar Scientology beliefs and practices Second language acquisition DVD Philosophy of language Theory of conduct Audio commentary (DVD) Polish language Education in the United States T-V distinction Chinese grammar AmigaOS Student History of philosophy Indian English Morphology (linguistics) Future tense French verbs Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Manually Coded English Cognitive science Closed captioning Hearing impairment A Course In Miracles Copy protection African American Vernacular English Linguistics Object-oriented programming Computer virus Hiberno-English XML George Lakoff Japanese honorifics MP3 Notable lines in the Star Wars series Sindarin American Sign Language Quotation mark Martial art Danish language Education Thai language West Germanic strong verb Sesotho language Romance languages Speech synthesis Cornish language Ludwig Wittgenstein Procrastination Graduate school Sanskrit Logic Bislama Final Fantasy magic Philosophy of mathematics Irregular verb Social rule Subtitle Welsh language Inflection Cantonese (linguistics) Persian language Pitaten Subjunctive mood Dubbing (filmmaking) Grammatical gender Laserdisc
