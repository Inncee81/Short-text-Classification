what language should i study now just studied spanish i'm thinking either german french or chinese other ones russian japanese arabic german and french are used widely throughout the european continent after english they are the de facto languages of the eu either of those would be worthwhile personally i recommend german it's widely spoken in both west and east europe including ex soviet republics whereas french is limited a little bit more to west europe arabic is supposedly extremely easy to learn to speak but extremely difficult to learn to write it can be a very useful language however and has an immense vocabulary that lends itself to flowery poetic language you will also be able to communicate with most of the muslim world including many african and south asian countries if you know arabic japanese and chinese are reputedly difficult both to speak and write but would be very useful russian is difficult but not terribly so the biggest jump is not the new alphabet which is admittedly hard to pick up especially as russian words tend to get really long but all the case endings there are like of them and they all start to blur together after a while russian also has obscure pronunciation rules like english does so what a word looks like is not always what it will sound like German language Non-native pronunciations of English Russian language Chinese language Spanish language Arabic language Esperanto as an international language Esperanto Latin alphabet Dutch language Finnish language Japanese language Africa Cyrillic alphabet Arabic alphabet Afrikaans Korean language Nationalism Urdu Jewish languages Ukrainian language Hebrew language Tatar language Diacritic Germanic languages Portuguese language Old English language Vowel Alphabet Central Asia Hindi Taiwanese (linguistics) Vietnamese language French language Polish language Danish language Varieties of Arabic Russia Languages in the United States Pinyin Keyboard layout Linguistics Aramaic language Mutually intelligible languages Phoneme Creole language Languages of Hong Kong Greek language Romanization Interlingua Japanese writing system Simplified Chinese character Turkic peoples Chinese character Coptic language Grammatical gender Speech synthesis English as a lingua franca for Europe Egyptian language Classical Chinese Cantonese (linguistics) Standard Mandarin Kanji Jew Standard Cantonese United Nations Security Council Tatars Persian language Indonesian language Spelling reform Passport Belarusian language Translation Dictionary Chinese written language Hanja Old French Slovenian language Ido England Singapore Arab world Basque language Transliteration African American Vernacular English Black (people) Norwegian language English English Latin spelling and pronunciation International Phonetic Alphabet Poetry Swedish language Lingua franca
