why do people ask the wrong questions at fast food places subway pizza shops etc they ask for here or to go when they are really asking whether you want it in a bag or not i eat and run i don't eat it there and i don't need a bag so if i answer honestly its to go they stuff it in a bag which i don't want its inconvenient wasteful polluting if i tell them to go but with no bag they're all confused why can't they just ask in a bag or no bag which is really the info they're asking another example someone asked me if i go to work saturday i answered no then my car gets blocked in the driveway why do people ask wrong questions they should ask do you need to go out then yes and my car wouldn't be blocked in people are so stuck in their routines and their standard questions expecting standard answers i should be able to answer their question and the results went right otherwise why ask the wrong questions it's a standardized society with standardized rules behaviors actions reactions processes phrases and attitudes not a good thing that's the way the every day us operates more because of convenience saving time and getting more things done than because of efficiency or accuracy people ask the wrong questions because they are pre programmed to do so by a wrong and illogical learning process based on general practice as opposed to logic and coherence applied differently for each individual situation so most americans become like robots saying the very same idiomatic expressions albeit wrong ones asking and responding almost like pre recorded tracks and having no minds of their own because being different unique or special simply means being impractical in modern society so in order to help you have less trouble dealing with your automaton human partners please you too act like a robot without an individual identity yourself and accept and use everyday's illogical terms like to go do you have the time and so many other incoherent expressions that everybody treat as coherent because everybody else uses them and that's the practical thing to do Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Ethics Criticism of libertarianism CPU cache Scientology beliefs and practices Logic Economics Goodness and value theory Social psychology Theodicy Determinism Social rule Expert system Consensus decision-making Ontological argument Postmodernism Euphemism Artificial intelligence Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Plame affair Psychology Epistemology Abortion debate Lie Objectivist philosophy Property (ownership right) Coercion Moral relativism Religion Halakha Indian English Confucianism Stuttering A Course In Miracles Philosophy of language Religious Society of Friends Translation Genetic algorithm Irony Cultural relativism Computer Meaning of life Milton H.
