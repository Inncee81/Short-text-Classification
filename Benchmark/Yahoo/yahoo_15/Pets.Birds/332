how manys time a year dos cockatiels lay eggs i have her years this st year she has laid them about months she laid for the st time and in the last weeks she laid another i have no male for the sake of your cockatiel may i suggest you switch her routine move her cage to another spot if possible make it a point to weekly switch around the toys and perches in her cage cockatiels hate changes but making changes now can very well end up saving her life as this stress beneficial in this case should reduce her desire to lay eggs she needs this done just as soon as possible so she will stop laying those eggs each egg depletes her calcium level physically stresses her badly and you run the risk of having an egg bound hen that condition can kill her don't remove the eggs immediately after your cockatiel lays them even though you know they're not fertile let her sit on them and tend them for about weeks or until she loses interest in the eggs if you remove the eggs before that time period odds are she's going to produce even more eggs and end up in more medical danger if you can get her to an avian vet and tell the vet what you've told us you'd be doing your bird a huge favor the vet will probably order a complete exam and take it from there so you'll have your friend for a long time to come Cockatiel Egg (food) Acne Gypsy moth Egg (biology) Bird Ostrich Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Stroke Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus John Cage Ladybird Infertility Kakapo Theory of conduct Infantilism Carbon dioxide Abortion Diseases of the honeybee Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mach kernel Factory farming Organic food Garfield Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Cock (chicken) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual reproduction Colorectal cancer Vegetarianism Kodocha Nile crocodile Leatherback Sea Turtle Traumatic incident reduction Atherosclerosis Psychosis Insulin Omega-3 fatty acid Eric Bischoff Pet skunk Obstetrics Pysanka Parthenogenesis Tai Chi Chuan Prostate cancer Ozone depletion Twin Glucocorticoid Psoriasis Equine conformation Albatross Platypus Childbirth Breastfeeding Eggerland series Hamster Veganism Ferret Education in Australia Pregnancy Medical analysis of circumcision Fire fighting HIV test Biological pest control Tooth enamel Characters in Bleach series Ionizing radiation Stem cell H5N1 Schizophrenia Ocean's Twelve In vitro fertilisation Folic acid Life insurance American lobster Migraine Dog Abortion debate Spider Spanish flu Gulf War syndrome Ozone hole Stuttering Beetle Minor Harry Potter Beasts Hikikomori Suicide Myocardial infarction Weed control Eddie Guerrero Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory A-level Chronic fatigue syndrome
