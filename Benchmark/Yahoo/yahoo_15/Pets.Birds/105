what possible reason could a lovebird have for regurgitating food i've two great and loveable lovebirds though i thought one might be a little unhealthy as she he continously fluffy his her feathers however it seems to be an normal practice with fluffy and she he seems perfect in every other way alert eating well very nimble and pooping fine recently fluffy and rodger though now i'm not so sure got a new lease of life and are allowed to leave their cage and make full use of the our living room however over the past week or so fluffy not very regulary regurgitates some of her his food and feeds it to rodger i've read that this is a mating ritatule by the male of the species however things are not adding up i always thought fluffy was a female rodger is larger much more protective and seems to be leader do female lovebirds regurgitate or is it only males if so then i've my naming wrong since given the extra freedom could this bring about more mating desires they have a nest box which i've always given them to sleep in first of all the female lovebirds tend to be bigger than the male second the female might feed a male or another female as well as a male feeding the female or another male i have lovebirds and have seen it all happen unless you get them dna sexed you wont know my mother in law bought a boy and girl who turned out to be boys you might have a couple or boys girls and the free flying is good for them the nest box on the other hand will make them want to breed not sleep Bird Hamster Albatross Red Squirrel Spider The Birds (film) Chicken Guinea pig Ostrich Platypus Mountain Gorilla Koala Emu Life in the Freezer Ant Eric Cartman Garfield Tarantula Auk RuneScape quests Lovebird Sesshomaru Gray Wolf Falconry Bird migration Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Shark Kangaroo Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Orca Capercaillie Cat Non-human animal sexuality Friends Liger Tsetse fly Monogamy Bee Sexual reproduction Spoonbill Fancy rat Cliff Richard Futurama (TV series - season 5) Infantilism Sexual attraction Miss Saigon Livestock Chuck Cunningham syndrome House Mouse Elephant 2005 trial of Michael Jackson K' Mealy Parrot Great Teacher Onizuka Mallard Poker jargon Chocobo Sexual dimorphism Sex Paper wasp Sea-Monkey Emperor Penguin Peafowl Canary Genetically modified food Wraith (Stargate) The Legend of Zelda series enemies Dairy Tasmanian Devil Same-sex marriage in Canada Sexual differentiation Kiwi Black-footed Albatross About a Boy Vomiting Mario W.I.T.C.H.
