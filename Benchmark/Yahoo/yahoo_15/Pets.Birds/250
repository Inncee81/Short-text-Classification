i have a questoin about birds and breeding i hav canaries who mated and had eggs but the male canary won't leave the female canary to tend to the eggs so the babies are dying would it be alright to remove the male after the eggs hav been laid yes you can remove the male female canaries do not count on their mates in raising the chicks as much as the parrot type birds do i never did breed canaries but was friends with many canary breeders and they regularly used the males basically for fertilizing the female kind of how dog and horse breeders put the male animals out for stud only i would not remove the male however until what you believe to be the last or near to last egg has been laid that should ensure that all the eggs will be fertile and the hen will remain ready to incubate hatch out and raise those chicks best of luck Chicken Bird Canary Ostrich Platypus Egg (biology) Emperor Penguin Rhea (bird) Emu Hybrid Egg (food) Mallard Osprey Albatross Capercaillie Sexual dimorphism Sexual reproduction Agriculture Non-human animal sexuality Seabird Bobwhite Quail Peregrine Falcon Life in the Freezer Bagworm moth Great Bustard Incubate (bird) Breed registry Condor Black-footed Albatross Dog American Robin Selective breeding Clownfish Queen bee American lobster Spider Malleefowl Livestock Dunnock Aphid Black Canary Estrus cycle Hermaphrodite Red-necked Phalarope Kiwi Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Fibonacci number Pet skunk Tarantula Pysanka Mixed-breed dog Kea Hamster Domestic rabbit Lion Bird migration In vitro fertilisation Red-cockaded Woodpecker Musk Duck Ruff Beetle Bee Monogamy Tuatara Tigon Factory farming Anopheles Cock (chicken) African Fish Eagle American Alligator Salmon Ovum Nile crocodile Gray Wolf Docking Horse racing Ladybird Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Puppy mill Penguin Plant breeding Red Junglefowl Infertility Canary Wharf Wilson's Phalarope Peafowl Rocko's Modern Life Laysan Albatross Dog breed Peppered moth ecology Mound-builders Gypsy moth Red Squirrel Domesticated turkey March of the Penguins Red Phalarope Species
