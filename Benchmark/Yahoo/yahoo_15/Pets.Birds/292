i can't get into my aviaries this is a bit of an odd question but i am having trouble feeding my aviary birds simply because when they see me approaching with the food container they ignore me if i don't have the container they all rush to the door my finches actually hover at the door and land against it my grass parakeets and quails stand on the ground at the door waiting my cockatiels and dove stand on the perches right at the door i can't get in with them all standing there argh i have to get my dad to hide the container then i go in and he quickly passes it to me any tips of working with this if i open the door with them all their waiting they might fly out by the way this is a few aviaries i have and with the same problem and i do feed them everyday a lot of aviaries i have seen have a double entry door system you open the first door enter a small area like a hallway or tiny room you close that door and open the door into the actual aviary if any birds get out they only get into the hallway when you are leaving you gently chase all of the birds back inside the main aviary and close that door and latch it securely and then you open the outside door and leave don't know how much room you have and if you would be able to build this little addition onto your aviaries but if you could it would stop escapes and you would be able to go in and out of the aviaries without having to wait for someone to help you Columbine High School massacre Airport The Marriage of Figaro RuneScape quests Shaggy dog story Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Bird migration Toronto Subway and RT Tick The Dalek Invasion of Earth StarCraft: Uprising Falconry Bird Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Phantom Manor Conspiracy (TNG episode) The Shining (film) Piccolo Junior Saga Aerial (dance move) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban G-Man (Half-Life) The Haunted Mansion Sento Trapping STS-61 Bird flight The Time Machine Futurama (TV series - season 5) Electrophysiology Hamster Richard Chase In-N-Out Burger The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Air safety Breastfeeding Diving Door Saw II Spider Star Trek: The Experience Parrot Sesotho language Fire fighting The Birds (film) Ferret Syphon Filter Natural Selection (computer game) Finch (TTC) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Colony in Space Seabird McMansion The Death Gate Cycle Mid-levels Jurassic Park III Operation Market Garden Combine (Half-Life 2) Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Parting of the Ways Elevator Castle Wars Boom Town (Doctor Who) Skateboarding trick Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Treehouse of Horror V Max Payne The Ark in Space USS Thresher (SS-200) Chicken Craps Kakapo Professional wrestling aerial techniques Kim Possible Syberia Escape from New York The Inside The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Floppy disk Norbert Wiener The Penultimate Peril Toyota Prius Shotgun house Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Legends of the Hidden Temple Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Doctor Who (Enemy Within) The Brady Bunch Changeroom Pyramids of Mars Domestic rabbit Monty Hall problem Property tax The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Sin City Capercaillie Jade Empire Eastern Illinois University Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Ultima Online
