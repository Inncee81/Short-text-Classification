who loves pet chickens i have four pet chickens and today was my rooster bon bon first birth day after raising them since they were chicks and lasting a whole enitre year with them i want to know how many people out there also have pet chickens and i would love to hear the silly things they did growing up yes i love them and it's nice to see that i'm not the only one i raise chickens and have had many that were pets the first chickens i ever got were really into pecking at people's moles and freckles when they were chicks they even pecked a mole completely off someone once it started bleeding it is easy to hypnotize a young chicken by laying it on the ground on its side in the dirt and drawing a line in the dirt slowly from the eye outwards the chick just lays there and stares at it for the longest time we gave them grapes when they got older and they would run around the yard for hours having fights over the grapes and chasing each other around then they would come and wait by the door for handouts you had to shove the chickens away every time you went in and out so they wouldn't come in the house another time two hens both went broody on huge clutches of eggs at the same time on both sides of the bed of my brother's pickup truck he made me move the nests i also enjoy going out into the chicken coop in the morning when they are laying eggs and watch how they chase each other from nest to nest for hours until the egg finally comes out one time there about hens all squashed in one nest box together at once they all laid eggs on top of each other Chicken Shaggy dog story Egg (biology) Egg (food) Emu The Pet Sounds Sessions Garfield Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Pet Sounds Animal communication Flea Fancy rat Kodocha 101 Dalmatians: The Series Jon Secada Malleefowl Chicken Run Friends Bird Albatross Sin City U.S. Acres Ocean's Twelve Pysanka Bon Jovi Platypus Domesticated turkey Time Out of Mind The Beach Boys Pickup truck Kakapo Shark Spidey Super Stories Hamster Dog agility Musk Duck Social rule Characters in the Smurfs Menstrual cycle Tag Seabird The chicken or the egg Factory farming Poker jargon Banjo-Kazooie Milton H.
