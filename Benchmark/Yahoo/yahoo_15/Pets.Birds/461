mccaw breeding i have a pair of b g mccaws they are both yrs old the female is tearing up newspaper in the bottom of her cage and also uses a bell on the end of a toy for her sexual pleasure are they to young to set them up for breeding and also what size nest box do they need where is a good site to view nest boxes for them thanks eileen http www petparrot com parrotsupplies htm you'll have to scroll down to view the macaw nest box these are pretty typical but we didn't like this style the size is comparable to a metal garbage can which are also used i built a x x pine box very coffin like with a wire panel in the bottom they chewed it up to their satisfaction and made a beautiful nest complete with babies if both of your macaws have been dna sexed so you're sure they're a breeding pair you could certainly set them up during the breeding cycle however they may become very territorial and even defend the nest against you assuming you are their primary caregiver it can also take them and you a few times to get it right' breeding birds have special diet requirements imbalances can lead to egg eating or eating the young so you'll need to do the research prior to breeding you'll also need to consider what you're going to do with the young keep them handfeed them more research and supplies might be needed if you decide you want to set them up i would see if there's a local breeder that would consider mentoring you through the process especially if you intend to handfeed and sell any babies Domestic rabbit Hamster Bird House Mouse Chicken Guinea pig Platypus Non-human animal sexuality Peregrine Falcon Albatross Infantilism Equine conformation Bee Dog Pet skunk Oscilloscope Mountain Gorilla Poker jargon Ferret Sexual reproduction Cat CPU cache Ant Quotation mark Nest box Drill bit Species Agriculture HTML element Fancy rat Leatherback Sea Turtle House Sparrow Tooth Koala Honeybee Nutrition Red Squirrel Osprey Milk Seabird Omega-3 fatty acid Compiler optimization Livestock Japanese tea ceremony Amstrad CPC Apple Brolga Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Bobwhite Quail The Origin of Species Red-bellied Macaw Ostrich Solar cell Chinchilla DNA Mealy Parrot Strap-on dildo Drosophila melanogaster Veganism Uniform Resource Locator Emu Hun-Apu Transsexuality Spider Mallard Condor Mosquito RISC Rhea (bird) Orgasm Narcissism Solar power Fusion power Sesame Street Pekingese Garbage collection (computer science) Extreme Programming Kakapo Squirrel Coffin Child sexuality Evidence of evolution Anal sex Falconry Acorn Woodpecker Antarctic krill Zerg Star Trek Customizable Card Game Joy Division (band) Dog agility Sex Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Kitten Macaw Red-cockaded Woodpecker American Alligator
