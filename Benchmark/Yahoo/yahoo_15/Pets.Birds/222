budgie problems hey everyone well i really need some help you see i have a now month old budgie and everything was fine and dandy but now that's all changed see this one time i took him out of his cage and tried to see if he would want to take a bath in a bowl of shallow water and he did not like that at all so now every time i try to take him out of his cage to hold him or something he runs away from me or flies to the other side of the cage what can i do to get him to trust me again and let me take him out of his cage without himmoving away please help also has a pet store person ever been wrong about the gender of your bird is it likely that they would be wrong most of the time also what age are most budgies when their gender shows and do pet store people look at anything else besides the cere to find out the the birds gender p s i'll give best answer to anyone who helps me out alot on this p later at four months the cere should be showing the right colors there aren't many ways to be positive other than the cere color but males are more vocal females are more territorial females have more pinkish feet that's about it since you scared him with the bath it happens a lot with smaller birds try just taking him in the shower with you or steaming up the bathroom it's just going to take time for him to trust you again just feed him lots of treats give him his space and don't force him to do anything if he doesn't get more trusting within a week or so take him out of the cage toweling works but it's better if you can just pick him up gently and let him run around for a while he'll soon realize that you're not going to try to give him a bath again and that he can come out of the cage without being afraid pet store people are wrong a lot about genders of animals because they are not informed or just want to sound intelligent by making something up with budgies usually they wont be wrong unless the bird was just a baby and they didn't realize it all babies look like males if you have any other questions or my answers made no sense i'm kind of tired feel free to email me Sento Social rule Domestic rabbit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gender identity Diving Chinchilla Guinea pig Fancy rat Ferret Pet skunk Toilet Chicken Changeroom W.I.T.C.H.
