what should i do if my budgies nest does not have concave bottom inside it is better if the nest floor is concave but its not mandatory i am unable to tell whether or not the budgies have begun nesting or if you just bought the nest and are asking about it before you give it to the birds to try out if you find that the hen is unable to incubate all of the eggs then you will need to try and hollow out the nest floor yourself but obviously you can't do it if she has already laid eggs and started sitting on them if that is the case then just let her go ahead and incubate as best she can and maybe she will manage to hatch them out anyway if not you should take the next down take the bottom out of the nest and with a knife rough sand paper or some type of power tool like maybe a dremel hollow out an aread about inches in circumference then put the box back up and put in the nesting material as far as next material goes you can put pine bedding about inch thick on the next bottom and the hen will arrange it to her liking mind you she may even throw some of it out if you prefer there is also a recycled paper bedding that is safe to use which can also be found at pet stores either one works its just a matter of which you or your bird prefer have you thought about what you will do with the chicks do you have a pet store or friends that you can sell them to also you should get a book about budgie breeding and find out more about how to give your parent birds the proper nutrition to raise healthy chicks if you want to look at some of my previousl answers click on my picture and you will see my profile below the profile on the left you will see a tab called my answers and i think you will be able to click on some of the other questions that i have answered that related to budgies and breeding good luck Chicken Hamster Kakapo Mattress Albatross Egg (food) Capercaillie Budgerigar Peregrine Falcon Fancy rat Platypus Egg (biology) Ostrich Ant Guinea pig Emu Equine conformation Archery Black-footed Albatross Domesticated turkey Condor Opportunity rover Japanese tea ceremony Teen Girl Squad Strap-on dildo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rhea (bird) House Sparrow Nile crocodile Osprey Diseases of the honeybee Mallard Gaia Online Ivory-billed Woodpecker Casting Brolga Gramophone record Bobwhite Quail Jumpstart 3rd Grade Kagu Kodocha Cockatiel Flea Vermicompost Leatherback Sea Turtle Volleyball Seabird Animal communication Drill bit Red-cockaded Woodpecker Textile manufacturing Minor Harry Potter Beasts American Robin Compact audio cassette Musk Duck Emperor Penguin Brewery Quotation mark Non-human animal sexuality Friends Stairway American Alligator Anchor Common Pheasant Kiwi Sooty albatross Floppy disk Kea Thermal power station Budgie (band) Ocean's Twelve Factory farming Malleefowl RuneScape quests Christmas tree Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Garfield Mound-builders Knife Laysan Albatross Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Curling Ammunition Tooth enamel Channel-billed Toucan Zerg Canary Live-bearing aquarium fish God Emperor of Dune Maxilla Lens (optics) The Ark in Space MapleStory Spoonbill Beehive (beekeeping) Eggerland series
