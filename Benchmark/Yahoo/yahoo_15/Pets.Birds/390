please help unhappy chick my mums friend recently hatched a laod of chicks she sells them and one had trouble breaking through so she broke it out it is still not dried out after a day and it is the cutest and saddest thing you've ever seen its beack is crossed o it has toruble eating and drinking it only has one eye and probably can't see out the other one what can i do for it first you should let the chick dry off after a chick hatches you should leave it in the incubator till it is completely dry the incubator should be around degrees so in that temperature the chick should dry in around hours when the chicks are dried you can take them and put them into the brooder the brooder should be around degrees the bottom of the brooder needs to be covered by something like a grooved paper towels dishrags or what ever you have but keep in mind chicks will eat sawdust that is to small and can get sick tip never use newspaper or paper on the bottom of the brooder this is slippery and can cause injuries such as straddle legs in young chicks food in the brooder there should be enough room for all of the chicks to eat and drink lack of room can cause in injuries for water put in one tablespoon of sugar per gallon this will give the chicks a boost as for feed get the chicks a good quality chick starter at the local feed shop stopping chicks from pecking each other use a red light bulb put grass or straw on the bottom of the cage so the birds have something to peck at how to tell if it is to hot or to cold if the chicks are huddled together near the heat source they are cold and the temp needs to get hotter if they are all at the edges of the brooder and not near the light it is to hot and the temp needs to go down if the chicks are spread out in all areas of the brooder the temp is right the temperature should drop degrees every week till you get to degrees then they should be kept around that temperature if it is warm enough outside you can let them out how to care for a chick that can t eat hold it then take your fingernail and gently pry open it s beak slip in some chick starter water down the chick starter till it is mushy then dip its beak in the water do not go past the holes in the beak that is the nostrils lift its head up so it can swallow repeat till you think he has eaten enough when do chicks open their eyes a little after they hatch if it is any longer your bird may be blind when do chicks walk they try to walk after they dry out they can t walk completely till around their second day of life what to do with sick chicks remove them from the brooder give them their own that is comfortable with food and water if it has a leg problem make sure the cage is small so it can t move around much hand feed them if your chick gets to badly of the best thing to do would be to put it down if a chick doesn t look so well and it is in with the other Bread Capercaillie Sauna Hamster Temperature Japanese tea ceremony Emu Coffee Dairy Seabird Shaggy dog story Bird 1957 World Series Aerial (dance move) Garfield Sento Albatross Customs and etiquette of Japan Equine conformation Cuisine of the Philippines Professional wrestling holds Yoghurt Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Agar plate Fecal incontinence Drag racing Textile manufacturing Brewery Swimming Cuisine of Denmark Manicure Happy Tree Friends Menstrual cup Alcohol fuel First aid Diving suit Snake Fancy rat Mattress Houseplant Drowning Yerba mate Sorghum Bird migration Tea Professional wrestling slang Cannabis cultivation Fire fighting Casting Thermal power station Common cold Water Babe Ruth Hyperthermia Diving Domestic rabbit Friends Light-emitting diode Animal communication Nile crocodile Diseases of the honeybee Foodborne illness Poker jargon Tofu Drill bit March of the Penguins Tuatara Vermicompost Spark plug Hiking The Ersatz Elevator Strap-on dildo Roman eating and drinking Pysanka Glass Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 African Fish Eagle House Sparrow Seismic retrofit Dialysis Gramophone record Mercury Atlas 6 Puff pastry Punt (boat)
