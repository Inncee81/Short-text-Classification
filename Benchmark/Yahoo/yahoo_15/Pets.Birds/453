can diseases be contained in domesticated birds parakeets someone told me that some bad diseases can be inside of birds she didn't say specifically like if they were from domesticated birds but they said it could irritate your skin making it hurt and your skin could be slowly rotting i want to know if its true my parents want to return my parakeets because of that reason but i've been with them for practically years i don't want to let them go i don't think its inside of domesticated pets and in wild birds but just in case i needed to know i need to persuade them that my birds are fine i have never heard of anything like that and i have known people who ahve owned birds for years and never had anything like that it could possibly be in wild birds but domesticated birds i don't think so if you are really really really concerned call an avian vet and ask if there is anthing that can do that and if it is common in domesticated birds like budgies etc it's jsut a call and i am sure he'll tell you you have nothing to worry about but if your parents need proff just call an avian vet H5N1 Bird Ferret Avian influenza Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Influenza Adoption Dinosaur Budgerigar Guinea pig Domestication Pet skunk Chicken House Veterinarian Parrot Garfield The Shining (film) The Fairly OddParents Pandemic Hedgehog Fecal incontinence Psittacosis Social rule Dog Banana Goat Conure Pet Hamster Guns, Germs, and Steel Agriculture Chile pepper Microchip implant (animal) Carolina Parakeet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lung Radiation therapy Urinary incontinence DDT Rabies West Nile virus Kylie Minogue Philosophical skepticism Singaporean measures against avian influenza Monk Parakeet Rabbit Smallpox Pneumonia Influenza pandemic Sesame Street Hearing impairment Equine conformation Fancy rat Spanish flu Domestic rabbit Anthrax Alexandrine Parakeet Antigenic shift Tattoo Plum-headed Parakeet One Tree Hill (TV series) Species Light pollution Domestic goat Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Plame affair Domestic violence Fathers' rights Livestock Falconry Reindeer Cat Health insurance Turkey (bird) Feral cat Tasmanian Devil Horse Theory of conduct Ayyavazhi mythology StarCraft Episode VI Moult Poker jargon Corporal punishment Timon and Pumbaa Philosophy of language Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Birds (film) Egg (food) The Death Gate Cycle Hunting Sorghum Laserdisc Rose-ringed Parakeet Slashdot trolling phenomena Virus Domestic AC power plugs and sockets The Twelve Labours Tooth enamel Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism
