how do i stop my quail from laying eggs hi i have a female button chinese pained quail who is laying an egg almost every day since this will dramatically shorten her life span i'd like to get her to lay the fewest number of eggs possible i've read that reducing their light to hours per day should reduce the number of eggs produced but this doesn't appear to be working does anyone have any other ideas i haven't removed any of her eggs she has of them scattered in groups around her cage dancing leaf many sites about quails say males live about years and females live about years because of the strain on their bodies loss of calcium and protein from producing all those eggs it is quite typical of chinese painted 'button' quail to lay their eggs all over the place there is not much you can do as far as i am aware if she is sitting on the eggs which they may sometimes decide to do regardless of whether there is a male or not then you can put fake eggs in the nest to stop the laying they can lay on sit on as many as eggs at one time i've had it happen i'm not sure if putting fake eggs in will stop their 'egg scattering' though just make sure she is getting plenty of calcium things like broccoli cuttlefish bone grated onto their food parsley beet greens yams and spinach are good sources of calcium you could even cook and feed the eggs back to her as well as the eggshell but it must be baked first it is true that males live around years and females around months largely due to all the eggs they lay however i've had a female live for years and she was laying heaps of eggs all her life and raised quite a few children Chicken Tofu Egg (food) Guinea pig Sugar beet Japanese cuisine Sushi Dietary fiber Carbon dioxide Platypus Domestic rabbit Spider Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of the Philippines Veganism Vegetarianism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Leatherback Sea Turtle Cuisine of Malaysia Kakapo Anopheles Bird Ostrich Aphid Theory of conduct Jewish cuisine Milk Bobwhite Quail Ice cream Drosophila melanogaster Vitamin C Kidney stone Black widow spider Food Kodocha Potato John Cage Tarantula Human skin color Sonic the Hedgehog Emu Octopus Protein German cuisine Professional wrestling holds Eggshell Gypsy moth Cantonese cuisine Hamburger Factory farming Organic food Equine conformation Dairy Cuisine of Singapore Ocean's Twelve Weight training Insulin Spinach Soy milk Vegetarian nutrition Iron Shark Atkins Nutritional Approach Tilapia American lobster Rickets Kiwi Pizza Common bean Vegetarian cuisine Seabird Vitamin D Peruvian cuisine Albatross Breastfeeding Dumpling Piccolo Junior Saga Pysanka Bengali cuisine Diseases of the honeybee Multiple myeloma Cauliflower Capercaillie Sex Parthenogenesis Mosquito Rice pudding Protein-energy malnutrition Grasshopper Paget's disease of bone Egg (biology) Cuisine of Brazil Salad Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mattress
