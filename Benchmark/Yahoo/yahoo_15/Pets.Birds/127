i have pekin ducks we raised from ducklings now i cannot get them to swim in my pond why we have let them swim frequently in the kiddie pool and bathtub when they were young so they know how to swim they just won't go in the pond i fill up the kiddie pool and they are in it before i finish filling it up so i know they like water but the won't swim in the pond what's up with that they are probably used to not swimming in the pond it depends if you raised them on land and have rarely let them to swim in the pond just try to bring them to the pond and if they don't go in keep coming back with them until they get used to it Mallard Swimming Sento Duck Breaststroke Drowning Pond The Ugly Duckling Butterfly stroke Backstroke Triathlon Swimming pool Baptism Lake Diving Fish farming Medley swimming Adult Swim Siphon Jodie Henry Huangshan Mountains Sauna Dixie Kong Sea ice Aquaculture Bathing Katharine Hepburn Mandarin Duck Platypus Water quality Poole History of swimming Water polo Hampstead Heath Henry Fonda Personal flotation device Poker jargon Frogman Hot tub 2002 Commonwealth Games Customs and etiquette of Japan Turkish Van Rubber duck Ernest Harmon Air Force Base New Zealand at the 2004 Summer Olympics Mies Pittwater Council Suicide methods Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Moonee Ponds Creek Sailing Frog Psyduck Loon Goldfish Skinny dipping Lifeguard Bottlenose Dolphin South Orange, New Jersey Knoebels Cranford, New Jersey Los Angeles Clippers Seabird Water garden About a Boy Front crawl Prospect Park (Brooklyn) Peterhof Ruddy Duck Otitis externa Salt Lake, Hawaii Horsham Shrimp farm Gardening Jerry Lee Lewis Schistosomiasis Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics The Beverly Hillbillies River Cam Swimsuit U.S. Acres Ecco the Dolphin Epiphany Anglo-Chinese School Koi Bladderwort Indianapolis 500 River Thames Sea-Monkey Lake Burley Griffin Alberta Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life Bath Wood Duck Ravi Shastri Michael Phelps Robert McCloskey Kappa (mythical creature) Diving suit Westerly (town), Rhode Island
