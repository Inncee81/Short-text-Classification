how to handraise birds some of my zebra finches escaped i feel terrible they left behind babies they have not fledged yet but they have all their feathers so far i've had them for a day and a night i'm at least trying to keep them alive instead of just leaving them here's what i'm doing please tell me if i'm doing it okay or if i'm completely wrong i have no experience with this sort of thing i feed them once every hours i'm using avione hand rearing formula they are in a shoe box with the lid open a crack there is paper towel and a tea towel on the bottom and they are in a plastic container with tissues and feathers i put a shot glass of water in there for humidity or whatever not sure if it's working after phoning pet stores a pharmacy a vet and an electrical store i had no luck finding a heat pad so i put the shoe box on my electric blanket with the setting on low continued in additional notes mixed part with parts boiling water then after a few minutes test it on my wrist i don't have a thermometer i should buy one i'm not really sure exactly how hot it should be so i guess i bought cc tuberculin syringes they don't have anything attached to them couldn't find anything like that i'm too scared that i'll drown the poor things by squirting a ton in their mouth and getting it wrong so i do a bit at a time they grab the nozzle and swallow it sort of and i squirt it in what i'm really not sure is when to stop feeding them what does a suitably full crop look like at the moment i'm just guessing and really don't know then i clean up any spilt mixture so that it doesn't harden on their beaks or face i didn't feed them during the night i stopped at about or pm and started again at am is that okay i hand raised a zebra finch chick about the same age in similar circumstances years ago i still have him and he is an absolute delight he has the personality of any hand raised parrot and loves to have his head and neck scratched as others have said you are doing fine i had raised numerous species of parrots before this finch but i was also very nervous due to his small size mine also swallowed the pipette which was really alarming and frightening at first but is apparently normal for them i used the same criteria for the crop as i did with parrots feed to the point of a slightly firm bulge but not to where it feels hard or tight it's always better to err on the side of feeding slightly less but more frequently then to over extend the crop the crop will shrink as they near fledgling age if your three turn out like mine did you will have some very special zebra finches you really get a unique view of their true personality when they are hand fed good luck with them Shaggy dog story Kakapo Equine conformation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Thermal power station Chicken Dairy Drill bit Breastfeeding Poker jargon EastEnders Fire fighting Japanese toilet Tyrannosaurus rex Piccolo Junior Saga Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Characters in the Smurfs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Menstrual cup Pottery Professional wrestling holds Textile manufacturing Hamster Sin City Sento Diving RuneScape quests Bird Mattress The Inside Social rule Horse Urinary incontinence Donald Neilson Mouse (computing) Handloading Professional wrestling throws Hypoglycemia Capercaillie Japanese tea ceremony Thermoregulation Plastic Dog Milton H.
