have you ever felt this way to all teachers have you ever felt like teaching isn't as important as other profession like being a doctor i know our profession is important and without teachers there wouldn't be any doctors lawyers architects etc but next to a few careers friends have i sometimes feel that what i'm doing isn't all that spectacular don't misunderstand i love education and teaching i am proud to be a teacher but just am i crazy i blogged about this yep i'm a dork on my page a long time ago feel free to check it out if you've got time i don't think what we do is spectacular and to be honest i think most people fall into two categories when it comes to their opinions about us they either put us up on a much higher pedestal than deserved or they think we're all child molesting idiots i also think there really are some teachers who probably aren't making a difference and shouldn't be teachers however i still feel like what i do is important because i make it that way i have a passion for teaching and a passion for kids in general i try to make what i teach relevant to their lives and applicable to what they'll do in real life i see my job as a way for me to soapbox it and hope my students can look at the world through different perspectives i don't force my beliefs on them but i encourage them to explore alternatives and to question what's considered truth but i totally understand what you're saying most of the people i was friends with in high school have gone on to those spectacular careers you're talking about they make way more money than i do and they party like rock stars compared to me lol it's the career path i chose though so i'm not really concerned with how glamorous it is as long as i know what i'm doing is worthwhile and i get paid enough to take care of the bills then it's all good nice question Theory of conduct Aesthetic Realism Education in the United States Education Rudolf Steiner A Course In Miracles Philosophical skepticism Graduate school Current teachings of Prem Rawat Religious Society of Friends Intelligent design movement Scientology beliefs and practices Jon Secada Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Education in Japan Education in the People's Republic of China Boston Public Social rule Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Education in Portugal Plame affair The Catcher in the Rye Socrates Homeschooling Jiddu Krishnamurti U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Philosophy John Howard Yoder Moral Politics The nature of God in Western theology Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Aikido African American Vernacular English Religion No Child Left Behind Act Opus Dei Juris Doctor Blog Professor Church of Christ, Scientist Infantilism Pedophilia Richard Feynman Alcoholics Anonymous Meaning of life Avenue Q Alexander Technique Cliff Richard Friends Shaggy dog story Theodicy Teacher Intelligent design Singlish Goodness and value theory Jumpstart 3rd Grade About a Boy The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy American Idiot David Hume Atheism School choice French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Epistemology Anthroposophy Sexual orientation Church of Christ Knots Landing Teach the Controversy Franz Boas Milton H.
