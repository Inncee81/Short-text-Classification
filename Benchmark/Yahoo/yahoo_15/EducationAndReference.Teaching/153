what works when disciplining kids in the classroom these days i teach th grade and in today's educational system you are forbidden to use any of the tried and true disciplining methods of old i'm not talking about spanking here today there are regulations that prohibit the use if writing reading homework physical placement i e standing in a corner take away recess time and of course public humiliation my teacher used to make us write i will not blah blah blah on a piece of paper 'x' amount of times whenever we misbehaved and that worked for me but we can't do anything like that today i am not in favor of anything cruel and unusual but we are expected to instill a sense of respect and discipline in these students and it is becoming harder and harder to do so if all of our ammunition is taken away so i ask you parents siblings and hopefully teachers are you aware of any disciplinary methods that are effective in today's p c classrooms please suggest them if so i am in great need for my upcoming class my students do not receive recess as they are fourth graders they have pe each day and they get about minutes to run around and play during that time i can not take any time from that also maybe i should mention that i teach in virginia education standards are very strict here don't let behaviors happen in the first place i know this is easier said than done but there are things that you can do to keep behavior issues to a minimum do you constantly and consistently reward appropriate behavior i can't tell from your post but by rewarding appropriate behavior you will get more results do not allow any down time in your room students should always be busy with something have something to do when finished no one should have to ask you what to do next keep a file folder for each child with anchor activities as motivation to do the work provide some type of incentives homework pass minutes computer time or whatever this will instill that hard work and doing a bit extra pay off then of course there are those times when we have minutes of down time without warning waiting for the pe teacher of whatever try some activities that you can do on the spot questions i'm thinking of a number and so on i always keep a set of picture finds on hand they are from the highlights magazine for children this same company also sells books called math mania that are quick too i always thought centers were for young children however i have found that they are fantastic ways to keep older kids working independently and they find them enjoyable too one that i really like is a series called take it to your seat language arts math science and so on it is a bit of preparation in advance but once it is laminated it will last for years http www amazon com literacy centers take your seat dp keep transitions to a minimum i know that with specials classes lunch and so on this can be difficult but i mean the transitions that you can control math to reading and so on also call students individually when lining up to leave the room jenny is ready for pe please push your chair in and line up you may have to stop instruction minutes early but it works no one wants to be the last one seated one thing that i carried with me when i went from middle school to elementary is have the student call mom to confess what he she did this has a greater impact on the student than if you call or send a note home good luck with the new school year Education in Japan GED Education in Romania No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Education Graduate school Kindergarten Grade (education) Education in Taiwan CPU cache Hunter College High School Literacy Homeschooling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Computer Primary education Theory of conduct Martial art Mathematics Unemployment Alexander Technique University of Massachusetts Amherst Stuyvesant High School Education in Portugal Intelligent design movement Hogwarts Japanese tea ceremony Second language acquisition A-level Columbine High School massacre Bristol Grammar School Teacher Miami-Dade County Public Schools Experiential education Charter school Hopkins School Teach the Controversy Craps Logic School bus Lynbrook High School Philosophy of education Marshall McLuhan Economic inequality Logo programming language Boston Public Education in Singapore Spanking Shaggy dog story Capitalism E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
