can anyone point me in the direction of some interesting books on art and education i'm currently really interested in the possible merits of using art as an educational tool a book that i've been rediscovering recently for use in my classroom planning is art and illustration for the classroom by rhian brynjolson through peguis publishers the isbn number is this book is full of ideas for art production both technical exercises and projects you can take a jump right in approach by looking at the many samples of students work and their captions for ideas as well as just reading in longer blocks for explanations of how to teach the concepts i m currently working on correlating lists of mini lesson and project ideas from this book with a series of arts driven unit themes i m using in the upcoming year topics such as composition repetition volume etc if you would like for me to send you a copy when i finish send me your email address by the way for visual awareness and art appreciation i use a website with my kids called the artist s toolkit it is created and maintained by the minneapolis institute of arts it can be found at http www artsconnected org toolkit though i teach elementary school age kids this site would be appropriate for teaching at any age level the toolkit section has a watch find and create process that i use to make sure that my kids fully understand the concepts that i am presenting them with i use this as well as the encyclopedia section for my kids to practice apply pencil sketch techniques to reproduce sections of the related art work for ideas and reminders i have them paste them into notebooks we refer to as our ideas journals we use these lessons as jumping off points for the other class art projects that we do for art appreciation i also use a series of books by mike venezia called getting to know the world's greatest artists they are aimed more at early years students but when i encountered them i found i learned things about art and artists that i didn t know they are put out through childrens press he also has put out a series called getting to know the world's greatest musicians hope that some of this helps Tai Chi Chuan Software engineering Open access Scientology beliefs and practices Ajax (programming) A Course In Miracles Comics Second language acquisition Yearbook Extreme Programming Object-oriented programming Music Art Intelligent design movement Homeschooling Computer X Window System Teach the Controversy Francis Crick GED The Origin of Species Experiential education Education in the United States Marshall McLuhan Current teachings of Prem Rawat E-mail Psychology Richard Feynman Fair use Aesthetic Realism Open source culture Design pattern (computer science) Literacy Mathematics Arthur Cayley World Wide Web Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Beavis and Butt-head Modern dance Logic Ayurveda Photography Copyright Futures Studies Master's degree M.C.
