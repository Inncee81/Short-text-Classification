how do i create a lesson plan i have to create a mock lesson plan for esl students as part of a job interview those students are japanese adults who have had about years of basic english education but are still considered beginners i have no idea where to start or how to go about picking a topic for a lesson plan and i was hoping someone with a little esl teaching background could help the lesson plan has to be mins long and i'll have to roleplay mins of it with the other people in the group interview more specifically i have to focus on conversation with a lot of interaction between students if anyone has any input or suggestions i'd appreciate it set up a mock of teaching your students job interview skills this will make you stand out in the interview process start by teaching students about professional resumes and the importance of them give them a sample then pair the students up and give them a list of questions that they might encounter during an interview process after a few minutes have them switch roles and then move around the room it helps get you acclimated to talking to different people with different accents as not everyone in america speaks american english clearly i am in a speech class in college and our speech instructor is going over interviews with us as well he did this with us last week and next week we will do an interview with him we have to make mock resumes and sit with him through an interview sitting with the other students who were new at this was a great help in preparing to speak with him i hope this helps Multilingual Alexander Technique Second language acquisition Teacher Graduate school English as an additional language GED Software engineering Education in the United States Homeschooling Teaching English as a Foreign Language Language education Social rule Whose Line Is It Anyway?
