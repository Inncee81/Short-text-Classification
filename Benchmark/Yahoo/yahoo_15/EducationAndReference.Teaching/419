what can i do to prepare for student teaching a high school class i'm about to start my student teaching in a few weeks and am not sure what to do expect or what to do to prepare myself i'll be teaching high school math i'm in my early 's and look very young what can i do to prepare and what can i do to look like a teacher and not one of my students dress is a big thing in helping you look and feel more like a teacher i was told by a friend also a teacher to dress at least one step up from the students you'll be teaching for example we have casual fridays at my school but then we always wear a nice shirt or blazer with it to still look professional if your student teaching program was anything like mine you'll probably spend at least the first week observing how the teacher runs the classroom it's insane to expect you to arrive and jump in feet first with our programs it was observe for a week then pick up one class then another until after a couple weeks you're teaching the entire day i teach music so when i was student teaching i started teaching all the rd grade classes one week the next week i taught the rd grades and the st grades the next week i picked up another grade and then another until i taught the full class load don't be afraid to ask your cooperating teacher questions the teachers i worked with were very willing to answer any questions i had no matter how dumb i thought the questions were your cooperating teacher was once in your shoes so s he understands how you're feeling take advantage of the fact that s he has years of experience and ideas i stole so many ideas from my cooperating teacher and even though she's been teaching years she's gotten ideas from me now as well that exchange is so beneficial for both parties good luck Graduate school Education in Romania Education in the United States Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Experiential education Great Teacher Onizuka Education in Germany Teacher Education in Hong Kong Education in Japan Kindergarten No Child Left Behind Act Socrates Beavis and Butt-head Education in France Caulfield Grammar School Hogwarts Culture of the United States Education Education in Taiwan Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Intelligent design movement Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Extreme Programming Raffles Institution Harrow School Teacher's Pet (Disney) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Hunter College High School Negima Secondary education in France Jesuit College Preparatory School Alexander Technique Theory of conduct Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Glen Ridge, New Jersey Aesthetic Realism Japanese tea ceremony Academia The Catcher in the Rye Education in South Korea Avenue Q Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Williston Northampton School Scientology beliefs and practices Dyslexia Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Secondary education in Japan __cole Polytechnique Martial art Homeschooling Full Metal Panic?
