teachers what do you see as th e biggest challenge s in education today why what will be the effects as an elementary teacher i find that my biggest challenge is that the parents of my students don't seem to take much interest in how their kids are doing we get a lot of lip service they say they will help but they don't even look in their kids backpacks to see if there are notes from the teacher or homework we all work and we're all tired when we come home but that doesn't mean you ignore your child i agree with posters above too money for supplies too much technology and little meaningful learning teachers in our time seem to be expected to teach manners and morals also ethics because parents don't do it it is certainly scary that one day these people will be in charge of our government Education in the People's Republic of China Teacher Theory of conduct Bart chalkboard gags Education Education in India Tuition Homeschooling Education in Japan No Child Left Behind Act Great Teacher Onizuka Education in the United States Catechism Primary education Homework Shaggy dog story Pledge of Allegiance Charter school Gifted Socrates School choice Tai Chi Chuan Current teachings of Prem Rawat Asperger syndrome Kindergarten Education in Germany Education in South Korea Daria Education in Romania Saved by the Bell The Giver Teachers (film) The Fairly OddParents Ocean's Twelve Education in England Ludwig Wittgenstein __mile Durkheim Grade (education) Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Brown v.
