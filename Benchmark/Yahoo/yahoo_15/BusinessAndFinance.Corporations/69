what do you do if you know of someone doing kickbacks referring to my previous question thing is i care about the person and yet don't like knowing they are doing this and keeping it a secret being an honest person just makes it hard but i feel i need to do the right thing just don't want them knowing that i know please obtain good legal advice before you report the person who is soliciting and or receiving kickbacks the reason you need such advice is to prevent exposing yourself to a lawsuit for libel or the like obviously if you report the person to his employer the person will be fired immediately that person may try to sue the employer and others you for unlawful termination therefore consult a good attorney to review your suspicions your evidence your motives and other facts then your attorney can explain your options beginning with do nothing and make informed recommendations good luck Slander and libel Expert system Karl Rove Oil-for-Food Programme Contract Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines USA PATRIOT Act Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Political corruption Probation officer Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution 9/11 conspiracy theories Appeal Jean Charles de Menezes Supreme Court of the United States Infantilism Guantanamo Bay Ethics Prior restraint Patent Scientology beliefs and practices Downing Street memo Combatant Status Review Tribunal Nuclear option (filibuster) Unlawful combatant Lawsuit 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Identity theft Theory of conduct Ronnie Earle Asbestos Fred A.
