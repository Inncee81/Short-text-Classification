how do you clear a memory card from a digital camera i've deleted all my pictures off my camera after putting them on the computer but when i go to take a video or a picture it still says card full what do i do the correct way is to simply go in the settings lin the camera look for the format tab and then simply hit the yes button it should say something like this will erase all on this card do you want to proceed another way is to hook your download cable and look at the card in windows and simply delete all the pictures in the proper folder this varies from mfg to mfg but most use either my pictures or documents or a specially named folder created by the mfg of the camera that is automatically written to the card when you insert the memory another is to use a card reader and delete the photos on the card in the same way you do with the download cable hope this helps you Secure Digital card File Allocation Table Bluetooth Object Desktop IPod Digital photography Windows XP Floppy disk Universal Serial Bus Digital camera System 7 (Macintosh) Stereoscopy Photography Mouse (computing) File system XD-Picture Card Screenplay Nintendo Revolution Anamorphic widescreen Windows 2000 Screenshot Macintosh Finder Danger Hiptop Memory card Nintendo DS Game Boy Nintendo GameCube Computer Xbox 360 Yearbook AmigaOS TiVo Microsoft Windows Mac OS X v10.4 Mozilla Firefox NTSC Enterprise content management Television Amiga Memory Stick JavaScript The Sims 2 MSN Messenger High-definition television Java programming language Gmail Trusted computing Yu-Gi-Oh!
