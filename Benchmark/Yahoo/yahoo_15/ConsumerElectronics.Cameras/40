changing the dpi resolution on a digital camera i am still a bit confused at the dpi resolution concept of a digital photo even on a megapixel camera using the highest resolution of x the jpeg quality and or if they are the same the dpi comes out at is it that some cameras do not have the capabilities of higher dpi so many sites like bay photo etc are talking about higher dpi numbers for better quality you can not control the pixels per inch in your camera as this is a function of the sensor i have found the following ppi for some cameras by the following manufacturers i wonder if this specification is available anywhere i have four camera manuals in front of me and i can't find it in any of them nikon ppi canon ppi pentax ppi we discussed this by way of question and answers a while back and decided that the ppi file produced by the camera really did not have any effect on the capability to produce a good print if i take a photo with my wife's mp nikon and view the image on the screen it will start out as ppi if it's a full frame image of pixels x pixels the screen image would be pretty big if i viewed it full sized but it would print x if you crop a x out of this keeping it as full frame as possible it becomes dpi with my brother's mp pentax the image is px x px but it's at ppi if you print this without cropping it would be x if you crop a x out of this though it becomes dpi resolution which is virtually identical for the nikon mp camera with my son's mp canon powershot a the image is px x px but it's at ppi if you could possibly print this without cropping it would be x if you crop a x out of this though it becomes dpi resolution which is a bit better than either of the other mp cameras in other words regardless of the sensor's pixel per inch output mp cameras produced the same resolution when it came time to print comparable images how about a camera with more pixels if i take a photo with my mp nikon d and view the image on the screen it will start out as ppi if it's a full frame image of pixels x pixels the screen image would be pretty big if i viewed it full sized but it would print x if i had the right paper if you crop a x out of this keeping it as full frame as possible it becomes dpi or higher resolution than the mp cameras we knew that is would work out like this though didn't we the real question is what difference does this make in the real world if we agree that dpi is an excellent resolution for prints as long as you end up with at least ppi after you are done cropping on the screen you will get an excellent print as far as resolution goes all four cameras exceed that amount i usually resize down to dpi before printing because you can't tell the difference above that resolution anyway most people would be quite happy with a dpi print so go ahead and crop a bit if you get a print resolution too much below dpi you will start to see digital artifact in the print and it will be objectionable Image scanner Mouse (computing) WYSIWYG Raster graphics Stereoscopy Konica Minolta Digital camera View camera Windows Vista Digital camera back Inflation Camera Digital cinema Digital image editing Anamorphic widescreen Nikon D70 Nikon Corporation Canon EOS Photography High-definition television Geographic information system Image file formats Video Analog-to-digital converter Medium format Dot matrix printer Liquid crystal display PNG Motion capture Ebook Advanced Photo System Leica Digital cinematography Atari 8-bit family Original Amiga chipset MP3 Raw image format Movie projector Macro photography Aspect ratio (image) Digital video Widescreen Moir__ pattern 2D computer graphics Closed-circuit television PostScript PlayStation Portable MPEG-2 Nintendo GameCube Deinterlacing Nikon FM2 Autostereogram Computer printer Plasma display Holography Charge-coupled device NTSC Photographic film Floppy disk Camcorder Radeon QuickTime Binoculars Super Nintendo Entertainment System Depth of field Amstrad CPC Typeface PlayStation 3 Hubble Space Telescope Nikon FA Hash table Anti-aliasing Apple typography Bluetooth DV Killian documents Computer animation Canon EOS-20D Dither Machine vision Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis RGB color model Canon T90 Nintendo 64 Motion compensation Clementine mission Nikon FE2
