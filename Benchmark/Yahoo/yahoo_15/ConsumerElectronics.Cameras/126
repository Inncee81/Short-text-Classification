i am planning on buying a new digital camera what would be the best type to get what would have the clearest pics should i get one with more mp or optical zoom there's a delicate balance more megapixels allows you to enlarge more and crop more easily optical zoom lets you get 'closer' to the subject so you won't have to crop my suggestion would be to look for a camera with megapixels and with a x x zoom if you are using the longest reach of the zoom regularly or plan to then look at a camera with image stabilization is vr steadyshot etc as that will minimize the camera photographer movement that can be exaggerated when shooting at longer focal lengths sony panasonic canon nikon and all the big players make cameras that would fill your requriements the big thing is that you must handle each camera before making any decision the camera and it's controls need to fit the photographer not the other way around hope this is helpful Digital photography Zoom lens Leica Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Photographic lens Konica Minolta View camera Photography Camera Cinematography Canon EF lens mount Digital camera back Binoculars Macro photography Aperture Pixel Digital camera Anamorphic widescreen Depth of field Camcorder Zeiss Rangefinder camera Contax Charge-coupled device Single-lens reflex camera Canon T90 Canon EOS Digital cinema Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Photo System Nikon D70 Schneider Kreuznach Movie projector Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Professional video camera Tracking shot Eyepiece Panavision Widescreen Enlarger Closed-circuit television Cinerama Motion capture Raw image format Canon Inc.
