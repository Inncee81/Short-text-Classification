what's a good first dslr i have to make a decision on my first dslr and i have the following options nikon d kit rs rs k grey around us canon d kit rs k us grey is better then d x for around the same price nikon d kit k better kit lens us canon d kit rs k around us year warranty or k us grey i am tempted to look at the d because whatever i have read about on the canon verses nikon game is the usability pricing and choice of lense where i have nothing to gain or less as i have no legacy cmos sensor in canon seems to have an edge but noise on d is a bit higher then d because of cramping more pixels on a similar physical sensor k for d sounds expensive for a first dslr considering one can get one at k us for a d any advice i believe canon rebel xti is called d elsewhere in the world i've used both nikons and canons the definite choice is canon i think it is a bargain for all the features self cleaning lens mp digic processor etc canon is the only camera company that manufactures its own image processing ic digic and i think it helps the camera works better with other components inside compared to other manufacturer's off the shelf lsi chips in case there is a problem it's easier to repair too one thing i strongly recommend is that if possible do not buy the all in one kit w starter lens you will definitely grow out of such standard lens as mm ef s f usm in about couple of weeks then you will have to spend money again and buy a better lens you should get the body itself without the lens and buy lens separately they are well worth it even for a beginner i don't think you should get l series red circle yet because they are very pricey good all around lens would be ef s mm f is usm which has image stabilizer make sure to get good filters for lens such as hoya around and canon hood you should also get the lcd screen protector film about it protects from scratches and cracks on your viewing screen one last recommendation is get the black colored body it just looks more expensive and cooler than grey one good luck Nikon Corporation Leica Digital camera Pixel Atari 8-bit family Canon EOS-300D Canon EOS Photographic lens Canon T90 Camera Canon EF lens mount Sega Saturn PlayStation 2 Secure Digital card Liquid crystal display Laserdisc Digital camera back Charge-coupled device Television Hard disk Photographic film Stereoscopy Konica Minolta Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo 64 IBM PC compatible Overclocking DVD View camera Floppy disk Nintendo Entertainment System Single-lens reflex camera Mouse (computing) Light-emitting diode Movie projector Microeconomics Technicolor Nikon D70 Windows XP Macro photography Anamorphic widescreen Image scanner Oscilloscope IMac Nikon FE2 Camcorder Clementine mission IMAX Nikon FA Canon PowerShot G Nikon FM2 Galileo spacecraft Digital cinematography Sound Blaster Intellivision Machine vision Color PowerBook Xbox 360 ATI Technologies Photography Cinematography Hubble Space Telescope Amstrad CPC Widescreen NVIDIA Bluetooth MSX Panavision Game Boy Advance Nintendo Radeon Zire Handheld Gamut Divorce Medium format Airsoft Nikon FE Radio controlled airplane Central processing unit XML Computer vision Raw image format Game Boy E85 Laptop Rangefinder camera Copy protection Windows Vista Grey market
