can the secret service wipe out a digital cameras memory so my uncle and aunt visited the presidents summer house in maine and apparently they went when the president was on the grounds so security was real tight and stuff so they said no pictures or anything like that but my uncle took all kinda of pictured anyway of the guard towers and everything so he puts the camera in his case which is attached to his waist and they drive home where we live in ma and when he got home too look at the pics all of the pictured from the entire weekend were wiped out and his sd was completely ruined coincidence they probably had to go through a screening device especially since it was the president's summer house which might have ruined the camera that's why at the airports they ask you to take any digital cameras or lap tops out of your carry on bags because the screening light will demage them Digital photography Movie projector Road-rule enforcement camera Digital camera View camera Photography Pixel Leica Camera Stereoscopy Secure Digital card Traditional animation Buckingham Palace Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Oscilloscope Digital cinematography Late Night with Conan O'Brien Gamut The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Spider-Man War of the Worlds (2005 film) Professional wrestling throws Hong Kong International Airport Resident Evil: Apocalypse USB flash drive The Five Doctors Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Computer animation Nintendo 64 Computer forensics Memory card Game controller Laptop John F.
