i just bought a new camera and am wonder if i should charge the lithium battery fully before i turn it on is there any way to apporach a new lithium battery to make it max out in length lithium ion lion batteries are a little bit different than the older nicad or nimh batteries you will want to fully charge the battery the first time after that charge early and often that is don't let the battery run down below if at all possible before recharging unlike older technology lion batteries do not develop a memory and don't need to be fully discharged before recharging in fact fully discharging the battery frequently will reduce the life span of the battery it may take a couple of charging cycles to fully condition the battery and get the maximum capacity also don't store a lion battery in a discharged state it will also shorten the life of the battery store the battery with a charge if possible lion batteries do not discharge as quickly as nimh or nicad batteries when they are not being used so you won't have to immediately recharge if they haven't been used for a couple weeks having a second battery that you can alternate with is helpful bacause you can always have a charged spare to swap out when the battery falls below Nickel-cadmium battery Nickel metal hydride Lithium ion polymer battery Battery electric vehicle Ford Ranger EV Hybrid vehicle Bicycle lighting Laptop IPod Xbox 360 AlphaSmart IBM PC compatible Automobile Digital photography Bipolar disorder Airsoft Non-volatile memory Apple Newton Fuel cell Action potential Segway HT Hydrogen economy Future energy development Energy development Uninterruptible power supply Tesla coil Memory effect Handheld game console Radio controlled car Lead-acid battery CPU cache Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Lithium Handspring Solar car Hydride PlayStation Portable Hybrid Synergy Drive Flash memory The Secret of NIMH Redundant array of independent disks Torpedo Thermal power station Halo: Combat Evolved Galileo spacecraft PowerBook Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Atari ST Nuclear reactor Read-only memory Circuit design FireWire Fusion power Hubble Space Telescope Universal Serial Bus Game Boy Advance SP Internal combustion engine Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory MIM-23 Hawk Douglas DC-8 Explosive material Artillery Tire Solar cell Johnny 5 USB flash drive Binoculars High-voltage direct current Electrophysiology Capacitor Weapons of Star Trek Watch Game Boy Advance Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Nintendo 64 Nuclear power Creative Zen Canon T90 Tungsten Handheld Aurora (astronomy) Energy storage Hydrogen vehicle Bus models used in New York City Transit Membrane potential Internal ballistics Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Oscilloscope Water (molecule) Air gun CMOS Electroconvulsive therapy Zinc-carbon battery A4000 Vacuum tube Universal Century Technology USS Texas (BB-35)
