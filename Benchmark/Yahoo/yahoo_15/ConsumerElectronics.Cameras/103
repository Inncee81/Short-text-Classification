kodak memory card i've bought a sd kodak memory card mb and i have a hp photosmart m when i put the memory card in it said that i could take pictures but something is wrong because that size memory card and megapixels should take between is something wrong with my memory card or it's normal and is that brand of memory card any good thanks thanks i've put my image quality to best and now i'm down to my image quality was just to normal that's why i had so many pictures check two settings on your camera resolution perhaps the camera is set to a lower resolution which would result in more photos fitting on your card compression perhaps the jpeg compression changed from fine to normal or standard otherwise it has nothing to do with the brand all mb cards will hold the same amount of data Digital camera JPEG Image file formats Digital single-lens reflex cameras Pixel Photography Digital image editing High-definition television Widescreen Movie projector Data compression Photographic film JPEG 2000 Nintendo GameCube DV Motion capture PlayStation Portable QuickDraw MP3 PNG Stereoscopy Konica Minolta Secure Digital card GIF Poker jargon Digital television Super Nintendo Entertainment System Hubble Space Telescope Handheld game console 35 mm film XD-Picture Card Lossy data compression Video CPU design Television Gramophone record CompactFlash Credit card Atari 8-bit family Compression artifact Camcorder Sony Anamorphic widescreen PlayStation 3 Video compression Bluetooth Digital cinema Nintendo 64 Closed-circuit television Teletext PC Engine Digital Visual Interface Laserdisc Camera phone Memory card Betting (poker) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories IPod Mars Exploration Rover DVD Digital camera back Raster graphics Apple Computer Binoculars Lossless data compression Video codec Technicolor Digital image Sound Blaster Color Graphics Adapter Medium format Holography Synthetic aperture radar Windows XP Surveillance NTSC Warez MPEG-2 Tungsten Handheld Image scanner ATI Technologies Schneider Kreuznach Leica CPU cache Computer H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Film speed GSM services Topps Computer printer GeForce 6 Series 120 film Microdrive Normal distribution Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Pinhole camera
