telephoto lens air show i'm shooting an air show in late september i want some input in what lens to use for this i have a canon mm is f i was thinking of buying a x tc or buying a mm f or a canon mm or even thought about a third party lens sigma mm sigma mm any suggestions thanks marvin tom what is ffl i forgot to mention i will be shooting with a full frame body canon eos d the ef mm f l is usm would be prefect for air show and other sporting events the is image stabilization feature should be pretty helpful in your case make sure to use it in mode so that the lens knows you're using it for a panned shot mode deactivates image stabilization in the horizontal direction i'm not too familiar with the sigma or mm lenses their broad range in focal length makes them very desirable but they don't have image stabilization vibration reduction and the quality of the glass might not be as good as the canon's lens anyways good luck with your decision and the shoot Canon EF lens mount Digital photography Canon EOS Photographic lens Macro photography Cinematography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Single-lens reflex camera View camera Lens (optics) Contax Leica Konica Minolta Zoom lens Canon T90 Binoculars Canon EOS-20D Digital camera back Canon FD Widescreen Rangefinder camera Eyepiece Canon PowerShot G Normal distribution Anamorphic widescreen Depth of field Zeiss Panoramic photography Schneider Kreuznach Polarization Aberration in optical systems Panavision Aperture Digital cinematography Telescope Camera Fresnel lens Advanced Photo System Cinerama The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Canon EOS-300D Stereoscopy Nikon D70 Full frame digital SLR Motorcycle Stage lighting Doctor Wily Photography Glasses Tetrapod Four Thirds System Seismometer Magnification Gamma ray burst History of telescopes Computer and video game genres Windows Vista Parallax Transformation problem Amateur astronomy Monochromator Strategic management Photographic film Eyeglass prescription Microscope Enlarger Light Movie projector Gravitational lens Shutter speed Clementine mission F-number Apollo 8 Equine conformation Oscilloscope Gas tungsten arc welding F-16 Fighting Falcon Antenna (radio) Care Bears Ray tracing Galileo spacecraft Political economy Eye Star Trek Fisheye lens Hubble Space Telescope Airsoft Doctor Who spin-offs Maximum likelihood Joel and Ethan Coen Microeconomics Mega Man X8 Autogyro Digital camera The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Bicycle Welding
