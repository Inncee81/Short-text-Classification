why does my digital camera focus on the background instead of my subject most of the time we get awesome sharp results of the background but our subjects will be blurry it seems no matter what setting we put the camera on it always does this the camera is a fuji finepix with megapixels we can't get good action shots either any ideas thanks this is a bit of a complicated question to answer but i'll try and give you a basic idea here i'm also not sure which model camera you have so i can't be certain that all the details will be accurate but you should still get the main concept when you take a photo with most cams there's a two stage process half pressing the shutter button first to lock focus on your subject and full pressing to capture the shot if you don't half press and allow the camera to determine focus ie you just full press right off the mark the camera will automatically hunt for the first thing it can focus on and sometimes it'll get it right sometimes it will fire prematurely in this scenario always half press wait for the camera to lock focus and give you a signal that it's ready to fire usually the focusing rectangle lights up a green color and then full press the nd thing you want to keep in mind is that most compact cameras rely on contrast detection to achieve correct focus if you're trying to focus on a part of a scene that has very low contrast the harder it'll be for the camera to determine what exactly you're trying to focus on this can sometimes be tricky so if the camera refuses to confirm focus green rectangle refocus a few times or focus on something more contrasty but that's at a similar distance away from you as the actual target there's more to this but try the two suggestions above to get you started good luck Digital photography Stereoscopy View camera Digital camera Canon EOS Konica Minolta Internal ballistics Pixel Camera Cinematography Leica Panoramic photography Automatic number plate recognition Causality Camcorder Traditional animation Cheating in Counter-Strike Floppy disk Stage lighting Rendering (computer graphics) Anamorphic widescreen Radar Gamma ray burst Digital cinema Autostereogram Resident Evil (video game) Central processing unit Black hole Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Drawing Bullet time Eye Autofocus Mouse (computing) Scientific method CPU design Philosophy of language Revolver Movie projector Rangefinder camera Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Opportunity rover GunBound Terminal ballistics Theory of conduct Digital single-lens reflex cameras Depth of field M16 (rifle) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dial M for Murder Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Color Metaphor Canon T90 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory R-Type GunZ The Duel Film speed Falsifiability MP3 Macro photography Digital Filmmaking Big Bang Artificial consciousness Gamut Logic B-47 Stratojet Film Firearm Photographic lens CPU cache Modem Object-oriented programming Scientology beliefs and practices Bad Wolf Objectivist philosophy Lightsaber Binoculars Bluetooth Many-worlds interpretation Action potential Martial art Joel and Ethan Coen Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Computer vision Compact disc
