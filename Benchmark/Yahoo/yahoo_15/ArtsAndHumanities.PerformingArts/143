wicked the musical does anyone know why the last note in i'm not that girl is so low i have seen wicked times and watched several youtube videos and i think even the best singers stephanie j block kerry ellis etc sound awkward singing that bottom note i am no musical theory expert but is it something to do with the key that it is sung in or the major minor chord just wondering if anyone knows why stephen s decided to write it that way well all of glinda's songs were supposed to be more high pitched to represent her cheerful and hyper personality elphaba is more of a pessimist and i'm not that girl is supposed to be a sad song as well i think the note is so low because it represents how down elphaba is feeling because she doesn't think anyone will ever love her a happy glinda song would be more likely to end on a high note and everything elphaba does sings is supposed to contrast glinda because they're opposites Wicked (musical) Elphaba The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Glinda Avenue Q Wizard (Oz) The Emancipation of Mimi Wicked (novel) A Hard Day's Night (song) Somewhere Over the Rainbow Tonality Key (music) Musical mode Modulation (music) We Belong Together Fiyero Chord (music) Inversion (music) Son of a Witch Blood on the Tracks The Ashlee Simpson Show Songwriter Power chord Heavy metal music Beatmania IIDX The Wiz Musical terminology Tom Waits Just intonation Musical notation Interval (music) 10cc Sacred Harp Blur Barbershop music Transposing instrument Crazy in Love Tablature Clarinet Nessarose Queen (band) Gregorian chant Hey Jude Timpani R.
