in benidorm at the moment having great time wanna know if anyone else has been to see sticky vikki heard lots about her stripping and doing things but would like to hear your views ta minxy prob won t get to vote cos on hol ooh now you've brought back memories she was a bird in her fifties when me and hubby went to benidorm in but she really keeps herself in shape she's apparently made an absolute fortune from her act she did amazing things like sharpen a pencil up her fanny light bulbs and pull about m of those flags on strings out she just kept pulling and pulling until there was a massive heap on the floor she pulled a load of razor blades on a string out as well that made me cringe she must be huge down there especially as i presume she had to have some kind of battery pack up there to light that light bulb up she's well worth seeing but what amazed me is that all the bars she goes in she does a tour of all the bars in a night there are loads of kids in there as well you have really got to see her to believe she can pull the stuff out she can when we went she had a big box that she kept all her 'party pieces' in and in between each thing she pulls out she goes behind this box to shove the next thing up we were sat so we had full view of her doing it not a pretty sight and ahe always did the act absolutely starkers Time Out of Mind Knife Sampling (music) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Ashlee Simpson Show A-ha Combine (Half-Life 2) Blood on the Tracks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
