i'm getting my guitar in september from my sis but i dont know i don't know how to make sure it's tuned correctly and or whether or not the strings are good quality she says that it is but she also says that i shouldnt trust her word on it can you help me out i am just playing it to play the songs i love well my best guess would to be finding someone who knows how to tune guitars and ask them to teach you so you will know for future reference if you buy a new guitar or even newer strings i don't know much on how to tell quality on guitar strings but i suppose you can just try to keep that faith in your sister that they are at least something of what your looking for if not you could always try buying new strings and asking a sales clerk which do have a good quality they are always willing to help Acoustic guitar Violin Slide guitar Guitar Electric guitar Floyd Rose Pet Sounds Oasis (band) Bass guitar Double bass Twelve string guitar Eddie Van Halen Beatles for Sale Old-time music Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Timpani Intonation Cliff Richard Self Portrait History of the Beatles Noel Gallagher Bouzouki Blood on the Tracks Charles Ives Berimbau I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue The Beatles' influence Eric Clapton Cello Football chant Harp Another Side of Bob Dylan Juliana Hatfield Ukulele Gothic metal Lute David Crosby Banjo Liam Gallagher American Pie (song) Megadeth Therion (band) Stradivarius Mandolin W.
