is it hard to learn how to play guitar i tried when i was a teenager and took lessons but i just never really went anywhere with it but i really want to play electric guitar just because i love rock and metal music and i have always had a love for music but i dont understand how to read music it doesnt make sense to me and lessons are expensive and im in my 's and i know it takes a long time to get good should i just let it go or do you think i should try i learned as an early teen and it took a couple of years for me to get good i enlisted in the navy four years ago at the ripe age of and didn't play for almost years i recently decided to start playing again and i am reteaching myself i just learned the intro to megadeth's tornado of souls and was shocked i could do it i couldn't play it before and tried to learn twice the point of the story is that if you are willing to put forth the effort you will learn and excel attitude determines aptitude Heavy metal music Atomic Kitten Gothic metal Phoebe Halliwell Dave Mustaine Carl Barks Buddy Guy Time Out of Mind Megadeth Kodocha Rock (music) Grunge music Thrash metal Alice Cooper Death rock Hardcore punk Pantera The Isley Brothers David Ellefson Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) The Kinks Bon Jovi Bass guitar Overkill (band) Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1930-1970) Red Hot Chili Peppers Electric guitar John Cage Music history of the United States Solomon Keal Blonde on Blonde American popular music Rock and roll Second language acquisition Incubus (band) Jacen Solo Manic Street Preachers Trent Reznor Brian Jones (musician) Doo-wop Gothic rock The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Real Love (song) TLC Emo British rock Days of our Lives Sly & the Family Stone James Hetfield Scenes from a Memory Video game music The Yardbirds KISS (band) Kurt Cobain Nirvana (band) The Verve Pop music Joy Division (band) VH1 Judas Priest Pop punk Wishbone Ash Music genre Timeline of heavy metal Tenshinhan Suzuki method Timeline of trends in music (1950-1959) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dorama David Bowie The Jackson 5 Iggy Pop Dream Theater American rock Pok__mon Live!
