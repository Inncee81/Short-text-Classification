what brand of banjo should i get i'm looking to buy a nice banjo for under dollars does anyone with a banjo have any advice my first and best advice is to go to a music store and put your hands on a banjo don't buy one until you find one you can't take your hands off of if that is not possible the two companies i listed below will both take care of you there are many more and i don't work for any of them but i have done business with these two and they have both gone out of their way to make things right for me and i'm pretty fussy deering is a good brand gibson is a great brand but out of your price range of course if you see a gibson in your price range grab it gold tone is a decent little banjo made in china by the saga corporation i've gotten a few guitars and violins from them and their work is pretty even if you get a banjo on line you want to get a guaranteed return policy and a way to get it fixed without having to ship the thing back to where it was made best of luck and if you need anything else just give me a shout oh once you get your banjo check out this group http launch groups yahoo com group bgnrbanjo Banjo Bass guitar Gibson Epiphone Australian dollar Bank Wal-Mart Trademark Mozilla Firefox Commodore International Sears Holdings Corporation Monetary policy Gold standard Nintendo Guitar Violin Bond Fender Tesco Electric guitar Love and Theft Sampling (music) Dobro PRS Guitars Mutual fund Sydney Riot of 1879 Department store Citigroup Roxette Nine Inch Nails AMD Ethical consumerism Relient K HyperText Transfer Protocol American Motors Notable lines in the Star Wars series CPU cache Surveillance Mattress RuneScape economy Texaco Mandolin Old-time music Blood on the Tracks Shaggy dog story Business process reengineering Pretty Good Privacy Sweetheart of the Rodeo Tesco Ireland Bluegrass music Pet Sounds Poker jargon Retailer FairTax String instrument Deflation (economics) Economics Asian financial crisis Lonnie Donegan The Price Is Right Stock Economy of the United States Songwriter Humphrey Bogart Microeconomics Eaton's Capital accumulation QVC Betting (poker) Liberty Dollar Banjo-Tooie Electronic Arts Gaia Online Vanilla Ninja Jill Gibson Ford Motor Company The Selmer Company Hash table Supply and demand The Man From Snowy River Microsoft Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) C.G.
