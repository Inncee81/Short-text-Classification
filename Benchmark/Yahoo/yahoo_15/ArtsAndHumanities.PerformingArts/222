my life long dreams i have a dream of being a broadway performer but my actual job would be a music teacher and i will be in september and i am really worried that i will never be able to bc i don't take piano lessons bc my mom won't let me and she says if i want to learn so bad that i should learn myself well i am trying to learn out of a schaum piano book but i feel like i will never get better my dad taught me scales but thats about it and i am picking up from my vocal teacher some things but how can i get better without a piano teacher or is it just hopeless i have a keyboard it is really hard for me to read the notes and play at the same time it takes me forever to figure out how to play a song but i can sorta play rainbow connection also tell your mom that when i child learns a musical instrument they also get better in school subjects such as math and reading if its the cost that is keeping her from letting you offer to take on more responsibilities around the house to offset the cost i really hope she changes her mind i cannot imagine how my life now would be if my mom hadn't let me start piano when i was a kid The Adventures of Pete & Pete Avenue Q The Fairly OddParents Piano The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Music lesson Homeschooling Jon Secada Solomon Keal The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Music Suzuki method Songwriter John Cage Social rule Drama Kodocha Olivier Messiaen Sonata (music) Slow Train Coming The Giver A Course In Miracles No Child Left Behind Act Classical music era Grateful Dead Sergei Prokofiev Queen (band) Treehouse of Horror V Authentic performance Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Grandview, U.S.A.
