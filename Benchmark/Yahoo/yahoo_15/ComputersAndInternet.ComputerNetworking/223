how do i make a bridge with and still have my wireless capabilitys ok the meat of the question this is what i have i have a wireless point less than half mile away i can connect to it with my directinal antenna i also have a linksys g running ddwrt i can put it into client bridge mode and all that fun fun stuff but i wanted it to be like an extenshion of the ap that i was connecting to with the directinal anntenna how can i hook it up so that when my linksys router is bridged with the other access point that i still have wireless capabilitys at the linksys end any help would be great thanks everyone well its been a while since i used that but i don't remember it having a universal repeat mode which a few of the other systems do have if it has it you just need to enable it and give it another ssid and then set a new dhcp set for inside correction this does appear to be in the software now http www dd wrt com wiki index php wlan repeater is the link to wlan repeat mode with out it you can only use wds which requires the other end to also set up wds for you if that isn't possible you can't use just that one box for what you want you can add another router behind the bridge and then redistribute from there bridge router your computers however if you don't have specific permission from the ap on the other end you need to know you are committing an illegal act and jail time as well as big fines are being issued for those who do connect illegally to someone elses network Wireless LAN Wi-Fi Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Cisco Systems IP Multimedia Subsystem Windows XP MDAC Network address translation Domain Name System Universal Serial Bus Voice over IP Streaming media Novell NetWare Peer-to-peer Wireless access point Wireless Application Protocol PHP Ethernet Windows 2000 AirPort Universal Plug and Play Wget Wardriving Modem Nintendo Revolution Federal Standard 1037C PlayStation Portable PlayStation 3 Spyware IA-32 Cellular network Border Gateway Protocol FreeBSD Mobile phone Symbol Technologies Web crawler Denial-of-service attack Geographic information system Windows Server 2003 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Instant messaging Linux kernel Bluetooth Apple Computer Web application Multimedia Messaging System Xbox 360 AppleTalk Internet Group Management Protocol Amateur radio Nintendo DS BitTorrent Btrieve MAC address Wireless Redundant array of independent disks WiMAX Embedded system Microsoft World Wide Web Uniform Resource Locator Atari 8-bit family Game Boy Advance Session Initiation Protocol Internet Relay Chat Xbox Ajax (programming) WRT54G CPU design Perl Free software Transmission Control Protocol Internet protocol suite Mouse (computing) Tor (anonymity network) Common Unix Printing System MSN Messenger Phishing Radio Quake III Arena AmigaOS Floppy disk Netfilter/iptables Wi-Fi Protected Access Hotspot (wifi) Local area network Password HTTP cookie Secure Shell
