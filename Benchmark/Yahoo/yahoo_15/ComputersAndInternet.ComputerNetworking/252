why can't i connect to the internet from pm to am it's been about a month now and i've been wracking my brains trying to figure out what is wrong that i cannot connect to the internet as soon as pm hits i've tried tricking the computer an changing the time but that doesn't work i've tried taking off the firewall and putting it back on and still doesn't work i've tried about a million other things including system restore to three months ago when i knew the internet definitely worked at any time but no success with that either does anybody have any clues or solutions as to what's going on with my cuckoo computer i live in ny it was working fine about a month ago which is why it seemed werid thanks michael m i have sypbot and i always clean out my temporary internet files especially of recently and i just downloaded avg and ran it i guess it seems like the consensus is to call my isp blah we have a computer upstairs and it works fine around the same time there are alot of possibilities router or firewall has time sensitive access unlikely this is considered peak time for most internet service providers this can imply that there is congestion and you need to contact your isp to fix this issue as a way to troubleshoot try the following ask your neighbor to see if they are having the same problem if it is a network congestion issue your neighbors would have the same issue take your computer to someone else's house this will rule out your physical internet connection to rule out your router connect your computer directly to the modem take the switch or router out of the setup Network address translation Modem Windows XP Router Denial-of-service attack Broadband Internet access Voice over IP Internet security Spyware Skype Computer security Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Internet censorship in mainland China MDAC Domain Name System Windows Server 2003 Internet Group Management Protocol Password Computer insecurity E-mail spam E-mail America Online Data center Local area network Firewall (networking) PlayStation 3 Differentiated services AppleTalk Computer virus Cisco Systems 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Microsoft Windows Satellite internet Wi-Fi Usenet History of the Internet GSM services Telegraphy Data retention Border Gateway Protocol Linux Streaming media Spam (electronic) General Packet Radio Service Routing Quality of service X.25 Wireless LAN Friend-to-friend Email authentication Internet fraud MAC address FreeBSD Asynchronous Transfer Mode Integrated Services Digital Network Cable modem Transmission Control Protocol File Transfer Protocol Ethernet CompuServe Virtual private network Phishing Web hosting Communications protocol Peer-to-peer Embedded system Internet Private branch exchange Web crawler Digital Subscriber Line CPU cache Pretty Good Privacy History of Microsoft Windows Apple Computer Stopping e-mail abuse Open mail relay Computer Netfilter/iptables Ping Prodigy (ISP) Congestion control Juniper Networks Cable television Computer network Online service provider Telephone Thread (computer science) Novell NetWare Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Mandriva Linux Cisco PIX Enhanced 911 Control Panel (Windows) Anti-virus software OSI model
