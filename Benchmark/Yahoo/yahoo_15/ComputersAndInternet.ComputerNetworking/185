trival question below imagine two cisco routers r and r using a frame relay service r connects to a switch that uses lmi type ansi t and r connects to a switch that uses itu q a what can r and r configure for the lmis to work correctly choose a ansi and itu b t and q c ansi and q d this would not work with two different types e no configuration is needed c and e cisco settings are cisco ansi and q in the command lmi is local management and the local router only has to match to the local switch far side lmi setting does not matter the default on cisco routers is to auto sense the lmi so not configuring lmi at all will work Frame relay Cisco Systems Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Cisco IOS Asynchronous Transfer Mode Multiprotocol Label Switching Federal Standard 1037C MAC address Global Title Spanning tree (networks) Linux Ethernet Wi-Fi Cisco PIX Quality of service X.25 Virtual LAN HyperTransport Routing Logic gate AppleTalk Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Common Unix Printing System Request for Comments Network address translation ISDN User Part SQL ITU-T Differentiated services C programming language Netfilter/iptables Simple Network Management Protocol MIPS architecture Fibre Channel Rail terminology MDAC Private branch exchange Border Gateway Protocol Enigma machine Embedded system Digital Subscriber Line Telephone exchange Enhanced 911 TIA-568A/B Circuit breaker Modem Novell NetWare Universal Serial Bus Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Floppy disk Windows Server 2003 Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol International Mobile Subscriber Identity C syntax PowerPC Link-state routing protocol Tor (anonymity network) SCSI Denial-of-service attack Mouse (computing) Firewall (networking) GPRS Core Network Virtual Network Computing Internet Relay Chat Bluetooth Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Fiber distributed data interface IEEE 802.11 Relay MUMPS Switch Session Initiation Protocol General Packet Radio Service Hydraulic machinery Btrieve Voice over IP Open mail relay Network congestion avoidance Telegraphy Token ring Network switch Manual transmission Scuba set Signalling System 7 Telephone numbering plan Communications protocol BASIC programming language IP Multimedia Subsystem Zeroconf Domain Name System 10-gigabit Ethernet Password NATO phonetic alphabet Local area network Windows XP Serial communications
