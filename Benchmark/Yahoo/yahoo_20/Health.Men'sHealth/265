how to you gain weight at my age i am years old and i weigh lbs and i am ft inches tall i have skinny arms and i'm not very strong however i am constantly active i am a tennis player i occasionally go to the gym maybe once or twice a week i know about weight gain supplements but i am not sure if it is safe to take them at my age i don't want to stunt my growth by weight lifting my doctor told me that i would never gain fat i do not understand i would like some advice on my matter if possible thanx alot you have the same problem i do first thing there's nothing wrong with you you mentioned that you are constantly active what you are doing is you are burning more nutrients than you are putting in your body protein is what you need for the energy and to increase your size you don't need any supplements they only thing i have ever taken was creatine i only took it because i was putting on the pounds to play college football and i have the same problem of not gaining size as you i wouldn't recommend it to you because you don't need it and it won't put on size i was taking it to gain strength also you are only i wouldn't ever take it until you are or older basically all it does is put more creatine in your system so you can push up that last rep that you normally won't your body already has creatine so taking it only puts more in your body to extend the results but don't use it until you are over back to what you need to do number one thing to put on size and gain weight is eat eat lots of protein since you are very active you are burning more protein than you are putting in throughout the day when i put on weight i ate meals a day decent size meals and don't stuff you face this allows you to keep restocking the nutrients in your body that your body keeps trying to burn off while doing everything you do playing tennis and even just walking i ate meals a day and i ate every hours eat before you are starving because when you are straving that is when you have nothing left in your body so your body starts to burn off anything when you go to the gym go days a week or more when you are trying to gain weight one or two days will not do it but don't over work yourself because then you will have a new problem golden rule stay consistant if you eat and workout like this for a week month or months or whatever then stop it will all disappear so stay consistant the daily intake of protein is gram for every pound you weigh you want to gain weight so eat double that you weigh lbs so eat grams of protein a day but remember as you put on weigh that number will increase so pay attention to your weight also make sure you stay active it's always good to good luck Weight training Dieting Bodybuilding Creatine Anorexia nervosa Milk Tocopherol Guinea pig Super Size Me Obesity Nutrition Protein Coeliac disease Table tennis Garfield Insulin Equine conformation Mixed martial arts Adjustable gastric band Explosive material Muscle Raw food diet Social rule Marathon (sport) Fasting Pound Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Little Britain Cheese Omega-3 fatty acid Prostate cancer Paragliding Veganism Stomach cancer Mass Vitamin C Vegetarianism Puberty Humphrey Bogart Hypoglycemia Acorn M16 (rifle) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) American football Protein-energy malnutrition Binge eating disorder Swimming Satchel Paige Calorie restriction Low-carbohydrate diet Swingout Diving Healthy eating Aerial (dance move) Osteoarthritis Theory of conduct National Football League The Contender (television series) Nutrient Professional wrestling throws Functional magnetic resonance imaging Weight Knife The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Fancy rat Vegeta Peanut Denis Law Diabetes mellitus Glossary of climbing terms Psoriasis Craps Clinical depression Anchor Ra (board game) Dialysis Exercise Brown Bear Cancer Volleyball Mitsubishi 3000GT Sewage treatment Gold standard Neopets Iron Jackass: The Movie
