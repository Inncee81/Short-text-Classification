does circumcision haf any side effects or will it affect my sex life what will happend during circumcision will it be painful during a circumcision you would be given a local anesthetic to numb the area so when they cut off your foreskin it shouldn't hurt it will likely be painful afterwards as you heal but that's what painkillers are for from what i hear erections can pull on the stitches and cause pain and the glans penis head will probably feel oversensitive for about a month as it's constantly exposed which it isn't used to as for side effects or effects on your sex life that's hard to say there are tons of anecdotes of guys who got circumcised and loved it and from guys who got circumcised and felt it was the worst mistake of their lives so it's a toss up in a sense but there are a few studies that might help you make that decision circumcision does remove a lot of the nerve endings found in the foreskin and these nerve endings could otherwise contribute to sexual sensitivity if not removed links also several studies seem to indicate that the foreskin may actually be beneficial to the sexual satisfaction pleasure of not only the man but the woman as well links so it seems like in the majority of guys that get circumcised it tends to have negative effects on their sex life this isn't universally true as there are guys who've have improvements after the procedure they're just in the somewhat minority but those guys probably had physical medical problems with their foreskins to begin with so an improvement makes sense other side effects might be that it's no longer possible to comfortably masturbate without using some kind of external lubrication as there might not be enough skin left to move this is true of a lot of circumcised guys but not all and so things might require a little extra effort and there might be a mess to clean up all in all it's your choice and that's a big deal if you feel that you'll only improve from it go for it if you're unsure or undecided might not be a good idea as your indifference could cause you to regret it if you go through with it see link for a story about a guy who got circumcised and rather regretted it Medical analysis of circumcision Circumcision Prostate cancer Female genital cutting Masturbation Phimosis Ridged band Human sexuality Orgasm Condom Human sexual behavior Brit milah Gliding action Circumcision advocacy Intersex surgery Sexual intercourse Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Sex organ Smegma Glans penis Sexual arousal Clitoris Strap-on dildo Penis removal Child sexual abuse Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Body modification Prince Albert piercing Penis enlargement Fecal incontinence Balanitis xerotica obliterans Sex toy Gay slang Infantilism Frenulum Anal sex AIDS Vulva Hormone replacement therapy (trans) History of intersex surgery Pain Reflexology Anesthesia Social rule Premature ejaculation Sexual abstinence Penile cancer Herpes simplex virus Bondage (BDSM) Sharia Happiness Psoriasis Erectile dysfunction Sex and the City Erection Acne Breastfeeding Personal lubricant Blood on the Tracks Theory of conduct Transsexuality Man Sexual fetishism Infant baptism Clinical depression Safe sex Multiple sclerosis Massage Cancer Zoophilia Stomach cancer Childbirth David Reimer Balanitis Human sexual response cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Erogenous zone Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fasting Narcissism Epidural Autism Utilitarianism Microeconomics Sigmund Freud
