to all men who masturbate and looks at pornographic materials ok i admit i am one of you too but recently everytime i masturbate or look at porno karma always comes like example i masturbate today then tomorrow i get my sort of punishment by me being teased or being embarrassed in class another example is that tomorrow i get a minor or serious injury so aren't you guys afraid of the punishment that is coming for you before masturbation was a part of my daily life until these things happened now i always think twice if im going to look at porno and masturbate so i just wanted to hear some opinions about this what should i do your talk let's realize that sex is a bad fact for you and so any consideration just is prejudiced now it's not my intent to persuade you that masturbation isn't a sin because my creed is different but as some factual scientific information affirm sex is good and healthy besides you're confounding karma with material and earthly causality happening to you consequentially because karma only refers to the soul and sa s ra or rede for wicca in fact yours only is a petty personal circumstance due to some change you're noting particularly while in the meanwhile others bad event also are happening without masturbating surely if true teens masturbating constantly and more times in a day even shouldn't go out then being in danger sorry but you just should be more realistic and objective Karma Theory of conduct Karma in Hinduism Child sexuality Theodicy Reincarnation Determinism Human sexual behavior Religion Plame affair Goodness and value theory Masturbation Pornography in Japan Evil Free will Social rule Old wives' tale Utilitarianism Sin Child pornography Merit Rape Moral objectivism Mary, the mother of Jesus Objectivist philosophy Predestination Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Child sexual abuse Infantilism Slashdot trolling phenomena Advaita Vedanta Homosexuality and Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Great Teacher Onizuka Immortality Deconstruction A Course In Miracles Transsexuality Human nature Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dualism (philosophy of mind) Oral sex Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sexual orientation Abortion debate Simone Weil Eastern Orthodox Church Lawrence v.
