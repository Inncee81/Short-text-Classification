penis size seems too small i am years old but my penis is only inches long and inch wide is this too small i am scared of what a girl might think becuase i am still a virgin thanks in advance your problem is that you re worrying too much about your size you re basing your whole manhood on how many inches you have instead of what you re worth as a man or what are you going to tell me that all you have to offer a woman is your penis there s nothing else good about you if your penis is all you are worth actually let me correct that all that you think you are worth then you must seek psychological help let s imagine that you have a smaller than average size so what are you going to sit there cry b itch about it feel sorry for yourself or even throw your money away buying pills why not use all that energy and use it in educating yourself on how to really please women i say really because there re a lot of guys out there that think that penis size is everything hell with penis size most men think that their penis regardless of size is all women need in bed do yourself a favor think really hard about what i m about to say you do not need a penis to satisfy women if a penis is so indispensable when it comes to pleasing women how is it that lesbians who don t even have penises can satisfy other women i've talked to a lot of girls who swear that a skilled lesbian can satisfy them in ways that most guys even with big penises can only dream of oh please put aside the misconception that lesbians always use dildos vibrators which is not true at all i know some lesbians bi females that have never owned nor used one that's something that women do in porn movies because those movies are targeting men i m not saying that some don t use them but ask any lesbian that use them and they ll tell you that they can live without them i used to have a penis after a surgery to remove some fibrous tissue that had built due to injury i end up with a penis to put it in perspective business cards are usually long which means that i'm longer than a business card at first i wasn t too happy about like most guy would too but after a few months after my surgery i ve come to realized that it was a blessing in disguise in fact i never really wanted to have the size that i now have but if i was given the choice of going back to my old size i probably would but only as long as i was able to keep the knowledge that i ve gained if i were to lose that knowledge in the process of going back to my original size i wouldn t want to go back no way my new size has made me rethink about the way that i used to try to please women i used to think that i was a great lover now i know that i never was at least not to the extend that i could had been i was pretty selfish like most guys i ve spent a lot of time after my surgery listening to women talk about sex asking them questions about what they really want in bed so on after talking to a lot of them including lesbians bisexuals i live close to west hollywood which in case you don t know it s a gay community i now have a better understanding of what women really want in bed i now compare sex with a nice romantic dinner our penis regardless of size is not the main dish on the table kissing hugging caressing in other words lot s of affection is the appetizer a full body massage with soft kisses all over her body is a great appetizer then comes the main dish which is a combination of masturbation and oral sex on her not you dummy once she s had enough once she s pleased then your penis becomes the dessert and the main dish for us guys then comes the toppings whip cream nuts etc on the desert the toppings are the kisses the holding and caressing that comes after sex while laying in bed together the smaller your penis the more this is true unfortunately most guys specially big guys think that a couple of minutes of kissing masturbation and or may be some oral sex is the appetizer their penis is the main dish the dissert all rapped into one some guys think that the appetizer is the girl going down on them not the other way around in case that what i said above doesn t help you reprogram the way you think i ll leave you with the following interesting fact according to many surveys and studies on penis size the female orgasm very few women ever achieve orgasms from penetration alone and
