we want to have a monthly cocktail party at our house w the same group of people what do we supply we have two small kids so we can't get out much and have a pretty tight budget we have a great group of friends that we see occassionally but not near enough we want to have a standing cocktail party once or twice a month people could stop by after pm for drinks and snacks we expect a core group to show up for most of the parties but anticipate others being invited occassionally by us or by people in the core group what would it be ok to ask friends to bring what should we supply okay i don't think people who are saying that you should be supplying all the food and liquor every time either read your whole question or are understanding what it is you're doing i have a group of friends at times about to of us who all like to get together we usually end up at one couple's house though because they have the room for one thing they also have a pool table a huge bar in the rec room and a pool just because they have the room to have better parties than everybody else nobody has ever expected them to be entertaining us every time we go like somebody else said theme parties would be good let everyone know what the theme would be and let them bring an appetizer or dessert that goes with that theme you'll probably end up supplying most of the mixers for the drinks but if these are good friends and this was everybody's idea then nobody will be expecting you to pay for the whole thing Cuisine of Denmark Meal Korean cuisine Bar (establishment) Poker jargon Japanese tea ceremony Moe Szyslak Parliament of the United Kingdom Cuisine of Brazil Disney's Polynesian Resort Oasis (band) Customs and etiquette of Japan Charles Dickens Hotel Coffeehouse Public house Theory of conduct Wine Craps Cocktail The Brady Bunch Ron and Fez Religious Society of Friends Humphrey Bogart Scouting Birthday Cuisine of the Philippines The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shaggy dog story Tea Social rule Drinking culture 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ice cream Sukkot The Catcher in the Rye Red Hot Chili Peppers Good Morning, Vietnam Buckingham Palace Wilton House Make money fast I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Sento Piccolo Junior Saga Queen Margaret Union Little Britain John Kerr French cuisine She Loves You Food Convenience store Journey (band) Nicomachean Ethics Arthur Laffer Alcoholic beverage __douard Manet Prohibition Milton H.
