sleepover birthday party for a year old girl my bff is having her party soon and is clueless money is tight and she can only use the living room or her bed room and we must be q u i e t her dad s a meanie we want to stay up all night too well if this was my sleepover i would choose the living room see if her parents will let her move the furniture out of the way and then get mattresses or airbeds or something for you all to sleep on then get sleeping bags duvets blankets sheets throws anything to keep you warm add loads of pillows and cushions and you have the perfect sleeping area then get snacks that means stuff like pringles chocolate dips popcorn and drinks like fizzy pop or whatever you like if money really is an issue you could just buy a few bags of potato chips and fizzy pop for cheap prices a really cool snack would be to buy a few boxes of strawberries wash and cut them into a big bowl then melt a huge bar of chocolate into another bowl all sat round and eat them tasty and cheap if you have to be quite get a film and put it on low and vow to stay quiet throughout the film make sure it is a really good film so that you won't want to stop watching then when the film ends you could read fashion magazines or paint each others nails or go on a dance mat if you have one or anything that doesn't make a lot of noise do face masks make buns do each others hair take loads of photos also if you can't make noise in the house go play twister on the back garden or sit around and tell ghost stories under the stars a great idea to waste time would be to go out until as late as you can beforehand so that you are in the house for the least possible time because you might run out of things to do if you don't have much money you could go see a show or gig or something in the local area thats free or you could hang out at the park Teen Girl Squad Mattress Upholstery Professional wrestling match types Japanese tea ceremony Poker jargon Blood Simple Cuisine of Denmark Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Comanche Great Teacher Onizuka The Amber Spyglass The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Coffee Customs and etiquette of Japan Plastic Bed (furniture) Professional wrestling slang Aerial (dance move) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sin City Ocean's Twelve Meat Loaf EastEnders Soft drink The Fairly OddParents Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Happy Tree Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban In-N-Out Burger Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory Microeconomics Potato chips Snack food Textile manufacturing Animal Crossing Big Brother UK series 6 The Time Machine Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Calvin and Hobbes Characters in the Smurfs Hamster The Ashlee Simpson Show Homer Simpson Breakfast RuneScape quests Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Jeffersons (South Park) Movie theater Ben Johnson (athlete) Little Britain The Shining (film) Sandwich Miss Saigon Queen (band) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Spidey Super Stories Dairy The Contender (television series) Bong The Amazing Race My Parents are Aliens Empire Burlesque The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Satchel Paige Squidward Tentacles What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
