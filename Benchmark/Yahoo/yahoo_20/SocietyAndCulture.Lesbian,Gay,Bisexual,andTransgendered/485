being gay is not a choice but the bisexuality could be a choice because some people became bisexual after a long time i watched on tv a case where a guy was married but he started to feel something for the guys when he was since that case he is bisexual it's the bisexuality a choice or it's like the homosexuality nature i am gay and i am curious about bisexuality because i dont know much about that love maps are personal experience that shape one's tastes as they grow up biochemistry is dictated in the womb and some time after together they create a plethora of h mo h t and everything in btw from spanking to ball sac nailing and adult diapers human sexuality is a mess at the best of times no one usually knows why they like redheads or chests or certain types of bodies or habits and why some other types just turn them off and there isn't any way to make them like those qualities either i was lead soprano in one of the largest lesbian and gay choirs in the world in the 's you didn't have to be lesbian or gay to join sexuality was not in fact an issue but pride was we celebrated diversity in all our songs and were a major contact point for the community including pflag which is parents and friends of lesbians and gays i wasn't treated even as well as the straights because i was bi i was either a fence sitter or just mixed up but the dykes weren't comfy around me and neither were the uptight basses so i hung out with the flaming tenors all three years they at least couldn't care less i danced well and had a good time so pthhh when i confronted the president of the choir about my unfair treatment as a whole she said well you know it's just that we find your sexuality so confusing i said to her well as soon as i know i'll let you know i am now legally married to a magnificent man and we love each other so much we made a daughter live a breeder lifestyle and you have a tendency to breed i also live with my common law wife and am a guardian of her daughter our children call themselves 'sisters' in canada we may be able to pull that off in a charter challenge soon i've never met a bi that didn't think that in a perfect world everyone is really bi many gays believe deep down that we only fall in love with ourselves and gay is the best reflection of that so if everyone was free to try it we'd all be gay and of course many hets think that everyone who isn't straight just had a bad expereince that made them not like the opposite sex or makes them wear dresses or whatever 'cause it's not 'natural ' i have found pictures of women far more exciting than men since i was a child i have usually had sex with men most of my life but not always there you go i label myself bi since most straights would call me confused and most lesbians certainly would not see me as 'women loving' enough is there some reason why i have to 'pick' a camp why i have to love someone based on their genitals those are nice and all and sadly in this culture very much define a person's experiences but is that all of who they are and should that delineate who i love and how i am happy to report that the choir is now a declared lbgtq friendly in part due to my agitation stand up bi's it matters 'course they booted me first Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gender role Infantilism Gay rights Transgender Homosexuality and Christianity Gay Lesbian Same-sex marriage Ex-gay Homophobia Homosexuality Marriage Biology and sexual orientation LGBT Religion and sexual orientation Homosexuality and transgender Pedophilia Polyamory Strap-on dildo Transvestism Abortion debate Sex education Queer Coming out Slash fiction Homosexuality and Judaism Anal sex Friends Reparative therapy Shaggy dog story Same-sex marriage in Canada Heteronormativity Child sexual abuse Theory of conduct North American Man/Boy Love Association One Tree Hill (TV series) Gay rights timeline Religion and sexuality EastEnders Age of consent Domestic violence Homosexuality and medical science BDSM Heterosexuality Zoophilia Swinging Child sexuality Queer as Folk (U.S.) Pornographic movie Gay community Incest Singapore gay equality movement Laura Schlessinger Human sexuality Badly Drawn Kitties Social rule Demographics of sexual orientation Humphrey Bogart Asexuality Avenue Q Don't ask, don't tell Kyle Broflovski Spanking Theodicy Pornography Homosexuality in China Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Effeminacy Section 28 Little Britain James Dobson Gay bathhouse History of sex Group sex Drag queen Same-sex marriage in the United States Will & Grace Stewie Griffin Boston Public Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) The Ashlee Simpson Show Bondage (BDSM) Nudity Kylie Minogue Homosexuality and Islam Urinary incontinence Human Lawrence v.
