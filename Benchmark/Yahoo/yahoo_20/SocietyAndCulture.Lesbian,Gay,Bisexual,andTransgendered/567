my brother is gay my brother is and i know hes gay i got no problems with his sexulity but our mum wait untill he tells us we are close and i want him to know i love him what you do it would be awkward for him if he hasn't come to terms with it himself yet if indeed you are correct i for myself am borderline bi but do not regard myself as gay there are just some men out there that i find attractive and i don't believe in hiding that there is a scale from gay to straight they are not poles apart with no in between stops i waited quite a while before telling my sister i liked other men and it was a big deal for me what she thought of me for it ultimately i sometimes feel a total fraud having said this because i don't always think about men i think quite a lot about women too but also i am used to my own company i think you should cuddle your brother often and tell him you love him and i think that your mother has the right idea in instructing you to wait for him to discuss the subject with you Sexual orientation Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures EastEnders Social rule Friends Little Britain Biology and sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Homophobia Shaggy dog story Bisexuality Gay The Smoking Room About a Boy Avenue Q Yoko Ono Knots Landing Will & Grace Transsexuality Homosexuality and transgender Gay slang Theory of conduct Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Jennifer Lopez Characters from Arrested Development Ex-gay Attitude (magazine) Marvin Gaye Gender-neutral language Gender role Domestic violence Sex and the City Rent (musical) The Lovely Bones Angel Sanctuary Laura Schlessinger The Shining (film) Humphrey Bogart Borderline personality disorder Big Brother UK series 6 Homosexuality and Christianity Extras (sitcom) Shot of Love Night (book) Lesbian Milton H.
