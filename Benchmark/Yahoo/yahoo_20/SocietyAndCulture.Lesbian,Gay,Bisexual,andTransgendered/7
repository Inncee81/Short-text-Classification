as a ageing straight woman but with good intentions any advice i lovely lad has joined my company he told me at interview that he was gay not a problem to me please do not take that as patronising it was not meant to be he is facing a bit a flak from some of the all female staff i know it is because he is young but i can see that some of the teasing is getting to him i don't want to appear to be fighting his battles for him or in fact to be favouring him and i honestly know that the ladies think that this form of teasing is just letting him know that they accept him for who he is so the question how do i comfortably address this situation without offending anyone and please forgive me if my clumsy attempts at this problem has in any way come across so as to offend anyone i promise you that is not the aim trying to keep everyone happy not easy alright so tell me what does 't' mean to you i know what it means to me but i rather think you were making a point that sadly is wasted on me care to speak english can you first of all i think you did a great job at trying not to offend anyone my advice to you is to talk to the young man and let him know that the teasing is the way that the ladies are accepting him even though it is a bit juvenile tell him that he should say something to them Social rule Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Little Britain A Course In Miracles Gender-neutral language Theory of conduct Plame affair Laura Schlessinger The Smoking Room The Marriage of Figaro Pedophilia The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Friends Sexual orientation The Apprentice 2 Cliff Richard Love Hina main characters Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Euphemism Shaggy dog story Gay Theodicy I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Indian English Sin City Battle of the Bulge 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Forgiveness Japanese tea ceremony The Inside Singlish Transsexuality Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Socrates George Costanza Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Tony Hancock Homophobia Wang Mang U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Porridge (TV) Capital punishment Internet troll Unreformed House of Commons The Critic Yoko Ono Galaxy Angel Haven (TNG episode) Pitaten Swami Vivekananda John Berryman Singapore gay equality movement The nature of God in Western theology Alan Keyes Probation officer Contract Hillary Rodham Clinton Breastfeeding Ex-gay Ethics Breath of Fire III Milton H.
