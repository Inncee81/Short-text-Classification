what is the origin of homosexuality who are the first gays how did they propagate almost all mammals across the earth and other species as well have gay members among them so the origin of homosexuality extends beyond the origin of the human species as for how we propogate that's not an easy answer however a lot of genetic traits aren't determined by any set genes often times a whole lot of genes goes into determining how bright you are how tall you are what color hair you have etc so it may be that most people have some of 'gay genes ' but not all of them it may be that when two parents together have enough of those genes and pass them to their kids they become gay another fairly widely accepted theory is that at least for boys becoming gay has a lot to do with hormones when you're in your mother's womb that would be another case where the 'gay genes' aren't passed down by people who are actually gay think of it this way a lot of short parents have tall kids often times those tall kids got their genes from their grandparents it may be that when those kids finally have kids they're even more likely to pass on their parents genes for shortness than their own genes for being tall there are a lot of cases where genetics is passed down tangently and not directly so you don't have to be gay to have gay kids in fact the vast majority of kids from gay parents are straight Biology and sexual orientation Gene Gender role Species Sexual differentiation Sexual orientation Gay Heterosexuality Transsexuality Human Mendelian inheritance Natural selection Eye color Baldness Homosexuality and transgender Religion and sexual orientation Genetically modified organism Evolution Homosexuality Gay rights Genetics Sexual identity Human skin color Nature versus nurture Extinction Sociobiology Theory of conduct Sex Evolutionism Recessive gene Androgen insensitivity syndrome DNA Red hair Same-sex marriage Gay slang Y chromosome Dominance relationship Molecular evolution Franz Boas Biology Human height Breastfeeding Eugenics House Mouse Marriage Sexual selection Race Barbara McClintock Controversies in autism Liger Recurring South Park characters Dog Generation Y Human variability Hair Homosexuality and Christianity Kyle Broflovski Genetic engineering Ex-gay Twin Genome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anglican views of homosexuality Duesberg hypothesis Chromosome Mnemonic Bisexuality Horse Dinosaur Color Cosmic Era human enhancements Elephant Meme The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Sexual dimorphism Bioinformatics Digit ratio LGBT Autism Genetic algorithm Reproduction Speed of light Mitochondrial genetics History of sex Homophobia Gay rights timeline Macroevolution Reparative therapy Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Cancer Homosexuality and medical science Hair color Orders of magnitude (numbers) Creationism Cell growth Price equation Validity of human races Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Genomics
