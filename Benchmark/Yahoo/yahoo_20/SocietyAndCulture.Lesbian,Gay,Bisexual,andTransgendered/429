creepy or what i'm going to leave most of the boring details out but we had some poeple over at out house and there was this one girl who caught my attention she looked like she was in her 's and she had short hair i kind of got a gay vibe from her but i didn't really pay more attention when my mom introduced me to her she said you daughter is very pretty and there was def something about the way she said it and she kept staring at me throughout the evening but i didn't really mind she was pretty hot but here comes the creepy part at one point she asked me if she could borrow my phone because hers had died i said yeah sure she excused herself for a mintue and the next day she called me and asked me if i remembered her i said sure do we talked for a while and then it hit me how did she get my number she told me she had gotten it when she had borrowed my phone i find her very attractive but the way she got my number kind of turns me off was it creey or what wow i'm sorry that was really long andigravity i had my number saved under 'voicemail so yeah she did dig around a bit let's see borrowed your cell phone on a pretext and decided to lift your number off it well i don't know about your phone but my phone doesn't display its own phone number if you just open it up to use it you actually have to go into the phone book to find it so the question i think you should be asking now that this woman has proven she'll root around in your private information to get something she wants without so much as letting you know first is what other information did she help herself to while she was ferreting around in my phone if she's willing to invade your privacy for her own ends she's willing to invade the privacy of others for the same reason so she could very well have the personal information of your friends and family she could have checked your call logs to see if she had any competition find out who she had to suck up to in order to put herself closer to you etc at best it's a completely tasteless and tactless thing to do which proves she doesn't actually respect your need for privacy and personal boundaries any decent person borrowing another's phone would have known to keep their noses out just like any decent person knows that using someone else's bathroom doesn't entitle them to root around in the drawers and medicine cabinet what's to stop her from sneaking your diary or hacking into your email if she wants to check up on you once the two of you are in a relationship nope i'm all with you what she did was creepy creepy creepy creepy it would definitely be setting off alarm bells in the back of my head personally if i were in your shoes i would not only try to refrain from having any more to do with the woman in question i'd make sure my mother knew what her friend decided to sneak off and do not only is this a trust issue for you it's one for your mom as well after all this isn't just what she decided to do when you loaned her your phone it's what she decided to do when your mother invited her into your home edit yeah i kinda figured she had to go poking around for it so at the very least you know she decided to go checking your private messages even though she didn't know you or have permission to do so in fact she may not have even been looking for your phone number since it was listed as voicemail and not my phone number like it is on my phone it may be that while she was busy spying on you and invading your privacy she happened upon it it definitely sets off the boiling bunnies alarm bells in the back of my head i'd steer clear Shaggy dog story The Inside Friends Plame affair Theory of conduct Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Little Britain Ocean's Twelve EastEnders Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye The Emancipation of Mimi Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Garfield Have I Got News For You Sin City Kodocha Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Telephone numbering plan Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Surveillance Poker jargon StarCraft: Uprising Prank flash My Life as a Teenage Robot About a Boy Privacy Kyle Broflovski The Star Wars Holiday Special 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Russian joke Milton H.
