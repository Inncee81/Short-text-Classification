am i right to be gay i am very fem and never have been able to find the right women i am really pretty and when i look at someone i feel is gay i get dirty looks i always go for the hot bi kinds and found them to be always going back to men i decided to try the guy thing and have made plenty of mistakes with it i hate to be with a man but it is someone i went on a cruise with a friend and got pregnant and have a beautiful little girl but i still no i am gay is it ok to persue this now or is it selfish i am dying inside i am never happy anymore i love to hold hands love and cuddle another girl not a boy and it makes me sick to continue with this what do i do i am feeling so empty and alone and need her whoever she is please help ok i forgot to add he knew of my situation before hand he was my first and i would never want to hurt him so also how do i break it i would love to get into a situation where we still live in the same home for our daughter is that possible awww honey i'm so sorry about what you're going through it must be very hard i think that you should be yourself that's all that matters if you know that you are gay then you need to be with women and not try to straighten yourself out how could it be selfish to be who you are i'm sorry but it's not that's exactly what you need to do as for the people who give you dirty looks screw them you need to stop worrying about what other people think you said that a lot of girls that you have been with went back to men well maybe that's because you're only looking for girls that are bi maybe you need to try to meet a lesbian i think the main thing is that you need to love yourself no one else will love you until you do i think you need to take a little bit of time to find out exactly who you are accept it love you and then i can almost gurantee you that the love that you have for yourself will grab ahold of some random person that just out there waiting to love someone like you i'm sure you are a wonderful person and that anyone would be lucky to have you you also need to teach your daughter self respect pride and confidence she's watching you and if she sees that you love yourself and you're happy with who you are then she'll be the same way good luck honey i hope this helps a little bit EastEnders Social rule Kodocha Pitaten AFI 100 Years series Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Cliff Richard Gay Marilyn Monroe Sex and the City Shaggy dog story Sexual orientation Knots Landing Boston Public Sant Thakar Singh Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Futurama (TV series - season 5) Theory of conduct The Inside The Subtle Knife The Amber Spyglass W.I.T.C.H.
