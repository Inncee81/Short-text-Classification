sexuality question alright so here is my question i am a straight guy and married alot of my friends tease me because they say i act gay or give off that what they call gaydar i don't know i like to dress nice and style my hair i like video games but i also am the kinda guy that loves musicals especially phantom of the opera so i have always kinda thought of myself as either bisexual or bi curious keep in mind i have never actually done anything with another guy but i have been thinking about letting my wife peg me so does this mean i am gay bi what i don't know anymore i love my wife and love being with her but there is this other side i want to explore any suggestions ideas i think it is hard to label yourself as a bisexual i think the fact you want to dress nice and style your hair is just a question of vanity some men even get their nails done and like to wax some parts of their body but it doesn't mean they are necesserely gay they can be called metrosexual who are guys who have a strong concern on their appearance i think maybe you should analyse a few things i for example came to realize i was a lesbian because i felt attracted to girls in a physical and emotional way i've never had this connection with men so maybe you could see if you feel attracted physically to men for example maybe you have this curiosity to be with a men but you've never felt anything when you are around them i believe is from human nature this necessity to explore things and to be curious to taste and have new experiences in your case i think you should really see how bad you want to go through this experience and if it really is what you are seeking because you might risk your marriage as you said you love your wife if you leave her for example to explore this other side and this wound up not being fulfilling you might lose her on the other hand it might be the experience you were expecting and wanting to have that is why i think you should see if you can really connect with a guy in a physicall and emotional way i say emotional if you are seeking for something solid that is more than sex good luck i hope you come up with the best decision for you and be happy with it Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Gender role Human Transsexuality Gay slang Reparative therapy Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Friends Infantilism Homosexuality and Christianity Lesbian Gay Homosexuality Marriage Theory of conduct Cliff Richard Social rule Humphrey Bogart Characters in the Smurfs Homophobia Meaning of life Anal sex Friedrich Schleiermacher Transactional analysis Little Britain One Tree Hill (TV series) T'Pol Yuri (animation) Motivation Sharon Tate American Psycho Kyle Broflovski The Marriage of Figaro Domestic violence Same-sex marriage Dualism (philosophy of mind) Eric Cartman Something Positive Kylie Minogue Past teachings of Prem Rawat God Emperor of Dune Homosexuality and transgender Blood on the Tracks Gaydar Zoophilia The Emancipation of Mimi Kender Religion and sexual orientation Soul EastEnders The Inside Ranma __ characters Homosexuality and Judaism The Fairly OddParents BDSM Abortion debate Happiness Cole Porter The nature of God in Western theology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Iago Yoko Ono Asexuality Jennifer Lopez Shaggy dog story Ethics David Hume Biology and sexual orientation Jon Secada Religion and sexuality Domination & submission (BDSM) Nicomachean Ethics The Invisibles History of sex Kim Possible Singapore gay equality movement Taxi Driver Kurt Cobain Swinging Dead Like Me Polyamory Simone Weil Sex and the City Anderson Cooper Queer Sex education Force (Star Wars)
