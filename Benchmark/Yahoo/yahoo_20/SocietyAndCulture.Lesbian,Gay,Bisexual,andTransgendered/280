do you have any relationship double standards the e flirting question triggered this in me because i'm ashamed to admit not really but i'm gonna perpetrate that i am lol that im a vicious e flirt but when i think my girlfriend is e flirting i see red i need her to cut all ties with the person she's flirting with so that's a big double standard that i have that i'm trying to work on what are yours oh my god pjonk i feel the exact same way and wickey you are a trip lol i color outside the lines you sound like my girlfriend except that she does get jealous as well she wants me to be more jealous but i dont think she knows what she's askin for cuz jealousy and me are not a very good mix hey girl this one made me stop and think yeah i have the usual green eyes when my gf is flirting and most of my gf's in the past have felt the same i don't really flirt all that much when i'm in a serious relationship so it's not as big an issue for them as it is for me most of them have had the flirt gene only one of them had a problem about it when i wanted to talk it over but your question was what are our double standards flirting is not the biggest double standard i've got and i'm not happy about it i am a feminist have been since i was a child chauvinism sux canal water i know every woman out there well for the most part can change a flat tire can stand up for herself can work in any job she wants to but if my girl had a flat i'd be there in a heartbeat if someone disrespects her i'm all over it and i'd just as soon she didn't work with men or a lot of beautiful women omg did i really just admit that bad dyke bad dyke Social rule Kyle Broflovski The Ashlee Simpson Show Frankie Laine One Tree Hill (TV series) Can't Hardly Wait W.I.T.C.H.
