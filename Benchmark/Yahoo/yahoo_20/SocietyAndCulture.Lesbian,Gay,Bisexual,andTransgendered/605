does he like me well i go to the gym every monday friday and on occasion sats and suns anyhoo i didn't really take notice not till last week but there is this guy who kind of follows me around i mean i dont get a omg stalker feeling when he does it because i really don't know what i feel there was also this one time while i was on a treadmill and i wasn't sure at the time but it looked like he smiled at me but i payed not attention to it lately he stares and i constantly catch him doing it sometimes i feel he's about to talk to me but decides not to i really don't know what to think and i hate to admit it but what he's doing has got me wanting to se him more and more how do you know if someone likes you i've had that feeling before in the past and been both right and wrong about whether they liked me but more often than not i've been right next time you get the feeling he is doing this come up with some way to start a conversation with him like maybe act all frustrated with something electronic on a piece of equipment and pretend like it isn't working right then say something like hey i could just be a complete idiot but this thing keeps blinking or maybe try asking him how to change the setting on something after he does it i get the feeling he'll definitely help you even if he isn't into you that way give him a big smile and make eye contact when you say thank you if something like that doesn't work are there tvs or music in your gym if he is working out next to you try making a general comment to him about something you see or hear like for example you'd think lindsay lohan would just hire a driver for herself for when she's messed up with all that money laugh something that he can comment on or smile back at you for then after you've spoken once you can give him the head nod or say hey to him when you see him start treating him in a friendly way so if he is interested he'll feel more comfortable around you and talking to you and you'll be able to get more information out of him in my experience people tend to react positively to friendliness that seems genuine so that should help you to figure him out good luck Social rule Shaggy dog story Pitaten Time Out of Mind The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha EastEnders Poker jargon Humphrey Bogart Hey Jude Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Great Teacher Onizuka The Contender (television series) Theory of conduct Friends The Shining (film) Hall & Oates Blood on the Tracks Milton H.
