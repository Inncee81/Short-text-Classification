what's the best way to come out to my family mainly my mom i'm recently claimed myself bisexual but my mother is a total homophobe and i think she suspects my sexuality but convinces herself that i am straight with extra graceful mannerisms i want to tell her that her wish for grandchildren isn't totally lost but lately i've found myself attracted to both guys and girls i want to let her know so that i can be myself and not worried about being judged and uncomfortable around her i want to be myself okay how old are you if you're truly worried about your mother's reaction couldn't you just wait until you're out of the house and then tell her also she's your mom she might be taken aback and upset at first but eventually she'll come around and love you no matter what Bisexuality Kurt Cobain Shaggy dog story Kyle Broflovski Homophobia Sexual orientation The Inside Friends Recurring South Park characters EastEnders Will & Grace Charmed Human sexual behavior One Tree Hill (TV series) Fathers' rights Stewie Griffin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gay slang Mystique (comics) Richard Littlejohn Religion and sexual orientation Treehouse of Horror IV One Life to Live Phoebe Buffay's songs Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Earth Girl Arjuna Hustler Magazine v.
