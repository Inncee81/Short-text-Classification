this is random but do homosexuals feel as though bisexuals are just looking for attention i have a few lesbian friends and this came up in conversation the other day i was just wondering because i've heard from a lot of both straight and gay people that bisexuality is not a real orientation i personally think that bisexuality is just another way of expressing one's self but i was just curious about what other people think i personally am homosexual but i don't believe that people can be straight or gay it is human nature to be attracted to the opposite sex you may not want to be sexually active with the opposite sex but you will still think dang she looks hot i think that each group thinks about identifing theirselves too much what does it matter if bisexuals are showing off or if gays are showing off all that should matter is whether or not they are happy with who they are Sexual orientation Gay Human sexual behavior Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Reparative therapy Gender role Homophobia Homosexuality and Christianity Lesbian Transgender Gay rights Homosexuality Religion and sexual orientation Ex-gay Biology and sexual orientation Group sex Transvestism Transsexuality Gay slang Anal sex Queer Outing Don't ask, don't tell Demographics of sexual orientation Asexuality Homosexuality and Neopaganism Sex education Homosexuality and transgender Transwoman Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Homosexuality in Singapore Same-sex marriage Heteronormativity The closet Yuri (animation) Swinging Singapore gay equality movement Homosexuality and Judaism Effeminacy Orgy Laura Schlessinger Queer as Folk (U.S.) Gay pride Autogynephilia Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Sex-positive feminism Gay rights timeline Anderson Cooper Gay bathhouse North American Man/Boy Love Association Homosexuality and Scientology Gender and sexuality studies Violence against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered Zoophilia Homosexuality in Japan Anti-gay slogan Liz Phair Will & Grace Homosexuality and Islam Slash fiction BDSM Homosexuality in China Child sexuality Uniting Church in Australia Kinsey Reports Religion and sexuality Anglican views of homosexuality Terminology of homosexuality Homoeroticism Section 28 Gaydar Homosexuality and Voodoo Infantilism Marriage Human sexuality Polyamory Gay village Gay community Christian right Clerical celibacy Log Cabin Republicans History of gays in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust Social rule Homosexuality and medical science Same-sex marriage in Canada OutRage!
