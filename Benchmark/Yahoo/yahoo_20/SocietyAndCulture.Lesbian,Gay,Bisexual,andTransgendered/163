a fun question for all i noticed that it seems a large proportion of lgbt people are vegetarians sitting here eating birthday cake today whee and i was wondering if theres a similar trend when it comes to cakes and sweets what's your favourite kind of cake chocolate gateu sponge lemon chocolate fairy cake etc etc my favourite are pink french fancies not sure why pink ones just taste better aww i didn't steal your observation i was reiterating it i rememberd your question but couldnt remember who asked it memory like a sieve french fancies are like little mini cakes icing all over but they have a little hump at the top of each one filled with cream mm seems to be alot of chocoholics here it's nice to ask fun questions once in awhile lol you stole that vegetarian observation off of me but i'll forgive ya d happy birthday hope you have a great day i absolutely love chocolate brownies and have developed a super recipe myself but unfortunately each brownie has about billion calories in it i hate spice cake and marzipan so if i ever marry my boyfriend we'll probably have a chocolate or sponge cake instead luckily he hates spice cake too i also love carrot and orange cake both individually and as one cake and banana bread i know banana bread isn't technically a cake but it's too sweet to be actual bread as for sweets well i love kinder bueno and milky ways i tell you if it wasn't for my regular gym and sex workouts i'd be calorifically challenged edit oh well i don't really mind anyway i just remembered you answering my question on gay vegetarians Cake Breakfast Japanese cuisine Cold Stone Creamery Cuisine of the Philippines Spidey Super Stories Little Britain McDonald's French cuisine Kit Kat German cuisine Chocolate Bengali cuisine Tofu Cuisine of Argentina Polish cuisine Pizza Cuisine of Malaysia Birthday The Smoking Room Oreo Pancake Hot dog The Fairly OddParents Food Radio Yerevan Korean cuisine Cuisine of Austria Rice pudding Hamburger Russian cuisine Kodocha Vegetarian cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Banana Chinese cuisine Theory of conduct Dim sum Twinkie Coffee Cajun cuisine Marzipan Avril Lavigne Jewish cuisine D__ner kebab Phoebe Buffay's songs Cha chaan teng Stollen Care Bears Palindrome Mirmo!
