why are you all not as frightened by these questions as i am please read page after page of questions asked here all i see is young people scared to death by the thought that they are gay what kind of world have we as gays allowed to rise up around us we have been in this revolt business for years now and we seem to have gone nowhere in a handbasket i see questions about gay pride sickening rebuttal to what these parades accomplish fear of being gay because of what the religious right has instilled in our country in the last decades and so much more where is the equality it isn't just about marriage it is about life when and how do you plan on actually making changes in the world according to gay you don't even get out and vote what kind of world are you leaving behind when you care only enough to gripe about our plight but not enough to do something about it and yes i am mad as hell at you gays you have overwhelming power yet you squander it by doing nothing except writing here at ya goldwing great question but you went on a lot more than you usually do this has really gotten under your skin of course that's ok means you actually have feelings are not afraid of them good on you mate and fear i believe is the motivation in the heart of the young people who write in with the hundreds of am i gay questions all of us struggle with conflicts within especially at the age range they are seeking some help in making the choice judgement on their current and future sexuality too bad their parents couldn't do a better job but that's where they are at and where we were all at some of us are still there frozen by fear even if there was no anti gay sentiment on our society they would still struggle with the question of their orientation true one fear would not be active the fear of being rejected or outcast by the friends and family and you are correct to note that this fear is alive and kicking in them as they struggle with their sexual identity same thing happens in young people who are considering a spiritual path different from their family of origin or culture i don't think society's thinking can be changed much and i'm not optimistic about the ability of activism to change it quickly but society's thinking does change by itself meanwhile what we can do it teach young kids how to learn to overcome and walk through their fears making them strong men and women who can confidently make their choices even if there are unpleasant consequences today peace and to thine own self be true Sexual orientation Gay rights Human sexual behavior Homosexuality and Christianity Transsexuality Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ex-gay Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gender role Religion and sexual orientation Religion Same-sex marriage Avenue Q A Course In Miracles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gay Social rule Homosexuality Friends Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Ten Commandments Religious pluralism Meaning of life Abortion debate Humphrey Bogart Domestic violence Goodness and value theory Pacifism Pitaten The Death Gate Cycle EastEnders Opus Dei Simone Weil YuYu Hakusho Anthroposophy Political correctness Kim Possible Milton H.
