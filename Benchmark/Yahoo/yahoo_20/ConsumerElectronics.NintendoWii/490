does a satellite broadband connection work for the wii i know that many of you know very well what a wii is so for you bunch that already know what a wii is you don't need to worry about this part of my questioning but the wii is a video game console published by the company nintendo and is the latest system to come out and you can connect to the internet with it through a broadband connection for those who know something about broadband when nintendo says that the wii needs a broadband connection to connect to the internet will any broadband work because i don't need to be worrying about what broadband i need if any broadband works with the wii i would ask this question on a place with more knowledgeable techies like the wii message board at gamefaqs com satellite if i remember gives broadband download speeds but slow responding upload speeds thus pulling content or doing passive browsing is okay but actually interacting with a server regularly may be difficult if that's true you may be disappointed with your wii internet experience as you're constantly sending data for things like the everybody votes channel or the mii parade i would guess that many features would work but features like on line multiplayer the mii parade etc will be disappointing even if it technically works due to speed lag Modem Broadband Internet access Internet Sega Dreamcast Computer and video games BitTorrent Voice over IP PlayStation 2 Nintendo Game Boy Nintendo DS PlayStation Portable Lag Warez Cable television First-person shooter Xbox Nintendo Revolution Nintendo GameCube Internet service provider Multiplayer Game Boy Advance Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Broadband Peer-to-peer Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Sega Handheld game console Ethernet Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Bluetooth Xbox Live America Online Steam (content delivery) Digital television Digital Subscriber Line Internet Relay Chat Newsgroup MDAC Quake Nintendo 64 Quake III Arena File Transfer Protocol Freenet Computer role-playing game PlayStation 3 Skype The Internet Movie Database NTL Communications satellite Console game Uploading and downloading Verizon Wireless Microsoft Nintendo Entertainment System Halo 2 Web hosting Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DVB The Sims Dial-up access Now Broadband TV Mario Kart 64 BZFlag Telewest Broadband Power line communication History of computer and video games WiMAX Sonic the Hedgehog Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Handheld video game Video on demand Final Fantasy 3DO Interactive Multiplayer Telephone Copy protection Game demo Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Game programming Windows XP Wipeout (game) Mozilla Firefox Opera (web browser) Blue screen of death Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
