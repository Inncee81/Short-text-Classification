how can i beat the mercenaries fast to unlock the hand cannon for re wii edition plz answer to beat quickly need to unlock gun fast ah going down memory lane again just last week i was just like you and slowly but surely i managed to beat that part of the game here's what i learned each character has the ability to make a high kill chain but how you use their weapons is the hard part so here's a couple of tips you can use rule head shots are the best shots to take down everybody in sight krauser and wesker are good when it comes down to mass amount of enemies both of them have a least one flash grenade if you come across a mass amount of ganados toss one at the ground and then get as close as you can while they are blinded and then use their special attack krauser uses his arm and they all go splat wesker uses the thrust punch and bowls them all to the ground rule you use your strongest attack against the toughest enemies and make a stand village bella sisters military water base doctor salvador castle clawed ganados can't remember the real name military land base j j these are the strongest enemies in the game under the bosses to take them down give yourself some distance and shoot them at the knees then aim for the head for the clawed ganados use flame and hand grenades to make him take a knee then blast him with your strongest weapon rule don't worry about the amount of enemies it may seem like breaking the first rule but the point of this part of the game is to kill and surrive and give yourself enough time to move once you hit the mark do what you can to time out the clock if you can use these three rules you can get that hand cannon but there is a stronger weapon than that it's called the plagas removal laser a weapon of mass destruction that fires intense radiation that can and will kill birds objects and anything or anyone that is infected with las plagas like the note says if you remove it it's adult state it will bring the host along with it there's only one rule when using that weapon give yourself enough time for it to charge and let it rip it can even kill saddler with one blow i mean it will kill him and it will skip that part where you get the rocket launcher to truely kill him good luck buddy Doom enemies Turok: Rage Wars Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Combine (Half-Life 2) Blood (computer game) Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Tenshinhan Ada Wong Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Jack Krauser Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Naruto jutsu Armored Core Volleyball Worms weapons and tools Unreal Las Plagas Quake III Arena Star Wars: Battlefront Tank Resident Evil (video game) Bubble Bobble Rocket propelled grenade Star Wars: Battlefront II Natural Selection (computer game) Internal ballistics Weapon Albert Wesker Battlefield 2 GunBound Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal GunZ The Duel Leon S.
