connection problem when i try to connect my wii it shows me strong connections i can use one of which is in the room right next to the wii however when i do the connection test it says connection not found why wont this work how do i change it to channel could be due to another electronic device causing interruptions in the connection usually you can fix this by changing the wireless channel to channel on your wireless router i've got a cordless phone that when ever it rang disconnected my wii and my ps and i couldn't figure it out for a month did some research and found that changing to channel was less likely to give issues hope this helps Wi-Fi Bluetooth Cellular network IEEE 802.11 Mobile phone Universal Serial Bus Modem General Packet Radio Service Mouse (computing) Battery (electricity) Voice over IP Denial-of-service attack GSM services Cordless telephone Jack plug Wireless access point Telephone exchange Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications Broadband Internet access Wireless Nintendo DS Television BlackBerry Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Radio Surveillance Nickel-cadmium battery Covert listening device 9-1-1 Karaoke Super Nintendo Entertainment System WiMAX Hearing aid Ultra high frequency Musical Instrument Digital Interface Wireless mesh network Wireless Application Protocol Atari 8-bit family Cisco Systems Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Password Embedded system Telegraphy Loudspeaker Serial communications RS-232 NEC Corporation Enhanced 911 Amateur radio Integrated circuit Cable television Opera (web browser) Digital Subscriber Line Wearable computer Burglar alarm Global System for Mobile Communications Blue box Transmission Control Protocol Oscilloscope Network address translation Communications protocol Electric motor STS-61 Transformer ALOHAnet Global Positioning System Field-programmable gate array Private branch exchange Fibre Channel MDAC Integrated Services Digital Network Residual-current device Speech recognition Communications satellite Phase-shift keying Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Handheld video game HyperTransport Bob and George Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Circuit design Hard disk Code division multiple access Central processing unit Microwave oven Verizon Wireless Vodafone Phreaking Lightning Emergency telephone number Electrophysiology PlayStation 2 Remote control MTV PowerPC Handheld game console
