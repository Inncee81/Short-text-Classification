trauma center wii i am thinking about getting trauma center for the wii and i heard that it doesnt have support i have a widesceen tv will i have black bars on either side when i play or will it fill the screen also i had trauma center on the ds got as far as the bomb level is it worth buying the wii version the ratio shouldn't affect the gameplay too much in reality if it's not supported but you could check nintendo com forums for some answers from people who actually work for nintendo i have played it a couple of times it is a ton of fun and decently challenging i never played the ds version so i can't really compare them for you your best course of action may be to rent the game first and see if you like it enough to shell out the cash Dance Dance Revolution Nintendo DS $ale of the Century Gradius Galaga Nintendo Revolution Super Nintendo Entertainment System Beatmania IIDX Wheel of Fortune Nintendo GameCube Super Mario Bros.
