does anythign happen to the wifi usb connector for the wii if its on to long it gets warm so any problems i don't have the nintendo wifi connector because i use a router but my wii has been on the connect settings since launch and its fine its not really sending information on a constant basis but instead sends a few packets at a certain times of the day that looks for updates and new channels the wii may get a little warm at times but does not have a overheating problem at all as far as the wifi connector it shouldn't generate that much heat to cause a problem at all if you find its getting very hot you should probably call nintendo Wi-Fi Universal Serial Bus Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Ethernet Voice over IP DMX (lighting) RS-232 IPod Bluetooth MDAC Musical Instrument Digital Interface PlayStation Portable Nintendo Revolution Xbox Quality of service SCART SCSI Advanced Technology Attachment Computer bus Routing PlayStation 2 Denial-of-service attack PCI Express Digital Visual Interface Hotspot (wifi) Network address translation USB flash drive Satellite internet Nintendo Entertainment System Open Shortest Path First Television Oscilloscope DVD AppleTalk Atari 8-bit family IPv4 Xbox 360 Station identification Streaming media Communications protocol Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IPod nano General Packet Radio Service Serial port PowerPC D-subminiature Radio Apple Desktop Bus FireWire Differentiated services Thermoregulation Internet protocol suite HyperTransport Router Commodore 64 Email authentication Atari 2600 Integrated services Nintendo Power Asynchronous Transfer Mode AES/EBU Wireless LAN Nintendo DS Netfilter/iptables Error correction and detection S-Video Parallel port Solar power NSA encryption systems Telephone PlayStation 3 Serial ATA Dialysis Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting The Midnight Sun Mars Exploration Rover TRS connector Nintendo Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sound card Super Nintendo Entertainment System Port (computing) GSM services Transmission Control Protocol Game Boy Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Mozilla Firefox Signalling System 7 Peltier-Seebeck effect Tungsten Handheld Pocket PC Packet Domain Name System Mobile phone ZX Spectrum RCA connector Semi-trailer Nintendo Virtual Boy Data retention
