ntsc wii with pal update hi i have an ntsc wii and a pal brain academy game when i put it in it says i have to update the firmware i turned of the wii and went to the options and checked for an update but it says i already have the latest firmware if i let the disk update my wii will it brick it and also how do i check to see what firmware my wii is more than likely if you had accepted the update another dialog box would have come up recognizing that you have an ntsc system and it cannot install the update i don't think nintendo would have put an option to view the actual firmware version in the console menus just because they tried to keep it very simple however none of this might matter since the game is pal the ntsc will refuse to play it in fact i'm surpised you got as far as you did and it didn't just say something along the lines of unrecognized disc the only way to play that disc on your wii would be to use a modchip or some other region coding bypass Modchip Regional lockout DVD PlayStation Portable Super Nintendo Entertainment System PlayStation 2 Sega Saturn Nintendo Entertainment System AmigaOS NTSC Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xbox IPod BIOS Resident Evil (video game) Atari 2600 Nintendo GameCube Laserdisc History of video games (16-bit era) PAL Atari 8-bit family Resident Evil 2 Amstrad CPC Commodore 64 System 7 (Macintosh) Patch (computing) Sega Master System Soul Calibur Sega Dreamcast Copy protection Universal Media Disc Nintendo DS Embedded system GBA Movie Player PC Engine Mozilla Firefox Homebrew (video games) High-definition television Software testing Xbox 360 S__CAM Final Fantasy Visual Basic The Sims 2 Television IBM PC compatible Windows XP Game Boy Floppy disk Blue screen of death Nintendo 64 Oscilloscope Open Firmware Steam (content delivery) Mac OS X Quake II File Allocation Table VHS Object Desktop Nintendo Apple Macintosh SAM Coup__ Pok__mon (video games) Hello world program Nintendo Seal of Quality PlayStation (original) Compact disc ATSC Computer virus GameFAQs Teletext The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Knoppix Metroid Action Replay Super Mario remake series Verizon Wireless Commodore 128 System/36 Soul Edge Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Final Fantasy VI Amiga IA-64 Gradius Chrono Trigger Debugging Telecine Resident Evil MOS Technology VIC Macintosh Finder Blu-ray Disc Def Jam Vendetta Cheat cartridge Resident Evil Code: Veronica Nintendo Power Power Macintosh G3
