acting audtions my sister is a big name actress but i can't tell you who for personal reason and whenever i go to movie auditions they never treat me like i am my own person they don't understand that i am not my sister can you give me some tips on what to do ha my sister and i are not famous but the same thing happens to us it is because your sister has left a bigger impression than you have the only way to fix this is to be famous in your own life whatever you do do it well make friends when your sister's people meet you for the first time they only have your sister to compare you to talk a while and let them get to know you but remember in your sis's world that things are different than in yours if you are not famous don't expect strangers to recognize you i wouldn't suggest being an actress to try to be equal to your sis in popularity unless that is what you want to do for a career choose your own road and be famous with the people on your road good luck to you Theory of conduct Polyamory Social rule The nature of God in Western theology Scouting Sexual orientation Friends Actor Utilitarianism Kodocha Asha Bhosle Betting (poker) Poker jargon Sharon Tate Hilary Duff Cliff Richard Nicomachean Ethics Humphrey Bogart Kim Philby Milton H.
