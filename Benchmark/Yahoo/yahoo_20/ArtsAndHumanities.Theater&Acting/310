is the play the thing i am a produced and published playwright my latest work was presented at a tiny theater in nyc and now i've submitted it to a publisher recently i was contacted by a movie producer who is interested in filming the play i would prefer to wait til the play is published it is copyrighted already this way the movie producer purchases the film rights but i retain the performance rights as a play this may squash the whole deal though any thoughts i don't have an agent i don't make that kind of money wr garrity it's all tied up in contract negotiations we've produced a few films along the lines of what you're going through and in each instance it had to be presented very clearly as to who had the rights to what and so forth in reality you can have a contract state almost anything you want as long as all parties agree to what is stipulated what you need to be on the look out for is what is sometimes called a futre considerations clause in this case the producer films the play live but what happens down the road if they decide to develop what he films into a feature movie also i would check and see what they are looking for as far as display rights i mean you wouldn't want a film of your play running in a cinema right next to the playhouse granted that is an extreme worse case scenerio but you see what i mean i would suggest you speak with a lawyer who specializes in entertainment law and have them draft up a contract prior to production if you can't afford an attorney look around locally for a legal aid office sometimes they take a little while longer to produce the results you need but the cost difference can save you a ton of money Voice actor American Idol Melissa Joan Hart Winona Ryder Sunshine Logro__o Halliburton Journey (band) Modelling agency Mandy Moore Dirk Benedict William Hung Edward Pawley Limp Bizkit History of SNL:1980-1985 Susie Carmichael Kristin Kreuk Financial audit Bestseller Little Britain Riley Smith Hannah Spearritt Play School Film Batman Forever Marlon Brando Eddie Murphy Wal-Mart General intelligence factor Mulholland Drive (film) Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Sally Ann Howes Meat Loaf Cheo Feliciano Tom Hanks Popular, Inc MythBusters Self Immolation Extras (sitcom) Comedy film Sal Mineo Psychiatric hospital W.E.B.
