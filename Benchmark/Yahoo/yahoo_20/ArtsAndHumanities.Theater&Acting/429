do you have to have more than one voice to be a voice actor so far i only have my regular voice it depends on what you want to do with voice acting if you're looking to do basically commercials full time and if your natural voice fits then your golden but if you want to get into doing movies video games cartoons characters etc you're going to need to develop a few voices your basic reading skills are a must but you need to be able to read several different types manuscript or copy as it's known in the business you need to be able to pick up a newspaper and read it aloud you need to be able to pick up a medical journal and read it aloud lets face it you need to be able to pick up anything and be able to read it aloud here's the kicker you need to be able to do more than just read it you need to be able to speak the words on the paper as if they were your own this is one part of the talent many vo's spend countless hours training to learn how to do some of them learn how and some of them don't therein lies one of the needed talents you need to develop the ability to grab a piece of paper that is sometimes handed to you minutes before you go into the studio dissect it to find it's true message and read it aloud as if the words were flowing from you if you practice and practice and practice and still don't develop the ability then you might not have the talent some of the other talents that certainly help are the ability to act and be funny a lot of people might think they are funny but you need to be funny many of the commercials that are recorded today whether they are for television or radio have some aspect of comedy or comedic acting in them tandem spots tandem is more than one vo in the spot a spot is a commercial generally demand that the actors or voice actors be funny your time is best spent getting professional training from a qualified acting coach for acting and a voice over coach for learning voiceovers a coach will generally know if you have what it takes to advance in either career the third and probably most important is a good voice by good we mean clear listenable articulate and in some way unique one of the biggest misconceptions is that you have to have some sort of dynamic over the top high or low voice to get into the business not true what you need are the abilities mentioned above and a sharp concise speaking ability a very regional voice as in having an accent can hurt a lot more than it helps a very heavy accent or inner city affect will most likely not get you very many calls if that's one of your voice characteristics it's time to start working on getting rid of that accent talent is being able to turn it on or off don't loose it just find a way to turn it on and off it's totally possible to make a fairly decent living even by la standards by doing nothing but voice over work i have several friends that do almost nothing but voices for video games and they are getting booked all the time couple of things i noticed when they were starting out was that the ones who could do multiple voices comic scary announcer etc booked work a lot faster than others having a demo reel and a site where people can sample your work on line was also a huge plus also if you can get in with a manager or an agent that deals with voice over work they can be a huge help as most vo jobs don't get posted to breakdowns the way acting jobs do there are a number of classes and books that can give you tons of information on training and things to take into consideration if this is the path you want to follow though be warned the field of vo acting is almost more competitive than standard acting and quite a bit tougher to break into there are training programs that will range from a few hundred dollars for a basic introduction to a dollar week program a decent site to visit to see what you're up against is voices com the other thing to keep in mind is that once you have your training and you think you're demo ready you'll have to book studio time to record there is no real way to put a price on this because there is no way to tell how long your sessions would take or how much you want to record some industry figures are as show below recording fee dollars duplication fee dollars graphic design dollars cd cost dollars printing cost dollars distribution costs packing postage dollars keep in mind these prices will vary from market to market as well as studio to studio best of luck Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Spam (electronic) Publishing E-mail spam Walt Disney World
