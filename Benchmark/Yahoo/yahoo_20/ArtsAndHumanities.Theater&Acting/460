how does one become a tv show producer i've been trying to find some meaning to my life and i was thinking what do i like to do and what do i have experience doing so i am trying to figure out what's involved in becoming a tv show producer i have a background in finance and extensive acting skills and i want to do something that combines both but more on the creative side anyone know from experience anything about being a tv producer or any other ideas i'm just pretty fed up with my job hahaha and really only stayed here because i wanted to finish my acting conservatory thanks everyone well what kind of producer do you want to be producers may do many different things some pay for or raise the to pay for a production to do this have a lot of friends with money or access to a lot of money some are actually writers like on sitcoms to follow this path you become a writer on a tv show and work your way up from there get a job in the mail room at a agency like caa or william morris get to know a lot of people in town when a script or pitch comes a long that you like put all your new found contacts to use and get a cast nd crew commited to brining the project to life pitch the idea to every major and minor production company in town and then make sure youa re allowed to stay on as a producer get a job at a production company ageny or as a freelance production assitant and meet a bunch of people who keep giving you better jobs with more responsibility until you have gained enough respect to become a freelance producer i recommend number find a script or a project and raise money from people who have no hollywood experience who you can fleece with promises of untold wealth from their investment make a project that is really good but not quite good enough for anyone to buy in hollywood but good enough to get you meetings so you can pitch new projects sound like a lot of work it is and it is all that while dealing with nasty back stabbing fake two faced and completely selfish people on th planet but that's why you'll get paid the big bucks Legal research Screenplay Douglas Adams Plame affair Transactional analysis FairTax United States Postal Service The Unquiet Dead Family Radio The Amber Spyglass Computer virus ISBN Surveillance Theodicy Neil Gaiman Real estate broker Screenwriting The Catcher in the Rye Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Food and Drug Administration Optical character recognition Open access Genesis Syphon Filter Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Object-oriented programming Bounty hunter Robert Altman Cuneiform script E-mail spam WFME The Daleks' Master Plan Value added tax National Weather Service Internet fraud Tcl Freedom of information legislation E-mail Paradise Lost Chu nom Gmail Carl Barks Egyptian hieroglyph Typeface The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Scripting language Arabic alphabet Quentin Tarantino Python programming language Fallen angel KFRC Credit score Operation Mockingbird Modelling agency Credit history Adam and Eve ILOVEYOU Chinese character Peter David Barsoom series Cross site scripting Identity theft Melissa worm Kolob Perl Pretty Good Privacy Starsiege: Tribes Interstate Commerce Commission Virgin Mobile Original sin Scientology beliefs and practices The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cultural references Library catalog PHP Don Quixote W.
