is just about wrapped up there are no current disney channel open calls scheduled currently the casting of the shows on the disney channel are being conducted through standard industry procedures the locations of casting offices for disney channel productions are not released to the general public these are the casting directors that were used for the seasons of hannah montana carol goldwasser episodes howard meltzer episodes lisa london episodes catherine stroud episodes fyi they do not open unsolicited submissions from actors they only accept official submissions in response to the character breakdowns and only from agents unfortunately in this day and age an actor can't pick and choose if they want to do film tv commercials be on the disney channel or whatever you have to take what you can get anyways i grew up on the same street as actor eric stoltz when he was your age he did school plays but his parents supported him big time and paved the way for him but the big break for eric was when he joined the santa barbara youth theater group it was popular for casting people agents etc to come to santa barbara and see the plays several actors got started there including anthony edwards er kathleen wilhoite and kady huffman tony award winner you should seriously consider joining a youth theater group in your area along with your school theater aside from the obvious things like finishing school and study study study study your craft here is some neat info advice for kids have fun and enjoy every performance learn as much as possible from the professionals you work with get your rest and drink plenty of water be respectful and do what you are asked to do to make the child wrangler's job easy remember you are there to do a job share the experience with your friends and family visit as many places as you can be thankful for the opportunity use your down time to keep up with schoolwork laugh laugh laugh advice for parents respect the word business in show business do not let the spotlights and excitement overshadow that this is in reality a business this is a family commitment have an open family discussion regarding how this commitment will affect your entire family and your present lifestyle you ll need to consider the following how will this affect your family s financial obligations do you have the flexibility to take your child to auditions and accompany him her on bookings who will have responsibility for any other siblings at home how would your family handle the possibility of a theatrical tour or relocation due to a job commitment be honest with your child and make sure he she understands the commitment involved and truly want to pursue a career in show business make certain your child understands that contact with peers at school may be limited and time to devote to social school sports activities will decrease as well auditions are usually after school and there is often little advance warning emphasize that auditions can be as frequent as three times per week and that performing arts instruction will also take up free time also make it clear that booking a job can involve a time commitment of one day to several months and can sometimes include touring or relocating educate yourself about the biz remember this is a business and there is a lot to learn before jumping in head first and for your child's welfare learn as much as you can visit the web sites of the screen actors guild sag aftra american federation of television and radio artists and actors equity association theater for the most reliable and current information all three web sites contain information on child performers in addition a wonderful site for reference material is lawrence parke acting books http www actingworldbooks org books ht never

the child theatrical labor laws in your state http www dol gov esa programs whd stat some states may require entertainment work permits if this is applicable to your state your child will not be allowed to work unless a work permit is obtained there are no exceptions if the work permit is renewable do so at least six weeks before expiration to assure a current work permit status some states currently california new york and louisiana also require set aside trust fund accounts information about these requirements can be found on your respective state's department of labor website or by calling to request information by mail your child must be within your sight and sound at all times while working in film tv commercials if there is an obstruction on the set preventing you from viewing your child ask the employer production to please provide a monitor for your viewing this is a union regulation so do not feel intimidated about asking or speaking up if you feel uncomfortable with a situation that will affect your child's safety and or welfare do not bring siblings to set this will distract you from keeping a close eye on the child working keep a diary of bookings and all paperwork contracts pay stubs expenses receipts parking transportation wardrobe pertaining to each booking you may need this information both for residual tracking if applicable and also for tax purposes keep a separate folder for receipts some expenses may be tax deductible if your child has met the financial requirements required for a deduction some possible deductions may include but are not restricted to continuing education with regard to your child's career i e coaching training transportation parking photos mailing expenses wardrobe laundry cleaning union dues and professional dues answering machines pagers cell phones even under certain circumstances theater and movie tickets please consult a financial advisor regarding allowed expenses the bottom line is when in doubt save all receipts beware and proceed with extreme caution when promoting your child on line and using on line casting sites internet safety is a major concern because of child predators if you choose to promote your child through a personal web site never list personal information that would enable a predator to locate your child i e date of birth address home phone number etc use a phone service number or p o box for contact if necessary also keep in mind that a child's photo on a website can be copied and used inappropriately and once it is circulated on the internet it is usually impossible to remove or control if you find it necessary to have a site designed for your child use a professional web site design service that is familiar with web site security the bottom line for your child's safety and welfare a reputable agent manager should be used to promote and procure work for your child not a personal web site keep your child connected with his her peers both from the community and from school to keep your child s life as balanced as possible inasmuch as it is possible find time for meetings with friends for special school events for after school activities for sports birthday parties etc the reality of show business is that a child actor's career can be short lived many successful young actors grow up to find themselves thrown back to reality among their peers either by choice or by chance the way to make this transition easy is never to separate your child from his her pre show business lifestyle and friends education should be a top priority a child's career should never take priority over his her education you need to think long term explain to your child that there are no guarantees that an actor s career will last through his her entire lifetime let your child know that ultimately real world responsibilities must be met and it is important to have an alternative career path just in case set up a meeting with your child's teacher principal at the beginning of the school year to advise the school of your child's situation let the school know that your child is a performer and discuss what this will entail i e frequent absences etc throughout the school year find out what your child's responsibilities will be to make up the educational requirements and what the school s policy is on absences also try to arrange for the loan of an extra set of textbooks to keep at home for use with on set teaching be prepared pack an audition work bag and refresh the contents periodically include a change of clothes grooming supplies snacks nothing messy or sticky quiet games coloring books activity books juice boxes light colored juices that will not stain your child's work permit and social security card your child s set aside trust fund information if applicable your child's birth certificate or passport union identification if applicable your identification license or passport toll money change for parking meters audition diary have this all ready to go at a moment s notice be prepared for education on set if you can get them on loan from your child s school be sure to have extra set of textbooks at home for on set teaching prepare a backpack containing the textbooks school supplies writing materials a calculator notebooks crayons markers glue stick a dictionary and whatever other items your child normally uses to do class work and or homework listen to your child his her feelings about working in show business may not be revealed through words but through actions if the smiles disappear and it becomes a chore instead of a passion or if you see your child balking at auditions and preferring to be with friends it's time to be honest with yourself and your child it may be time to stop and put the biz aside for awhile or
