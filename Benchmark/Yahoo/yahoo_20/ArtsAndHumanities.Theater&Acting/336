how can you become famous all my friends say that i have a great voice i sing amazingly and i am a good actress i love to act i would give up being normal to be a famous actress i'm young but i'm good so how do you become famous you shouldn't be acting and singing just to be famous you should do it because you love to do it everyone has their reasons for loving it but it definitely shouldn't be just for fame and money i mean fame and money are a plus but that shouldn't be the main reason so find something you love doing like a sport or something but don't do acting since you're mostly doing it for the fame trust me being famous is not that great after a while at first it's great but you will get tired of everyone thinking they know you and randomly coming up to you to get your autograph they also don't let you have any privacy people want to be friends with you only because you are famous they won't leave you alone you never know who are your real friends and who aren't also the jealousy that is the worst people that don't even know you are mean to you just because they don't like the style of music you sing or they are jealous trust me about all of this honestly trust me Double bass Blood on the Tracks Mario Jon Secada Violin Chicago Cubs Pitaten EastEnders Drill bit Highway 61 Revisited Annie Spice Girls The Emancipation of Mimi Kilt Rod Stewart Spirited Away Dragon Booster Fur Avenue Q McFly Cello Billiards Cliff Richard Hilary Duff Comanche Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Keeshond The Ashlee Simpson Show Tibetan people Bassoon Salad Fingers Slayers Phoebe Buffay's songs Whitney Houston Gwen Stefani TLC Stuttering Harmonica Kodocha Hearing aid Characters in the Smurfs Undergarment Car handling Rock Follies Journey (band) Saved by the Bell Buttocks Clothing Sheryl Crow Rich Mullins Hall & Oates Upholstery The Shining (film) San Diego Padres Maison Ikkoku Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jazz Ranma __ characters The Inside AC/DC Everwood Irish dance True Crime: Streets of LA Beavis and Butt-head Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hannah Spearritt The Jackson 5 Androgen insensitivity syndrome JoJo Hair color Brassiere Boy band My Parents are Aliens Vowel Interval (music) Strap-on dildo Breastfeeding Great Teacher Onizuka Professional wrestling match types Springfield Elementary School Time Out of Mind Adoption Mandy Moore Infantilism Pittsburgh Pirates Little Britain America's Next Top Model Social rule Gender role Diving Rais massacre Traditional animation Papa Lazarou Glass The Blue Lagoon (1980 film) Ron and Fez Singlish Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Tammy Wynette
