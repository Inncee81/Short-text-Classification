did i make the right decision in becoming a theater major it was so much more fun in high school i actually felt like i was getting something done now i feel underappreciated and my hard work is shit upon i would go back to my dorm after a theater class and feel so bad that i would start crying i feel really stupid picking a career that doesn't promise much in the way or success i should have chosen a field in which i could at least have a chance to be successful you know one that actually appreciates the output and not the facetime i am about to begin my senior year and it is too late for me to change my major i also feel that as an african american woman there is no chance for me out there in entertainment i don't look like halle berry and am in my opinion not talented enough to succeed in hollywood or anywhere what can i do i just don't feel like i love it anymore i also get the vibe from those around me that i am either with the group or against it i grew up in santa barbara with actors eric stoltz and anthony edwards and they also had fun in high school doing plays etc then they both went to usc as theater majors they both dropped out the first year now look at them i'm not saying that you should drop out but just a though they both went on to study with the late peggy fuery and they learned more in her classes than they would have in four years of college you must make that decision for yourself whether or not you made the right decision as far as being an african america woman it is actually a big advantage i am on the screen actors guild ethnic equal opportunities committee and i am in the know about this good luck in your decision and i personally love to see people rough it out and stay the course Graduate school Drama Social rule Explosive material Minimum wage Avenue Q Property (ownership right) Theatre W.
