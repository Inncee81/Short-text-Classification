i have been thinking about starting an acting career what all should i do to get started start with making sure your family supports your decision get training acting classes voice lessons dance classes get into every theatre production you can once you've built a decent resume with that move on to simultaneously student films and independents once you've gotten a few credits there it's time to look for an agent if you want to find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying good luck Record producer Timpani The Emancipation of Mimi Marching band Multitrack recording Chet Atkins Authentic performance Synthesizer Saxophone Flute Freestyle music Transposing instrument Whitney Houston Piano roll Joy Division (band) Henry Cow Organ (music) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Electronic musical instrument Good Vibrations Musical set theory Sound effect Grammy Award Sound recording Sampling (music) Soul music Trey Anastasio Dream Theater Robert Moog Music TLC Physician Brian Eno Sheryl Crow Walt Disney World College Program Conny Plank Emotions (album) Joe Meek Simon and Garfunkel Logic John Cage Motown Armin van Buuren Electronic Arts Alex Chilton Video game music Koji Kondo College Skeleton Crew (80s band) Phil Spector Grammy Awards of 1987 Player piano Blood on the Tracks Tonality Interval (music) Missy Elliott Donna Summer Clarinet Eddie Kramer Piano Belmont University Sly & the Family Stone Les Paul Recorder Power chord Ace of Base Beastie Boys Copyright law of the United Kingdom Software engineering 2Step Sampler (musical instrument) Music theory Witold Lutos__awski King Tubby Linkin Park Game development Sgt.
