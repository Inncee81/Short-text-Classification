should i leave work at the moment yesterday at work we had a security issue and there are no security procedures in place at the moment which is the resposibility of the business i work at a front desk where i could have been in a really threating situation as customers were coming in i felt like i had an obligation to protect them too after pressing the duress button and no one responding i went to walk out and noticed about staff watching through the window in the door to see what would happen i was concerned about the staff member that was being abused and threatened and the customers coming in it wasn't until last night it hit me hard and i thought it could have been me and what if he had a gun i don't want to sound like a sook but i'm really upset and hadn't shut my eyes all night last night and i'm weeks pregnant do you think it's time to get over myself and say it's the past or go home and take it easy i work in an environment where we have security issue's all the time i guess i'm just used to it now but with your being pregnant maybe you should just take it easy you don't want to stress yourself too much basically it's a choice between safety and earning a living i work part time so i don't feel like i'm at a great risk i have been in several very scary situations though so i know how upsetting it can be all i can say is to take as many precautions as you can discuss your concerns with your boss or you can quit The Shining (film) EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story G-Man (Half-Life) The Inside Sharon Tate Jon Secada The Price Is Right Blonde on Blonde Abortion Knots Landing Milton H.
