what do you think of this saying i brought you into this world and i can take you out i like it and you i am not abusive i mean i like it because it is sort of a true statement in that i brought you into this world but the i can take you out does not mean abuse it means i'm your mother father you get to listen to me a my way or the highway type of deal and let's not act too scared of our children man we are really politically correct these days although i think it is better called litigously correct again it does not mean abuse in any way shape or form whatever happened to not taking things so literally ah the famed bill cosby said my father established our relationship when i was seven years old he looked at me and said 'you know i brought you in this world and i can take you out and it don't make no difference to me i'll make another one look just like you ' how many other famous quotes do people use tons i see nothing wrong with this statement if you have a loving relationship with your child if you are abusive and belligerant then maybe it could be seen as threatening but all these yaers who think it's threatening probably had bad parents or are bad parents themselves ha from my experience children in this day and age need a respectable fear of their parent's authority maybe if we resorted to parenting techniques used by our parents and grandparents there wouldn't be virginia tech incidents or kindergarteners getting expelled or bringing knives to school and telling johnny they'll slit his throat i say america has a reform for good parenting discipline respect and less tv video gaming and it needed to start yesterday did you know bill cosby's wife's name is camille Bill Cosby Domestic violence Theory of conduct Fathers' rights Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Family Divorce Philosophy of language Ten Commandments Rick Santorum Humphrey Bogart Lou Gehrig Past teachings of Prem Rawat Current teachings of Prem Rawat Theodicy Knots Landing 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Laura Schlessinger Elvis Presley Scientology beliefs and practices Wyatt Earp Ex-gay One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha The Marshall Mathers LP Kender The Human Stain About a Boy Nicomachean Ethics James Dobson Milton H.
