how do i go about getting visitation once paternity is established i live in oregon and i had a paternity test done if proven the father i would like to have visitation and or split custody the baby will be two in february i haven't been able to see the child and i was just notified of this august of and i am just worried that i may not get visitation rights does anyone know if i will be able to get visitation rights even though i haven't been in the childs life due to me not even knowing about the child until last year and if so where should i start get a family attorney if you are proven to be the father have him file paperwork for which ever you are wanting to go with if you live close to the child then split custody might work but if you are far away then i wouldn't recommend it to hard on parents and the child once the paperwork is filed the mother would be notified of your request and have time to get a lawyer you will get a courtdate to appear to state what you want and why even though childsupport and visitation is suppose to be seperate they do usually ask if you are paying support at the court date if the child is yours then yes with a good lawyer you have a pretty good chance of seeing your child atleast every other weekend and probably day during the week every week typical visitation agreement as long as you don't have a history of violence that may cause harm to the child they may start with supervised visits for a few visits to see how the child responds and let the child get to know you before getting regular visits getting split custody is a little more difficult when a child doesn't know you but if it wasn't your fault you weren't in your childs life then visits should be granted talk to the lawyer asap and get things started if the test comes back you want to move fast if you find out the child is yours because the longer you wait to move on it the worse it will look on you if the child is yours Divorce Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Fathers' rights Child support 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Visitation Marriage Kodocha EastEnders Friends Humphrey Bogart James Bulger Theory of conduct Mach kernel Abortion in the United States Fathers' rights movement in the UK Hillary Rodham Clinton One Tree Hill (TV series) Supreme Court of the United States Vivian Solon Good Times Patent Killian documents Abortion debate Major League Baseball television contracts Street-Legal Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Ben Johnson (athlete) Tennessee State Constitution The Ashlee Simpson Show Maria Hertogh riots Knots Landing Continuation War Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carl Barks Pitaten Paternity Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Branch Davidian Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Wal-Mart Prostate cancer Domestic violence The Contender (television series) Breastfeeding Time Out of Mind Guantanamo Bay No-fault divorce Ocean's Twelve Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Timeline of the Enron scandal Mary Astor Cyprus dispute Father Karl Rove Downing Street memo Attorney at Law Darryl Strawberry Days of our Lives Incarnations of Immortality Password Extreme Programming Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda Probation officer John Roberts Supreme Court nomination and hearings Social rule George W.
