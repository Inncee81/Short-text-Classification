mother in law and my baby now my first problem is that i live with my husband parents and we have a baby but if anyone who is kinda in the same situation did they find their mother in law way more annoying or overbearing when they had a baby i mean my mother in law is over bearing and gives advice when its not need but i can't stand her now we live with her and she will go in and walk the baby up in the morning before she goes to work kisses all over him calls and is like let me talk to him claims him as hers and i can't stand it i have tried to set boundaries but its not work she wants to do all the firsts with him like feed him his first bowl of baby cereral had to be involved with the first bath and all that and i can not stand it i have told my husband but he's like we have to deal with it because she lets us live there for free buys all our food constantly buys stuff for the baby and i just don't know what to do any more any advice stories comments this is kinda a venting story but thanks for the answer and for all of you who said move out its impossible right now we don't have money i do feel for you i can only imagine having to live with the mom and having her be overbearing but since you do have to live with her other wise why would you right and she is supporting you i say you have to suck it up yep you gotta share let her help with the first stuff let her have the first kisses of the day having an overbearing and helpful mom in law is kind of a blessing in disguise at least she is helping i know this isn't what you wanted to hear but if you can't allow her the grandma stuff that she wants i would say you will probably have to move out you can't live rent free somewhere have her buy you food and baby stuff and ask to make the rules find a good outlet for your anger like a good friend a long jog chocolate etc and hope for the best at least she wants to be a part of the grandchild's life and is willing to foot the bill focus on your blessings and smile through your anger good luck Social rule Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Buffay's songs Friends The Catcher in the Rye Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breastfeeding Kodocha EastEnders Garfield Knots Landing Little Britain Care Bears Charmed The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.
