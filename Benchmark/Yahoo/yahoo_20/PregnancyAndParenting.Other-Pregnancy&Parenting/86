breastfeeding and supplementing with formula need some answers please im breastfeeding but also supplementing with bottles i feed my son from each breast and then give him the rest with formula he doesnt get full from my breastmilk alone big baby at birth i would like to feed my baby more breastmilk then formula and wondering is there anything i can do to make a lot more milk to fill him up any safe supplements or any way just in general pls help thanks nurse or pump frequently plan to nurse at least every to hours during the day and at least every hours at night even if you must awaken your baby time your feedings from the beginning of one to the beginning of another if your baby is available to nurse this is preferable to pumping as he will better stimulate your breasts to produce more milk allow the baby to nurse on each side until he pulls off himself or goes to sleep offer both breasts at each feeding although nursing is preferable if the baby cannot nurse directly at the breast use a hospital grade electric pump for double pumping instead such as the lactina or pump in style double pumping has been shown to increase prolactin levels prolactin is the hormone which stimulates milk production pump for minutes per session longer sessions have not been proven to be any more beneficial at increasing supply along with nursing you may want to add another pumping session or two sometime during your day you also may want to add a few extra minutes of pumping after the baby has finished nursing allow the baby to meet all of his sucking needs at the breast avoid any bottles or pacifiers during this time your baby's need to suck ensures that he spends adequate time at the breast to stimulate your supply avoid supplements including solid food water juice and formula adding these will result in your baby nursing less often and you getting less stimulation you can be sure that your baby is getting enough by counting his wet diapers and bowel movements see is my baby getting enough if your baby requires a supplement for medical reasons consider using a nursing supplementer at your breast so that you can continue to receive crucial baby stimulation snack often on foods rich in protein and calcium drink enough to satisfy your thirst forcing fluids is not necessary and may have the opposite effect any type of fluid is satisfactory rest as much as you can consider taking the baby to bed with you for the time period the rest will benefit you and the close skin to skin contact may encourage him to nurse more often some mothers have found that the herb fenugreek is helpful for increasing milk supply it works best when combined with increased frequency of nursing and or pumping you can find it at your local health food store or nutrition store the dosage is capsules times a day most moms notice an increase in supply after using it days it is safe for your baby while taking it you may notice that your perspiration and urine smell like maple syrup as fenugreek is used to give artificial maple syrup its odor some moms report diarrhea while taking it that quickly resolves once they stop taking it if you suffer from asthma your symptoms may become worse with the fenugreek dosages higher than the recommended one given above may result in hypoglycemia in some mothers if pregnant you should not use fenugreek as it may cause uterine contractions many moms use it for a quick boost to their supplies others have used it long term with no problems other herbs often recommended for increasing milk supply are blessed thistle and alfalfa for some mothers a combination of herbs seems to work better than one herb alone you may use the fenugreek blessed thistle and alfalfa in combination if you choose if the above measures do not cause a significant increase in your supply you may want to ask your doctor about reglan metoclopramide a prescription drug available in the us and sometimes prescribed for low milk supply reglan is most effective at doses of mg times a day and should not be used for any longer than weeks if you have a history of depression reglan should be avoided due to its potential side effects of depression
