just curious ok now i know you aren't suppose to have sex until after the week check up but i didn't have any stitches and was also done bleeding about a week after i had my son sorry if that's to much info my husband and i had sex with out a condom i know not the best idea i am also nursing and well i was told by the health nurse that for at least months while exclusively breastfeeding that it could be used instead of a condom or birth control i personally don't like that idea and wouldn't use it on a regular basis but i guess what i am asking is why do you hear about some people being pregnant at their week check up and they are nursing but then you hear it can be used kinda as a form of birth control as i really wouldn't want to be pregnant so soon after having my son thanks for you answers in advance that was a stupid thing for your nurse to tell you breastfeeding only reduces the chances of getting pregnant it is sooooo not a kinda form of birth control you should always use a back up and you answered your own question you hear it can be used kinda as a form of birth control there is no confirmation of it next time you should get a second opinion or research it on your own not after the fact Fertility awareness Childbirth Condom Pregnancy Abortion debate EastEnders Oral contraceptive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Family Feud Menstrual cycle Plame affair Folic acid Emergency contraception Roswell UFO incident Abortion Marilyn Monroe Neighbours Philosophical skepticism Big Brother UK series 6 Sex education Theory of conduct Premature birth Knots Landing Good Times Sexual orientation Prostate cancer Oral sex Humphrey Bogart Little Britain Anal sex Herpes simplex virus Friends Safe sex Tocopherol Social rule Sharon Tate Plame affair timeline Medical analysis of circumcision Zhao Yun Ra__lism HIV Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kurt Cobain Shaggy dog story Obstetrics Horus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Radio Yerevan Intelligent design Cancer Endometriosis Year of the Spider Laura Schlessinger Hiberno-English Heracles Target Corporation Simone Weil Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Transsexuality Melanie Wilkes 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Anne Rice Urinary incontinence Eugenics The Emancipation of Mimi Pornographic movie Married... with Children Reservoir Dogs George Costanza The Marshall Mathers LP Legal aspects of transsexualism Atlas Comics (1950s) Wheel of Fortune Stroke Highway 61 Revisited Triage Infant Password Guinea pig U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Rei Ayanami Nursing Pope Joan Miscarriage History of sex Twin Mojave people Milton H.
