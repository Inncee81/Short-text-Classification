does or slaps on the bottom count as spanking when i grow up i got spanked now and then but that was what my dad called 'proper spankings' and that was perhaps six or seven minutes over his knee today we would probebly call that excessive and i would not do that to my children said that i have on occations given my daughter a few smacks licks on her bottom but that can't be counted as spankings can it i wouldn't call one or two excessive but it depends on how hard you smack her too i too was given a swift slap across the bottom or the back of the leg if i mis behaved as i was growing up and i've grown up without any mental scarring as a result and i like to think i'm a nice young woman i went all the way through school have never been in trouble with the police worked all my life and give up my seats on busses for old ladies even though i'm weeks preg i still do it i will definatly use a swift smack on the bottom or a slap on the wrist as a punishment when my child is born i agree child abuse is not right in any form but no one should have the right to tell me how to bring up my child that includes which nappies to use cloth or disposable what time of feed to use breast or bottle or how to disaplin my child Erotic spanking Corporal punishment Hazing Buttocks Breastfeeding Professional wrestling attacks Paddle (spanking) Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Serial killer BDSM Parenting Punishment 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Diaper Fred Phelps Domestic violence Nudity Eddie Guerrero The Marshall Mathers LP Dogville Weight training James Dobson Rocko's Modern Life Piccolo Junior Saga The Marriage of Figaro Torquay United F.C.
