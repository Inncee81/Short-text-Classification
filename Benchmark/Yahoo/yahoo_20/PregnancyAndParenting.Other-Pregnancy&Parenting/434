mothers and fathers out there who are looking for a baby sitter what qualities do you look for i am i am honest good with kids have baby sat numerous times before can prepare food and give baths what qualities are you looking for in a baby sitter am i too young one of the questions i always ask is if the babysitter knows cpr and first aid because i would feel better knowing they knew what to do in an emergency besides calling or calling me there are steps that can be taken while waiting for the ambulance to arrive that can save a life you can usually take a cpr class at your local hospital but it is not usually taught for free is not too young to babysit but it helps to get the cpr certification so you are better prepared i also look at the maturity level of the individual and if they are able to pay attention and remember my instructions i look at how their appearance is because if they take care of themselves they will be a good caretaker i also ask if they make good grades in school to make sure they are at least somewhat intelligent enough to know what to do in a crisis i look for someone who is responsible and who will not be on the phone all night or eat all my food or go through my things it is always a plus when the babysitter straightens the house a little before i get there Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Day care Pitaten Paramedic Emergency medical technician Triage Infantilism American Red Cross First aid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Emergency Medical Services Emergency telephone number Japanese tea ceremony Ambulance Drowning Everwood Nurse Baby Blues Education in the United States The Fairly OddParents For Better or For Worse Jon Secada Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Myocardial infarction Breastfeeding Commander Keen Community emergency response team Education Trip sitter High school Night (book) National Health Service Generation Y About a Boy Swami Vivekananda The Sims Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Germany Kodocha Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Hyperthermia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Little Britain Childbirth British Civil Service Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Calvin and Hobbes Boston Public Medical emergency EastEnders Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus New Kid on the Block Hikikomori Mina Mongoose Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina The Shining (film) Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Lifeguard The Legend of Zelda series characters Care Bears Education in Hong Kong St. John Ambulance Education in the People's Republic of China Social rule John Howard Yoder Fasting Humphrey Bogart College admissions John Kerr Software engineering Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Adoption Ayyavazhi mythology Intelligent design movement Hogwarts God Ecology Trinity College, Dublin Full Metal Panic?
