how can i feel not weird about babysitting tomorrow i'm going over this lady's house who i'm going to babysit for and she wants to show me around get me used to her baby and everything but i just feel weird being in someone's house who i don't really know i met them and they're really nice people and i definitely want to do it and i don't like have a bad feeling about it or anything it's just weeird because i've never babysat before any tips well first make sure you know how to take care of their baby lol ask them for tips on what the baby likes like food and when she needs her diaper changed i personally think that it is easier to babysit little babies compared to little kids if you want to feel more comfortable maybe ask them if a friend or family member like a cousin can come and stay with you since it is the first time your babysitting their kid babysitting is fun and you shouldnt be worried because it will get easier and you will get used to the people Diaper Care Bears The Fairly OddParents Jon Secada Doug Infantilism Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) AFI 100 Years series Baby Blues Day care Humphrey Bogart Boy Meets World Kyle Broflovski EastEnders Rugrats FoxTrot Social rule The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy "Weird Al" Yankovic Kimi Finster The Beach Boys Everwood The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Pure Pwnage Avenue Q Radiohead Friends Stewie Griffin Spidey Super Stories The Critic Fecal incontinence The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Boy band Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Breastfeeding Melanie Wilkes The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Vandread The O.C.
