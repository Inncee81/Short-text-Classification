contraceptive pill or stick with the rhythm method posted this in womens health but havent received any answers yet i'm yrs old have been sexually active for yrs with the same partner we live together today i went to get my first prescription for the pill we've been using the rhythm method for three years and though i know it's not perfect we haven't yet had any scares i told the dr i wanted to go on the pill for everything contraceptive pimple control to lighten up my periods they're normally extremely heavy painful and that i wanted to try yasmin but he prescribed me levlen instead reading up about it i'm concerned about the number of women who have experienced a sudden rash of acne have become moody or gone off sex or even gone off their partners all together some people have even become pregnant on it should i bother taking it i have never become pregnant on the rhythm method i dont want to mess up my cycle for no reason what's your experience with the pill or rhythm method i had lots of trouble with the pill which i went on long before i was sexually active to help with my periods i went through different brands before i ended up getting pregnant after i switched to a th brand after having a heavy week long period on yasmin i never had any acne weight gain mood swing reactions on any of the brands my only problem with them all was they did not regulate my period it was still painful heavy and as unscheduled as ever i never tried the rhythm method because with my irregularity i never have any idea when i might be ovulating or not if you're doing it successfully i don't see any problem with continuing what you're going but the rhythm method is probably the single most unreliable method of birth control so unless you could support a child if you did happen to get pregnant i would use a back up method it doesn't have to be the pill it can be condoms spermicide the shot or even the patch whatever you like what i use now is an iud i have the mirena brand which can be left in place for up to years it's been in a year and a half now according to the doctors and all the research i did on it before i had it inserted it's got a better success rate than surgical sterilization Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception Acne Condom Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual abstinence Intrauterine device Pregnancy Abortion Abortion debate Sexual intercourse Sex education Puberty Methamphetamine Baldness treatments Oral sex Safe sex Miscarriage Menstrual cup Endometriosis Prostate cancer Guinea pig Childbirth Sexual revolution Psoriasis Depo Provera Polycystic ovary syndrome Antidepressant Isotretinoin Teenage pregnancy Urinary incontinence EastEnders Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Diaphragm (contraceptive) AIDS Herpes simplex virus Masturbation In vitro fertilisation Maprotiline Obstetrics History of sex Malaria Clinical depression Electrophysiology Ovarian cyst Eugenics Alanis Morissette Paroxetine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Medical analysis of circumcision Folic acid Transactional analysis Migraine Tattoo Sleep Growth hormone treatment Apollo 8 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medical prescription Infantilism Borderline personality disorder Gonorrhoea Sex toy Coitus interruptus Medicine Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Harm reduction Theodicy Ovulation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Human sexuality Tobacco smoking Central processing unit Sterilization (surgical procedure) Human penis size Margaret Sanger Cannabis (drug) Strap-on dildo Schizophrenia Caffeine Feminist movement Premature ejaculation Pornographic movie
