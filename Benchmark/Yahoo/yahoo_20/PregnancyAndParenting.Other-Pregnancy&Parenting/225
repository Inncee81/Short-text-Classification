can someone help me understand ok i don't understand how if a pregnant women falls on her stomach or has trauma to the stomach she can lose her baby late in pregnancy my friend was telling me of how a woman who was months pregnant and her boyfriend slammed her into the ground she lost her baby but i don't understand how when there is so much protection around the kid such as the amniotic fluid then a kid would come out or die and why would someone want to do that to their baby and girl it is true that the baby in the mothers womb is surrounded by amniotic fluid but just like any other fluid it takes the shape of its container if the mother was slammed to the ground her stomach would receive the impact of hitting the ground and the fluid would flow away from the baby the babies head probably hit the pavement or the head was forced backwards or sideways so hard that its neck was broken i am sure that the mother was hurt as well the babies placenta could have been torn from the mother in which case no oxygen nutrients blood etc would reach the baby as for how anyone could do this to another person i have never understood that on a personal note i had a loved one that was beaten so badly by her husband when she was months pregnant that the baby came out in more than pieces the mother had broken ribs ruptured spleen punctured lungs and many more injuries Childbirth Abortion Professional wrestling throws EastEnders Miscarriage Professional wrestling holds Pregnancy Fetus Breech birth Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Stroke Equine conformation One Life to Live Suplex Neighbours Abortion debate Pneumonia Cytomegalovirus Lung Kodocha Kurt Angle Drowning Friends In vitro fertilisation Aortic dissection Premature birth Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Jennifer Lopez Boston Public Diving The Shining (film) Reptile Placenta One Tree Hill (TV series) Charmed Sex and the City Twin Rib Intact dilation and extraction Jam (TV series) Stomach cancer Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling aerial techniques Steffi Graf Motorcycle helmet Tammy Wynette Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary First aid Lymphatic system Circulatory system Britney Spears Hollyoaks Amy Dumas Jon Secada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coeliac disease Syringomyelia Madonna (entertainer) Snake Eddie Guerrero Eye Comanche Days of our Lives Pregnancy (mammals) Decompression sickness Childfree Birth weight Infant respiratory distress syndrome Stewie Griffin Shock Oral sex Professional wrestling slang Pete Sampras YuYu Hakusho Sami Brady Everwood Endometriosis Glen Jacobs The Amber Spyglass Caesarean section Guinea pig Blood (computer game) Infectious mononucleosis Tupac Shakur Turner syndrome Robin Ventura Mary, the mother of Jesus
