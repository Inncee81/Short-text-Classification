why are most teachers in higher learning establishments liberal i mean when my son went to harvard he came back and wanted to become a bread maker in italy he believed in reperations and actually believed that anyone who is afraid of the dark is racist and that black children are afraid of the light but luckily he got a job at ubs so all the crap he believed has ended they had to go to school to get there they spent to year kissing the ashes of various faculty members they have told the same lie so many times to appease a professor that they end up believing it themselves most of the conservatives of my generation did our post graduate work in vietnam that left the liberal elements to go to canada england or elsewhere and get fancy diplomas in underwater basket weaving then it was all is forgiven and a blanket amnesty was issued to the cowards they came home with their fancy diplomas and that's were it started i do encourage you to have some patience liberals are killing off million perspective voters a year in the form of abortions the only way liberals can add to the voter rolls it to add to the welfare rolls in another or years i anticipate a significant change the conservatives took the house of representative in the very year the first aborted babies would have voted is that a coincidence the last election was not a liberal overpowering of conservatives it was a lot of conservatives who were pissed off and fired their representatives Liberal Democrats (UK) Politics of Canada Canadian federal election, 2004 Democracy EastEnders Plurality electoral system Canadian federal election, 1993 Elections in the United Kingdom Alan Keyes Tom Brinkman Margaret Thatcher Conservative Party (UK) Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) Paul Martin Tom DeLay Democratic Party (United States) Fancy Crane Knots Landing Franklin D.
