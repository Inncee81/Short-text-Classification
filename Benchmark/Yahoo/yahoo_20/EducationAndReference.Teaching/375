how to write a professional yet practical dress code for elementary teachers i need help writing a dress code for teachers at an elementary school last year our dress code was pretty lax but the rules that were there were not enforced and toward the end of the year there were parent complaints that some of the teachers were not dressing professionally enough to suit them so the principal has now made a very rigid dress code and we teachers are not allowed to wear any capri pants no open toed shoes pants are supposed to be regular length and have inch of loose material around the thighs and buttocks shoes must be closed toe but not tennis shoes nothing sleeveless nothing see through i mean some of this stuff is self explanatory like who would really wear low cut tops or tight jeans to work with children but this is ridiculous we live in florida we teach year olds and we are expected to stand outside during mid day on the playground with no shade and supervise recess we are expected to get down on the kids' level in degree heat with long pants and closed shoes the kids are required to wear uniforms but those uniforms are short sleeved polo shirts and they have a choice of wearing the shirt with long pants shorts that are within inches of the knee or skorts for girls and the parents made the dress code for the kids we didn't we teachers are trying to convince the principal that we can wear capri pants and nice sandals and still look professional so my question really is how can the dress code be worded so that capri and gaucho type pants some of which are very professional can be included but outfits that are too casual are excluded i mean someone in a nice rayon sleeveless sundress looks much more professional than a person in a polo shirt and khaki pants but the dress code says we need to wear the latter not to mention it's very difficult to even find long pants and closed shoes here in south florida where it's hot pretty much year round help yeah and about the men the only two men on staff are the pe teahers and they are allowed to wear any shorts and t shirts they want and tennis shoes obviously the principal just asked them to use good judgement and not wear anything too short or too tight hmmm doesn't seem fair does it any teachers how is your dress code worded yes a union would be helpful but this is a charter school not a public school i would express to my principal that i spend a lot of time on the floor painting and doing other messy things to wear some of the clothes you mentioned yes its important to look nice but it is also important to be comfortable enough to do your job also if you look too uppity you can't really relate to some of your underprivledged students seems like a really dumb thing to worry about after all we have important issues to think about with our kids Bob Jones University Social aspects of clothing Skirt and dress Suit (clothes) Shirt Jesuit College Preparatory School Irish dance Recess (TV series) School uniform Shorts Kimono Softball Singapore Police Force Japanese tea ceremony Culture of the United States Sento Trousers Jeans Sock Raffles Institution Little Britain Cowboy Volleyball Canadian Armed Forces SpongeBob SquarePants Beavis and Butt-head Teen Girl Squad Buttocks Aerial (dance move) Clothing Paul Is Dead The Warriors Strap-on dildo Basketball Marching band Codename: Kids Next Door Corset Pantyhose French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Recurring South Park characters Figure skating Doug High-heeled shoe Clown Humphrey Bogart Plastic Education in Japan Textile manufacturing Academic dress of Oxford University Education in the People's Republic of China The Fairly OddParents Diving suit Negima Diving Theory of conduct Nudity Great Teacher Onizuka Scrubs Child pornography Hijab Okashina Okashi Russian joke Customs and etiquette of Japan Fair use Hakama Marilyn Monroe Charter school Trailer Park Boys The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Mixed martial arts St. John Ambulance Jackass: The Movie Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Stairway No Child Left Behind Act Skinhead White-collar worker Education in the United States One Tree Hill (TV series) Drag racing Jewish services Hogwarts Eton College Teacher's Pet (Disney) Heavy metal fashion Empire Burlesque Stocking
