what do i need to do to become a primary school teacher like grades in gcse's do i do alevels then what do i do and so on would reallly appriciate it d x you need to get at least grade c in english maths and science at gcse level a levels are often the requested route by universities but some teaching degree courses accept students with qualifications such as a btec in childcare check different universities' requirements once you have done either a levels or grade equivalent you go to university where you do a degree in primary education with qts qualified teacher status some of these teach you a bit about all primary school subjects and you do approximately teaching practices each year for or years and some offer you a specialism so if you are particularly good at one subject you can study that to a higher level if you would rather do a degree in one subject you can do that first in pretty much any subject you like and then you apply to do a one year course called a pgce which is like a primary education degree but compacted into one year this also involves teaching practices where you have to plan lessons carry them out mark work evaluate your teaching set yourself and your pupils targets etc there is also something called the gtp or graduate teacher programme which you need a degree to do and involves training while working in one specific school i believe you apply to the local education authority for this wheres with pgces and degrees that give qts you apply to universities via ucas whichever training route you go down once you are trained you are not fully qualified until you have carried out your first terms of teaching i hope this helped i did a pgce and it was very stressful a word of warning almost everyone i was on the course with had a bad experience during teaching practice because of unsupportive class teachers no matter how hard you try you can't please some of them you just have to jump through hoops and look forward to getting your own class at the end of it all for more information about the routes into teaching look on the teacher training agency website A-level Postgraduate Certificate in Education UCAS Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States College General Certificate of Secondary Education Master's degree Education in Germany High school Education Education in England Education in Australia Education in Romania No Child Left Behind Act Juris Doctor IB Diploma Programme Education in Taiwan Education in Singapore Academic degree Education in the Republic of Ireland Nurse Lawyer Secondary education in France Education in Japan College admissions Physician Kingston University Professor Danish Folkeskole Education Education in Malaysia Doctor of Philosophy Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Doctorate Institute of technology City and Guilds of London Institute Education in Finland Tripartite System SAT Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Columbia University Education in France Secondary education in Japan Homeschooling Law school Alexander Technique Paralegal Advanced Placement Program Intelligent design movement Bologna process Education in Austria Junior Certificate Software engineering A Course In Miracles Higher Commercial Examination Programme Gymnasium (Denmark) National Certificate of Educational Achievement Higher (Scottish) Physical therapy Scientology beliefs and practices GED Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX) Student loan Leaving Certificate Waldorf Education Standardized testing Bristol Grammar School Trinity College, Dublin Baccalaur__at Reiki New York State Department of Education Open University Chinese University of Hong Kong Academia Hogwarts Education in Canada Barrister Australian Qualifications Framework Education in South Korea Rabbi Higher Preparatory Examination (HF) Scottish Qualifications Authority Apprenticeship Harrow School Martial art Education in Northern Ireland Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Higher education in Japan Tianjin University
