middle school classroom guidelines or rules what are some of the guidelines you have for your class and what are the consequences for not abiding by them it really depends on where you are in your career and your style in the classroom i am just about to start my fifth year of teaching and everything has changed every year overall you need to set guidelines for everything regardless of where you are in your career since middle schoolers aren't capable of remembering simple things like how do i go get a tissue do i ask or do i just get up that was the biggest thing that i learned in my first year they need to be told how to do everything at least once as for rules it's really just the basics that we've always had in school if you have to pick one thing for all of the kids to pay attention to it's respect there are several ways to show respect and if the kids are focused on respecting one another you and themselves they won't cause you any huge problems as for consequences it can really be different for every student i do a lot of one on one conversations about behaviors if that fails with a student i get a bit more severe by using my school's hierarchy of discipline i will admit there are times when the consequences for one student are nothing like the consequences for another student based on whether or not i've had problems with the student in the past i'll never punish a student more strictly because of their behavior but i may punish a student less than the hierarchy prescribes simply because that isn't a normal behavior from that student my first year was a very tough year and there were several times when a student openly swore during class and received a detention or office referral based on the offense but there was a case of one of my star students lashing back at a classmate by yelling you're starting to f ing p me off she had never once caused me a problem that year and i was stunned to hear what she had said i called her out of the room and discussed it with her how her classmate had annoyed her and how her reaction was inappropriate for the classroom she was very apologetic and knew that her response was inappropriate rather than write an office referral like i'm sure that i had for another student that year i sent her to the guidance office for a few minutes to cool down before coming back to class she never gave me any more problems and i'm certain that this was handled as well as it could have been handled the bottom line for consequences is this set up a plan for how you are going to handle problems in the classroom and follow it based on the circumstances if it's a case of a kid that is usally a pain in the neck follow it strictly if it's a kid that doesn't give you hassle every day take it easy on the kid they'll appreciate it and respect you more in the long run my plan works like this st offense verbal correction nd offense conference outside with student rd offense time out of the room th offense call home th offense office referral just a note my state's wellness policy doesn't allow us to detain students during lunch time so detention isn't an option also sometimes that th offense is a great time to have the student call home and explain to his her parent what they did to warrant a call home it embarasses the hell out of them in front of their classmates and gets their parents nice and upset that they had to get a call during the middle of the day this is incredibly effective as usual extreme circumstances call for skipping a few steps in the hierarchy if a kid punches a kid or does something to injure another student they don't need four chances they're going to the office all in all it really comes down to you knowing your students and what will work for them i would suggest sticking to a plan of action rigidly for the first several weeks of school and then when you know which kids are repeat offenders and which aren't you'll know how to deal with them individually heck sometimes it just comes down to letting a kid know that he's acting like a yutz and he'll cut the proverbial crap Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Milton H.
