applied math i am in the process of creating a homework project for my students i want them to research a topic and present on it the topics have to do with how math has affected sailing in the past years i came up with the gps but am drawing blanks any ideas that you can throw out there would be appreciated thanks in advance first thing i would do is a google search for web quests about sailing i started to do them to send you some links but it all depends on what grade you are teaching if they are already out there why recreate the wheel if that doesn't work for you do some research on sailing and see what you find maybe that will generate some ideas for you when you mention sailing the first thing that comes to mind for me is pythagorean theorem that doesn't do anything with the history unless the sails have become bigger or smaller have they added more sails how does wind speed effect the sails you would probably need to factor in the area of the sails too honestly i do not know anything about sailing so i may be way off base here as a last resort i would choose something other than sailing if you have a difficult time finding the information odds are your students will too i suggest doing a search for web quests that are grade level appropriate you will be able to integrate technology into the lesson which the kids love my th graders complete web quests for me on a quarterly basis Mathematics Graduate school Theory of conduct Education in Romania Grade (education) Extreme Programming Computer Education in the United States GED Technology Luminiferous aether Theodore Kaczynski History Halting problem Fermat's last theorem Economic inequality Microeconomics Second language acquisition World Wide Web Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Hunter College High School A-level Education in Portugal Economics Spacecraft propulsion Central processing unit Master's degree Solar variation Species W.
