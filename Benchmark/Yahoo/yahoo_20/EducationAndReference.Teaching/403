why are the school systems in america making science teachers teach evolution evolution is a theory just like creation is they both have evidence that supports them but also have evidence that prove it's not true i believe in creation and most of the people that usually end up in my class do too and when the teacher tells us that it's a new lesson we always get into an argument about how it's not fair that we have to listen to this evolution bull do u think they should make teachers teach that subject or not teach it being that it's just an opinion and do u think it's fair that they're making students learn it when they don't want to one could argue that evolution is a religion because it is faith based like creation it can not be proven because science can not test it to say evolution is science is false unfortunatly it is presented as such and many people are made unware of it's many falicies neither creationism nor evolution should be taught in public schools since there is a seperation of church and state that many people like to spout about when you talk about creation being taught so too should evolution not be taught Creation and evolution in public education Creation science Intelligent design movement Creationism Teach the Controversy Kitzmiller v.
