first day of school icebreakers i'm starting my first year of teaching in a month and i'm wondering what to do with my class on the first day of school i'm teaching social studies classes will only be about an hour long that day i thought about doing an icebreaker activity any ideas i hate icebreakers because they put you on the spot and no one will remember your name afterwards anyway but if you had an nontraditional icebreaker such as a game and you put the children in a group then this would allow the children to become familiar with each other and you can assess their ability to work as a team and also make it easier on yourself to remember their names Icebreaker Experiential education Education in the United States Education in Australia Icebreaker (novel) Education Propaedeutic value of Esperanto IB Diploma Programme Graduate school Education in Romania Harrow School Drama Homeschooling Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Education in Germany Kindergarten Nuclear marine propulsion Social rule Time Out of Mind Education in Hong Kong MV Caribou Cruising (maritime) Education in the People's Republic of China United States Naval reactor United States Coast Guard Academy Eric Bischoff Alexander Technique Contract bridge Yao Ming United States Coast Guard Southern Poverty Law Center Education in Japan Homophobia H__sker D__ Pittsburgh Steelers Caulfield Grammar School Standardized testing The Origin of Species Theory of multiple intelligences Generation Y Canadian Coast Guard Secondary education in Japan Education in France Social class Icebreaker (Suvorov) Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Master's degree USCGC Bramble (WLB-392) The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Memorial Stadium, Clemson Second language acquisition Softball Hunter College High School Church of Christ Multilingual Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Teachers (film) Kodocha Bah__'__ Faith and Education Culture Secondary education in France Blood on the Tracks Danish Pre-School Education Buddhist texts Galactic Civilizations Georgia Institute of Technology Extreme Programming 1957 World Series Beavis and Butt-head Charles Darwin's education Miyamoto Musashi Literacy A-level Ravi Shastri Troy Glaus Anti-Mormonism Juris Doctor Socrates Evolutionism Chinese calendar Neverwinter Nights Satchel Paige Norway national football team Education in Singapore Karl Marx MV Abegweit Sydney Riot of 1879 Special education Scientific method Columbia University Dog training Max Weber Eight hour day York University Tripartite System Left-wing politics Cornelia Rau
