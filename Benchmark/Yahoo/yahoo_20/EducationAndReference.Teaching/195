teacher visiting the homes of students during the summer opinions from teachers parents please i received a letter in the mail today from the nd grade teacher that my daughter will have this school year in the letter she states that she will be calling us within the next week to schedule a time that she can come to our home meet with us our daughter who will be her student she says that she likes to see what kind of environment that her students are coming from also she says speaking to the student now please think of some things that you can tell me or show me such as your room or a special toy there are teachers in this elementary school this one teacher is the only one that does these summer home visits prior to the school year i feel that this is very inappropriate and that she is just being nosy the school is having an open house days before school starts anyway that is when we will meet her i feel this is an invasion of privacy etc should i contact the principal about this i hate to be a trouble maker opinions thoughts thanks i know i can just tell her no when she calls but i worry that she will think that i have something to hide which i don't my husband i are happily married with three children we have a nice home so how we will look does not concern me i just think that she is trying to form opinions about her students before she has them in class my daughter is a straight a student with excellent behavior and is reading higher than her grade level surely the teacher aleady knows this info so why come and check the home i just think this is strange i am a teacher and i think you should give her the benefit of the doubt during inservices i've been told that going to see the students in their homes shows you care that the parents and students will look back on that extra effort and appreciate it that it will help to build rapport faster etc i would not jump to the conclusion that she's looking for evidence about which students come from bad homes i also think you should feel free to decline Education in the People's Republic of China Kindergarten Education in Japan One Tree Hill (TV series) Education in the United States Grade (education) Primary education No Child Left Behind Act Columbine High School massacre Education in Germany Kodocha Great Teacher Onizuka Secondary education in Japan Brown v.
