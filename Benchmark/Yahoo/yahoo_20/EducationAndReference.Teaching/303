should i reply to an e mail from my tutor at uni i had a little chat with my tutor about my english problem on friday and just received an e mail from him and the e mail is about his suggestion to get advice from the course coordinator and that's it should i reply it i felt a bit disappointed cos i thought he could help me and i feel that he doesnt really care about me sad oh no i didnt think of the relationship thing at all omg he's like yrs older than me m i sounds like i like him i just want ppl care about me i know uni is different from high skool but i used to stick with the teachers at university tutor pupil relationships are always more adult the reason he probably didn't answer you is because tutors often don't think that it is their responsibility to help out their students in this way they see it as your advisors job and would rather you asked someone else you see they don't have any vested interest don't worry about responding to the e mail you should send a simple one back saying thanks for your advice don't worry not all tutors are like this some actually want to help their students although from experience english departments are always the worst for support don't let this put you off asking for help again in fact from experience i found that the students who were persistent were the ones who the tutors liked most just don't be overly persistent be friendly and maintain a professional adult relationship show that you are willing to be friendly but see them on a level and remember that you pay fees for those guy's help it is not their duty but if they are nice enough and have the time they should be able to help you out just remember don't expect them to go through the work with you but do expect them to give you any tips on books that you could read that might help clarify the problem for you or websites that would help if the problem is academic suggest this when you e mail him Social rule Graduate school Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Plame affair Theory of conduct GED Monarchy in Canada Infantilism Little Britain Education in the People's Republic of China Current teachings of Prem Rawat Adult attention-deficit disorder Humphrey Bogart Neopets Education in the United States One Tree Hill (TV series) Thomas Hobbes Sydney Riot of 1879 College Internet troll Milton H.
