fake frappuccino recipes i am looking for a recipe to make an imitation orange creme frappuccino and any other recipes for imitation fraps would be greatly appreciated thanks the first step to making a frappuccino is buying high quality coffee you can buy authentic starbucks coffee or you can shop around for less expensive coffee if you really want to save some money if you can you should buy the coffee beans the coffee beans are not only less expensive but fresh ground coffee will make your frappuccino taste even better once you have your fresh ground coffee it's time to start brewing frappuccinos use double strength coffee to give it an added kick this means that to make a frappuccino you have to measure two tablespoons of ground coffee per serving in your coffee maker once the coffee has been brewed chill it in the refrigerator it works best if you brew the coffee the night before so that you will have your frappuccino the next morning now that you have your chilled coffee add three tablespoons of granulated sugar one cup of milk low fat or skim milk works fine and two cups of ice in a blender these measurements assume you are making two grande frappuccinos if you are making more or less please adjust the measurements accordingly blend the ingredients together on high speed until the ice is crushed and the drink is smooth pour the frappuccinos into two ounce glasses and enjoy caramel and mocha frappuccinos if you want a caramel or mocha frappuccino just add three tablespoons of caramel topping or three tablespoons of chocolate syrup or orange cream yogurt oz that's all it takes to make your own frappuccino Chocolate Espresso Tea Milk Breakfast Starbucks Kit Kat Milkshake Tofu Dairy Cold Stone Creamery Mayonnaise Turkish coffee Cheese Mai Tai Cuisine of Denmark Yoghurt Japanese cuisine Bubble tea Chili con carne Maple syrup Muesli Instant coffee Bread Champagne (beverage) Sake Cha chaan teng Oreo Drink Martini cocktail Cuisine of Malaysia Hong Kong-style milk tea Russian cuisine Cooking weights and measures Ramen Vegetarian cuisine Vinegar German cuisine Cinnabon Brewery Cuisine of Singapore Wine Pancake Cajun cuisine Beer Sugar Mooncake Caffeine Cake Brewing Heath bar Food Soup Cider Soy protein Rice pudding Curry Olive oil French cuisine Moonshine Gatorade Soy sauce Cheesecake Coffeehouse Apple pie Coffea Cream (food) Guinness Questionable Content Bengali cuisine Alcoholic beverage Gelato Jewish cuisine Scotch whisky Indian filter coffee Tortilla McDonald's Cuisine of Brazil Dairy product Barbecue Cappuccino Peruvian cuisine Hamburger Stout beer Twix Ketchup Sangr__a Chicken soup Cadbury Schweppes Lactose intolerance
