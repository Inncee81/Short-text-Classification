how to make the best iced tea i bought an iced tea maker so i don't always have to run to the store to buy more i just can't seem to get it right i have been trying to make green tea with honey and sweet tea with splenda i am thinking about trying to add lemon to either of these anyone have tips for the right amount of these ingredients to add and the right amount of teabags my recipe for making iced tea doesn't involve an iced tea maker but perhaps you could adapt this to the machine i put about a quart of water the amount doesn't matter at all and approximately a cup of sugar in a cooking pot and heat until it boils you could adjust the amount of sugar or use an equivalent amount of artificial sweetener depending on your taste once the water starts to boil i add either four of the large family size tea bags or regular tea bags and immediately remove the pot from the burner let the bags steep in the hot water for at least minutes but an hour or more just makes it better then take your concentrated tea mixture and pour into a gallon pitcher or bottle fill the bottle to the top with tap water and you'll have perfect southern style sweet tea Tea Rum Ice cream Japanese tea ceremony Cuisine of the Philippines Japanese cuisine Beer Hong Kong-style milk tea Halva Bread Barbecue Yerba mate Turkish coffee Cider Russian cuisine Breakfast Soft drink Chocolate Lemonade Maple syrup Sugar Honey Caffeine Milk Cantonese cuisine Ketchup Horehound Champagne (beverage) Sweet tea Soup Bubble tea Idli Cajun cuisine Sake Food preservation Espresso Wine making Fujian tea ceremony Chili con carne Peruvian cuisine Bong Yoghurt Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Herbal tea Martini cocktail Alcoholic beverage Carbon dioxide Cuisine of Singapore Cha chaan teng German cuisine Vinegar Wine Cooking weights and measures Sugar substitute Ramen Coca-Cola Kitchen Single malt Scotch Cuisine of Denmark Gatorade Dumpling Pancake Cocaine Sangr__a Basil Bengali cuisine Bacon Pot Noodle Soy milk Water Portable stove Apple pie Teapot Pizza Diet soda Dialysis Healthy eating Rebreather Diet Coke In-N-Out Burger Slow cooker Korean cuisine Water purification Rooibos Cuisine of Malaysia Houseplant Chai Egg (food) Sulfuric acid Bagel Thermal power station
