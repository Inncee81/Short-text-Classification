tap water question i usually drink purified water but sometimes the delivery is late and i have to drink boiled water that has been cooled in the fridge obviously why is it that when i drink boiled tap water i usually experience some discomfort in my chest area sort of like a mild heartburn but more frequent tap water is loaded with chlorine and fluoride so if your body is not used to these chemicals then it may give you some discomfort the local governments tell you fluoride is good for your teeth but fluoride doesn't work that way it is a topical acting chemical that is like if you got a cut and ate a tube of neosporin to heal it fluoride is a waste product of many industrial processes and dumping it into your water is a cheap way for companies to get rid of it Hydrochloric acid Tooth enamel Fluoride therapy Fluorine Hydrogen chloride Cocaine Water Brewery Nuclear power Tooth Plastic Bottled water Dental caries Sulfuric acid Aluminium Chlorine Ammonia Coffee Titanium Fossil fuel power plant Maple syrup Nuclear reactor Vitamin C Chlorination Acetic acid Hydrogen economy Molten salt reactor Sea-Monkey Hydrofluoric acid Nitric acid Methamphetamine Fractional distillation Volcano Haloalkane Wood pulp Sewage treatment Heartburn Beer Calcium Hard water Menstrual cycle Gastroesophageal reflux disease Silver Halogen Hypoglycemia Ozone depletion Radium Mercury (element) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ice cream Ramen Use of poison gas in World War I Explosive material Fountain Body piercing Asthma Hydrogen Hazardous waste Town gas Toothpaste Alcohol Air conditioning Energy development Sodium hypochlorite Plutonium Alternative biochemistry Ozone hole Hiberno-English Sugar Petroleum Japanese tea ceremony Autonomous building Mineral Smoke-screen Water pollution Hemp Allergy Zinc Urine Krypton Sauna Conjunctivitis Chocolate Nutrition Drink Tofu Boiling point Fecal incontinence Alcoholic beverage Water supply Radon Rooibos Survival skills Distillation Dairy Hydrogen peroxide
