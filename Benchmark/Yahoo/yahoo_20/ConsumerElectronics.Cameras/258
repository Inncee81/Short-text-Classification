how can i find the claim number for my camera i'm sending my camera in to be fixed and i have to fill out a paper and it says claim number and i can't find it anywhere since you didn't give very much information this answer is just a guess most manufacturers and even retailers require you to call them up before you send back your equipment to be fixed that way they'll know what to do with it once they receive it the claim number that it's asking for is probably the number that the customer service rep gives you to mark on the paperwork and possibly the packaging itself so that once it gets to the manufacturer they'll know what department to send the camera to so if you haven't contacted the manufacturer and you're trying to get them to fix it call them if you don't and just send it they'll probably just send it back with a nice letter that tells you to call them first Retailer Telephone exchange GSM services Morse Code Internet fraud Bluetooth Plame affair United States Postal Service FairTax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Best Buy Data retention Jumpstart 3rd Grade Road-rule enforcement camera Musical Instrument Digital Interface IP Multimedia Subsystem Joseph C.
