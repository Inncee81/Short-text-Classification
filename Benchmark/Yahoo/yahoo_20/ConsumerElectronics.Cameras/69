cleaning the inside of a digital camera with air i've got a sony dsc p and it has a history of getting dust inside the lens on the sensor i know you aren't supposed to take any compact cam all the way apart but i know people have done it i'm considering either taking it apart to clean the sensor or blowing some compressed air in the lens joints to see if it may help any thoughts might help might hurt unless you can get to the sensor itself you're tossing the dice as to whether you blow stuff off the sensor or force crud already partly inside onto the sensor Digital photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Camcorder Photography Sensor Camera Macro photography Digital camera back Floppy disk DVD Digital camera Movie projector Canon EOS Nikon Corporation Digital cinematography Hard disk Eye Point and shoot camera Raw image format Combine (Half-Life 2) Four Thirds System Airbag Panavision PlayStation 2 Diesel engine Hardware random number generator Sony Exposure (photography) Widescreen Compact audio cassette Motion capture Blu-ray Disc Full frame digital SLR Black hole Advanced Photo System Foveon X3 sensor RQ-1 Predator Fuel injection Shutter speed B-47 Stratojet Vignetting Zoom lens Galileo spacecraft MP3 Professional wrestling throws Professional video camera Mariner program Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Single-lens reflex camera Konica Minolta Canon EOS-20Da Delta IV rocket Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Carburetor Canon EOS-300D Videotape Mars Exploration Rover Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) IMAX Autofocus USB flash drive Bad Wolf Television Cassini-Huygens Two-stroke cycle Japanese toilet Clementine mission Nikon D70 Volleyball Compact disc Epson Seiko Corporation Photographic lens Smoke detector Leica Royal Air Force F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Canon EOS-20D Washroom Tank Stirling engine Reflecting telescope High-definition television Nuclear weapon design Timeline of invention Touchscreen Glossary of firefighting equipment DV The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Contax 35 mm film Wind RFID Dodge Neon Professional wrestling holds Rangefinder camera Vacuum cleaner Medium format Computer vision Movie camera
