trying to source extension tubes i have a nikon d s slr and use a nikon mm dx macro lens for my macro work i'm trying to find a set of extension tubes that will allow me to increase magnification the issue is that the tubes need to link seamlessly with the lens and the camera electronics so that i can retain control over aperture exposure and if possible with the autofocus though that latter need isn't essential despite a lot of hunting around i can't seem to find any manufacturer who is willing to certify their extension tubes as being able to provide this need is anyone using extension tubes successfully with this combination of equipment if so i'd really appreciate a recommendation as to who makes those extension tubes so i can get a set for myself i'm not hung up on an exact match if you are using a nikon digital slr and successfully using tubes with a nikon dx lens and this combination gives you control over aperture and exposure and maybe autofocus that's endorsement enough thanks i knew about the nikon problems so it has to be a third party maker like tamron kenko promaster or others the problem is none will certify that the combination works and i've not known anyone who's tried them to tell me if they do work or what problems i might have to expect nikon pk a pk and pk provide aperture indexing but do not support auto focus you will not get exposure metering on the d with ai lenses which is the standard design of these extension tubes i have not heard of a nikon extension tube that will give you what you want non oem extension tubes may provide what you are looking for but i am not aware of any that do Nikon Corporation Konica Minolta Contax Digital single-lens reflex cameras Leica Macro photography Canon EOS Canon EF lens mount Canon T90 Photographic lens Nikon FM2 Single-lens reflex camera Nikon FE2 Nikon FM Digital photography Olympus (company) Binoculars Rangefinder camera Point and shoot camera Depth of field Camera Nikon D70 Television Eyepiece Telescope Photography Enlarger Aperture M16 (rifle) Schneider Kreuznach Cosina Canon FD Pentax Autofocus Anamorphic widescreen IMAX Advanced Photo System Oscilloscope Digital camera Antenna (radio) Hard disk Camcorder Metering mode Canon EOS-300D Floppy disk Street photography Lisp programming language Aberration in optical systems Canon T70 Cinematography Lighting IBM PC compatible DVD Reflecting telescope Transistor PDP-11 Exposure (photography) Film speed Blu-ray Disc Lightsaber Galileo spacecraft Zoom lens Lens (optics) F-number Movie projector Vacuum tube Optical fiber History of telescopes 135 film Panavision Secure Digital card E85 Color temperature Microsoft Windows Bass guitar MIM-23 Hawk Photographic film Rebreather Zeiss Amateur astronomy Electrical engineering Solar power Canon EOS-20D Central processing unit Thermal power station Stereoscopy Widescreen Ultraviolet Image scanner Semiconductor device M60 machine gun Cathode ray tube
