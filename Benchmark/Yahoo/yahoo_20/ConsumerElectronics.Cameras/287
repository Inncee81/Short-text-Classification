i need help with my nikon d camera please i feel so dumb i think turning the flash on and off is confusing and when i take pictures some of them look very blurry and idk how to fix that i also do not understand the masp thing i've read the manuel but i dont get it help before you swim in the ocean practice in the pool as dr sam said use auto and let the camera make the basic decisions be sure to use a high enough iso or higher to avoid movement blur also learn to hold the camera correctly way too many photographers hold a dslr like they would hold a book with both hands on the camera body hey it's a nikon not harry potter lol hold the body with your right hand poised over the shutter button and your left hand supporting the lens this prevents the lens from moving up and down also stand with one foot behind at an angle and the other foot in front think ballet this give you a more stable stance and minimized the vertical axis movement that naturally comes from a two feet aside stance finally don't smash down on the shutter button press slowly and be sure your shutter speed is at least matches the focal length of your lens for example if you're using a mm lens be using at least for your shutter speed as you grow in experience or when you acquire a vr lens you can begin to use slower speeds for more help on your d print off the pages of this guide i did the same for my d and am doing the same for my daughter's d just print them off three hole punch them and keep them in a folder or binder for reference http www kenrockwell com nikon d users guide index htm you have a great camera whatever you do learn from your mistakes and you'll find fewer of them as you grow Digital photography Canon T90 Photography Leica Photographic lens Nikon Corporation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Mouse (computing) Nikon FE2 Shutter speed Panoramic photography Nikon FM2 Movie projector Nikon FA Single-lens reflex camera Konica Minolta Floppy disk Automatic number plate recognition Eye Camera Cinematography Nikon FE Fast bowling Digital camera Depth of field Macro photography Street photography Pinhole camera Aberration in optical systems Super Mario 64 Cinerama Rangefinder camera Shutter (photography) Marching band Aerial (dance move) Binoculars Nikon FM Skateboarding trick Film speed Boxing Diving Contax Helicopter Backstroke Eyepiece Time-lapse Canon EOS Stage lighting IMAX Equine conformation Drill bit Black hole Horse gait Weight training B3ta Breaststroke Drag racing Digital camera back Knife GunZ The Duel Volleyball Wing Chun Windows Vista Swimming Ajax (programming) Exposure (photography) Water polo Wind turbine Poker jargon Guilty Gear Danger Hiptop Oscilloscope Hello world program Antenna (radio) Secure Digital card Front crawl Punt (boat) Professional wrestling throws Zoom lens Panavision Lighting Mattress Lathe Canon EF lens mount Bicycle Headlight Dance Dance Revolution Advanced Photo System Aikido Anamorphic widescreen
