year old nikon mm camera did i break it i've been given a aprox yr old nikon fm camera the lever that advances the film won't move the film forward if i broke it is it repairable i presume you have pressed the shutter button and checked that you are not at the end of the roll of film both these will prevent the film advance working once you have checked these the next step is to give the base of the camera a solid thump with the heel of your hand do not use anything harder than you hand this may release the mechanism if it is stuck if this doesn't work the next step is to recover any film already exposed a good camera store will be able to do this for you if you don't have your own lightproof bag it will be repairable but you would need to know what the likely costs are before committing yourself to that a local camera repair shop may be prepared to give you some advice on that added you don't need to install a battery to operate the shutter the fm series are completely mechanical cameras and the battery is only used by the exposure meter Canon T90 Leica View camera Digital photography Nikon FM2 Single-lens reflex camera Nikon FE Movie projector Nikon FM Nikon FE2 Nikon FA Digital single-lens reflex cameras Camera Photography Windows XP Shutter speed Aerial (dance move) Point and shoot camera IPod Floppy disk Mouse (computing) Photographic lens Poker jargon Binoculars 135 film Stereoscopy PlayStation Portable Exakta Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Exposure (photography) Rangefinder camera Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Camcorder Surveillance Windows 2000 Equine conformation GunZ The Duel Radio controlled airplane Shutter (photography) USS Williamson (DD-244) The Price Is Right IMAX Pinball Enlarger Canon EF lens mount PlayStation 2 Shutter angle Bulk vending Canon T70 Welding Computer forensics Time-lapse Manual transmission Film speed STS-61 Holga camera Nikon Corporation Wind turbine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Bicycle lighting Nintendo 64 Professional wrestling holds Steadicam Ty Cobb Automatic number plate recognition Twin-lens reflex camera Guilty Gear Traditional animation Thermal power station Kasparov versus The World Hubble Space Telescope Artillery F-number Harp Glossary of climbing terms Canon EOS Data recovery Knife Escalator Eastman Kodak Solar power Characters of Lost Game Boy Slot machine Stage lighting Helicopter Skateboarding trick Cruising (maritime) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Internal ballistics Panoramic photography Drill bit Automatic teller machine Apollo Command/Service Module Extreme Programming 8 mm video format Screw Elevator
