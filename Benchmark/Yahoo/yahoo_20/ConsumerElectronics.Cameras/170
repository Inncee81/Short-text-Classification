how many recharge cycles is typical for nickel metal hydride nimh batteries in cameras the nimh batteries in my kodak are failing to hold a charge after three years of use and about recharge cycles the package claimed about recharge cycles is the latter just hype or is my experience on battery recharge life more typical nimh will go through recharge cycles if used in certain circumstances for example do you leave your batteries depleted or do you charge them after your done using them how much of the range do you use your battery to to to fully discharging the batteries will shorten their charge cycle life especially if you leave it in the camera where the circuits slowly drain the batteries beyond the full discharge the longer they stay depleted the more damage they take the range that you use is important also charging them to is okay but beyond will damage the battery often times it's better to pull the batteries before they are completely charged on the charger unles your going to use them soon replace them around when they drain to charge they store and operate well in the region another factor with lower end nimh batteries such as used as an alkline replacement is that they have a shelf life this means that they will only last so long even in ideal conditions before their chemistries deteriorate the more frequently you use them the more you'll get out of them it's no wonder that they claim a recharge cycles they do them under ideal conditions for the batteries the closer you get to ideal conditions the better they work Battery (electricity) Nickel-cadmium battery Lithium ion battery Battery electric vehicle Toyota Prius Lithium ion polymer battery Ford Ranger EV Diode IPod Hydrogen economy Hybrid vehicle Digital photography Airsoft Circuit design Automobile Electric boat Armored Core Action potential Fuel cell Memory effect Laptop CMOS Carburetor Hubble Space Telescope Tesla coil Second Battle of the Atlantic Submarine Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory PlayStation Portable Tether propulsion Terminal ballistics Solar cell Groundwater Haloalkane Thermal power station Explosive material Uninterruptible power supply Bipolar disorder Electrophysiology AlphaSmart Iowa class battleship Nuclear fuel cycle Hybrid Synergy Drive Electroconvulsive therapy Ozone depletion Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Items in the Metroid series Capacitor Service life Radio controlled car Protoss Lead-acid battery Jet engine Spark plug Alkane MOSFET Sewage treatment Torpedo Transistor Vacuum tube Electroshock gun Nickel General Motors EV1 Handheld game console Internal ballistics Johnny 5 Traumatic incident reduction Universal Serial Bus Artillery Diesel cycle Radiation hardening Turbocharger Water (molecule) Roomba Hydrogen Iron Man Nintendo DS Lightning Ozone hole RuneScape weapons Incandescent light bulb USS S-38 (SS-143) Air gun Oscilloscope Nuclear power Petroleum Green Lantern Corps Urinary incontinence Electrical generator Halo 2 Field effect transistor Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Redundant array of independent disks Apple Newton
