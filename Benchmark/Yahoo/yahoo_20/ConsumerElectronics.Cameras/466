hp photoshop m question i recently bought an hp photoshop m and i was out taking some pictures at a wrestling show when i downloaded my pics i noticed that the flash kinda died at the tops of the heads of the people in front of me and not what's going in the ring is there something i should check first or is it just a matter of going over the heads of the individuals the flash bounces off the nearest object and fools the camera into thinking the exposure is good either lift the camera over heads or turn the flash off a flash on a small camera like that is only good for feet anyway sporting events typically have fairly bright lighting Stereoscopy Photography Canon T90 Professional wrestling throws Digital camera Macro photography B3ta Digital photography Adobe Photoshop Parallax Suplex Professional wrestling slang Road-rule enforcement camera Goatse.cx World Championship Wrestling Panoramic photography Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Professional wrestling Mars Exploration Rover Camera Shaggy dog story Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Gamma ray burst Konica Minolta Table tennis Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Surveillance Canon EOS Lightning Professional wrestling attacks Leica Professional wrestling holds Spirit rover Closed-circuit television View camera Traffic light Internet phenomenon Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Something Awful Forums Boom Town (Doctor Who) Film Something Awful GunZ The Duel Automatic number plate recognition Parachuting Color temperature New York Giants Professional wrestling match types Pornography Opportunity rover Flash (photography) Hubble Deep Field Professional wrestling aerial techniques Twin-lens reflex camera Equine conformation Determinism Depth of field Cassini-Huygens Movie projector Bicycle lighting Traditional animation Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Photographic lens Digital image editing Internet fraud Marching band Lightsaber Extraterrestrial skies Combine (Half-Life 2) Batting (cricket) Sun Universal Serial Bus Rail terminology Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Horse gait Sumo Flash (comics) Red-eye effect Game show Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Paintball IPod Unidentified flying object Prank flash Care Bears Mixed martial arts Mercury 4 Black hole Speed of light Slayers Boxing Cat's Eye Nebula Oscilloscope Volleyball Light-emitting diode Street photography Baseball
