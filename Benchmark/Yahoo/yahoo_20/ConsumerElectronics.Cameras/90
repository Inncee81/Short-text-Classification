is this a good camera i recently lost my camera so i'm looking to find a new one this one looks like it's similar to my old one but i really don't understand all the little details about what would make it a good camera the stuff at the bottom of the link does it look like a good one i had an hp before and i loved it http h www hp com wwpc us en sm wf a html the one i had before was mp and the quality was good enough for me i'm not doing like professional photography just regular pictures i don't know about this confusion but the link you gave shows and m and it says that this camera does have optical zoom not only that but they are honest about calling the digital zoom a cropping mechanism zoom in with x optical zoom then crop with x digital zoom to mm focal length equivalent to to mm this camera is a good step up from the one you had chosen before it lets you turn the flash off which is important for taking a baby's picture it has a frames per second burst rate that is also helpful for getting just the right shot of your baby if this is similar to your old camera you will be comfortable with it and i think it would be a good value and a good purchase for you given your stated purpose and experience Digital photography Photography Zoom lens Leica Cinematography Photographic lens Panoramic photography View camera Konica Minolta Digital single-lens reflex cameras Contax Single-lens reflex camera Digital camera back Digital camera Stereoscopy Anamorphic widescreen Camcorder High-definition television Canon EOS Binoculars Panavision Movie projector Aperture Macro photography Traditional animation Film Motion picture terminology Nikon Corporation Mouse (computing) Digital cinema Movie camera World Wide Web Canon EF lens mount Camera Lens (optics) Widescreen B3ta Canon T90 Prank flash Rangefinder camera 8 mm video format 35 mm film Photojournalism Color temperature Windows Vista Telescope Gamma ray burst F-number Cinerama Holography Digital cinematography Modem Secure Digital card Schneider Kreuznach Amateur telescope making Eyepiece Digital image editing Television Tracking shot Laserdisc Digital circuit Universal Serial Bus Late Night with Conan O'Brien Point and shoot camera HTML Ebook DV Surveillance Magic (illusion) ATI Technologies Lightning Bubble Bobble Unreal Tournament 2004 Internet Warez Closed-circuit television Video The Inside Zeiss Persistence of vision Map Circle of confusion Digital Olympus (company) 3D computer graphics DVD Oscilloscope Instant camera Alfred Hitchcock Professional video camera Optics Street photography Charge-coupled device MP3 NTSC IMAX
