can i fix a scratch on a camera lens or is it done for can't see the scratch in photos i appear to have knocked my new lens and there is a fairly obvious mark evn though i can not see it on the lcd playback is this fixable or have i just made a v expensive mistake a scratch on the lens will not affect sharpness of pictures it will introduce a little flare when bright objects are in shot and reduce contrast a tiny bit you don't say what the camera is but a professional fix could cost as much as a new mid range camera whatever you do don't try to fix it yourself the best you can do is to make it worse i think your best plan is to just carry on using it until you get round to an upgrade and be more careful next time Digital photography Photography Photographic lens Stereoscopy View camera Gramophone record Digital camera Single-lens reflex camera Cinematography Leica Movie projector Panoramic photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Camera Technicolor Laserdisc Konica Minolta Television Camcorder Anamorphic widescreen Contax Canon T90 Depth of field Zoom lens Pixel Eyepiece Internal ballistics Phonograph Cinerama Binoculars Headlight Apollo 8 Photographic film Galileo spacecraft Combine (Half-Life 2) Machinima Digital cinematography Macro photography Lens (optics) Canon EOS Airsoft Dog High-definition television Widescreen Point and shoot camera Reflecting telescope Clarinet Solar eclipse F-number TFT LCD Road-rule enforcement camera Opportunity rover Automatic number plate recognition Videocassette recorder General Dynamics F-111 Drill bit Sun Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Diamond November (film) Radar Eye Joel and Ethan Coen MIM-23 Hawk 8 mm video format Amateur astronomy Billiards Zerg Deep Impact (space mission) Film Canon FD Secret photography Radio controlled airplane Gamma ray burst Digital cinema DVD Laptop Liquid crystal display Digital image editing Contact lens Atari 8-bit family Traffic light System/36 Slide rule Liquid crystal display television Hubble Space Telescope All Aussie Adventures Zire Handheld Autostereogram Nikon FA Platform game Very Long Baseline Interferometry Sunglasses Gamut 70 mm film IBM PC compatible Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure Inkjet printer ITunes Eyeglass prescription
