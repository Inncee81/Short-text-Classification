my friend dropped my camera my friend dropped my camera and the lens got jammed such that it is halfway out naturally the camera isn't quite working and i'm so freaking pissed at her irresponsibility can someone please tell me if there's anything i can do about my camera i loved it it was a casio exilim i didn't have a choice she's way older than me but sadly irresponsible sigh i have a guarantee but since there are no dents etc will it be possible to bring it to the store and just tell them it got stuck like don't mention that it was dropped drops are not covered by most warranties and unless you're using a camera that's worth at least it's not going to be worth the cost of having a professional repair it i bought a camera for at christmas and my son dropped it the lens housing was jammed just like yours my brother is great with mechanics but he couldn't fix it and when i asked at wolff camera what it would cost to have it repaired it would've been as much as buying a new camera so that's what i did next time let your friend use their own camera Shaggy dog story Digital photography Camera Digital camera The Smoking Room View camera Happy Days Photography The Inside Poker jargon Single-lens reflex camera Marilyn Monroe Warranty Knots Landing Camcorder Canon T90 Ex-gay The Ashlee Simpson Show James T.
