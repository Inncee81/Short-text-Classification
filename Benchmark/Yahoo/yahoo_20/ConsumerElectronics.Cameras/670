how much do megapixels really matter so i'm like really into photography and all that and i've read so much about it like omg some of you guys on like no so much about cameras and stuff and like stuff that i really could never ever learn even if i lived to be like really old like or something anyway so my friend looked at some of my photos and he was like wow ur really good so i'm thinking i could maybe take some more photos so anyway my question is like how much to megapixels really matter because my friend is gettingmarried tonite and so like i told him i would do his wedding for hime and that i'm really good and stuff and he's like wow i am spending like on photos and stuff so seeeing as he is a good friend and stuff i like said wow i can do it for like and he's really exited to be saving like a thousand dollars because it means we can all drink more at the wedding and i'm like wondering like how much do megapixels matter 'cos i have like a pda and if megapixels don't matter too much and stuff it has like a megapixel or something camera in it and i am thinking that seeing as megapixels don't really matter all that much that i might be able to use my pda to take the photos because it's really great and the photos look great because it has like a really large screen and the photos look really really good on the screen so i am thinking they must print well because they look so good on the screen and the best part is that i don't have to do all the stupid stuff like mess around with shutter speed and aperture and stuff because that is really hard and this pda is really really smart and it does all that stuff for me and i don't even have to use a flash and the pictures look really great so what do you guys think because you know so much about cameras and stuff and do you think the photos will be great they should be because i took photos at my friends part so i have experience and stuff also do you think is ok or should i still charge please answer the wedding is tonight dr sam you got it but then i knew you would antony m this question was inspired by you and posted in response to a question you asked http au answers yahoo com question index ylt anv himklwsbsup av vgath gt qid aaltyo i'm afraid you may have stepped way out of your league photographing a wedding professionally appropriately and to actually please the bride and broom and their folks you must have a lot of knowledge and experience about how to photograph a wedding how to cover a wedding how to get organized so that everyone involved in the photos knows where to be and when mega pixels are important as are many many other facets of photography equipment a wedding photographer must have dependable sufficient and efficient lighting and or flash equipment as well as workhorse cameras yes i said workhorse camera s in professional photography the term workhorse is indicative of equipment that is tried and true and has the features and ability to work like a horse because to do a good job photographing a wedding that is you will do as well work like a horse it's hard and it moves fast and strategically important photo moments happen in a heartbeat and are gone did you catch that once in a lifetime look on the bride's face or how her dad looked at her just before they walked down the aisle what about the expression on the groom's face when he first gets a good look at the bride coming down the aisle to him and mom's tears that is the kind of stuff that makes a good wedding photographer of course the photographer must have very good quality and dependable professional quality equipment megapixels and all not only that but a good photographer has all his equipment multiplied by or even a professional photographer does not contract to photograph something as important as a wedding without having back up equipment and back ups for his back ups you do not charge a bride a few thousand to photograph her wedding and then have the first little blurp in your migapixel digital camera leave you completely dead in the water a real pro will hardly let the sudden death of a camera slow him down he will barely say just a sec and then he has another camera etc in his hands almost like nothing happened so i'm like really into thinkin omg if you are like really like really really for real and you really are like into photography and all that stuff wow you really want to learn stuff about cameras and stuff like that and i'm like hey go for it like read read read and then go out and take lots and lots of like you know photos cause like ya know that's great experience and like omg sooo much fun but please please save your friendship and let him stay with his professional photographer if you're going to the wedding you could maybe unobtrusively observe the photographer for the entire time and get a small taste of just what all it takes to professionally photograph a wedding but i'm betting you are not for real and just posted
