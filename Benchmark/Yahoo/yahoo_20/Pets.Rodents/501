do you think my hamster is afraid of me please read carefully before answering i have had my hamster for days now everytime i try to take him out of his cage he runs away from my hands and if i do not get to him fast enough he hides in one of his tubes if i block the tube he does the defence thing and rolls on to his back he never bites squeaks or pees though however i only take him out after pm sometimes it is already p i wait until he is fully awake and alert he will sit on my hands in his cage and eat right out of them once out of the cage i can hold him all i want without any issues and he will run all over me in fact we play this game where i cup my hand around him and leave an opening somewhere he runs around in my cupped hand until he finds the way out then we do it over again when we are playing his ears are always up and his little whiskers are moving around tickling me sometimes he tries to run back out when i am putting him back in the cage he never squeaks or bites me so what do you think is he scared of me actually is sounds like he is pretty happy but there can be many dfferent reasons why he is running away from you it may take a little more time for him to trust you more but from what you have told about him it sounds like you two are really close but like i said it may take a little while longer but with what he does now it shouldn't take long for the bond to grow Hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Time Machine Shaggy dog story Social rule John Cage Cat Aerial (dance move) Theory of conduct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Table tennis Milton H.
