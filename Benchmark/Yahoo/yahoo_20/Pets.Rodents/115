select breeding to rat breeders please i've heard of rat breeders breeding brothers and sisters to make certain characteristics stronger which if done wrong can make things weaker too but i also heard that doing that will cause health or temperment problems so i was wondering if its safe to do that and also breeding mother son or father daughter for the rats' health in the case of a good breeder who knows the family lines very well this can be okay inbreeding by itself doesn't cause problems in order for problems to crop up these problems already have to be present in the family lines if a breeder knows that their lines are free of issues doing a close breeding like that shouldn't cause any issues breeding a random male and female rat with no knowledge of their genetic background though is asking for problems Selective breeding Plant breeding Dog Dog breeding Incest Rat Inbreeding Cat Puppy mill Dobermann Eusociality English Springer Spaniel Docking Guinea pig Agriculture Guns, Germs, and Steel Kakapo Havanese Fancy rat Genetically modified food Show cat Dog breed House Mouse Hamster Black panther Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Arabian horse Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune Primate Bernese Mountain Dog Species German Shepherd Dog Abortion debate Chicken Free will Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Horse Domestic rabbit Bird migration Password Dragon Booster Tibetan Mastiff Encantadia Genetically modified organism The Tribe Great Dane Hemp Ferret Dachshund Africanized bee Epistemology Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Bene Gesserit Potato Wheat Development of Darwin's theory Order of succession American Pit Bull Terrier Extinction Brown Rat Green Revolution Honeybee Ethics Aladdin (1992 film) Biology and sexual orientation Maine Coon Domestication Beagle Genetic engineering Apple Pitaten Minor Discworld characters Horticulture Family The Origin of Species Fathers' rights Nuclear power Discus (fish) Theodicy Sampling (statistics) The Secret of NIMH Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Hanoverian (horse) Coming of Age (TNG episode) Labrador Retriever Sin City Animal testing Pekingese Breed registry Canary Basset Hound Domestic goat Monty Hall problem Salic law F1 hybrid
