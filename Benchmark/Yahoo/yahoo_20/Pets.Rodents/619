gerbil help please sick gerbil so i have a female gerbil i've always used the same brand of litter food toys etc for her whole life and the past few weeks her face has been swelling off and on at first she lost all hair on her face but it has been growing back very quickly there's a white piece of something in her eye and i can't tell if something is stuck in there or if it's some kind of growth there is also a red mucous or blood that has seeped from her nose and eyes but it clears up fine and looks more like her mucous rather than blood i have taken some pics i just don't know what to do or where to go to email pics for someone to help her appetite is fine the same as it always has been shes alwyas in fresh bedding and with fresh water and she's as active as ever she doesn't seem sluggish or to be sleeping too much she doesn't seem to be in pain at all but i also think she has trouble seeing when it's very swollen any help please we have always and continue to use carefresh bedding we got her probably or months ago and she's only months old i've talked to people in pet stores and they all say they've never heard of this my boyfriends mother also bred and raised the critters years ago and she's never seen this either the only way that i can find medicine for her is to take her to a doctor and that's not in my finances at the moment she's also in a gallon tank so it's not a question of the area being too small or her getting use to a new enviroment it would help to know what kind of food bedding toys ect you are using on her as well as how old she is if you are using cedar or pine bedding this may be causing problems these beddings can cause allergic reactions and upper respiratory infections try switching to aspen carefresh aspen pellets or newspaper pellets you can also use paper towels and change them every other day i would look in the phone book for a vet that treats small animals or ask someone in your area if they can recomend a place in my area a vet check for a gerbil ranges from dollars depending on where you go most medications for gerbils are cheap since they do not need very big doses if she is still eating drinking and acting otherwise normal this is a good sign it usually means that what ever is wrong with her has not progressed very far and is probably not life threatening gerbils live about years my oldest lived to be your gerbil may just be getting old too good luck to you Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Allergy Common cold Tuberculosis Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tattoo Urinary incontinence Carbon dioxide Pet skunk Meriones unguiculatus Cat Ferret Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City First aid Traumatic brain injury Asthma Pneumonia Folic acid Medical prescription Psoriasis Kodocha Cancer Insulin Tarantula Conjunctivitis Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Little Britain Lung cancer Obstetrics Syphilis Medicine Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Malaria Social rule Cephalic disorder Shark Garfield Blood Cirrhosis Dairy Group A streptococcal infection The Shining (film) Milton H.
