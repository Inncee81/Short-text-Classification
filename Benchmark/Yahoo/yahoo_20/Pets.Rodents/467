when i bought two female hamsters in weeks their on each other you know what should i do i have two female fancy bear hamsters one is white golden one and the other was a gray fluffy one in two weeks i saw their were on top of each other like you know i was very shocked what i saw even my sister saw and was shocked when i went to sleep my sister woke me up and told me that my white golden hamster escaped and was near the fish tank so i grabed it and put her back in and cover the small hole they could come out my sister said that it because that the white golden hamster was scared of her and i think she was crying because i saw the tears so i am guessing that the white golden hamster is very scared of the gray one that they did it so please right back to me and tell me why is it happening hamsters are very territorial especially the females hamster cages aren't that expensive buy two and let them live apart it is possible that one is pregnant its not your fault some hamsters are pregnant when you buy them from a pet store that is when they are most like this please keep them both in different cages if one of the hamsters is accidently pregnant she will cannabolize her babies if she senses any threat as well as attack the other hamster hammy's are not social creatures like some other rodents male and females if they are from different breeds that cannot mate with eachother are the only pair that can be kept without any fighting if raised together good luck and i hope that both your hamsters are not hurt Hamster EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Golden Hamster Knots Landing Gray Wolf Ferret Episodes of Lost (Season 1) House Mouse Pet store Fancy rat The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Piper Halliwell Discus (fish) Days of our Lives Liger Friends Kakapo RuneScape quests Dog One Life to Live Brown Bear YuYu Hakusho Shark Breath of Fire III Sharon Tate Monster Rancher monsters One Piece minor characters Lion Vegeta God Emperor of Dune Chinchilla Shaggy dog story Eddie Guerrero Father Ted Salad Fingers Big Brother (USA TV series) Legend of Mana Madonna (entertainer) Pet skunk Neighbours Animal communication Gaia Online Fancy Crane StarCraft: Uprising Baby Blues Futurama (TV series - season 5) Reservoir Dogs Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Domestic rabbit Humphrey Bogart The Birds (film) The Young Ones (TV series) Melonpool Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Tigon John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Runaways (comics) Mouse-like hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Panthera hybrid Pok__mon Live!
