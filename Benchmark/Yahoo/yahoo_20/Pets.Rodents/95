my pet rat is sick symptoms doesn't move bloody nose loss of appetite clumsy he was fine a few days ago it came on really fast does anyone know what he might have we had a rat a few years ago who died of a respiratory problem we took our first rat to the vet and gave him shots but still past away we aren't exactly sure how old he is but is at least months but he could be as old as we have had him for about months and was fine we don't want to waste the money if nothing can be done at the vets does anyone know of anything that will help him get better help please the bloody nose you are describing indicates a common nasal or eye discharge called porphyrin a small amount here and there is normal for any rat but if it is increased accompanied by sneezing or noisy breathing the rat needs to be put on baytril if left untreated this can progress into pneumonia and there is no cure for that generally a treatment would be baytril twice a day for days if the symptoms are somewhat more severe or have been going on for a while i would suggest baytril in combination with doxycycline twice a day for days some rats are really prone to those respiratory infections which can be caused by ammonia from their urine so make sure their cage is clean or stress is a common reason to bring it on as well certain types of cage bedding can bring it on as well as the small particles are aspirated by the rat i always use towels instead of bedding most rats are treated once and they will be fine after that some rats are really prone to it and they relapse constantly when taken off the medications i recently had a rat who was very prone she relapsed times every time i took her off the meds every relapse does more damage to their lungs and then i decided to keep her on lifelong meds she was a year and a half old when she all of a sudden developed severe breathing problems and had to be put to sleep but this is all just from my experience i strongly suggest you take your rat to a rat experienced vet asap the not moving and not eating could indicate something else as well good luck and all the best for your squeaker Pneumonia Fancy rat Common cold Guinea pig Urinary incontinence Asthma Lung cancer Traumatic brain injury Chronic fatigue syndrome Domestic rabbit Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Cancer Charles Darwin's illness Herpes simplex virus Duchenne muscular dystrophy Decompression sickness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tuberculosis Narcotic Stroke Group A streptococcal infection Rabies Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Medicine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Malaria Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Stomach cancer Acne Cephalic disorder Cat Liquid breathing Shock Coeliac disease Methamphetamine Conjunctivitis Sleep Hamster Mesothelioma Bipolar disorder Vitamin C Equine conformation Chlorpromazine Obesity Post-traumatic stress disorder Blood Ebola Parkinson's disease Hay fever Cocaine Epilepsy Addiction Hearing impairment AIDS Lyme disease Aspergillosis Allergy Radiation poisoning Obstetrics Doxepin Insomnia Ferret Antidepressant First aid Ulcerative colitis Emphysema Paget's disease of bone Cystic fibrosis Acromegaly Schizophrenia Drowning Gonorrhoea Migraine Electroconvulsive therapy Aspartame Hepatitis C Narcolepsy Multiple myeloma Folic acid Childbirth Chinchilla Babe Ruth Psittacosis Growth hormone deficiency
