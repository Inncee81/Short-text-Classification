my dwarf hamster has a tumor we brought our dwarf hamster to the vet two weeks ago with a lump on her stomach the vet said it was a cyst and lanced it and put her on antibiotics we brought her back again this week because it had filled up again and it turns out it is a tumor he took a scalpel to it this time and gave us more antibiotics up until our last visit the lump didn't seem to be bothering her but since she visited the vet she's been sleeping alot and moving around a lot more slowly than normal with her eyes closed i thought it might have been the loss of blood that was making her tired she hasn't been eating either up until about half an hour ago when she took a small amount of broccolli from me her heart also seems to be beating alot faster than normal and this is visible just by looking at her is this the tumor having an effect on her or has anyone got any ideas the vet said that she wouldn't survive an operation to remove the tumor sadly small creatures are prone to tumours my mouse has one now and it's only a matter of time before i have to take him back to the vets to be put to sleep but for the moment he's not too bothered he is sleeping more and his heart seems to be beating faster too but he is still active for a large portion of his daytime the vet has said that the signs to look out for are going off his food water very lethargic the tumour becomes ulcerated the tumour grows to a size that it's getting in the way when any of these happen the kindest thing you can do is to have your pet euthanised though it's not easy decision to make but better that than your little hamster in pain surgery is very risky on such a small animal and it will only be a temporary solution to the problem because another tumor will appear too at the end of the day just do what you feel is right maybe give your vet a call and ask them to clarify what i've said though i am sorry for this difficult time for you but i am going through it myself now too and if i can help you any further please feel free to email me via my profile Fancy rat Hamster Stomach cancer Radiation therapy Cancer Colorectal cancer Lung cancer Guinea pig Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tasmanian Devil Ferret Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Mesothelioma Malignant melanoma Garfield Diarrhea Mattress Chemotherapy Brain tumor Breast cancer Traumatic brain injury Puberty Chronic fatigue syndrome Acromegaly Blood on the Tracks Androgen insensitivity syndrome Aspartame Adjustable gastric band Time Out of Mind Oncology Prolactinoma Dialysis Stroke The Death Gate Cycle Poker jargon Neurofibromatosis type II Domestic rabbit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Peptic ulcer The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Soft tissue sarcoma Zollinger-Ellison syndrome Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Carpal tunnel syndrome Diabetes mellitus Acne Cephalic disorder Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Shock The Amazing Race Spleen Gastroparesis Tuberous sclerosis Hypoglycemia Needle aspiration biopsy Sleep Theory of conduct Folic acid Slayers Hyperprolactinaemia Insulin Testicular cancer The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Metastasis Aortic dissection Nutrition Chicken Tenshinhan Anorexia nervosa Renal cell carcinoma Childbirth Esophageal cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Penis First aid Sun Cindy Sheehan Diabetic retinopathy Growth hormone Pet skunk Ecco the Dolphin Blood Hedgehog Disneyland Tobacco smoking Warm-blooded YuYu Hakusho Deluge (mythology) FoxTrot Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Decompression sickness
