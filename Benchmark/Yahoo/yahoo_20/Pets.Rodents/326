www coastcages com catalog index php main page product info cpath products id in addition to the other replies max bar spacing for adult mice according to online research i did before getting mine mm which i've tried to convert to inches for you and seems to be less than inch for a pregnant mouse i'd just use a small aquarium or ferplast type of hamster plastic tank no tunnels with enough space to comfortably make a large nest walk about a bit and eat you don't want a wheel in there because it might hurt the little ones add one once they reach the hopper stage maybe that's eyes fully open and actively exploring their surroundings because of that latter bit i definitely wouldn't use a wire cage for baby mice they might get out you're right about wire cages having better air circulation than aquariums with this idea in mind based on rat care since i had those first i started out with a wire cage for my mice too however i fairly quickly changed my mind tank like cages really do seem to be better suitable for mice also i just could not find a large enough imo wire cage with mm bar spacing for female mice plastic tanks e g for hamsters often also aren't that big and definitely not high i didn't want to get an aquarium because a fairly large one would be too heavy to carry around so i ended up making my own mouse tank out of lexan type of plexiglas i solved both the annoying top access and air circulation problem of aquariums by placing two large doors in the front of my mouse tank consisting of closely spaced wire while daily because of that distinct mouse smell cage cleaning of my mouse cage and later plastic hamster tank was a p i t a i now honestly enjoy cleaning my pretty seethrough mousie tank palace with it's wonderfully easy access i'd show you a pic but yahoo photos has closed down and i haven't had time to sort out my pics and place them online elsewhere sorry it looks a bit like the glass tank in the pic linked to below incl three triangular shelves but then with the top closed except for a small wire covered ventilation opening and the entire front consists of two large wire doors except for a cm high part from the bottom since otherwise all the bedding would fall out through the wire i see you've already been given the link to the fun mouse website fancy mice is another very good mouse website http www fancymice info re the blue and purple cages you link to for mice tank like cages work better for me see above but if a cage works better for you i haven't checked the bar spacing but since the two types low and high have equal floor space i'd go for the high type more total floor space this will probably mean that you will get pee on the wire if they pee on the top shelves my major problem with the wire cage i first used but you owe it to your little mice to get them the absolutely biggest home you can possibly afford both money and space wise since they are going to be spending their entire lives in it and they have huuuge territories in the wild in comparison just something to think about re the rat cages you link to do you have very young i e small female rats perhaps the purple one you say you currently have has a floor space that is what i'd call just do able it's actually fairly similar to what i've used for a few years i use metric units sorry yours is x cm mine was x cm but it always annoyed me how little space i had with which to do something one litter box large enough for an adult female rat one house large enough for two a food bowl and that was it they could barely turn their cute little furry behinds so to speak it made me feel a bit claustrophobic anyway ideal floor space imo x is okay is something more like x cm for your convenience x inch in addition your cage has only very little height most of which is taken up by that wheel meaning you can't do anything with it if you don't have enough space to get your pets a home cage tank whatever with large floor space you need to get the total surface area from the home's height that cage of mine i mention above albeit with a small floor space was as tall high as a young kid well over a meter keep the purple cage as a very handy transport cage though or one level hospital cage if you can remove the levels and wheel that is you never know when it might come in handy as for the possibly new blue gp cage the floor space is a bit better see below for a wire comment though the height imo however is simply unacceptable for rats yes they'll be able to stand up bare lab rat animal welfare requirement but they won't be able to do much more than that please get a cage at least cm high for your convenience cm inch i haven't looked at the bar spacing of this cage so for the rat cage please follow ratlover's suggestion of the super pet type cage for rats it's good to look for gp suitable floor spacing but you need ferret suitable floor spacing cage height the only problem with some ferret cages is that young rats esp females might be able to get out between the bars some good websites for rat cage info http www sophielynette com cage html http www rattycorner com go to cages http www fancy rats co uk resources productreviews category php c personally fyi for rats i prefer cupboard style cages unfortunately you also have to make these yourself do able but a lot of work now that i have experienced the ease of cleaning that i have with my mouse tank with doors though there's no way i'm going back to poking my arm through one of those hideously small doors of most wire rat cages so no more rats for me until i make me a grotto style cage http www dapper com au grotto htm if you really want a pull out tray personally i wouldn't want my ratties walking on that exposed wire above the tray but if you do that's your choice look into getting one of those large i e sufficient floor space and height indoor aviaries a bit more expensive yes but if you decorate it well mostly add shelves somehow you can make your little girls a wonderful home large enough in fact to add a few more ratties if you wish and that should make it well worth the extra cost in conclusion bigger is always better these are lifetime homes for your little pets and the only space they have unless you let them freerange in your house most of the day so always get the biggest cage tank for them you can afford i hope this helps greetz cyzahhe
