why hasn't my hamster climbed it's ladder yet i jsut got a semi long haired hamster today and he won't climb his ladder or even get on his wheel and won't go in his hidey home lol is this normal for young or new hamsters he was probably in a big aquarium when you got him surrounded by his furry pals maybe even curled up with one or a whole bunch sleeping he was then put in a box and placed in a new home sooo your hamster is just a little scared i know i would be and is trying to get use to his new place give him a few hours eventually he will decide to explore and try out all the fun things in his cage it will not be until late tonight that he will select a place to make his nest then build it so just be patient i am sure it will not be long until he is running like crazy on his wheel and ladder Hamster Professional wrestling match types Eddie Guerrero Wheel of Fortune Shawn Michaels Ron and Fez The Price Is Right South Park The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Ashlee Simpson Show Futurama (TV series - season 5) Grandview, U.S.A.
