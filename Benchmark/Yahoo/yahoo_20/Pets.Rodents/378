what are the pro's and con's of fleece bedding i'm adopting a guinea pig this weekend and i'm setting up a cage i was thinking about getting a fleece bedding since my friend who owns three of her own pigs suggested it she puts shredded paper on top of the fleece and throws it out and washes the fleece when she puts out her pig for floortime is this a good idea or should i try carefresh any suggestions i use fleece bedding in my c c cage and love it there is no odor either as long as you put something underneath the fleece to soak up the pee like old towels puppy pads newspaper or a combination works best that way the stuff underneath soaks up the moisture and your piggers stay dry then all you have to do is sweep up the poo's and any spilled hay use a dark colored cloth so the poo blends in better and wash it once or twice a week depending on how dirty it gets i find it is much cleaner and better looking and i know my piggies love it carefresh also is good for them but i find it makes the cage look too messy the cons of it are that if you dont get it held down right your piggers could end up burrowing down under it Textile manufacturing Guinea pig Upholstery Tofu Bacon Menstrual cup Neighbours Vermicompost Ron and Fez Domestic rabbit Professional wrestling match types Dry cleaning Chinchilla Fancy rat Menstrual cycle Hamster Mattress Towel Psoriasis Toilet humour Salad Fingers Dean Koontz Sugarcane Drag racing Sanitary towel Jute The League of Gentlemen (comedy) EastEnders South Park Dairy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q Hemp Pig John Cage Holes (book) Days of our Lives Coconut crab Garfield Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sento Washing machine Charles Manson Pottery Knots Landing Eddie Guerrero Urticaria Shit Conker's Bad Fur Day Rice Collecting fossils Strap-on dildo Spanish prepositions Boxing Tattoo Tanning Hay Dick and Dom in da Bungalow Cantonese cuisine Iron Roswell UFO incident She Loves You Chris Jericho Scabies The Dalek Invasion of Earth Manicure Chili con carne Customs and etiquette of Japan Ed, Edd n Eddy Lisa the Vegetarian Comanche Lord of the Flies Tina Turner Dog Jennifer Lopez Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Sewer Sinfest Jon Secada Fecal incontinence Peruvian cuisine Snowball (Animal Farm) Beachwear Vampire Cashmere wool Sub-Zero Champagne (beverage) Undergarment Miss Piggy The Critic Nintendogs Cleveland Browns About a Boy Laundry detergent Cannabis cultivation Weaving Richard Chase Toilet
