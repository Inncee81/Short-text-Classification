how to move baby pigeons from porch i have baby pigeons on my porch and the mother is taking care of them is there a way to move them without disturbing them or can i feed them until they can fly if i call my hoa they will be removed by them steve i can get in trouble for leaving them there because i am in an apartment complex and the droppings are going down to the neighbors porch i want to know if i can feed them becuase the mother won't come back if i clean up and put them on a piece of cardboard or newspaper my whole point in looking into this is to help nature the hoa can and probably will remove them probably with a shovel if i don't do something comprende some people are really quick to jump to the wrong conclusion and they look pretty foolish why do you want to feed them if the mom is taking care of them and why would you want to move them leave them alone and let nature do its thing it's an old wives tale that if you touch them the mom bird will abandon them so you can move them just pick up the whole nest or whatever and move it to another spot The Inside Humphrey Bogart Calvin and Hobbes RuneScape quests Tag Rock Dove Knots Landing Chess strategy and tactics Bird Professional wrestling throws Friends Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move) Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Volleyball Hall & Oates Hamster My Name Is Earl American Psycho Phoebe Buffay's songs Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Married... with Children 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chopsticks Chicken Textile manufacturing Social rule Paradox Treehouse of Horror V Family Guy Dead Like Me Dove Mario Babe Ruth's Called Shot Baby Blues The Family from One End Street Jackass: The Movie Kimi Finster Bubble Bobble Snooker Marilyn Monroe Laura Schlessinger Kereru Angelina Jolie The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Theory of conduct Futurama (TV series - season 2) Joke Have I Got News For You Taikyoku shogi Dai dai shogi Rugrats Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers AFI 100 Years series Kodocha EastEnders My Little Pony Neighbours Cosmo Kramer Kakapo The Fairly OddParents The Birds (film) One Piece minor characters Shogi Tai shogi Kevin and Kell Wood Pigeon The Amber Spyglass Everwood Daddy Cool (band) 613 mitzvot Rocko's Modern Life Macbeth Confidence trick Alfred Hitchcock Wrigley Field Sin City Breastfeeding Cindy Sheehan Seabird Rent (musical) Doonesbury Ko shogi Kurt Cobain New York Giants Full House Backgammon Mr. and Mrs. Turner Wa shogi Surveillance The Apprentice 2 My Life as a Teenage Robot Falconry Denis Law Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Random Harvest
