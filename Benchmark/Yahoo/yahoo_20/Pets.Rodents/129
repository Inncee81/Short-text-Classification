rat and guinea pig owners only which in your opinion makes the better pet and your reasons why just for fun oh definately rats i've cared for both and every single time i'd choose ratties they're basically like minature dogs mine loved to play games with me they'd try to sneak up on me i'd grab them and tickle their tummies and then they'd pounce and jump up and down on my lap laughs ahhh the memories they're incredibly smart animals there is such a thing as rat olympics and in africa they've trained rats to find active land mines so the people can disarm them note the rats are too light to set the mines off shows how intelligent they can be they desire attention from humans regardless of whether or not they have a cagemate i kept some rats singly later on i rescued two brothers who'd been raised together and absolutely adored one another unlike with a lot of other rodents rats can get along with cagemates of the same gender and obviously of the opposite gender spicey i won't go bashing guinea pigs not fond of them 'cause there are a lot of people out there that really love theirs i salute them all but it's ratties for me xd Care Bears Guinea pig Fancy rat Pet Taboo food and drink The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Rat Sexual orientation Garfield Ferret Pig Cat Domestic rabbit Human sexual behavior Badminton Hamster Mickey Mouse Rodent Animal testing Working dog Aladdin (1992 film) Ranma __ characters Theory of conduct InuYasha (character) Brown Rat Game show Taikyoku shogi Kim Possible Meat Ren and Stimpy Obedience training Economic inequality The Secret of NIMH Porcupine Perfect Dark Dilbert Aspartame Chinchilla Australasia ecozone Tai shogi Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Fairly OddParents Creatures in Bionicle Transsexuality Blood (computer game) Neopets Pet skunk Dog Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Feral cat Motivation Revolutionary Girl Utena Volleyball Newshounds Olympic Games Pitaten Fruits Basket Chinese astrology Sin City Animal cognition John Howard Yoder Gender role Egyptian Ratscrew Death Note Island restoration Felis sapiens Property (ownership right) Descendants of Darkness Laughter Dog agility Rat (zodiac) Robot El Goonish Shive Jackie Chan Adventures Oceania ecozone Sleep Shredder (TMNT) Introduced species Tooth enamel The Amber Spyglass Syphon Filter Age of Mythology Transgender Cro Animals in space People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals German Shepherd Dog Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers Murinae Krusty the Clown Time Crisis 3 Spidey Super Stories Domestication Gambian pouch rat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) Animal rights Pikachu Livestock The Dalek Invasion of Earth
