how to give a guinea pig a bath this can be quite tricky you can do it in the kitchen sink or in a washing up bowl but we find it easier to do it in the actual bathtub so that they don't jump out use warm not hot or cold water test the temperature with your elbow put the guinea pig in the bowl bath then add a small amount of water an inch or two then use a jug to slowly pour more water over the big's body keeping clear of it's head eyes and ears you should also use a special guinea pig shampoo or a gentle baby shampoo once every few months use a small amount of shampoo and rub it into the fur creating a lather do not get the shampoo on the head in the ears or anywhere near the eyes or nose try to clean the fur as thoroughly as possible it is a good idea on boars to keep the area around the grease gland on its bum clean else the fur can become really greasy and matted a stronger grease cutting cleaner will probably be needed for this once all the fur has been shampooed use a jug and fresh warm water to rinse off the shampoo you may have to do this a couple of times it may be easier to use a showerhead on a warm gentle setting empty the water and allow your pig to drip dry for a few seconds then place it on a towel and thoroughly towel dry it a little food treat often helps as encouragement and so that the guinea pig associates baths with a good thing you can then use a hairdryer on a gentle warm setting to finish the drying have your hand in the air flow against your guinea pig to make sure it is not too hot also lift up the fur so that the inner fur close to the skin gets dried as well if your pig lives outside make sure it is completely and thoroughly dry before putting it back outside else it will get cold and could fall ill hope this has helped good luck and happy bathing ps remember to treat your pig every now and then for encouragement as the whole experience can be quite stressful and scary for them if you're lucky your pig will love baths but most don't Sento Guinea pig Massage Textile manufacturing Psoriasis Japanese toilet Customs and etiquette of Japan Aerial (dance move) Shampoo Hamster Dandruff Domestic rabbit Sauna Menstrual cup Manicure Common cold Bong Social rule Cat Towel Happy Tree Friends Dry cleaning Fecal incontinence Diving Dialysis Ranma __ characters Comanche Tea Drowning Hand washing Tattoo Plastic Upholstery Chinchilla Rosacea Dairy Japanese tea ceremony Fancy rat Hydrotherapy Care Bears Hard water Carbon dioxide Fujian tea ceremony Thermoregulation Coffee Dishwashing Urinary incontinence Diseases of the honeybee Pet skunk Mattress Fire fighting Carburetor Pig Hyperthermia Casting Characters of Naruto Climate of the United Kingdom Cetacea Elephant Dishwasher Baptism Drag racing Bacon Acne Vacuum cleaner Motor oil Concrete El Ni__o Aloe Soap Breaststroke Otitis externa Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cruising (maritime) Strap-on dildo Diving suit Chronic fatigue syndrome Cannabis cultivation Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Dog Paragliding Shaving Little Britain Sewage treatment Mixed martial arts Professional wrestling attacks Weather front Phoebe Buffay's songs Urticaria Drill bit E85 Yosemite National Park
