training my guinea pig can i train my guinea pig to come to me when i come in he stays in his cage in my bedroom yes you can it will take practice though it's been said that guinea pigs and other small animals can be clicker trained i would recommend that you get a clicker like for a dog that you may purchase at any pet store also some treats veggies or fruits will be great for rewarding next time that you let your guinea pig out of it's cage set him down on the floor try calling it's name if it comes then click the clicker and give your guinea pig a treat but if your guinea pig doesn't come then try to slap the floor or your knee if your guinea pig comes then click and reward it will take tons of practice but if you really want to train your guinea pig then that's what it's all about never tell your guinea pig no or yell at him her that only puts stress on both guinea pig and owner please only reward and click if nessacary remember your guinea pig won't get it on the first day try to keep your training sessions short so for about minutes on the first day keep that pattern for a week then go for minutes for the rest of the training session no training session should be any longer then minutes thanks and good luck future vet Dog training Domestic rabbit Clicker training Obedience training MapleStory Fancy rat Pet Animal Crossing Stuttering Pig Garfield Taboo food and drink Vitamin C Animals in space Coprophagia Archery Pet skunk Fecal incontinence Professional wrestling match types Click consonant Lisa the Vegetarian Teen Girl Squad The Sims RuneScape quests Chicken Money Cat Joy Division (band) Ferret Marathon (sport) Urinary incontinence Coconut crab Slot machine Reinforcement Pet store USS Yorktown (CV-10) Animal Liberation Front Animal rights Combat stress reaction Pink Floyd Dog Housebreaking Australasia ecozone Whaling Livestock Denis Law Russian space dogs Massage Blonde on Blonde Animals (album) Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Weight training Refrigerator car Texas A&M University Horse breaking Microchip implant (animal) Peleliu Timon and Pumbaa 1731 English cricket season Ron Weasley New Guinea Jonathan Wild Animal Farm Jumpstart 3rd Grade Mel Blanc Animal testing Papua New Guinea The Pet Sounds Sessions The Apprentice 2 Boar USS Ammen (DD-527) RuneScape cheats Hippopotamus Password John Peel Blackadder Blockbuster Video Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Japanese tea ceremony Gaia Online Insulin USS Wahoo (SS-238) Tooth enamel Little Britain Dairy Chinchilla Economy of Guinea Bob Backlund Tattoo The Family from One End Street Saturday Night Live Japanese toilet Three Little Pigs Second Vatican Council RuneScape Random Events USS Stevens (DD-479)
