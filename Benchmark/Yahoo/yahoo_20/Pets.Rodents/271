handling a skittish guinea pig i've had my guinea pig for a few months and she is fairly skittish probably because i know she wasn't handled much in the pet store when she was younger but she's gotten to the point where when i'm entering the room i say hi to her and she sticks her head out of her igloo and squeeks at me and when i stick my hand into her cage she walks over and sniffs at it or takes the treat out of my hand she has a sort of small cage and i want her to be able to get out and get more excercise than just doing zoomies around her cage so what is an easy safe way to pick up a guinea pig without them running away i work with exotics and yes guinea pigs are very hard to catch sometimes sometimes if you move in slow and talk to her then grab her real quick with both hands then hold her against your chest and support her legs just pet her and talk to her a lot they usually like this once you have a hold you can have a treat in your hand or ready to grab and offer her as you hold her to help this as well it's just a metter of trust it takes time so just be patient just try not to squeeze her too much when you grab her if your pig is a boy then change every thing i just said to him instead of her and please acccept my apologies Guinea pig Aerial (dance move) Domestic rabbit Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling aerial techniques Hamster Chinchilla Professional wrestling match types Fast bowling Mad Money Conspiracy (TNG episode) RuneScape quests Gaia Online Dog training The Inside Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Ed, Edd n Eddy Salad Fingers Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling throws Fancy rat Garfield 2000 Australian Grand Prix Trapping Equine conformation Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blonde on Blonde Floppy disk Swingout Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Glossary of climbing terms Sin City Four square Mixed martial arts The League of Gentlemen (comedy) M16 (rifle) Aikido Escape from New York She Loves You Chopsticks Coming of Age (TNG episode) Diving Chicken Rayman Knife Suplex Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Super Mario 64 One Piece minor characters Eric Cartman Ashton-Tate Three Little Pigs Care Bears Tenshinhan Parade (military) IBM PC compatible Kasparov versus The World Shawn Michaels Breaststroke Mach kernel Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Reservoir Dogs Ferret Milton H.
