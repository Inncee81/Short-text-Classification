cats and small rodents i want a pet mouse or hamster but my mom says no i have two cats but i told her i would keep my door shut all the time so they can't get to it but the answer is still no she says it like i'll feed it to them her excuse is 'maybe when we move to a bigger house' but i know we won't anytime soon how can i convince her lots of pets are fine with other pets that are in the house my cousin has a cat that watches the snake and has even gotten into the snake cage my kitty used to let the bird sit on her and watched the hamster but never bothered it i have a kitty now that loves to watch the fish but has never tried to eat it or anything so i think the cats would be fine suggestions call and ask the vet's office what they think about cats and small rodents ask the pet store what they think about cats and small rodents use that as basis for your argument part of your mom's issue might be taking care of the new pet a new pet means money for food bedding a cage toys treats she might worry about the cost she may also worry about your dedication to taking care of another animal try helping out with feeding the cats and scooping their box as much as possible so that you can prove your dedication if she's worried about the cost offer to pay for it i'm not sure how old you are but you might be able to do house chores to earn or get a job or babysit Hamster Garfield Pet Guinea pig Pet skunk Ferret Shaggy dog story Cat Bat Pet store RuneScape quests Rent (musical) Domestic rabbit The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Pet Sematary The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Taboo food and drink Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Calvin and Hobbes Hello Kitty EastEnders Chicken Care Bears Bird Neopets Chinchilla The Fairly OddParents Animal communication Socialization House Mouse The Birds (film) Microchip implant (animal) Animal rights Timmy Turner Sin City Trapping The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Japanese tea ceremony The Star Wars Holiday Special Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wal-Mart Carnivore The Smoking Room Sea-Monkey Feral cat Flea American Alligator Phoebe Buffay's songs Confidence trick Inception of Darwin's theory Badly Drawn Kitties Poker jargon Tooth enamel Mutts Mouse Predation Stewie Griffin Meat Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Doris Day Kodocha Canary Treehouse of Horror V Pok__mon Live!
