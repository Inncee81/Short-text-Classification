would a dwarf hamster manage these tubes i'm buying this cage and a male and female pair of dwarf hamsters would the hamsters be able to climb through the tubing or would i need a mouse ladder heres the cage http www argos co uk webapp wcs stores servlet search storeid catalogid langid searchterms ps i know there is hamsters in the cage but i'm not sure whether they are dwarf hamsters or not it should be okay take a look at it in person and make sure the tube has good enough ridges for your little hamster to climb on if the inside of the tubes are not grooved enough then a dwarf might not be able to make it keep in mind too that it will take a little while for the dwarf to get used to climbing you might get frustrated in the beginning and think that the tubes really are too big for them but soon the hamster will learn and be crawling through it no problem for the record i do agree that you might want to look more at wired cages it will give them just one more thing to play on Hamster RuneScape quests Domestic rabbit Sexual reproduction Professional wrestling match types JavaServer Pages Wire Animal testing Eddie Guerrero Hell in a Cell Steel Cage Match Pet store Computer Dwarfism Tire Muroidea Ladder The Walt Disney Company Paul Wight Magic (illusion) Pachypodium key to species USS Trigger (SS-237) Golden Hamster Poker jargon Web crawler Vacuum tube Fancy rat Guinea pig House Mouse Sexual differentiation UK Singles Chart Snorkel Bicycle frame English plural World Wide Web RuneScape locations Dwarves (Middle-earth) Cerebellum Mouse-like hamster Oscilloscope Domain Name System Spider Uniform Resource Locator The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Escalator Long Path Pinky and the Brain Elevator Trapping Kart racing Hoarding Monogamy Combat Zone Wrestling Robert Ballard Gandalf Ceteris paribus Java Servlet Rings of Power West Coast Swing John Cage Hex (Discworld) Mount Everest Rebreather Faraday cage Gramophone record Mouse Trap (board game) The Ersatz Elevator Kfar Darom Adam Copeland Rib Temerin Leon White Electronic commerce Electrophysiology Jason Reso Anemometer Eumuroida Mountaineering Climbing Internet Thud Argos (retailer) Glossary of climbing terms Big band The Basement Tapes Cray-1 Alaga__sia Torpedo Scientology beliefs and practices Planet Jarrett Cheirogaleidae Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) P-47 Thunderbolt WebSphere Guitar Cricetidae Phonograph cylinder The Time Machine Rail terminology Conker's Bad Fur Day
