what's the difference between the new imac and the old one i was gonna buy the old imac but it seems that it's not on apple com anymore it was the second option i remember and costed about and it used superdrive or something the new imac the first option costs the same and runs on superdrive is there anything that's worse than the old imac i was gonna buy it's the same thing really mainly they just did an update on the outside but nothing really on the inside they only thing that is different inside is that they added a faster graphics card also if you're looking at it from a recyclable point of view it's made of glass and aluminum so it will be better for recycling oh and the first option now on the new imac is the same as the second option on the old one IMac Apple Macintosh PowerBook IBook Mac OS X PowerBook G4 Apple Computer Power Macintosh G3 IPod Floppy disk Mac mini Mac OS X v10.2 NeXT Steve Jobs Atari 8-bit family ILife AirPort IBM PC compatible Timeline of computing 1990-forward Capacitor plague AlphaSmart USB flash drive Mac OS 8 Windows 2000 Recycling Microsoft Windows Counter-Strike AmigaOS Power Mac G5 MAME Windows Vista Apple IIGS IBM Personal System/2 Desktop computer Yellow Dog Linux Radeon Blackjack Power Mac G4 Cube 64-bit Apple II family HyperCard FoxTrot PowerPC Chromatography Plastic 3dfx Bong Mac OS history Windows XP Copland PostScript Laptop Redundant array of independent disks Linux PDP-11 Personal computer Gramophone record Winning Streak Mac OS X v10.1 PCI Express Graphics processing unit Homestar Runner BASIC programming language Neopets PowerPC G4 Handloading Faster-than-light TRS-80 Microeconomics Commodore International Modem RISC The Sims 2 Kaypro Baseball Stars Gross domestic product ITunes Music Store X Window System Old World ROM Amateur telescope making Visual Basic Amiga Sega Saturn SGI Indy System/36 Jonathan Ive Mac OS X v10.0 Star Trek Customizable Card Game Computer Mouse (computing) Commodore 64 Power Macintosh Nintendo Revolution Hydrogen economy History of Microsoft Windows Ultima Online Fuzion Coprocessor Mario Bros.
