how to set color quality to bit but computer winxp only allows and bit my pc specs processor intel core duo motherboard ecs video card bit geforce fx sound card sound card memory gb you are mixing up quite a few video card measurements that i am quite sure of however you didn't use enough of them so we can guess at what you actually meant all we know is that it's a something and it's a geforce fx in this case the could refer to amount of memory onboard which indirectly affects the resolution and colors available for the video modes in your case the does usually have mb onboard memory interface size though for the 's memory interface is bit core processing width bit at a time in this case however having mb does not mean you have bit color far from it you see memory affects the resolution modes available for example let's start with the simplest bit or black and white how many bytes do you need to display it well depends on the resolution x x higher or lower let's just pick x that gives me the resolution and since each pixel is one bit divide by gives me number of bytes needed to display x in b w if i have bit color to th is so that's colors then each pixel is one byte so to display bit color at x is well x bytes about mb if you do the math if i have bit color bytes per pixel then you multiple the previous result by and you get mb of memory needed remember though bit color means each pixel now has to the nd variations of color you can't really tell the difference between the colors at bit color so it's a waste to go any higher than bit color and nobody implements color settings higher than bit CPU cache Radeon NVIDIA ATI Technologies GeForce 6 Series Atari 8-bit family Original Amiga chipset Pixel Video Graphics Array Central processing unit Color Graphics Adapter CPU design Sinclair ZX81 Texas Instruments TMS9918 GeForce 4 Radeon X Series Graphics processing unit 3dfx Computer display standard Ethernet Raster graphics ZX Spectrum Digital Computer numbering formats RGB color model PlayStation 3 PlayStation Portable Digital photography Super Nintendo Entertainment System Commodore 64 Atari ST Apple Computer MOS Technology 6502 Redundant array of independent disks Extended display identification data DV Word (computer science) PC Engine Nintendo Entertainment System Texas Instruments TI-99/4A X86 assembly language Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis GeForce 7 Series Amstrad CPC Color depth CDC 6600 High-definition television X86 Analog-to-digital converter Chroma subsampling Musical Instrument Digital Interface Endianness TRS-80 Color Computer Amiga Dynamic random access memory Universal Serial Bus Windows Vista TRS-80 Apple Macintosh Video Apple II family Dots per inch Addressing mode Graphics card Pentium 4 Motorola 68000 Sega Saturn Mac OS X Personal computer Liquid crystal display Dither Overclocking IMac Compact disc JPEG H.264/MPEG-4 AVC GeForce 2 2D computer graphics TurboGrafx 16 Anti-aliasing JPEG 2000 Nintendo 64 IA-32 Windows 2000 PlayStation 2 File Allocation Table Atari 2600 BIOS PowerPC
