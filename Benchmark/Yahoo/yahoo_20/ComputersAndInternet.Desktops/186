how can i make my computer use more of its ram this is a little hard to explain i got a computer with gb of ram but when i run a big application like a video game the computer ends the game when gb of ram is used saying that to much physical memory was being used now i've experimented and right before the error message appears to close the game and the game is still running i open the task manager and under the performance tab only gb of ram is being used so my question is how can i make my computer use more ram maybe like gb before it shuts down the program if the rest of the ram is used to keep the computer functioning then why does the performance tab say that only of my ram is being used is there any way to conserve ram on vista like all the other answerers said enable increase your paging file virtual memory and also cancel some of the vista's memory hugging services i used this guide on disabling the services and saved about mbs of ram http www blackviper com winvista servicecfg htm oh yes and since it's vista plug in some usb memory sticks while you're playing your game vista can use that free space on the usb drives as a cache and might be able to use many of them simultaneously Virtual memory Windows 2000 PlayStation 3 CPU cache Xbox 360 Embedded system Apple II family IBM PC compatible Windows Vista Mach kernel History of Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh Flash memory IPod Computer Computer forensics Acorn Electron Universal Serial Bus Musical Instrument Digital Interface Atari 8-bit family ZX Spectrum Secure Digital card Nintendo GameCube Redundant array of independent disks Spring operating system Floppy disk FreeDOS Commodore 64 Gmail Sinclair ZX81 PaX Hard disk AmigaOS RISC Domain Name System Computer virus Nintendo Revolution System/34 Blue screen of death PowerPC Atari ST IMac C programming language Common Unix Printing System Timeline of computing 1990-forward System 7 (Macintosh) Cache INMOS Transputer FireWire Macintosh Finder Windows Server 2003 Page table Computer bus Laptop Federal Standard 1037C Read-only memory DragonFly BSD Xbox System/36 Software engineering Apple Computer Mouse (computing) DR-DOS Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Apple IIGS OpenGL PlayStation 2 Overclocking Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Amstrad CPC Macromedia Flash Memory management unit Mozilla Firefox Digital photography Personal computer PlayStation Portable Object Desktop Fritz-chip Google Random access memory Computer hardware Cell (microprocessor) IA-32 NX bit MSN Messenger Copy protection Linux World Wide Web
