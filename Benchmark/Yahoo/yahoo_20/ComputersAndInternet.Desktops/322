how could i power my desk top pc for outside use i need to power my desk top pc for a market and do not have the money for a laptop so i know i could use a generator but was wondering weather there was anything else about like a battery that could be charged up to power the pc generators can be nosey and it would be good for me if i could have an alternative power supply if you have a car nearby i have a solution i'm a truck driver and i use one of these for power http www cetsolar com winverter htm you can find these for at any truck stop i've seen them at walmarts as well but they are usually cheaper at a truck stop if there is a pilot truck stop near your home they have them for it plugs into a car's cigarette lighter and it will power a desktop i've done it you probably will have to keep the car running though if you want a a real alternative power supply they sell these things all the way up to watts they mount permanently to your car and must be hooked up directly to your battery a watt version will pretty much power your entire house with volt power you can find them for less than they make them in watt and watt versions as well Laptop IBM PC compatible Wi-Fi Battery electric vehicle Bicycle lighting Transformer Universal Serial Bus Ford Ranger EV Radio controlled car Battery (electricity) Manual transmission Toyota Prius Electrical generator Lighter Solar power Hydrogen economy Loudspeaker Light-emitting diode Atari ST IPod Volt Pentium M Windows XP Microeconomics Grandview, U.S.A.
