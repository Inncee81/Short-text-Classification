i have core duo e gig of ram seagate gb rpm mb and palit nvidia gt i want to speed more what can ido to make morethan faster my computer or what parts ineed to buy to make super speed in all time my computer try to increase the processors clock rate means the frequency of the processor that will directly affect the processors speed instead of gh you can achieve or even near by without even a single penny RISC Central processing unit CPU design AMD Overclocking MIPS architecture Athlon DDR2 SDRAM Hard disk Front side bus Northbridge (computing) ATI Technologies CPU cache Celeron Microprogram Apple Macintosh Radeon 3dfx Clock rate TRS-80 Color Computer PlayStation 3 PowerPC Microprocessor Pentium D IBM PC compatible PowerBook Moore's law CDC 6600 Opteron HyperTransport Pentium M PR rating MOS Technology 6502 Speed of light Supercomputer Super Nintendo Entertainment System TRS-80 Power Mac G5 Modem Cray-1 GeForce 6 Series Dual-core 64-bit GeForce 2 PowerPC G4 Vector processor IA-32 Computer bus Graphics processing unit Shader Dynamic random access memory PC Engine Cyrix VIA Technologies VIA C3 Pentium Computer architecture Mach kernel Timeline of computing 1990-forward Acorn Archimedes Motorola 6809 Compiler optimization Cell (microprocessor) INMOS Transputer Control Data Corporation Data General Nova Mac OS X Xeon Superscalar Silicon Graphics Application-specific integrated circuit GeForce 4 Field-programmable gate array Computer and video games Self-modifying code Amdahl's law Non-Uniform Memory Access Zilog Z80 BBC Micro Electric motor Nintendo GameCube Acorn Electron Transmeta Seagate Technology Reconfigurable computing IBM PC Optimization (computer science) Radeon X Series AltiVec Commodore 64 Athlon 64 Original Amiga chipset Intel 80486 Cray-2 Gramophone record PowerBook G4 Windows XP Digital circuit
