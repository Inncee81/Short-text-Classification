when i defragged a client's desktop you could hear the rythmic rattle across the room the operation finished ok and the computer still works but i know the palpable vibration isn't good the computer has been in use for at least three years without trouble and i haven't worked on it before so i don't know if this is a new symptom judging from the user's non reaction i gather it is typical is there anything to do or try other than making sure we have full backup and restore capability before it finally crashes if you get a new hard drive now you can do a full disk copy instead of having to rebuild it and restore files if it's clicking whether the user ignores it or not you should probably get that thing replaced Windows 2000 Windows XP Redundant array of independent disks Virtual memory Computer virus File system Floppy disk IBM PC compatible Backup Linux MiniDisc Macintosh Finder History of Microsoft Windows Hard disk Steam (content delivery) Disk image Computer Laptop Windows 3.x AmigaOS Object Desktop MS-DOS File Allocation Table Commodore 64 Malware Cache IPod Commodore 1541 Apple IIGS Knoppix Apple Macintosh Windows Me Password Windows Vista Personal computer Microsoft Windows Novell NetWare Apple II family Embedded system History of the graphical user interface Mouse (computing) Defragmentation Atari ST Mach kernel Disk cloning WordStar Mac OS USB flash drive Stardock Partition (computing) Mac OS X Amstrad CPC Spyware MAME NeXT Operating system Google Boot image control System 7 (Macintosh) Data recovery Sound recording Screenshot X Window System DragonFly BSD Copy protection Warez Computer hardware System/36 Defrag Computer file 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Computer forensics Apple Open Collaboration Environment BIOS Apple Computer Xerox Star Microsoft Office Requirements analysis Computer storage Amiga Virtual Network Computing Digital photography Xbox Musical Instrument Digital Interface OS/2 ITunes Video game music Emacs Thin client Forth programming language Trusted computing Library (computer science) Blue screen of death Anti-virus software File sharing Flash memory LiveCD
