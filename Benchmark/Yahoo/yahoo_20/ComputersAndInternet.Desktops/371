would you rather buy a pc or have someone build one for you i'm debating which route i have limited needs photos internet quicken music mp s what do you think they both have their advantages buying one you will be able to have a whole package that works and if it doesn't you can have it repared when you build one you are piecemealing the machine together you are not sure what is compatable with what nessessarily but you can make it how you want to and not get the extras you pay for when buying a machine also when building you can start with a simple core system and over time put on better pieces and letting you spread costs over time i have done both and if i needed a new one i would go and see what packages there are for sale if there isn't anything that tickles my fancy i would just build one myself IBM PC compatible CPU design Computer Floppy disk System/36 Mac OS X Windows 2000 RISC Extreme Programming RPM Package Manager Bulk vending Commodore International Cable television Microprocessor Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo DS Windows XP Atari 8-bit family Ashton-Tate Voice over IP United States Postal Service Data General Nova INMOS Transputer NeXT Air New Zealand System/34 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Digital Equipment Corporation Apple Macintosh PlayStation 2 Betting (poker) Field-programmable gate array History of Microsoft Windows Domain Name System Redundant array of independent disks Laptop Nintendo Commodore 128 Computer virus Surveillance AppleTalk CPU cache Infocom Central processing unit Port Authority Trans-Hudson Machinima Copy protection PowerPC Labor theory of value W.
