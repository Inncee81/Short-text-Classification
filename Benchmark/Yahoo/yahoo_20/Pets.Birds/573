i had a pair of lovebirds one died what happens with the other one when can i get a new mate well one of my lovebirds just recently died i want to get another one so i have a pair again but i am unsure of how soon i can get another bird as well as if the new bird will be rejected since his mate just died i'm not really sure what to do so help me out please thanks it will depend on the remaining lovebird if it seems very depressed and won't bond closer to you then getting it a friend might help sometimes they will grieve for awhile but then be ok alone lovebirds can and do switch mates occasionally so it's not like you can never re pair them i would find a bird you like do you know if the current bird it male or female that will help in the selection on a new bird since male male and male female pairs work out better than female female pairs usually since females can go a little crazy at breeding time there's always the exception but when getting a new bird i'd stay on the safe side you can then find a new buddy for your bird and introduce them slowly in separate cages for awhile then next to another then try together but carefully watched since they may just never get along but usually like companionship regardless good luck Bird Kakapo Platypus Lovebird Non-human animal sexuality The Birds (film) Emu Ostrich Species Tigon Canary Spider Mallard T'Pol Order of succession Mating system Sexual dimorphism Sexual selection Gender Humpback Whale Ruff Peafowl Albatross Dog Leatherback Sea Turtle Falconry Mosquito Extinction Hamster Monogamy Red Squirrel Animal communication Bagworm moth Peregrine Falcon Gun dog Life in the Freezer House Mouse American lobster Guinea pig Northern Cardinal Mahjong Liger Gray Wolf Same-sex marriage Florida Scrub Jay RuneScape quests Brolga Chess terminology Cat Rock, Paper, Scissors ELO rating system Coconut crab Orgasm The Amazing Race Bobwhite Quail Wolfrider Great Bustard Kodocha Panthera hybrid Emperor Penguin Chess strategy and tactics Pump It Up Dunnock Stereoscopy Micronauts Domestic rabbit Clinical depression Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Ernst Mayr Sexual reproduction Vulcan (Star Trek) Baboon Sheryl Crow Territory (animal) Dinosaur Ecological selection Kiwi Chess problem Irreducible complexity Ruy Lopez Garfield Earthworm Days of our Lives Clownfish Beauty and the Beast (series) The Critic Chess opening The Joker's Wild Animal Light pollution Decision making Tetrapod Big Brother (USA TV series) Ogdoad American Black Bear Conifer cones Wilson's Phalarope Dragons (Pern) Yerba mate
