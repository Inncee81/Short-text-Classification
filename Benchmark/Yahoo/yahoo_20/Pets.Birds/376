i have new neighbours with homing pidgeons i have new neighbours with homing pidgeons they only moved in weeks ago and yet the pidgeons know their way to their new adress how is it that a bird with a small brain can find it's way from camdon to essex they brought them with them in what seemed to be old fashioned picnic baskets the wooden kind that the famous used to use in the books famous five go adventuring etc like the time when they solved the murder and that other time when they found the kidnappers and reported them to the police a bit like black bag the fateful border collie that was in viz who used to solve the mysteries but then it all went a bit wrong a bit like ross mcgwerter from the guinness book of records who slid down a wall and sadly died leaving his brother to run the show so no i wont bother then with this trivia many thanks for your answer which was like a breath of fresh air amongst the spoggy answers from other people which is a bit like when batman fell into that cave and was frightened by them bats which was a bit like how i am feeling now ah well they've come to take my crayons must go thankyou very much a tata homing pigeons are awesome they may not have the same type of intelligence you or your parrot has but don't underestimate them they have a natural homing instinct that has been bred in them for thousands of years and a strong drive to return home to their mate and their nest it is thought that they use magnetic fields of the earth to navigate their way home researchers put magnets on the heads of homing pigeons and they got completely screwed up and lost homing pigeons also rank as one of the fastest birds on the planet they have been reported to fly as fast as mph and can fly hundreds of miles nonstop at speeds averaging mph which in my opinion is pretty impressive for a bird that has such a bad reputation Bird Homing pigeon Rock Dove RuneScape quests 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fast bowling The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Theory of conduct Tenchi Muyo!
