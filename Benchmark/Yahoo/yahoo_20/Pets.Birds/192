what a good price for a cockatiel i found some tht are is that good thanks it depends on where you are what the color mutation is and who you get it from we paid about for a lightly pied male at a pet store about for a gray male at a pet store and for a lutino whiteface pure white bird female from a breeder at a petstore i've priced lutino whitefaced cockatiels to be about gender really doesn't matter while young it is impossible to tell the gender of your cockatiel visually even once the gender is known which for lutinos whitefaces and white faced lutinos you usually either have to rely on genetic tests or on personallity there are still perks to both genders that make the price between them remain relatively even males are more likely to talk and sing and females can breed well that is from a seller's prospective if you know the genders of the birds in question and know you're not going to breed get a male because they won't every have any problems with becoming egg bound even solitary female cockatiels tend to lay eggs obviously infertile which runs them at a high risk of becoming egg bound Cockatiel Cat Androgen insensitivity syndrome Kakapo Platypus Bird Dog Supply and demand Pet Color Mixed-breed dog Ostrich Egg (food) Contract Horse Dobermann Leatherback Sea Turtle Transgender Pet skunk Canary Infertility Gender Legal aspects of transsexualism Sexual dimorphism Clown Hamster Bird migration Sexual differentiation Species Gender-neutral language In vitro fertilisation German Shepherd Dog Gender identity Domestic rabbit Seabird Dragons (Pern) Chocobo Genetic algorithm RuneScape economy Colorectal cancer Biology and sexual orientation Labrador Retriever Drosophila melanogaster House Mouse Panthera hybrid Organic food Final Fantasy XI Guinea pig Sexual reproduction Economics Skunk Labor theory of value Gender role Osprey Human cloning Sex Transsexuality Human sexual behavior Capitalism Honeybee Egg (biology) Havanese Golden Retriever Uranium Discus (fish) Grammatical gender Schizophrenia Liger Health insurance Puppy mill Tarantula God and gender Intersexuality Sexual selection Catalan grammar Homosexuality and transgender Dragon Booster Black panther Lactose intolerance Friends Order of succession Clownfish Domestic violence Twin Ferret Dog show Border Collie Sexual attraction Bee Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Hyperinflation Monopoly Cancer Non-native pronunciations of English Keynesian economics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Man English Springer Spaniel Price discrimination
