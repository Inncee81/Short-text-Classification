how can i tell if my three parakeets are happy and healthy i don't know if my parakeets are healthy because i don't feed them fruits and veggies i do put fruits and veggies in their cage but they never eat it they stay away from it like it is a monster who will kill them i've tried apples celery banana cabbage and brocolli but when i give them their seed diet in their food cup with vitamins they only eat millet and i don't give it as a treat it is in their seed diet i don't really know if my parakeets are happy but they always chirp out loud very loud you can hear them houses away from ours kind of active because they always stay in spot cleaning themselves and i spray them with mist times a week in the summer and i only got them this they only play with three toys wich are balls swing and a mini ferris wheel toy that's all they ever play with are they healthy and happy enough for them to live long budgies i am assuming that is what you are calling a parakeet there are many different kinds of parakeets have a life expectancy of years most of those that die young are either unhealthy or develop a tumor this tumor tends to be a not so uncommon occurrence it tends to show up just before or during the th th year diet of just seed is also pretty common amongst budgie owners for the best health a diet of pellet is better and even that should be mixed with seed and fresh veggies and fruit the way i get budgies on a pellet diet because most budgies when purchased are on seed is i give seed with a small amount of pellets and every weeks i increase the pellet and decrease the seed another thing about budgies if you have paid attention when you change out their food they tend to eat only the food on the top surface the fresh foods should be finely chopped from what i read they appear to be healthy also it is not unusual for them to have a preference on the toys they play with have yet to see one that does not like bells Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Fancy rat Vegetarianism Prostate cancer Budgerigar Dietary fiber Healthy eating Bread Mealy Parrot Atkins Nutritional Approach Stomach cancer Diarrhea Hamburger Colorectal cancer Jewish cuisine Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fruit Organic food Shotgun Tooth Milk Vitamin C Ramen Tomato Chicken Vegetarianism and religion Sea-Monkey Fecal incontinence Dieting Breastfeeding Nutrition Muesli Tocopherol Genetically modified food Blood (computer game) Acne German cuisine Canary Happy Meal Famine Pet skunk Organic farming Potassium Cuisine of Denmark Rice Garlic Anorexia nervosa Cancer Bengali cuisine Chinchilla Fruitarianism Cuisine of Brazil Super Size Me Tofu Cuisine of the Southern United States Banana Miso Urinary incontinence Garfield Food guide pyramid Fugu Hypoglycemia Polish cuisine Health insurance Ferret Sauerkraut Flowering plant Tlingit Hemp Cuisine of Malaysia Farthing (coin) Biological pest control Potato Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Human height Japanese tea ceremony Low-carbohydrate diet Poker jargon Irish cuisine Raw food diet Chile pepper Food preservation Vitamin Maize Chronic fatigue syndrome
