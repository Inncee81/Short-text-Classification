can birds eat ice cream i have a grey cheek parakeet and ive heard that they like ice cream im scared to give it ice cream becuase i think i might kill it i just wanna know can birds enjoy that special cold treat i agree with what seems to be the overwhelming thought here in the fact that it isn't a good idea birds don't have the ability to properly process dairy and while a little dairy such as milk can be alright you have to consider ice cream has other things in it it usually has sugar that isn't good for them and depending on the flavor some can be potentially toxic so i would avoid it there are some human foods that are alright but i would stay clear of most treat foods that we eat especially with a parakeet since their systems would only require a very small toxin to kill them due to their size Ice cream Milk Dairy Kashrut Tofu Dairy product Kosher foods Cream (food) Tea Veganism Milkshake Food Pasteurization Foodborne illness Fecal incontinence Food preservation Organic food Bird Nutrition Coffee Theory of conduct Meat analogue The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Vegetarianism Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Denmark Hamster Patrick Star Lactose intolerance Sewage treatment Dieting Carbon dioxide Japanese cuisine Organic farming Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Vitamin D Dairy Queen Bob and George Soup Breakfast Healthy eating Butter Tooth Oreo New Zealand English Crohn's disease Heath bar Stomach cancer Livestock Rice pudding Breastfeeding Insulin Cat Diarrhea Mango Yoghurt Unclean animals Fugu Atkins Nutritional Approach Potato Escherichia coli O157:H7 Spider Cancer Cheesecake Phoebe Buffay's songs Vanilla Jewish cuisine Kangaroo Trans fat Debugging Vegetarian cuisine Little Britain Plutonium Codename: Kids Next Door Commodity markets Confectionery Gelato Cake Goodness and value theory Sour cream Beatrice Foods Brown Bear Espresso Hypoglycemia Omega-3 fatty acid Alcohol fuel Property (ownership right) Raw food diet Vitamin C Hedgehog Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Acne The Apprentice 2 Tlingit Mushroom hunting Raw milk
