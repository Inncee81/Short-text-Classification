african grey or macaw which should i get are there any differences in these birds intelligence wise life span ect thank you depending on how old you are know that both are like sending a child to college on the amount of the cost a grey does not demand the cage space a macaw does a macaw also has a loud scream compare to a grey macaws will voice their opinions more so then a grey and need to be vocal where as a grey will and can tend to be more noise makers greys can be plucker's if you modify their daily schedule in the slightest both can live to be with a proper diet of pellets and veggies pasta meat cheese fruits and table food both have specific food requirements greys have a vitamin a and d deficiencies while the macaw needs a high protein diet which is found in meat both are found to die of fatty liver disease which cuts into their life span drastically the macaws tend to get nasty when they hit sexual maturity and if you have never had a bird i would not reccomend one as a first bird a macaw has a lb beak pressure and for that reason alone they can be intimidating to a new bird owner you can not fear a beak on a macaw or they will rule you most macaw cages have play pen tops why it's the most stupid things cage designers have done who knows macaws should never be above your eye level that means never allow the bird on your shoulder if you choose a macaw macaws do more damage to people's faces sitting on shoulders then i have seen in all my years yrs the intelligence wise both have the intelligence of yr old children but so do cockatoos i do not beleive the greys are the talkers i have dealt with cockatoos that are much smarter then a grey could ever be never saw a grey pick a pad lock and then place the key back where they got it from and look to see if anyone saw them do it lol other species of birds were never tested yet that's all the diets are important so you want a baby that has the right diet the more variety of foods you feed the healthier the bird will be feeding one thing is not going to make your bird healthy feed it what you eat and off your table will give the bird the variety of vitamins proteins and minerals the bird needs to be healthy what bird you pick is entirely up to you know that it's a life time commitment and think now that if something might change in your life this kid isn't leaving home for the rest of your life it's something you will be passing onto your relatives if you feed it properly so if your life style changes or you go to college this bird will be with you don't make this decision lightly good luck with your decison Domestic rabbit Nutrition Veganism Guinea pig Vegetarianism Vitamin C Hamster Chicken Mealy Parrot Dieting Milk Omega-3 fatty acid Fecal incontinence Genetically modified food Hypoglycemia Breastfeeding Vitamin Dog Egg (food) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vitamin D Anemia Hyacinth Macaw Atkins Nutritional Approach Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Food Fancy rat Livestock Hedgehog Raw food diet Protein Cyanocobalamin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an African Grey Parrot Fugu Coeliac disease Kashrut Soybean Tooth Vegetarian nutrition Colorectal cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human skin color Acne Bird Orca Cirrhosis Diabetes mellitus Insulin Healthy eating Hun-Apu Dairy Growth hormone treatment Adjustable gastric band Conure Low-carbohydrate diet Tlingit Factory farming Macaw Food guide pyramid Natural Selection (computer game) Explosive material Hamburger Cancer Social rule Carpal tunnel syndrome Cheese Welding Cholesterol Puberty Alzheimer's disease Sea-Monkey Pasta Cat Shotgun Ferret Mahjong Spider Capercaillie Chronic fatigue syndrome Kakapo 613 mitzvot Soy milk Education in the United States Trapping Albatross Species Obesity Equine conformation
