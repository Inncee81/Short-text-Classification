i have a cockateil that won t stop sqwarking how do i shut it up thanks for all your answers she s about years old i have tried the towel and she has toy s when ever you leave the room she starts even when the leaves she starts maybe i ll take louise up on her offer and get a contract out on her i ment the bird not louise cockateils may squawk loud when need attention or when they are frightened cockatiels are natural squawkers especially the males the males are much more vocal than the females especially when they are ready to mate it sounds like your cockatiel is trying to get your attention he definately needs to get out of his cage more they need to be out of their cage for at least an hour a day to get their exercise do not put a mirror in the cage with him as this will only frustrate him he will try to talk to the other bird and when he gets no response from that other bird he will get frustrated and he will turn mean you could try covering his cage when he starts the really loud squawking but make sure to take the cover off as soon as he quiets down agian a few times of doing this might let him know that when he squawks too much he will be covered and he'll now that he needs to quiet down make sure however to let him have some squaking time just like a baby it will help to keep his lungs in shape Shaggy dog story John Cage Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Chicken Cockatiel Chinchilla The Shining (film) Squawk Box Salad Fingers Spider Skinny Puppy Kodocha Mealy Parrot Canary Professional wrestling match types Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Magic (illusion) The Visitation September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Shawn Michaels Kakapo Hamster House Mouse Bird Lung The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Friends EastEnders Johnny 5 The Penultimate Peril Spice Girls 1957 World Series Radiohead Rose (Doctor Who) The Curse of Fenric Milton H.
