should i give my cockatiel away or buy her a friend the only thing my cockatiel wants to do is spend time with me or my husband i can't interest her in anything else after years of trying and tons of money spent on toys if she's not with us she screams sometimes unrelentingly for hours on end i've tried the whole ignoring her so she won't scream business she requires constant attention otherwise she gets peculiar and i'm worried she may be getting depressed i am about to have my first baby my husband will be working full time and we do not have the time to spend with her i can't give her all the time she needs i am not sure how many hours a day a solitary cockatiel needs from its owners but from my research it seems they need a very significant proportion of the day which i do not have i realize now i am not a bird person nor is my husband i will soon have much less time with baby on the way would it be better to find her a new owner who could give her the constant attention she requires or to get her a buddy granted i've discovered over the years that a bird was not the best choice for me as a pet but that does not mean i do not love her or that i have not cared for her she has lots of toys which i change out regularly a very large cage i give her a varied diet fresh veggies daily and high quality food even though i've had to make cut backs for myself to feed her the best food i can get and we do spend time with her talking to her petting her she loves head scratches playing with her she is very very affectionate i was only worried we don't spend enough time with her and that with baby on the way and jobs we'll have less time for her in the future i worried she might be depressed b c of her lack of interest in toys and flying though her interest with being with of us is very strong i'd like though if she could enjoy herself while we are away and she's in her cage i hate to think of her being miserable or sad thanks for the advice i did spend a lot of time with her in the beginning she wouldn't touch her food unless i held her she was never scared of me from the start but of everything else and it took a bit more time but she soon grew to adore hubby i think he's now her favorite but i've had her a while now and since those days of the initial spoiling its been at least three years and she is still very demanding i've tried the ignore tactics as you've described been working on them for a very long time now and i've tried radio all types of music and of course toys i don't have a tv i gave that up to make sure she got the best food she even calls while she's eating munch munch whamp munch munch whamp i unfortunately don't know anyone who doesn't have full time employment i think for someone with a lot of time she'd be excellent b c she's very sweet and loving though unimaginably stubborn i've had this happen with some birds in my shelter they were spoiled as soon as they were brought home the owner plays with the bird for hours and hours at first because it's new now the bird expects this every day have you tried entertaining her with the tv lots of birds love tv and actually start having a favorite show this way she can have the entertainment she wants and you don't have to worry about her being depressed the other thing is when the baby comes the bird will get jealous usually and you have to talk to her play with her and soon she'll just accept not being played with because of the new baby if she's screaming to be with you really the ignoring works it does take time especially with spoiled birds but it also depends upon the method you used for ignoring you kind of have to actively ignore birds when she screams shut off the lights no covering the cage they don't understand this and leave the room don't come back until the bird has been quiet for full minutes at first it may take hours but it will happen and once it does you're on your way to a quiet bird also once she realizes that she isn't going to be played with all the time she'll start wanting toys if you're sure that she's not going to work out with your family no you're not a horrible owner this is actually a very responsible thing to do and proves that you're a good owner because you want what's best for the bird just try to find a friend who wants her or contact an avian shelter sometimes they'll give you a list of names of people who want a cockatiel so the bird never has to go to the shelter it can go right from your home to the next home Kodocha Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Hamster Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield EastEnders Chicken Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Characters in the Smurfs Piccolo Junior Saga Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) One Tree Hill (TV series) Domestic rabbit Humphrey Bogart RuneScape quests Breastfeeding Pitaten Time Out of Mind Friends Bird Theory of conduct Little Britain Cockatiel Avenue Q Infantilism Guinea pig John Cage Sin City Ferret Bread W.
