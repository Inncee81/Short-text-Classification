parakeet question my two parakeets have become obsessed with each other i know they are both males so it is not a mate issue you can no longer take one of them out of the cage to play without them screeching and they immediately fly back to the cage also their food dishes that came with the cage i had before i bought are rather deep so when i put their food in there they have to lean in to them to get their food and then all the seed they have popped open just falls back down in the dish i feel like i am wasting food when i dump out their dishes because the good seed is at the bottom do i need to get a smaller dish or should i just leave the food in there and let them dig for it any advice would be great first of all to the smartasses who decided to be extremely rude when answering questions i do have the right cage for me parakeets secondly i do not feed them just seed they eat whatever i eat which is basically different every day i was pertaining to the millet spray in their cage which was given as a treat making the mess lastly their wings are clipped i would not own a bird in my home who did not have their wings clipped and they should not be kept in separate cages they are flocking birds they are meant to be kept in pairs and if you do not have any useful information to give keep your mouths shut thank you to those of you who were very nice and had good answers you don't have to dump the seed to get the hulls out take the cup outside pour it in your hand slowly while blowing and the hulls will blow out and the good seed will be left just make sure that you don't mistake hulls for seeds and starve your birds i read on the internet that some dummy did just that starved their bird thinking they had seed and it was just hulls also i adopted a parakeet from an old man who had to go into a nursing home had i not gotten his when i did he would have probably starved because the dummy that was supposed to be caring for him thought that was seed and it was just hulls when i went to pick up the bird i could have given that guy a good smack but the bird was so happy to be in a good home we brought him home and introduced him to our parakeet and they became fast friends immediately Hamster Chicken Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Canary Shaggy dog story Bird Knots Landing EastEnders Social rule Customs and etiquette of Japan Trapping Theory of conduct Parrot 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anorexia nervosa Domestic rabbit Little Britain The Ashlee Simpson Show 613 mitzvot Sub-Zero Equine conformation Russian joke The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Seabird Brewery Monk Parakeet Albatross Breastfeeding Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ron and Fez 1957 World Series Professional wrestling match types Textile manufacturing John Cage Late Night with Conan O'Brien Aerial (dance move) Poker jargon Salad Fingers Japanese tea ceremony John the Baptist Viva La Bam Chopsticks Bread Doom enemies First English Civil War Ranma __ characters Happy Tree Friends Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Stomach cancer Cliff Richard Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Futurama (TV series - season 4) Contract bridge Elephant Hemp Kodocha Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Eddie Guerrero Cruising (maritime) Saruman Socrates Good Morning, Vietnam John Kerr Athrun Zala Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma YuYu Hakusho Kakapo Ruy Lopez Guinea pig Ant RuneScape Random Events Gray Wolf Saved by the Bell Characters in the Smurfs Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
