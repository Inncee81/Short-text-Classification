my pet chicken i have a chicken and i want her to come with me on halloween cause there is no people on my street but i have no idea if it is a good idea or not could you tell me if there is a chicken leash and if i bring her what we should dress up as will you please tell me some how i dont think people will get drunk all the people on my street are like thanks any way i don't want to ruin your fun but i don't think that is a good idea and i don't think your chicken would enjoy that at all she would probably get very nervous spooked and may run away also chickens do not leash train easily however if you are still persistant about having a chicken to come with you on halloween i would advise tying a rope or string around her leg the sturdiest part of her body just in case she tries to run away and carry her to protect her from halloween drunks creepy people as for dressing her up a ghost costume for a chicken would be easy to make with a hole for the beak comb and eyes again i think your chicken would not like this at all but its your call whatever you do have fun Halloween Chicken Cowboy Professional wrestling match types Kitesurfing New York's Village Halloween Parade Dog training Spidey Super Stories RuneScape quests Fancy rat Falconry Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed Treehouse of Horror III Costume Cat The Haunted Mansion Comanche Garfield Textile manufacturing Saturday Night Live Sento Leash Mardi Gras Red Dwarf characters __douard Manet Great Teacher Onizuka Aerial (dance move) Social rule Professional wrestling throws Trapping Dead Like Me Homestar Runner The Legend of Zelda series enemies The Shining (film) Scream (film) Knott's Berry Farm Jennifer Lopez The War of the Worlds (radio) Clown Happy Tree Friends One Piece minor characters Theory of conduct Wedding Crashers Aladdin (1992 film) Ron and Fez Magic (illusion) Tyrannosaurus rex My Parents are Aliens Military slang Tag H5N1 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Piccolo Junior Saga RuneScape economy Ed, Edd n Eddy Marching band Camp Lazlo Dick Gregory The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Wig (hair) The Wizard of Id Equine conformation Obedience training Plastic Batman Alton Towers European dragon Joke Clothing Archery Human sexual behavior Tlingit Egg (food) Clarinet Beavis and Butt-head Boston and Lowell Railroad Gaia Online Ferret Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Professional wrestling attacks Cockfight Glossary of climbing terms ClayFighter 63 1/3 The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Carnival Dollar store Diving Spanking Ocean's Twelve Totally Spies!
