why do owls only flie at night they don't there are about different species of owl and only about of those are strictly nocturnal the reason we beleive owls to be nocturnal is due to several things for a start owls hunt by using extremly sensitive hearing at night the world is a lot quiter so it's easier for the owl to find it's prey also most of the owls we see in resedential areas barn owl tawny owl ect tend to hunt small rodent mainly short tailed voles these rodents are more active at night and therefore it is sensible for the owl to be hunting them at that time a good way to tell the difference if an owl has a light coloured iris eg yellow or orange eyes it will hunt in the daytime or the night if it has a dark coloured iris black or brown eyes it is a more nocturnal hunter however i have seen barn owls out hunting at in the afternoon before during the breeding season if the owls have owletts to feed nocturnal birds will hunt during the day Owl Leopard Barn Owl Snowy Owl Cheetah Capercaillie Collared Scops Owl Color Tytonidae Cat Stoat Indian Scops Owl Seabird Hamster Eye Red Squirrel Nocturnal animal Burrowing Owl Hunting Pit viper Eastern Screech Owl Southern Boobook Bat Falconry Platypus Iris (anatomy) Tyrannosaurus rex Peafowl Scops owl Kakapo Great Horned Owl Barred Owl Noctowl Spider Tasmanian Devil Great Grey Owl Peregrine Falcon Ural Owl Thermoregulation Vole Laughing Owl Gray Wolf Camouflage Light pollution Tawny Frogmouth Bird Skunk Typical owl Color vision Unreal Eye color Diagon Alley Horse Mushroom hunting Red Fox Northern Flying Squirrel Discworld gods Kevin and Kell Auk Vampire Mountain Beaver Extinct birds Puma Bird of prey Ferret Minor Harry Potter Beasts D'ni wildlife Mothman Tuatara Color blindness Nighthawk Brown Bear American Alligator Bird migration Night monkey James McNeill Whistler Bulborb Muir Woods National Monument Degu Clouded Leopard Beaver Muskrat Taikyoku shogi Conker's Bad Fur Day Laotian Rock Rat Little Owl Meriones unguiculatus Steppe Eagle Colugo Guinea pig Mega Man X4 Trapping American lobster Mosquito San Francisco Municipal Railway Sheffield Wednesday F.C.
