i just got an older parakeet he's about years is it possible to tame this bird considering the age i have just been reading chet womach's web site and he seems to have some great ways of communicating with birds so that you can build up a relationship of mutual trust and have a happy bird i also signed up for his free videos which are delivered by email i thought they were great although he does like to brag a lot i want to try target training with my aggressive african grey basically it is about rewarding him for touching the end of a stick whether he bites the end of or not eventually he will go through all sorts of contortions just to touch the stick and get the treat all the while he isnt even thinking about biting no this isnt spam i havent bought anything of his but it might be something you want to look at http birdtricks com Spam (electronic) E-mail spam Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail Search engine optimization Gmail Phishing Advance fee fraud Spam Prevention Early Warning System Theory of conduct Neopets Blog Advertising Monk Parakeet Usenet Intranet Proxy server Pinball Mozilla Application Suite Streaming media Transmission Control Protocol Pretty Good Privacy Dog training America Online BitTorrent Infantilism Spyware Cross site scripting Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories 2000 Australian Grand Prix Public key infrastructure Internet fraud Conure Customer relationship management Chicago Bulls Parrot Viral marketing Extreme Programming PLATO Wireless Application Protocol Creatures in Bionicle Psychoanalysis Apache HTTP Server Prisoner's dilemma Electronic commerce ALGOL 68 Make money fast Canary Economics World Wide Web Lynyrd Skynyrd Surveillance LiveJournal E-102 Gamma Carolina Parakeet Media in Hong Kong Kalarippayattu Contortion XML Snooker Baseball Stars Baseball Umbra (World of Darkness) Portal of Evil Computer Uniform Resource Locator Falconry Current teachings of Prem Rawat Natural Selection (computer game) Social psychology Link spam Philosophical skepticism Craps 2channel Internet pornography Second language acquisition Jabber Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Software agent Open Directory Project Polish September Campaign 50 Cent Cyberspace Computer-supported collaboration Mozilla Thunderbird Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Anonymous remailer SAML Bayesian filtering Dog The Human Stain Apache Software Foundation Objectivist philosophy Computer virus Skateboarding trick Electronic Arts Webmail MIME Malware Haunted Apiary
