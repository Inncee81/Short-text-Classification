have you ever taken ap us history if so how was it yeah a lot of it depends on your teacher for my apush class i had a pretty easy time of it i had it th hour at the very end of the day and basically dozed through it every day oh we had a lot of work to do in class and out of it but most of it consisted of making up enough notes to satisfy the teacher and hoping he didn t look too closely at them lol for any teacher though you ll have a lot of note taking a lot of listening to lectures outlining chapters apush is a ton of reading and don t let yourself get behind in it that s the type of reading that will very quickly add up to an impossible task if you let it there are large chunks in us history that i never did learn because i put it off and put it off got too far behind and never did actually read those parts lol mostly apush is boring i even generally like history but i couldn t stand u s history just couldn t get into it then again i got a on the ap test go figure lol good luck Time Out of Mind The Cure Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.
