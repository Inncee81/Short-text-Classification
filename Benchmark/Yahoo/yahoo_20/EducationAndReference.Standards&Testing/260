i failed my ap exam but got a good grade in the course how does that work out i took ap spanish junior year and i just got my ap exam results back i got a my teacher gave me a for both semesters how will this affect my application to colleges i also took ap chemistry as a junior and got a on the exam and an in the class also is there a way to hide my ap spanish score but not my ap chemistry score colleges don't usually consider ap scores when you apply to college if you want to send an ap report to any of the colleges i first suggest you cancel your ap spanish score if for some reason they don't let you do that at this point since you have seen your scores you can pay a fee for the score to be withheld on any college board report you send to an university it's per report to hide one score whether you withhold or cancel the spanish grade you can send an ap report to all the colleges you wish it is per report of course with the withholding fee if that ends up applying to you you'll have to spend an extra per report to hide the spanish score sadly i think the colleges will care more about your grades in the ap classes rather than your scores when it comes to admissions purposes so your spanish results will probably look better than your chemistry results if the colleges you are applying to don't consider ap scores in the admissions process Education in the United States Grade (education) SAT Graduate school Education in Taiwan College admissions Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Advanced Placement Program Juris Doctor Education in Portugal A-level Education in Singapore High school Education in Australia Education in Hong Kong Physician IB Diploma Programme Numerus clausus Trinity College, Dublin National Certificate of Educational Achievement Queen's University Test (student assessment) Education in Malaysia Affirmative action Stuyvesant High School Hunter College High School GED College Independent school (UK) Law school Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Victorian Certificate of Education Junior Certificate Appeal Law School Admissions Test UCAS Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Medical College Admission Test Brown University Leaving Certificate Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Prostate cancer Lynbrook High School Matura University of Bristol Secondary education in France __cole Polytechnique Secondary education in the United States DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Middle Tennessee State University Professor DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Princeton University Medical school Regents of the University of California v.
