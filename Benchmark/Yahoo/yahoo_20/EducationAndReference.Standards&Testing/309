i just don't understand the sat writing section every practice test i take i just keep getting low scores in the high low range i'm worried about this because i really want to make it into a good uc but don't think i can i studied the pointer's that barron's and the princeton review printed out but they weren't much help am i doing something wrong or am i supposed to do it differently how are you scoring your practice tests it s sometimes hard to get an accurate score on a practice for the writing section because you can t always give a score to your own essay very easily or accurately have you taken the actual sat that s really the only way to see how you ll do i suggest that you just keep taking practice tests and take the sat in october if you don t like your score you can take it again in november even if you re a senior that s not too late remember that the essay is worth of your raw score and the multiple choice is worth college board has information online that may help you http www collegeboard com student testing sat prep one writing approaches html and information about solving each type of multiple choice question as well as practice questions http www collegeboard com student testing sat prep one sent errors pracstart html in addition to practice tests and questions try to review grammar concepts either in a review book or online there s a lot of good information in identifying sentence errors and improving sentences pay particular attention to subject verb agreement they like to test that a lot because it s something that s going by the wayside in spoken english grammar on improving sentences the correct answer is never in the passive voice and will almost never have a preposition at the end read the sentences in your head with your chosen answer make sure it sounds right the less complicated the answer the better the wrong answers usually weirdly complicate the sentences that sort of thing but you don't just need pointers you need to actually improve your understanding of grammar if you can read a few fiction books with more complex grammatical structure throughout the scarlet letter crime and punishment something like that to improve your grammar skills and get you used to how more complicated grammar sounds and even if you don t do as well as you d like on the writing section that doesn t put you out of the running for ucs even at uc berkeley for example the middle range of students admitted scored on the writing portion a score in the low s would put you in that range and if your scores on the other sections were sufficiently high a lower writing score would not completely kill your chances especially if you ve got a good gpa and some good extracurricular activities on your r sum use college board s college search to find information for other colleges too http apps collegeboard com search collegedetail jsp collegeid profileid to see what you re up against and what scores you need to aim for good luck GED Extreme Programming The Princeton Review Education in the United States Second language acquisition Bulgarian language Theory of conduct Singlish ELO rating system Chinese language Password Philosophy of language Scientology beliefs and practices Greek language Standardized testing Scientific method Arabic grammar Intelligence quotient German grammar Test (student assessment) Linked list Economics Slashdot subculture German language Noam Chomsky A Course In Miracles American and British English differences Cognitive science Grade (education) TOEFL Finnish grammar Chinese character Wheel of Fortune African American Vernacular English Hiberno-English Debugging Non-native pronunciations of English Slovak language Affirmative action Dutch language Translation CPU cache Normal distribution National Certificate of Educational Achievement Vietnamese language Bernard Williams John Lott Swedish language Deconstruction Preposition Sapir-Whorf hypothesis World Wide Web Perl Poker jargon Bayesian inference Plame affair Esperanto as an international language Kasparov versus The World Logo programming language Advanced Placement Program Philosophical Investigations Physics Hong Kong English Welsh language Neuro-linguistic programming Spanish grammar Arabic alphabet Polish language Prostate cancer Appeal Spanish language Gender-neutral language Literacy Expert system Education in Romania Hebrew language Marshall McLuhan C programming language Sesotho language Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Many-worlds interpretation The nature of God in Western theology Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Education in the People's Republic of China
