for sure i'm screw but now what did you think there any chance for me getting to uc school i had gpa and i think i'm done for it what should i do to build up again because i'm going to be a senior and i don't know what to do with my life i know i could i always go to cc and transfer but my parent doesn't like that idea and i felt lower than everyone else is there any chance i can still be something big for my future any alternate for going to uc with maybe a very high sat score if by uc u mean university of california and not connecticut colorado some other random state that begins with a c ur not as screwed as u might think ok sure ur gpa sucks lets be honest here but thats like what a c b average or something lemme just say our valedictorian with a gpa of didn't get into uc berkeley while other ppl with much lower gpas did and lemme tell u why later sure ur gpa is a factor that ucs look at to admit students but there are so many other factors that can outweigh ur low gpa and potentially get u into a uc oh yeah before i continue if youre stressing over u not getting into a uc b c of ur parents then f that u cant always make em happy u gotta do what u can and if u feel like youre disappointing them dont they'll still love u and youre right u can always transfer from community colleges its not as bad as everyone says it is who cares if its frowned upon f them too okay anyway when its time to apply later this fall don't slack off and finish ur application personal statements like days or heaven forbid the day before the deadline like the many idiots i knew who did ur personal statements are absolutely crucial i mean crucial i think u guys have to only write two this year but im not sure go check which depending on how u look at it is either lucky or quite unlucky sure u get to write less but u lose a prompt to respond to which could let u make urself look better heh but anywho the prompts are up already and u should be starting yea so i just checked u do only have to write two essays uc admit ppl are getting lazy be thoughtful and reflective and let all ur teachers and ur parents other adults if they know english read ur personal statements for advice revision and again dont wait till the last minute because theyll just skim it and give u crappy advice make them read it over and over again until its perfect another factor community service and extra curricular activities dont exaggerate ur community service hours and if u have none ur high school sucks for not having a requirement but anyway start now ur summer's about to end list all of ur extra curricular activities as well cause they'll ask u to list em and write like a lil sentence or two about what the club activity is what positions u hold if ur in a sports team college prep class asb etc those are good too if youre not in any clubs sign up for them once school starts just dont rely too heavily on ur gpa sat scores i mean dont f them off completely but dont be so discouraged for sure im screwed not for sure stay positive honestly i think the personal statements were the most critical thing for me i just graduated this year u still have time oh yeah another thing the acts are sooo much easier than the sats do both of them and report both of ur scores if u have to bc ur not satisfied with ur score take the december sats and report ur score later u can do that after u submit ur application once the deadline arrives if u check the lil box thing that tells them youre taking the december one oh yeah u also need two sat ii subject tests for ucs heres what i had that got me into berkeley gpa sat total act composite sat ii math ii i dunno why i even bothered to take this lol us history again these factors were very modest and quite low to be admitted into cal but i think my personal statements put me over the top and no if u think im a rich white kid whose parents paid their way for me to get into berkeley then u are wrong i am neither white nor rich okay theres my advice for u dont be discouraged also do some research on what u want to do with ur life b c again different ucs are good depending on what u want to with ur life also csus arent as bad as well have u looked into those as an alternative apply to ucs and csus for backup and dont do what ur parents want do what you want ps financial aid scholarships search and apply for them if u need it or not just apply dont be lazy Education in the United States College admissions Graduate school GED Grade (education) Poker jargon Law school Education in the People's Republic of China
