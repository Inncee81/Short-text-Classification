studying for the act what if u don't complete a section ok i'm only studying for the act i didn't complete the science reasoning part so are the questions that i didn't get to wrong what exactly happens with them i'm confused and so stressed right now the act is not like the sat in that it does not deduct points for incorrect answers for this reason you are encouraged to answer every question even if you must guess that said the questions you didn't answer are considered wrong it's like any other test you would take at school the science part has questions your raw score is the number of questions you got right so it's not counting any of the ones you did not do or the ones that are wrong the raw score will be scaled which accounts for different test versions and then they round all of the parts together english math etc i'd say that if you did well on the other parts of the test you have a chance at a good composite score if you finished less than half the section it will probably detract from the composite score SAT Quizbowl Advanced Placement Program GED Science Bowl The Princeton Review Test (student assessment) Graduate Record Examination $ale of the Century SmartAsk Marilyn vos Savant Scientific method Split Second Family Feud The Joker's Wild Chain Reaction (game show) Normal distribution Standardized testing Education in the United States Mathematics Match Game Education in Romania Twenty One (game show) Fallacy Ken Jennings Fifteen to One Password (game) Theory of conduct Reach for the Top Intelligence quotient Extreme Programming Jeopardy!
