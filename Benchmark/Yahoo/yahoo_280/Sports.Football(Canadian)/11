do you think the eskimos can come back and win the grey cup this year i would have to say that this years eskimo squad is very lucky to be where they currently are in the standings they should likely have lost both games against the roughriders which they split and they should have lost their season opener to winnipeg they defeated the tabbies yesterday because of a dropped pass and a very questionable non call on a pass interference late in the fourth quarter if anything they are higher in the standings than their play has dictated given the strength shown by both saskatchewan and the bc lions the chances of the eskimos representing the western conference are somewhere between slim and none Grey Cup Saskatchewan Roughriders Edmonton Eskimos Canadian Football League West Division Toronto Argonauts British Columbia Lions Ricky Ray Damon Allen Canadian Football League Winnipeg Blue Bombers Cleveland Browns Western Canada Hockey League Montreal Alouettes Pittsburgh Steelers Stanley Cup Hamilton Tiger-Cats Calgary Stampeders Super Bowl V 2002 CFL season John Avery (football player) Canadian Football Hall of Fame November 2004 in sports 92nd Grey Cup Bowl Championship Series 2003 CFL season 1995 CFL season September 2005 in sports New York Giants San Francisco 49ers National Hockey League rivalries Poker jargon Alex Ferguson National Football League Ottawa Renegades Ottawa Senators (Original) National Football League Lore 1993 CFL season New York Rangers Super Bowl XXVI 1994 CFL season FA Cup Ravi Shastri Chicago Cubs NBA Finals Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.
