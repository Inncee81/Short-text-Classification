please answer i need to know your opinion i am starting a small online business probably on ebay selling totes that my mom and i make i just want your opinion to make sure that you guys would buy them i would rather not sell them on ebay so if you know of a site that we can sell items on and have it be our own then please tell me the bags aren't made yet well sites like cafe press let you make up your own store you can buy the professional one at a certain cost per month and then you can make some real money you can also get your own website like cutetotes com or whatever you want to call it just make sure you buy one with e commerce options on there so you can have a shopping cart and so forth just do some research you could also list them on ebay the more places the more exposure more profits Camouflage Canadian Armed Forces Active camouflage Khaki Heavy metal fashion The Wrong Trousers Battledress United States Marine Corps Undergrads Military uniform Teen Girl Squad Trousers Dragonfly Disruptive Pattern Material Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Skinhead Army Combat Uniform Penguin Majin Buu Saga Roy and HG Invisibility Peppered moth ecology Timbuktu Marianne Faithfull Scarface (1983 film) Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Peppered moth evolution What's Happening!!
