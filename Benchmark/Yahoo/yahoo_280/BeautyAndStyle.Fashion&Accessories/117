what color shirt should i wear for picture day my background is going to be pink white would be best because pink is a mix of red and white its in the lighter spectrum you dont want dark colors because pink is a light happy color after hundreds and thousands of pictures my experience has found that trying to mix different colors of pink doesnt always turn out too good keep in mind there is a lot of red in the face and that your hair and eyes have color as well if this is a picture day for a school and the yearbook is greyscale then try to go more for a shape in clothing then a color and if you have color photos than i am happy for you and remember to think of something funny fake smiles do not compare to the real thing Color Grayscale Human skin color Light-emitting diode Care Bears Jennifer Lopez Color blindness Color theory Drawing Meriones unguiculatus Hair color Red Atomic Kitten My Little Pony Stereoscopy Black Pink The Ashlee Simpson Show CIE 1931 color space Logo Rainbow Brite Gamut Chicago Cubs PNG Social rule White Keeshond Optical spectrum Paul Is Dead Cliff Richard Horse Qualia Rose Teletubbies The Wall Time Out of Mind Leather Blue Barbie CMYK color model Green Day Sunglasses Billiards Black (people) Opportunity rover Patrick Star White (people) Jon Secada Yellow Comanche Bonus Stage Paramount Pictures Rayleigh scattering Kender Primary color Albedo Gothic metal Power Rangers Abstraction Tibetan people Marching band JPEG Pitaten Color temperature Political colour Scrubs Physical attractiveness Diamond color Diamond Rich Mullins Mendelian inheritance Black-and-white Piccolo Junior Saga Fluorescent lamp Death rock fashion Color space Negima Code: Lyoko Plasma display Headgear Spot the Dog Eye color Synaesthesia Cosmetics Humphrey Bogart Material properties of diamond Plastic Black body Mnemonic Oakland Athletics Labrador Retriever W.I.T.C.H.
