i need sewing help sewing on a hood i'm reconstructing a band tee and i really would like to put a hood on it however i am not sure how to go about doing this if someone could please help me tell me how i need to cut the neck line and attach the hood that would be wonderful don't cut the tee cut the hood off at the seam where it meets the neck if there is no seam try it on with a hoody on under it and mark where the seam is on the inside with chalk or put pins then cut it there pin the hood to the shirt and try it on keep re pinning it until it fits right once it fits right loosely stitch the hood onto the tee and take the pins out securely sew strips of the left over hoody you got the hood from onto the inside and outside of where the hood and the tee meet this will make it a lot stronger and last longer and since you didn't cut the tee if it comes out cruddy you can just take the stitches out and re sew it have fun Adriana Lima Alessandra Ambrosio Victoria's Secret Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Ana Beatriz Barros Teen Girl Squad Patricia Ford FHM-US's 100 Sexiest Women 2005 Wood carving Marilyn Monroe Independent Media Center HyperText Transfer Protocol Alessandra Mussolini Slayers Resident Evil: Apocalypse Kylie Minogue Taki (Soul Calibur) The Sopranos Thomas Cole Moe Szyslak California Adriana Lecouvreur Victoria Cross Jean Grey Windows Vista Ford Crown Victoria William-Adolphe Bouguereau gallery PlayStation 3 War of the Pacific Victoria (Australia) Diego Vel__zquez MAD Magazine Tyra Banks Xbox 360 JPEG Victoria and Albert Museum PlayStation 2 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Billboard Hot 100 Dream Job (Season 2) Deep Impact (space mission) Cleveland Browns Death (personification) Bob Hope African American Vernacular English Game show Jacques-Louis David Andrew Blake Bon Jovi The Ashlee Simpson Show Oasis (band) European Parliament election, 2004 (Italy) Piccolo Junior Saga Shaquille O'Neal The Penultimate Peril Another World (TV series) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Eucalyptus Kevin Smith Virginian Railway Barbie The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Karen McDougal Mexico City International Airport Slashdot trolling phenomena Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Yoshimitsu (video games) Sega Dreamcast Meat Loaf Lima District Hair metal Mikhail Vrubel Desperate Housewives Drill bit Pontiac Aztek James T.
