how do you handwash delicates i have new tops and underwear etc with 'handwash only' on and it may sound stupid but how exactly do you do this and products what should you use thanks x its not that hard just use mild detergent or just use a bit of dish soap if you decide to use regular soap do not apply the soap directly to the clothes and if the detergent is blue make sure you add enough watter just get a bucket and fill it up with watter sometimes i jst clean the sink and fill put watter in it then you just put watter and the detergent while the watter is still running then you put the clothing in and just rub it in the watter concentrating on like the arms part of the tops and stuff if has stains you jst rub them then you rinse them off its some what like washing your hair its not hard at all i actually like doing it just make sure they smell like clean then follow the instructions for drying have fun HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Web server Glam rock Donna Summer Tokusatsu Futari wa Pretty Cure Computer-generated imagery Cliff Richard Gothic rock Ramones HTTP cookie Weather front Computer animation Hey Arnold!
