how do you fix a zip on a hoody jacket a tracksuit top style jacket that i have has had the zip break today and i want to fix it cos i like the top the side which the zip is attached to that you pull up has come off the jacket and i cant get it to go back on is there anything i can do to repair it you have to open the seams bottom part on the side that is broken pull the zipper cloth teeth away from the jacket enough to work with and looking closely you'll see a small ridge where the teeth of the zipper are attached slip the ridge teeth into the zipper slot and line up the other side teeth as best as you can and pull up if you are close enough the zipper head will layer the teeth correctly sew everything back into place and if the zipper head pulled off one of the teeth that caused it to come apart sew a big knot where the tooth was to keep it from coming out again if you sew it's a lot easier to just put in a new zipper Zipper Shirt Fast bowling Glossary of climbing terms Sewing Sewing machine Textile manufacturing Maxilla Straitjacket Climbing equipment Mattress Mandible Sailing Clothing Glossary of nautical terms Shoe Horse tack Seismic retrofit Bookbinding Equine conformation Stocking Autopsy Upholstery Clothing terminology Manual transmission Gag (BDSM) Brewery Knife Trapping Diving suit Drill bit Swingout Textile manufacturing terminology Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Screw Aerial (dance move) Social aspects of clothing Paragliding Canadian Armed Forces Saw Table saw Elevator Characters in the Smurfs Scuba set Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Floppy disk Skinhead Dog training Kilt Flag USS Vestal (AR-4) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Ulna Rigging USS William B.
