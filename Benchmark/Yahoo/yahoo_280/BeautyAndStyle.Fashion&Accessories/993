job interview i have a job interview for the new kohl's that is hiring located in my town i was just wondering if anyone has any advice for job interviews being that this is my first one and i am a bit nervous since it is a group interview oh and if you have any experience working at kohl's can you tell me what it is like working there any tips would be greatly appreciated oh i would also like to know what to wear to the interview which is how this question fits into beauty and style i feel most confident in an interview when i am prepared with that being said i would become familiar with the products at kohls what do they sell who are they targeting as their consumer etc in addition i would try to anticipate questions that you might be asked and mentally rehearse your answers to those questions some questions that you might be asked are as follows why do you want to work at kohls what are you strengths weaknesses what is your availability how would you deal with an irate customer if a customer asks you where to find an item and you don't know what the item is or where it is located what would you do what experiences have you had that will prepare you to be an employee at kohls what are your goals for the future what would you do if you knew one of your coworkers was stealing from kohls how would you managae conflict with a fellow employee supervisor tell us about one of your achievements regardless try to stay calm be aware of your posture and make eye contact with the interviewer as far as what to wear i am assuming that you are applying for an entry level position as such i don't feel that a suit is necessary however i would wear a pair of black slacks and a button down shirt make sure to iron them also wear close toe shoes on an interview avoid wearing a lot of make up jewelry or perfume good luck Social rule The Apprentice 2 Diving The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.
