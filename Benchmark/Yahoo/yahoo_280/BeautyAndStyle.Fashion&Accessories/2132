how can my shoes be too tight in the toes but fall off my heels with or without socks on every time i start walking in these they fall off my heels when i'm just standing they're a little snug in the toes but not too bad i really don't want to have to return them because they really are gorgeous so is there some way i can fix them note i already put heel grip and full length insole footpetals in them it's possible to put your weight on your heels while walking in stiletto pumps i think i'll try the tissue in the toes idea tomorrow double up on the heel grips lose the foot petals if it covers the entire inside of the shoe it could be making your toes have less space and placing your heel a bit higher then where it should be are these peeps toes or open toe the more you walk in them the more you're feet slide down and away from the heel stuff some cotton balls in the toes if it's closed to prevent your feet toes from slipping down so much wow just thought of that one but haven't tried it hmm i should try that on a pointy pair i have brb finally can you go back and get a half size smaller uh too wide where did that come from a guy she can get them on she said more like her heel is to narrow that's always my problem Baugur Group Oxford Street Philip Green Dottie West Metro Detroit Wally West Agatha Christie Department store Brisbane Penguin (comics) Retailer The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Nordstrom Flash (comics) Blanchardstown Shanghai Metro What's My Line?
