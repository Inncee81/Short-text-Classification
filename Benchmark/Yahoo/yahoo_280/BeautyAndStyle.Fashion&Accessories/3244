will people make fun of me if last year grade and i was in middle school i dressed in very causal clothes all i ever wore was sweats and hoodies i dont know why i dressed that way i guess i was just lazy then this summer i started to like clothes from hollister abercrombie fitch and american eagle i bought almost all my back to school clothes from those stores i really like the clothes they have there and i didnt buy them just because they are in or whatever and i didnt buy them just to fit it it's truley the style i like i'm just wondering if people will think i'm a poser i also got a hair cut straightened my hair and started wearing a bit of make up i kinda gave my self a make over what do you think others people will think thanks for you answer also i was pretty shy last year and i will probally be this year too will people noticed how i change by the way i dressed sorry for asking this for the rd time lol my style know is preppy but before it wasnt really anything will people think i'm a poser here's the deal everybody needs change in life everybody gets it whether it's a change in your style of dressing or something bigger it's still a change don't be afraid of what people think trust me by the end you'll regret the things you didn't do because you were too afraid of what others thought about it if people actually think about what you're wearing or act like it matters to them whether you've changed or not they are either too lame or they think you're really special but trust me not alot many kids care i think the bottom line here is you shouldn't care about what they think because nobody else has the right to claim or do stuff for you you are who you are you're not a poser besides at the age you are not many people know what who they are they spend maximum time trying to fit in so just relax do what you have to do if you go back to what you were wearing before i think that's being hypocritical to your self that's worse HyperText Transfer Protocol World Wide Web Website Uniform Resource Locator JavaServer Pages Ajax (programming) Web server Uniform Resource Identifier Web design Wget Domain name Web crawler Java Servlet HTML Cross site scripting Virtual hosting Representational State Transfer Web page Web browser History of the Internet Internet Application server Jakarta Tomcat Domain Name System Digest access authentication Internet censorship in mainland China Beauty contest Gopher protocol Web traffic Meta tag Wiki PHP BitTorrent CPAN HTTP cookie Slash (punctuation) Phishing Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Ecclesiastical Latin Web cache Unicode and HTML Squid cache Mozilla Application Suite Lotus Notes Hyperinflation Evening gown Visit of King George IV to Scotland Proxy server WebDAV SAML Character encodings in HTML Black HTML element Server-side scripting Flickr Miss Venezuela Software agent Gmail 200 (number) Apache HTTP Server Mozilla Firefox Common Unix Printing System Google Web Accelerator Academic dress Client-server 300 (number) 500 (number) Drag queen Kaisariani Academia Denial-of-service attack Methana Google bomb Opera house Wales Wedding dress Karytaina Search engine Base64 Search engine optimization Slashdot subculture Port numbers Fictional websites in Doctor Who Mydoom Quotation mark Google search Internet privacy Web portal Magnet link Wireless Application Protocol Inflation Fire Mod python Internet Explorer Evening dress White House The Book of Mozilla Web analytics Konqueror
