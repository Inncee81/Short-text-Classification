question about a nail polish i've decided to get a french manicure for back to school not acrylics but the only problem is i'm really worried about them chipping easily they always do for me if on the first day i have them and i hate chipped polish so i was wondering if after i got them done at the salon is there some sort of polish i can paint over the nails so prevent chipping does it really work and how often should i do this or should i just get acrylics after all help thanks a french manicure is so pretty wether its acrylics or natural nails the do have a top coat that they paint over it but it can still chip acrylics look great but do damage your nails and need to be filled often if your nails are still narly from the last cycle of acrylics you might want to get them again if you really want them to look nice if you deceide to go with natural you could always buy the white and base coat and take it with you to carefully fix any mistakes made and match the color exactly good luck theyll look great either way Shoe Skinhead Kilt Bob Jones University Black tie Suit (clothes) Social aspects of clothing Leggings High-heeled shoe Irish dance Leather Undergarment Heavy metal fashion Softball Boot Corset Clothing Gothic Lolita Footwear Sock Headgear Casual Coat (clothing) Napoleon Dynamite Punk fashion Loafers Culture of the United States Tennis shirt Morning dress Cowboy Trousers Textile manufacturing terminology JavaServer Pages Kimono Stocking Jesuit College Preparatory School Tightlacing Skirt and dress Sport rowing Athletic shoe Professional wrestling match types Reebok Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
