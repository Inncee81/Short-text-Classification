senior pics i have to take my senior pictures tomorrow and i'm not quite sure what to wear for my casuals i was thinking a halter and jean skirt but i dont want to over do it what do you think what did you wear the halter is on the more elegant end it is loose fitting and long well depends on if you're having a full body shot or just an upper body face shot i think my school told us to wear dark colored long sleeved shirts since those will look better against the background but you don't have to i think what you're wearing is ok i wore a light blue shirt and jeans p nothing too fancy Vince Carter Nike, Inc.
