low cut tops with small breasts is it ok with women to wear low cut tops if they don't show any cleavage because of their small breast size i'm a size a b well i'm not even really sure because i can still wear training bras xd and i'm sometimes i even go with the layered look and wear tops that have a built in bra and that's all i need so yeah can i wear low cut tops i mean i wouldn't be showing anything but would it still be slutty looking btw if i ever wear a lower cut top i always wear bermuda shorts or longer pants btw i am completely happy with my breast size i can go jogging and not have to worry about wearing a sports bra and what not they're also firm xd and i have friends with bigger boobs complaining that they are too squishy lol i used to be a ballet dancer so i don't have much body fat on me to begin with and of course us dancers have great legs and muscle tone ever notice that celebrities like paris hilton kiera knightly kate hudson nicole richie etc all have small busts but wear low cut tops and dresses that's because women with small busts can wear low cut tops without looking slutty so i say go for it JavaServer Pages Ajax (programming) Web browser World Wide Web PHP HyperText Transfer Protocol Web design Web server Lotus Notes HTTP cookie HTML Mozilla Application Suite ASP.NET Java Servlet Apache HTTP Server Uniform Resource Identifier Uniform Resource Locator Server-side scripting Web application Spyware Semantic Web Common Unix Printing System Gmail Mozilla Firefox Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Cross site scripting Proxy server Application service provider Jakarta Tomcat Squid cache Electronic commerce Sears Holdings Corporation Pok__mon Live!
