if you knew abercrombie was racist if you heard the owner of abercrombie say his clothes were not intended for people other than whites would you still shop there its just a question that occured to me i'm not totally against abercrombie i think they have cute clothes but it seems like people just shop there cuz everyone else does so i was wondering if there is anything or anyone who could actually stop them from shopping at abercrombie actually the owner has said stuff like that also that he only wants skinny rich popular girls shopping at his store i personally think abercrombie is really tacky and i shop at neimans nordstrom and barney's Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
