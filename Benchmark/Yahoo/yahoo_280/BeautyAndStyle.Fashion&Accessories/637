my girlfriend likes me dressed in feminine attire i find it exciting and wonder if i should do it more my girlfriend i are both and we have played around with me wearing some of her clothes i have started to wear panties almost all the time and it is exciting she has taken me shopping and has helped me buy feminine things to wear for her a few months ago i finally wnet out with her all dressed up to dinner and a movie it was wildly exciting and we had a great time if you know what i mean now i am wondering if i should start wearing women's underwear all the time and dress as a girl to go out with her on a regular basis i find the idea of this more and more exciting and stimulating i even went out and bought myself a corset and have tried it on a couple times but haven't let cindy know i have it yet are there other guys out there that dress up like a girl for their girlfriends all the time why do you think that cindy find this so exciting for us to do some women's clothes are very practical as you have found out but going all out is a bit much when guys try on a pantie that fits usually lycra with wide crotch they will not change back to the typical non comfortable male undies so you aren't alone pantyhose is now unisex proof http www activskin com au benefits htm check the benefits to become a believer and this is just one of many companies most likely brad pitt is correct in that a skirt will be the next fashionable item for guys since they are more practical than shorts in hot weather and actually make more sense for guys than girls kilts are becoming popular http travel nytimes com travel foraging html but a kilt is a skirt by definition so just get a less expensive denim cargo mini in place of shorts and it will look fine girl jeans are a change from the horrible baggy jeans most guys wear thus are an alternative but i would draw the line there wearing high heels bra etc just doesn't make sense for a guy unless you are a bit screwed up it is doubtful another girl friend would put up with it so be careful it is exciting because is is out of what is perceived to be normal it is most likely you are both looking for attention and yes others also do this Undergarment Clothing Pantyhose Kilt Trousers Gender role Skirt and dress Social aspects of clothing Cross-dressing Ranma __ characters Strap-on dildo Friends Corset Little Britain Stocking Heavy metal fashion Professional wrestling match types Marilyn Monroe Diving suit Tightlacing Skinhead World Wide Web Leggings Hijab Tire Haven (TNG episode) Phoebe Buffay's songs Denim Sauna HyperText Transfer Protocol Characters in the Smurfs Japanese tea ceremony Flapper Bob Jones University Suit (clothes) Canadian Armed Forces Transsexuality Professional wrestling slang G-string Sharon Tate Shoe KaBlam!
