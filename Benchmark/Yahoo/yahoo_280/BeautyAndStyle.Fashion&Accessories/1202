braces help ' k so first of all i'm eleven and going into th grade my orthodontist just told me that i'm gonna need braces and so i'm gonna go and get some before the end of the year my mom says that invisiline only works for like smaller things so i can't get that for a while my friedns say that htey can't even imagine me with braces what do i do i don't wanna look bad goin into th grade are there any suggestions on like what color i should get or any way to hide the braces a little plz i'm in desperate need of help ' k well if u end up answering this thanx soooooooooooo much i have braces too and i was absolutely terrified of getting them because i am kind of really smart and i wear glasses so i thought people would make fun of me if i had braces too but you know what no one did and it is so common now that you really do not need to worry about it now all my friends are used to me wearing braces i have gotten used to them too so now i feel comfortable with them just think of how much more beautiful your smile will be when you get your braces off if you want to hide them a little always get the silver or grey color so that it will not be too bright you can also get the tooth color but i do not reccommend that one because i do not like that color and it also does not make the braces less prominent white is also okay but then the color difference between it and the color of your teeth makes your teeth look yellow so basically just always go for silver or gray once you get used to it you can start wearing different colors they have a gazillion colors so just have fun with them and practically no one has the invisaline ones because they are so expensive anyway do not worry because believe it or not in a week or two or maybe even less than that you will get used to them and also they do not hurt as much as they are supposed to hurt for me the whole thing was pretty painless but if you have to wear head gear it does get annoying i had to wear head gear nights only for six months but it has made a huge difference so it is all for the best make sure you follow your orthodontist's directions very carefully because if you do then you can actually decrease the time for which you have to wear them don't worry about seventh grade either it is practically the same as sixth grade except with more homework so good luck with your braces Shaggy dog story Social rule Milton H.
