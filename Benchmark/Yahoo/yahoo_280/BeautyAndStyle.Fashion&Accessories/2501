do you think i'm materialistic i was talking on the phone to my friend and she called me materialistic she said i am a spoiled brat which is not true she asked me about some of my new clothes i got for school and i started telling her and then she said it and these were her exact words you are so materialistic you think that just because you have pairs of jeans you're soooo special well in years no one will care you have all these fancy clothes and no one cares i was like umm excuse me i but just about all my fancy clothes on sale i clip coupons to department stores from the newspapers i buy vintage and she asked me and it not like she poor or anything she has just as many clothes as i do now i'm the first one to admit i love clothes and stuff i love to shop and i won't say those things don't mean anything to me because that would be lying i don't brag i only tell people when they ask which she did so what is your opinion i always always donate my old clothes to charity that would be wasteful not too but i mostly shop at the big department stores vintage and some other small botiques i don't brag about my stuf cause i probably do have more than the average person i spend around dollars a month on clothes no i dont think you're materialistic i think what happened was that your friend wanted you to list what you bought so that she could compare it to her wardrobe and when she found out that you had a lot more cute stuff she got jealous and called you materialistic i would worry about it just make sure that shopping and possessions aren't your biggest priority in life and you won't be materialistic Skateboarding Skateboarding trick Poker jargon Blackjack Roulette Wal-Mart Craps Artistic roller skating F.W.
