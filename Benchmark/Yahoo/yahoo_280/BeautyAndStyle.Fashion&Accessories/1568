prepare for back to school so i am a little bored this summer so i am going to try to do stuff to prepare me for back to school including clothes and supplies learning stuff haircut nails stuff like that what should i do any other suggestions of stuff to do well get school supplies like pencils pens paper and a folder those will be the essentials teachers usually tell you what to bring the first week for your clothes follow your own style you know what you like and what looks good on you so just get clothes and prepare them the night before so you wont spend an extra minutes deciding what to wear haircut get layers and bangs if you want they give a nice shape to your hair nails i usually just go with a clear polish to make them look shiny i do my toes too but it doesnt really matter also other suggestions the night before school do everything throughout the day not only at night like wash your hair straigten then you can go over it in the morning shaving your legs and under your arms putting out things you have to bring to school this is just so you wont go to bed around and be tired and have bags under your eyes the first day hope this helps good luck Whose Line Is It Anyway?
