what is a good bra for really heavy boobs i wear a g and it doesn't seem to matter how much i spend on a bra i can't find one that stays in place and lifts my boobs back up to where they once were anyone out there have the same problem i typically by minimizers but i need something that lifts seperates is comfortable and most importantly stays in place i have been professionally fitted so i know i am getting the right size just can't find the right brand help oh yay you're the same cup size as meee d i'm a g annoyingly it's probably better for you to buy your bras from shops that specialise in making bras for busty women which unless you're lucky enough to live near a shop means buying online this is because other companies often just make 'bigger versions' of their smaller bras and even though these fit they're not really designed with support etc in mind if you shop from somewhere that specialises you'll often find that these bras are much much better and they do lots of different styles including ones that specifically aim to 'lift' your boobs furthermore there's more to choose from i don't know about your experiences but i often find that the only bras in our size from regular shops tend to be pretty ugly or plain as far as outlets go i am very fond of www bravissimo com and i've heard www figleaves com have a good dd section if you don't want to buy online maybe look at the brands that these sites are selling and try to find them elsewhere some examples are fantasie freya kalyani and panache anyway i hope you find some nice bras Brassiere Undergarment Caprice Bourret Electronic commerce Advertising Strap-on dildo Tesco Mattress Pickup truck Perl Bra (Dragon Ball) Theory of conduct Sears Holdings Corporation Advanced Squad Leader Social rule Professional wrestling match types Gramophone record Table saw Social aspects of clothing Equine conformation Starbucks Menstrual cup Infantilism Vegeta Homer Simpson Bras__lia Bicycle Microeconomics Shopping mall Pet Shop Boys Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Tyra Banks Madonna (entertainer) Cruising (maritime) Tire Surveillance IBM PC compatible Anchor Baseball Bish__jo game H2G2 Poker jargon Final Fantasy IX Cascading Style Sheets Marching band Messerschmitt Bf 109 Earring Magic (illusion) Little Britain Capitalism Hiberno-English Computer Shirt MapleStory Fish and chips Paragliding View camera BASIC programming language Glossary of ballet terms Diving suit Bicycle lighting Customs and etiquette of Japan Public transport Neopets The Skeptical Environmentalist Mozilla Firefox Galactic Civilizations Kolkata Violin Sailing Radio Yerevan Mary Phelps Jacob MMORPG The Smoking Room Gross domestic product Joke Japanese tea ceremony Autism W.I.T.C.H.
