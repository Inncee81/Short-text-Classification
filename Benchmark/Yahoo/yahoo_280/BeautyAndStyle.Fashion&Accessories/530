can i get my black juicy sweat shirt a lighter color i have this sweatshirt from juicy couture it's not zip up it's a long cotton thick hoodie with cut off sleeves if it wasn't black i hate wearing the color black i would actually wear it this winter is there a way or would it work to get it a lighter color like purple or blue i bought this item a year ago they don't sell it anymore so buying another is not an option i'd recommend washing it with bleach once or twice to see if the colour fades at all if the colour does fade put the sweater in the washing machine again and instead of using soap dump in some food colouring dye put the dye in first and mix it into the water hopefully you'll end up with nicer sweater now best of luck Textile manufacturing Clothing Canadian Armed Forces Shirt Kimono Tattoo Dye Clothing terminology The Warriors Technicolor Upholstery Gramophone record Tallit Leather Kilt Textile manufacturing terminology Heavy metal fashion Color theory Japanese tea ceremony Academic dress Horse Knitting Tea Food coloring William Perkin Denim Black tie Hoody My Little Pony Staining (biology) T-shirt Mango Punk fashion Death rock fashion E-6 process Arsenal F.C.
