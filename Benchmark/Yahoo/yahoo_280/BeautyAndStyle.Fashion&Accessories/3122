what do you wear at an opera i know some people are saying formal and informal but can you please give me some websites please i am going to the cadillac palace theatre to se the phantom of the opera unable to give you some websites but it also depends on the venue i've been to the lyric opera in kc and seen people in jeans i've even seen a girl in jeans at the metropolitan opera and in prime orchestra seating not up in a family circle cheap seat but if it's an evening performance i'd dress a little nicer if it's an opening night creative black tie is not uncommon if it's an opera's premier at a famous venue then formal black tie may be in order you can always call the opera house and ask they'd be happy to make sure you're not standing out as a general rule of thumb i'd stay away from things that are too sparkly or showy that could distract the performers though generally the stage lights or so bright they can hardly see the audience have fun Birthday Ajax (programming) Little Britain Good Times The Fairly OddParents Pitaten EastEnders Keith Richards Teen Girl Squad Web server Sluggy Freelance Humphrey Bogart Ed, Edd n Eddy The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Gift Garfield HyperText Transfer Protocol Episodes of Lost (Season 1) She Loves You Fall Out Boy Shaggy dog story Customs and etiquette of Japan Gosei Sentai Dairanger Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) World Wide Web Cuisine of Denmark Saint Nicholas The Ashlee Simpson Show Hello Kitty PHP Eric Cartman Black Pete Friends Jon Secada The Adventures of Pete & Pete Care Bears The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Marie Antoinette The Smoking Room Socrates Negima Liam Gallagher Kuzari Cats (musical) Homer Simpson Shen Gong Wu Clown Le Malade imaginaire The Fast Show Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Princess Tutu Schapelle Corby Physical attractiveness Characters of Naruto Spidey Super Stories Sin City Hey Arnold!
