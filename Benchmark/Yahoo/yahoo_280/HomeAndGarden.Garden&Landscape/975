hydrangea size i have a few hydrangeas that have been in the ground for about two years and each year they only seem to come back and grow to about to inches in height zone i dont trim the dead stems from the previous year because i have been told the provide nutrients throughout the winter month to the root system when i planted them a used mushroom compost and since mulched with organic compost the following year one is in full sun about hours a day and the other in partial sun about to hours a day and yet another a forgot about in almost full shade all day except for maybe an hour a day under some vines on a fence all are the same height now in late july no matter where they seem to be planted any help here to make them bigger do you know what variety of hydrangea you planted some cultivars of h macrophylla are bred to be compact also if you used too much mushroom compost to amend the soil when planting it is possible that may contribute to poor performance in your hydrangeas mushroom compost is mostly sterile and has not been composted as thoroughly as that in your compost pile it does not provide nutrients immediately and may lock up some nutrients in the process of decomposing i would suggest a slow release organic fertilizer such as espoma over the course of a couple of seasons for further information try these websites http www conweb com hydrangea or http squtch quiet like a panther org story mushroom compost Compost Hydrangea Soil pH Comfrey Fertilizer Composting toilet Mulch Earthworm Soil Agriculture Weed control Waste management Soil life Manure Organic horticulture Humus Cultivar Nutrient Organic gardening Peanut Sewage treatment Carnivorous plant Organic farming No-dig gardening Gypsy moth Irrigation Logging Eutrophication Hemp Root Black pepper Plant Dairy Green Revolution Cannabis cultivation Physiological plant disorders Green manure Tea Autonomous building Bonsai Permaculture Mushroom Orchidaceae Carbon dioxide sink Sugar beet Coffee Domain Name System Honey fungus Sunflower Garden Strawberry Apple Sequoia Masanobu Fukuoka Peach Olive Illegal drug trade Herbicide Soil science Maize Bamboo Cannabis sativa Deforestation Sustainable agriculture Weed Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hydroponics Prosopis cineraria Plant breeding Glastonbury Festival Sorghum Sunlight Leaf Pansy Pea Lake Stratification (botany) Anaerobic digestion Banana Pachypodium Perennial plant Button mushroom Biogeochemical cycle Biochemical engineering Begonia Twelve leverage points Tobacco Fungus Rainforest PH Potato Food Earth Milk Organic food Vegetation
