what makes a pink rose bush bloom a nearly white rose this year after planting my pink rose bush in the ground i had roses the first time around of blooming then just recently it began to bloom again i noticed that one of the flowers was white while the others are pink in color i was just wondering what could have make it do that st image take two day before the pink one bloomed http s photobucket com albums bb tarlyng action view current jpg nd image taken two day after the pink one bloomed next to the white rose http s photobucket com albums bb tarlyng action view current white n pink roses jpg this rose bush was not grafted i've had it for around two years they came from texas this is the first time ever that i've had a white bloom on it those canes that are in these images are from the first set of blooms this year i had trimmed those off after the flowers had die off in mid july to where they were suppose to be last fall is when i did all the proper cutting back all the dead branches grafting would affect blooms on the same cane first thought after seeing the condition of the white rose is thrips these are insects that get inside the bud and suck the juices and weaken the flower and perhaps to the point the pink didn't form up this looks like a mini rose you could also have spider mites they just love minis they are suckers too slurping all the plant's strength thrips you can see with good glasses by tearing apart the bloom and watching for quick scattering little brown or green specks spider mites leave the leaves rather spotty and yellowed or grey thrips need a pesticide mites can be washed off daily for weeks to break apart the repo cycle another thought is a genetic mutation have to see if it happens again on the same cane tfinally a virus which we won't even think about here i am concerned on how you are pruning cut spent blossoms back to a leaf cluster just above the don't leave long blind canes since they will not produce a flower and will only attract disease and insects Rose Diseases of the honeybee Cotton plant Biological pest control Plum Banana Flower Wisteria Fruit tree propagation Rosemary Beetle Tea Apple Sugarcane Loganberry Pruning fruit trees Pansy Insect Gypsy moth Leaf Eucalyptus Sunflower Coffee Flowering plant Bee Potato Bamboo Grafting Pachypodium brevicaule Pollination Hydrangea Paul Is Dead Pollinator decline Olive Pesticide Rambutan Mosquito Carnivorous plant Morning glory Canary James McNeill Whistler Diamond Oasis (band) Jute Snooker Color blindness Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
