any tips for bird of paradise i got a small one from a friend and planted it a couple of months later it is still alive but that's about all that can be said for it it has no new growth and doesn't look healthy i added some bone meal to the soil and it gets water based fertilizer regularly we've had plenty of rain it gets part sun part shade i live in central florida how can i encourage it to grow and even perhaps flower the success or failure of a planting often depends on whether the plants receive adequate moisture liberal watering during the growing season will encourage plants to grow more profusely and ensure a large crop of flowers during the blooming season to aid in proper watering construct a saucer like basin around the plant from the extra backfill soil this will hold water until it drains down to the plant's roots both a soggy soil with poor drainage and insufficient watering will cause leaves to yellow and eventually die during the winter months plants should be watered only when the soil next to the plants is fairly dry mulch placed around the base of the plants will help conserve moisture stabilize root temperature and reduce weed infestations keep a to inch circular area around the stem of plants free of mulch mulches against the stems of plants may increase the chance of stem rot common organic mulch materials include leaves pine needles bark wood chips sawdust and bagasse a sugar cane by product inorganic materials like glass wool gravel and crushed stone also are suitable peat should not be used because once dry it is very difficult to wet and may restrict water movement into the soil fertilization for best growth and flowering bird of paradise requires fertilization slow release fertilizers such as sewage sludge and bloodmeal or an inorganic complete fertilizer such as can be used apply slow release fertilizers at a rate of three to five pounds per square feet of bed area and at the rate of one pound per square feet of bed area spread fertilizer around plants every three months during the growing season addition of minor elements is recommended at least once a year preferably during summer remove dead leaves and old flower stalks to prevent fungal organisms from building up on dead tissue Wood Mulch Weed control Houseplant Fertilizer Hemp Sugar beet Gypsy moth Bonsai Soil pH Deforestation Compost Irrigation Weed Hamster Desert Alfalfa Jute Drainage Eutrophication Pine Alcohol fuel Peach Flowering plant Physiological plant disorders Tea Prosopis cineraria Pachypodium ambongense Plant Sugarcane Soil Textile manufacturing Garden Strawberry Honey fungus Hippeastrum Mattress Olive Renewable energy Maize Tobacco Yosemite National Park Agriculture Moss Leaf Vermicompost Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Cannabis cultivation Chlorophyta Seismic retrofit Pruning fruit trees Hydroponics Bamboo Desertification Earthworm Wetland Peanut Pansy Organic gardening Apple Carbon dioxide sink Fruit tree propagation Urinary incontinence Sugar Illegal drug trade Explosive material Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Tree Flax Wheat Basement Pinophyta Coffee Bladderwort Auxin Kudzu Diseases of the honeybee Geography of Albania Organic farming Acorn Biology of the Sierra Nevada Fancy rat Guinea pig Banana Elis Prefecture Brewery Biological pest control Photosynthesis Bacteria Orchidaceae Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Geography of Spain Carbon dioxide Campfire
