veggie gardening and squirrels what do you think will happen if i do this if i put a bunch of food out in squirrel feeders in my front yard would it lessen the chance of them from finding my veggie garden in the backyard by keeping them busy in the front or would it bring every squirrel in the neighborhood to my front yard and eventually lead them to my backyard veggie garden where they would have a feast hi i don't think it will prevent them from finding your garden but in my experience squirrels have never eaten my veggies the only thing i've seen them go after are fruit trees especially pears and sunflowers have they been eating your veggies we get mice moles rabbits and groundhogs but never squirrels in our garden good luck Squirrel Eastern Gray Squirrel Acorn Red Squirrel Viva La Bam Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Camp Lazlo Luck Rodent Conker's Bad Fur Day Tomato Bat Levitation (band) Mountain Beaver Soil life Bird feeder Hamster Garden of Eden Atlanta metropolitan area MRE Fruit tree propagation Birdfeeding Hamburger Piney Woods Alaskan Malamute Weather lore Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Taboo food and drink Animal Crossing Apple Garfield RuneScape quests Livestock Pine Kashrut One Piece minor characters Snack food Cuisine of the Southern United States Biological pest control Porcupine Burrowing Owl Nut (fruit) Gypsy moth Guinea pig Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Tree of Knowledge Domestic rabbit Peanut Ishmael (novel) Internet phenomenon Sluggy Freelance Northern Flying Squirrel Earthworm About a Boy Hedgehog Adam and Eve Groundhog Day (film) Crime prevention through environmental design The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show John the Baptist Tuxtla Guti__rrez The Fall of Man Super Mario Sunshine In-N-Out Burger The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Franklin (television series) VeggieTales Utopianism Jewish cuisine New York Giants Bloody Stupid Johnson Pysanka Food Walt Disney Pear Cat Inclusive fitness Original sin Samurai Champloo German cuisine Douglas Squirrel The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Passover Happy Tree Friends Aye-aye The Amber Spyglass Forest gardening Quince Kakapo Foodborne illness Richard Chase Pumpkin Redwall Western Gray Squirrel Orchard Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel
