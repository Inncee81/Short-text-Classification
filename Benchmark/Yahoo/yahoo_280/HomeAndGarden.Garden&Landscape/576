wormery how do you start one up i had a friend years ago who had a wormery all i remember is the waste product from the worms the brown stuff was used as fertilizer for the garden does or has anyone tried this and if so how are they made up how do you start up one of these the waste product you are talking about is worm castings and it makes excellent compost for plants there are commercial bins available for this you can search thew web and locate one that way if you want to build something from scratch you will need a plastic tote with lid some inch pvc pipe with holes every inches some type of cap with holes for the inch pvc and a vent for the top of the tote the important thing for any worm box is ventilation you need to let it breath and let out the heat otherwise your worms will die about an to inches up from the bottom of the tote you need to drill holes directly across from each other slide your pvc pipe through and cut it so its long enough to stick out both sides place your caps on both ends and repeat this step for the other set of holes cut a couple vent holes in the top of the tote and use your vent covers there as well for worms red wigglers work the best they can tolerate the conditions of the worm box the best to get started or containers from any bait shop will be enough after a while you will have enough worms that you can start making bins for your friends or giving worms to your fisherman friends until you do the next step keep your worms in the fridge they will stay dormant and will be ready to take on the task of the bin when you are ready now for a medium for the worms to live in i use shredded up newspaper i dip the paper in water and place it in the bin you can add extra water at first but will not need to do that much once you get the worm bin going once the shredded paper is in place pull it back in one corner and place your kitchen waste and cover with paper you will need to rotate fresh bedding every months replacing half the bedding at a time this is the best time to start another bin for a friend place the half you take out of your bin in the bin for a friend there should be enough worms to start up a new bin an active bin will only need to be cleaned if you put something nasty in it they don't like a couple things to remember about worm bins absolutely no meat oils or dairy waste if you do you will stink up the place if you have leftover salad that has any kind of dressing on it pitch it no bones or egg shells either unless you are going to compost the left over bin material in a backyard com poster don't overload your bin once a week is sufficient if you are getting flies use more bedding and make sure you cover your kitchen waste completely the yucky looking brown water that may build up in the bottom of the bin makes the best fertilizer for house plants don't wash it down the sink if you don't want to drain it off add more dry paper to soak it up likewise if you bin gets too dry add some water if you are adding enough kitchen waste the moisture from it should be enough to keep your bin going with out adding or subtracting anything i have found that a good bin will consume about a gallon of kitchen waste a week depending on the size of your family you may want to have multiple bins then again it all depends on how much space you have there are little buckets that are available for people to collect kitchen waste once filled add it to your bin to read more about this i would suggest that you get a copy of worms eat my garbage hope this helps Textile manufacturing Bong Casting Sewage treatment Drill bit Hemp Plastic Menstrual cup Earthworm Waste management Diving suit Composting toilet Kitchen Domestic water system Dustbin Mattress Japanese toilet Houseplant Carburetor Gramophone record Tobacco Autonomous building Japanese tea ceremony Seismic retrofit Drainage Aerial (dance move) Fancy rat Hamster Glossary of firefighting equipment Irrigation Solar cell Sento Computer virus Fire fighting Recycling Motor oil Poker jargon Billiards In-N-Out Burger Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Strap-on dildo Angling Cuisine of Denmark Knife Equine conformation Oplan Bojinka Paper size Shaggy dog story Comfrey Basement Dry cleaning Hydroponics Barbecue Fecal incontinence Solar power Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina M16 (rifle) Carbon dioxide Energy development Slide rule Internal ballistics Social rule Furnace Sulfuric acid Elevator Bread Stairway Upholstery Fishing Screw Firefighter Disc brake Fish farming Sushi Skateboarding trick Incineration Jewish cuisine Cruising (maritime) Polyvinyl chloride Mosquito Christmas tree Dialysis Livestock Cookware and bakeware
