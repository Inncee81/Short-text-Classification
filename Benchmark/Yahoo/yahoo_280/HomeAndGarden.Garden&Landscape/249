help is my tree dying ok we recently put another layer of landscape fabric and rocks over the old and existing fabric and rocks around the tree and up to the tree trunk we did that months ago and it was fine we haven't had much rain and now i notice that it's fall outside at first i thought it was just the lack of rain but my neighbor across the street has the same type of tree and his is not like mine the leaves are turning yellow and falling off everyday i am so worried because it's a beautiful large tree that if dead it would cost a lot of money to remove and make our yard look dead please help do you think it's because of our extra layer of rocks and fabric that's killing it yikes here are some pictures of my tree and what i've done http img imageshack us my php image treeen jpg http img imageshack us img treeen th jpg of course these are pictures of before all the leaves started turning yellow and falling off it is currently summer and i live in minnesota leaves don't fall off like this until october i don't think the fabric and rock are wholly to blame if at all think about all the roots that were disturbed and covered when your house and driveway were built it appears about were were the roots compromised like this on your neighbors tree are both trees losing leaves or only the one closer to the house the reason i ask is there seems to be damage to the bark and this may have allowed disease to enter that is killing that tree or both if they are in fact one tree with one root system in the picture it appears the tree closer to the house is already going yellow ahead of the other this would make sense as more of it's roots were cut for the house foundation or covered by the drive if it was me i would remove the tree closer to the house before it falls and do some moderate pruning of the other this should give the remaining tree more water and resources until it can recover rscott Bonsai Desert Wood Deforestation Leaf Glossary of graph theory Rainforest Dutch elm disease McMansion Campfire Yosemite National Park Mattress Gypsy moth The Amber Spyglass Flowering plant Olive Drill bit Yggdrasil Sequoia 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Medicare (Canada) Bob and George Pruning fruit trees Opportunity rover Autumn Casting Dead Like Me Jute Ivy RuneScape quests Tree Poker jargon Old growth forest Ages of Myst Wisteria Windows 2000 Naruto jutsu Solar eclipse Coffee Garden Strawberry Lechaina Pachypodium Evidence of evolution Beetle View camera Chernobyl accident Banksia Tire Surveillance Naval mine Atlanta metropolitan area Nuclear power Don Rosa Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Black pepper Textile manufacturing Coast Douglas-fir Pompeii Plum Drainage Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Drag racing Stereoscopy Mars Exploration Rover Lightning Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Canoe Paul Is Dead Christo and Jeanne-Claude Telephone exchange Lava Woodworking Glossary of wildland fire terms Grand Central Terminal Logging Domain Name System 1997 Pacific hurricane season Sudden Oak Death Diving suit 2005 Kashmir earthquake Ozone depletion Mount Pinatubo Brewery Natural disaster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an D'ni timeline Refrigerator car Fruit tree propagation Sin City Irrigation Mach kernel Yoshimitsu (video games) Bong Kangaroo Apple
