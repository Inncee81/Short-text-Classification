my gardner is picking my plants and stealing them i've recently suspected my gardner is stealing so i stayed home one day and saw him picking all my roses and putting them in buckets then when he left he stood on the corner and tried to sell them should i confront him he's really good but i don't want a theft here he barley speaks english though so i might nees my friend as a translator he is stealing and no matter what his background is whether poor or not stealing is never the answer tell him that you have seen him and that you want him to stop if he is doing this to you he is doing it to others as well and it is not acceptable Guns N' Roses Ocean's Twelve Wyatt Earp Social rule GoldenEye Who Shot Mr. Burns?
