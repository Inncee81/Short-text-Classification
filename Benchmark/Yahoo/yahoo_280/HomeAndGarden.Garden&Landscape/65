keeping a square of soil bare i'm weeding a flowerbed and will be planting in it afterwards but there is a square foot that i want to stay as bare soil indefinetly ie no grass or weeds growing from it if i salt that patch will it stop growth and will it harm the rest of the bed is there a better way i just want it to stay as it is as people seem to be wondering i'm burying a pet in the corner of the bed and think the depth is quite shallow so can't be digging up weeds that grow over the grave as i would dig up the pet i wanted a blank space i could put a marker on but it looks like i will be best pulling up weeds grass as it arrives thanks all any further ideas are appreciated you could put preen in it i use this in my flowerbeds it is a root inhibitor so when a seed lands on it then it's not able to put down roots however for my purposes you can still plant stuff that's already grown and it will do fine anyway it works great i never have to weed my flower beds you could also kill whatever is there with a non selective killer like roundup that will kill everything and you may need to spray it occasionally to kill new weeds Weed control Weed Herbicide Hemp Flax Agriculture Sorghum Garden Hamster Rapeseed Burial Flowering plant Sewage treatment Lawn Bamboo Dune Roundup Alfalfa Seed Comfrey Organic farming Knots Landing Hydroponics EastEnders Opportunity rover Irrigation Biodynamic agriculture Illegal drug trade Shaggy dog story Chatsworth House Maize Anchor Drooping Brome Zuiderzee Works Agricultural machinery Yarrow Genetically modified food Deforestation Fruit tree propagation Turnip (brassica rapa) Glyphosate Plough Wetland Pet skunk Peanut Plant Cannabis (drug) Percy Schmeiser Pansy Compost Ragwort Drainage Hop (plant) Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Root Sin City Yosemite National Park Creeping Charlie Avalanche Guinea pig Brewery Ragweed Garden Strawberry Orchidaceae Biological pest control Kudzu Gypsy moth Cultural Revolution Apple Lake Rice Green Revolution Domestic rabbit Sugar beet Desertification Pollination Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wood carving Broom (shrub) Invasive species No-dig gardening Cannabis Electrophysiology Red imported fire ant Soil Hay fever Jute Fish farming Arable land Organic gardening Mandrake (plant) Absinth Wormwood
