how long will these seeds take i planted some lavender seeds in the lil starter thing and have been watering them about days a week and keeping them in some sun during the day but not all the time for full weeks now and i still see nuthing at all how much longer should i wait before giving up because the seeds arent going to grow ok i gave up on this batch of seedlings and yea they hadnt done any growing i went through their dirt and saw that the seeds had swollen and opened up but nuthing grew from them it should have only taken days for viable lavender seeds to germinate longer than this indicates a problem if you try again here are a few things that can help improve your success lavender seeds do not need a pretreatment though cold stratification can improve germination rates lavender seeds can not tolerate excess moisture so they must be sown individually into your planting medium seeds can trap enough moisture between them to spoil germination well drained sand is the best germination medium sow the seeds only deep in moist sand planting too deep can prevent germination the optimum germination temperature is degrees fahrenheit don't let your germinating medium dry out or get overly moist a clear plastic cover is best as seeds need light to germinate and it helps to maintain even moisture levels you really need to keep them in the sun every day for proper germination sometimes germination is better with some cold pretreatment after sowing chill seeds to degrees fahrenheit for two weeks never let lavender seedlings become leggy by not providing enough light best to use supplemental light for hour 'days' never let seedlings freeze Stratification (botany) Seed Vermicompost Germination Tobacco Cannabis cultivation Rice Weed control San Pedro cactus Acorn Hemp Drooping Brome Mulch Sorghum Weather lore Sunflower Orchidaceae Sewage treatment Coconut Houseplant Desertification Sugar beet Giant Sequoia Barley Ethylene Severe weather terminology (United States) Sprouting Carbon dioxide Fancy rat Compost Polyethylene terephthalate Carburetor Pinophyta Degree Fahrenheit Solar power Tofu Flax Diving suit Drainage Garden Strawberry Climate of the United Kingdom Textile manufacturing Fruit tree propagation Water Desert Radiation therapy Hamster Plant Brewery Casting Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Kudzu Apple E85 Herbicide Thermal power station Hydroponics Psoriasis Deforestation Pachypodium habitats Weed Jute Global warming and agriculture Hypothermia Wood Cycad Onion Motorcycle M16 (rifle) Urinary incontinence Water (molecule) Norman Borlaug Common bean Seedbank Red Alder Sauna Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Biological dispersal Wind power Pine Lake Dairy Peanut Ocean thermal energy conversion Flowering plant Agriculture Banksia Mattress
