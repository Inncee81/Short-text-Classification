i live in the chicago area and i was wondering are tulips annuals here at the cheesecake they had tulips in the spring time but know they have some plants that have red leaves others that have lime green leaves with read outlines and some that are lime green and when the tulips were there these didn't exist do ya'll know what kinds a plants shrubs have this kind of folliage year round in minnesota they last a few years then usually start to peter out some kinds are better than others the catalogs will call them perennial tulips if they are inclined to last longer some of the fancier ones i've tried like fringe or peony type ones i never saw a second year my clay soil probably doesn't help either tho if the cheesecake is a business that looks like they spend a little money to look nice they are probably treating them as annuals just to keep it always looking nice to have tulips come back you need to leave the leaves until they turn brown to feed the bulbs for next year's flower flowerless browning tulips do not look good so a business or rich people will just get rid of the tulips when the flowers are done plant other things to look nice in the summer and plant new bulbs in the fall what they have there now sounds like coleus Flowering plant Tulip Plant Liriodendron Perennial plant Flower Hippeastrum Houseplant Gooseberry Wood carving Tulip mania Sears Holdings Corporation Tree Tobacco National emblem Clover Sage Peony Black pepper Alder Garlic Drag racing Kender Spalding, Lincolnshire Pansy Pachypodium baronii Pachypodium ambongense Tea Mahjong Apple Crocus Soil pH Kudzu Alfalfa Elderberry Olive Chicago Cubs Pachypodium bicolor Gross domestic product Blood on the Tracks Trademark Vermicompost Gypsy moth Potato Charge (heraldry) Five points of Calvinism Theory of conduct Desert Desertification Garden Strawberry Weed control Wood Peanut Pysanka Haarlem Orchidaceae Chicago Blackhawks Ragweed Morphology of Pachypodium Comfrey Pittsburgh Steelers Lilium Elm Phoebe Halliwell Commodore International Rooibos Red Valerian Japanese tea ceremony Rose Hemp Maple Juliana of the Netherlands Light-emitting diode Prosopis cineraria Peach World Series Coca Lighting Snowflake (botany) Banana Cuisine of the Philippines Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aesculus Lime (fruit) Photosynthesis Perilla Piccolo Junior Saga Vowel Daylight saving time Hop (plant) Netsuke The Amber Spyglass Plum Coffea arabica Floristry Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Digitalis Cannabis cultivation Green Day
