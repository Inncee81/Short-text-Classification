grow pumpkins it is too late for seeds tx can i buy the plants like i do tom plants where hi depending on the variety pumpkins take days to mature from planting the seed if you plant them now you would be harvesting early december at the earliest not going to help if you want them for halloween but you can maybe have some pie for xmas typically you can buy seedling like tomatoes peppers because they take too long to get any fruit if you start them from seeds pumpkins do not transplant well so you can't buy them as plants plus in most of the country if you plant them after the last frost you will have plenty of time for the crop to mature good luck Apple Pumpkin Flowering plant Hemp Loganberry Tobacco Tomato Cereal Pollination Seed Agriculture Squash (fruit) Potato Sunflower Coffea arabica Vegetarianism Green Revolution Plant Pinophyta Peanut Banana Pea Black pepper Avocado Maize Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Capsicum Weed control Genetically modified food Sugar beet Bamboo Pine Garden Strawberry Comfrey Vicia faba Coriander Alfalfa Cannabis cultivation Coast Douglas-fir Apricot Fruit tree propagation Luther Burbank Agricultural machinery Halloween Watermelon Phytophthora infestans Date Palm Chile pepper Cuisine of the Southern United States Common bean Organic food Coconut Kigo Carnivorous plant Vanilla Oat Sorghum Habanero chile Peruvian cuisine Peach Okra Grafting Acorn Giant Sequoia Growing degree day Jute Cultivar Mulch Frugivore Illegal drug trade Wheat Cannabis sativa Coffea Sugarcane Physiological plant disorders Durian Conifer cones Pineapple Barley Germination European Black Pine German cuisine Pachypodium bicolor Sowing Orchidaceae Heirloom plant Perfume Market gardening Mount Sinai, New York Plant sexuality Flax Weed Soil life Tree Onion Biological dispersal Araucaria araucana Domesticated turkey
