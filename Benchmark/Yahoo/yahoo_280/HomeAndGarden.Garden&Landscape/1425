a few questions about grape vines i have just bought a house and i have a grape vine in the back yard i want to transplant the vine to a new location at the present it is sitting under a pear tree and this makes it hard to get fruit from the tree also i am not that happy with the trellis the previous owners made for the vine i want to know if it can be bad to transplant the vine i don't know it age or what type of grape it is i want to know when is a good time to transplant we have a long growing season and maybe only nights with a frost a year thats the subtropics for you it is the rain season for us now with rain showers almost every afternoon temperatures are in the mid s to high s what should the trellis be made of also the previous owners said they never got fruit from the vine i want to know if it needs any special care or another vine to polinate with thanks for any help hi an established grape vine has a surprising amount of roots length and number transplanting would be tough especially in the summer if you are going to do it i would wait for the plant to be as dormant as possible personally when we moved in i took the old grape vines out because i didn't like where they were and planted all new ones it took years but i now have nice vines producing a lot of grape where i want them so my vote would be to remove it especially if it hasn't given fruit to the old owners for the trellis you can make it out of anything that can support the vines the vineyards around here use posts with steel cables we did posts with ' lengths of x like a split rail fence but higher good luck Grape Vine Fruit tree propagation Champagne (beverage) Wine Climate of the Alps Pruning fruit trees Bamboo Poker jargon Passive solar Kosher foods Kudzu Brandy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Apple Pinot Noir Rainforest Atlanta metropolitan area 613 mitzvot Kiwifruit Fruit Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Agricultural fencing Garden Strawberry Vanilla Agriculture Climate of the United Kingdom Monstera deliciosa Customs and etiquette of Japan Shiraz grape Kiddush K__ppen climate classification Palmdale, California 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tokaji Passenger car Pittsburgh Steelers Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Viognier Pysanka Animal Crossing Humphrey Bogart Black pepper Tire Wisteria Sukkot Health insurance Economy of Algeria Mediterranean Basin Pea Elis Prefecture Weed control Coffea arabica Ice wine Campfire Pisco German wine Port wine Penske Racing Poison-ivy Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests Tomato Citrus Wayne Corporation Auxin Wrigley Field Avocado Flowering plant Ron and Fez Chayote Richard Rahl S__millon Cucumber I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Knife 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Yosemite National Park Tom Waits Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Japanese tea ceremony Temecula, California Roman eating and drinking TGV Quince King Khalid International Airport Wildfire Arecaceae Burgundy wine Brewery Olive Loganberry Zinfandel Quang Ninh Province Polygonum Lychee Weather lore Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands
