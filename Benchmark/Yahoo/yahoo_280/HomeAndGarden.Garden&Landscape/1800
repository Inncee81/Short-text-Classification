i'm brand new to gardening and bought a bunch of outdoor container plants what should i know here's what i've got and done so far a lobelia hybrid luguna compact with blue eye and a sunbeam kordana rose both planted in in terra cotta pots with drain on the ground in semi shade a calibrachoa hybrid superbells tickled pink planted in a hanging tin in planter with drain hung in direct sun a mini spider plant and tiny fern both in in ceramic pots no drain in shade i planted all plants in miracle grow potting soil so here's my questions would the spider or fern do better indoors and do they need draining or larger pots how often should i water each of them do any of them need plant food it's already fall so will they still be alive this winter i'm in socal if they die for the winter st say annuals when will they come back do i have to do anything to them to make them come back please anything else i should know i'm really new to this and don't understand alot of garden lingo yet thanks and did i get good plants for a beginner sorry for all the questions but i went to home depot it's like pulling teeth trying to get customer service in that place lol oh and do i have to worry about pests the lobelia and the calibrachoa are both annuals so they will only live for the season if you want plants to come back for you next season you should buy perennial plants these usually are bigger and not as showy colourful as the annuals as for the spider plant and the fern those are indoor plants you should move them back into the house you should water your outdoor plants daily to promote root growth in a new environment it is quite late in the season for planting outdoors i must say but and again you are in south california so i can't really comment on that your indoor plants should be watered approximately once a week do not put your indoor plants under direct sun the fern can do with more shade and soil needs to be kept moist at all times i hope this helps next year you should really get your plants from a nursery the staff there will be able to help you choose the right plants home depot is not the right place unless you know what kind of plants to buy ie a seasoned pro Houseplant Cannabis cultivation Bonsai Hydroponics Plant Japanese tea ceremony Carnivorous plant Weed control Hamster Tobacco Gypsy moth Pansy Banana Garden Strawberry Organic farming Begonia Las Vegas metropolitan area Leaf Biological pest control Tsing Yi Orchidaceae Flowering plant Lighting Mid-levels Sage Christmas tree Comfrey Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Irrigation Hemp Perennial plant Sorghum Deforestation Desert Iris (plant) Climate of the United Kingdom Gooseberry Agriculture Wheat Tasmanian Tree Fern Black pepper Gardening Green Revolution Apple World Championship Wrestling Hippeastrum Olive Passive solar Snooker Customs and etiquette of Japan Maize Weed Cookware and bakeware Textile manufacturing Skateboarding trick Light-emitting diode Vermicompost Kitchen Tree Ultimate (sport) David Bowie Tea Cycad Cheese Peanut Geography of Albania GunBound Sewage treatment Solar power Earthworm Tillandsia Pottery Drainage Johnny Appleseed Chives Naruto jutsu Root Memphis, Tennessee Sustainable agriculture Persian Gardens Cyatheales Hellebore Professional wrestling throws Fancy rat Grand Teton National Park United States Botanic Garden Cyclamen Plantation The Fens Avocado Bladderwort
