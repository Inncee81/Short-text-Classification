trees near septic field bed i have read in several places not to plant trees close to a septic field bed as roots can damage the pipes my bed is raised by several feet and there are a few apple trees beside it that are full grown and were there long before the field bed was built should i worry about this my septic guy didn't seem concerned at all also my husband wants to put some of our wood for heating on the field bed but i think this is a bad idea as the weight could compact the soil and damage pipes am i right matured apple trees do not have the aggressive root system and shouldn't cause worry keep trees watered for added security so their roots don't seek other moisture solutions there are septic tank treatments that need to be flushed periodically anyway whether you have root problems or not putting stuff on top would not hurt anything if it is not too heavy or too much that area really should be left for patio flower bed garden or anything else that would not require lot of weight and still be useful Septic tank Autonomous building Sewage treatment Irrigation Brewery Apple Hydroponics Plant Drainage Thermal power station Fruit tree propagation Domestic water system Garden Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Weed control Bonsai Wood Solar power Bamboo Sugar beet Water purification Logging Tree Gardening Cannabis cultivation Tobacco Objective-C Seismic retrofit Sequoia Campfire Caliche Hemp Grafting Sorghum Desertification Vermicompost Kitchen Shaggy dog story Eucalyptus Plame affair Garden Strawberry Peach Prosopis cineraria Christmas tree Nuclear power Home repair Pickup truck Flush toilet Basement Fancy rat Toilet paper Mattress Soil Pachypodium Soil salination Avenue Q Flax Siphon Old growth forest Wastewater Alfalfa Renewable energy M16 (rifle) Liriodendron B-47 Stratojet Sewer Flowering plant Hydrogen economy Water Glossary of wildland fire terms Eutrophication Soil pH Tank Comfrey Deforestation Kudzu Wood fuel Onion Root Coast Douglas-fir X Window System Physiological plant disorders Passenger car Fish farming Drag racing Water resources Desert Mach kernel Electrical wiring Glossary of firefighting terms The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Internal ballistics Binary tree
