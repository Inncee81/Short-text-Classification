how can i get the best results from my rose bushes please give me any tips you can about growing healthy bushes with lots lots of flowers thanks for your help i've been growing roses for years now and i have found that they are among the easiest plants to grow and the most rewarding there are things you need to keep in mind to have a beautiful and lush rose garden and that is selection water feeding and pruning selection is important in that there are roses that are very disease prone and there are roses that are not hybrid teas are an example of disease prone roses that give the grower nothing but trouble when it come to fungus not to mention the fact that they have been grafted and can lose their graft easily they also tend to be short lived then there are the old roses hybrid musks english hardy and heirloom roses that have been bred to resist disease and have been grown from their own roots which means no graft to fall off they are also very long lived here are two of my favorite web sites for these roses http www heirloomroses com cgi browse cgi page item cat item http www davidaustinroses com american also i just learned about a selection of roses from another yahoo answerer called earthkind supposedly you don't have to do anything to these roses no fertilizer no chemical pesticides or fungicides and they flourish here is that site http aggie horticulture tamu edu earthkind ekroses ekbrigaderoses html watering feeding the most important thing to remember here is that roses hate to get wet so remember to water early in the morning and only at the base newly planted roses need water every day for the first weeks and then you can cut back to once a week but make it a nice big drink feeding is also important but stay away from miricle gro for roses and any other perennial it's only good for annuals roses really love manure mixed into the top layers of their soil and they also love fish emulsion they just explode with that stuff pruning there are two types of pruning and both are necessary to beautiful roses here are detailed instructions for pruning general pruning you do this to remove any dead or dying canes or spent flowers it is true that you need to pick a set of five leaves but not necessarily the first set pick a set of five that are pointing outward because that will be the direction of a new cane and flowers if you choose one pointing inward then your canes can cross and will cause other problems cut the cane at an angle like this about above the five leaf set it is okay to do this with each cane and especially if the cane is dying it is also okay to do this throughout the growing season because it promotes new growth autumn pruning any time between the first freeze of autumn and the last freeze of winter you can seriously prune your rose down to about feet this will create a fuller lusher plant for the new season once again you will want to cut at an angle however instead of cutting above a five leaf set this time you will want to cut right above a node which will resemble a small reddish slightly pointed bump on the cane like the five leaf set make sure the node is pointing outward hope this helps Apple Pruning fruit trees Gooseberry Fruit tree propagation Bonsai Agriculture Leaf Olive Bamboo Pansy Pruning Cannabis cultivation Loganberry Organic farming Wood Carnivorous plant Flower Grafting Sugar beet Comfrey Weed control Tea Tomato Plant Garden Strawberry Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Equine conformation Hamster Organic food Gypsy moth Expert system Flowering plant Sorghum Wheat Orchidaceae Textile manufacturing Elm Sugar The Amber Spyglass Soil pH Theory of conduct Maize Kudzu Tobacco Alfalfa Desert Perfume RuneScape quests Illegal drug trade Knife Collision detection HTTP cookie Peach Auxin Hemp Ginkgo Alcohol fuel Factory farming Wisteria Breastfeeding Sugarcane Watermelon Houseplant Root World Wide Web Dutch elm disease Honey fungus Prostate cancer Coffea Kiwifruit Goldfish Bladderwort Sustainable agriculture Hydroponics Chlorophyta Cross site scripting Mosquito Linked list Bird migration Pollination Livestock Perennial plant Capercaillie Black pepper Soil life Vermicompost Guns N' Roses The Apprentice 2 Tournament of Roses Parade Coffee Compost XML Wireless Application Protocol
