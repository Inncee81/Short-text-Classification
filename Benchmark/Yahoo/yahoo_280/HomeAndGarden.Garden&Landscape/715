how to regrow my post katrina lawn i'm about to move back home to new orleans in a few weeks and my lawn is in terrible shape as you can imagine i have all types of plants and other things growing on my lawn from the storm what can i do to restore my lawn to at least almost pre katrina quality lovely you'll have to remove all the growies before the new lawn goes in this will be difficult as much could be perennial at least and woody at worst i'd start with roundup and hope that kills all with roundup you can get a lawn back in quickly if you have a lot of woody plants cut them out carefully yes there are brush remover chemicals but i'd be hesitant to use those as they don't break down as quickly as roundup once your yard is clear rototill to introduce oxygen back into the gumbo you call soils down there phew moss or other yuckies thrive in soil without oxygen so fluffing it will go far in removing the scummy stuff one warning wear a mask when working around the soils just tell your neighbors you are allergic to things you'll be disturbing a lot of mold spores we don't want in your lungs i'd almost be afraid of what a soil test would show but fortunately or unfortunately chemical contaimination tests are individual tests and not part of a regular ag soil test a soil ph test might be in order to determine if and how much lime or sulfur you might need to add to bring the soil back to around or so then use a starter fertilizer and put in your lawn sprig seed sod or however is common in your area i'm glad you are going home Weed control Comfrey Plant Herbicide Lawn mower Peanut Soil Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Soil pH New York Giants Lawn Sewage treatment Irrigation Casting Logging Textile manufacturing Florida Keys Houseplant Photosynthesis Pottery Roundup Carbon dioxide Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Toy Story 2 Air pollution Tobacco Acorn Compost Hydroponics Motor oil Ragweed Fire fighting Fruit tree propagation Explosive material Jefferson Parish, Louisiana Hurricane Katrina timeline Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Vegetation Soils retrogression and degradation Eutrophication Hamster Drowning Flowering plant Bacteria Potato Plough Jute Water purification Wood Anthrax Welding Vermicompost Cheese Bread McMansion New England Patriots 2005 Atlantic hurricane season StarCraft: Uprising Perfume Garden Strawberry Alfalfa Glyphosate Monsanto Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina Shaggy dog story Creeping Charlie Deforestation Gardening 613 mitzvot Moss Diseases of the honeybee Extreme Programming Rapeseed Brewery Biogeochemical cycle Global warming and agriculture Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Mosquito Sugar beet Haloalkane Land mine Miami Dolphins Sin City Bonsai Opportunity rover 1957 World Series Black pepper Bladderwort Steel
