i would like to id my volunteer flowers i have several clusters of volunteer flowers that pop up all through my back yard between spring and fall they are beautiful and i would like to plant some on purpose as my lawn mowing man plows them over without fail can anyone help me or suggest where i might look online they look like smaller day lilies but they don't open quite as far as any of the pictures i've seen they are a light dusty pink color almost a bit purplish with no variation the color is solid they have very long stamens a sort of darker pink that stick out past the petals thank you those are called magic lilies or pink ladies in the spring you get foliage like a daffodil then in july august the long stem comes up with pink lily purplish tinge the best thing is to dig them up in the spring when the foliage first starts coming up to transplant them they are bulbs and they do spread and it's good to transplant them every three years or so i have also dug them in the fall and they came back fine Leaf Flower Rose Daffodil Bamboo Orchidaceae Flowering plant Wood carving Lilium Tulip Light-emitting diode Wood Daylily Floristry Autumn Iris (plant) Stamen Pachypodium baronii Hellebore Potato Christmas tree Pinophyta Hop (plant) Fruit Gladiolus Apple Pink Peanut Pansy National emblem Houseplant Tobacco Giant Hogweed Pysanka Kudzu Convallaria Soap plant Pachypodium brevicaule Carpel Cotton thistle Pachypodium bicolor Paul Is Dead Morphology of Pachypodium The Beatles discography Phragmipedium Weed control Caryophyllaceae Cotoneaster Lawn mower Cranberry Fantasmic!
