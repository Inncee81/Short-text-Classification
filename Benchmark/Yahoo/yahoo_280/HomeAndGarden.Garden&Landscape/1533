how do you get dog urine out from grass i have two male dogs that frequently leave burn spots i was told by our lawn service rep that the dogs may be getting too much salt in their diet but i've also read that it's not the low acidity level nor the ph level in urine but the amount of nitrogen that burns the lawn nitrogen is supposed to be the true culprit therefore increasing water intake will dilute the urine and in turn the nitrogen in it p s however i just checked my doctors foster and smith dog and cat catalog and they sell a product that you can feed your dog and it neutralizes the urine these tablets help reduce lawn burn by getting at the cause the urea and ammonia in your pet's waste these chewable liver flavored tablets contain yucca schidigera which helps fight lawn burn by binding the ammonia in urine yucca also decreases fecal odor so these vets claim it's the urea and ammonia who knows for sure probably the best solution is to have our hoses handy and quickly spray down the area where are dogs just tickled ya' think Urea Urine Biochemistry Prostate cancer Protein Cocaine Osmoregulation Tobacco smoking Protein-energy malnutrition Nitrogen Insulin Fertilizer Cyanide Kidney stone Fire extinguisher Flatulence Hamster Diabetes mellitus Urinary system Kidney Nitric acid Paracetamol Nutrition Alcohol fuel Dieting Vitamin C Sewage treatment Domestic rabbit Antiretroviral drug Soil pH Ammonium Sulfuric acid Blood urea nitrogen Water (molecule) Hydrogen Uric acid Diabetes insipidus Leptospirosis Glucocorticoid Salt Hydrogen peroxide Irrigation Colorectal cancer Iron Dietary fiber Town gas Hydrogen economy Tocopherol Guinea pig Lawn Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Autonomous building Fancy rat Carbon dioxide Urinary incontinence Acute renal failure Atkins Nutritional Approach Acid rain Agriculture Coal Titanium Cirrhosis Milk Methamphetamine Marine aquarium Ecology Vermicompost LSD Green Revolution Formic acid Composting toilet Carburetor Transaminase Hydrochloric acid Alternative biochemistry Fish farming Folic acid Aluminium Carnivorous plant Coffee Amine Ethanol Caffeine Water Breastfeeding Fire fighting Omega-3 fatty acid Magnesium Helium
