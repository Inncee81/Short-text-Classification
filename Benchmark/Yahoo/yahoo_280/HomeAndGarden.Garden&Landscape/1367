can kentucky bluegrass grow among weeds we got a good price on a house whose yard was mostly weeds such as crabgrass dandelions bindweed foxtails etc when we mow it it looks almost like a real lawn but the weeds grow back fast we don't have the proper equipment to do a new lawn we're thinking of mowing it very low doing some dethatching aerating etc and then planting lots of kentucky bluegrass seeds our theory is that the kbg will eventually grow well enough to choke out the weeds we plan to keep mowing the weeds low while waiting for the kbg to sprout and then keep mowing slightly higher than the sprouts so the weeds will have a hard time outcompeting the kbg part of the problem is a slope where heavy rains would wash the dirt if no weeds held it in place does this plan have a chance in hell to succeed not an expert but experienced the same problem when i lived ky and in wi yes aerating dethatching digging up big clumps of weeds and treating it regularing with chemicals hired a company for a small fee and my bluegrass prevailed eventually good luck Weed Weed control Hydroponics Lawn Illegal drug trade Polygonum Biodynamic agriculture Herbicide Dandelion Comfrey Double bass Cannabis cultivation Sewage treatment Tobacco Keynesian economics Tennis Jute Hemp Organic farming Microeconomics Chatsworth House Urban sprawl Gypsy moth Whitewater Houseplant Irrigation Creeping Charlie Dolly Parton Ragweed Tillage Thermal power station Equine conformation McMansion Agriculture Autonomous building New York Knicks Carburetor Digitaria Cannabis (drug) Green Revolution Anchor Alfalfa Compost Lexington, Kentucky Oat Bamboo RuneScape skills Tank Pesticide Real tennis Fish farming Great Depression Inflation The Adventures of Pete & Pete Avalanche Nuclear reactor Supply and demand Dune Eric Bischoff Sugar beet Genetically modified food Blood (computer game) Tractor Hamster Sorghum Pittsburgh Steelers Paragliding Extreme Programming Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Labor theory of value 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Publicly funded medicine Piccolo Junior Saga Pitaten Operation Market Garden Kentucky Romulus and Remus Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Pebble bed reactor Brassica Morning glory Sequoia Pollinator decline Plough Animal Crossing Mandrake (plant) Celebration, Florida Paintball Internal ballistics Poker jargon Solanaceae Hydrogen economy Hard disk Combine harvester Soil pH Deflation (economics) Offer and acceptance Caving
