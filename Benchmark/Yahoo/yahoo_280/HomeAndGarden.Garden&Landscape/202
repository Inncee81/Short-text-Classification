hollyhocks in michigan i just planted hollyhocks in early june in michigan right now they are only about inches tall with no flowers will they bloom this year how tall will they get do they flower all summer normally my wife wanted them because her grandma always had them just curious if anyone has experience with them i'm afraid she'll have to wait for next year to see the flowers the first year just leaves the second flowers they readily go to seed and produce 's and 's of new hollyhocks for next year too many cut the flowers back after they're done blooming for that matter remove the plants at the end of the second season save some seed and plant it in a year or two give it at least one season between growing it hollyhocks are very buggy and disease prone perennials enjoy them next year they are remarkable in bloom i am also in michigan good luck i hope that this helps Weed control Sunflower Plant Flower Pollen Flowering plant Alfalfa Garden Strawberry Hemp Pansy Apple Bamboo Rose Potato Wisteria Orchidaceae Textile manufacturing Kudzu Comfrey Peanut Apricot Flax Ragweed Pachypodium ambongense Olive Black pepper Tree Pachypodium brevicaule Monarda Tulip Purple loosestrife Pinophyta Giant Hogweed Iris (plant) Hamster Japanese tea ceremony Titan arum Hippeastrum Broom (shrub) Pollination Sage Gaillardia Begonia Banksia Dandelion Good King Henry Coffea arabica Fuchsia Liriodendron Loganberry Althaea (genus) California Poppy Watermelon Houseplant Goldenrod Date Palm Mirabilis (plant) Anemone Amaranth European Beech Jute Morning glory Ginkgo Dipsacus Pollinator decline Sorghum Absinth Wormwood Pachypodium bicolor Almond Perfume Crocus Cannabis cultivation Bladderwort Carnivorous plant Chinese tallow The Time Machine Cannabis (drug) Sweet William Pineapple Vanilla Leaf Giant Sequoia Elderberry Sorrel Pachypodium baronii Eucalyptus Tomato Monocotyledon Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Caryophyllaceae Malus Wheat Gooseberry Gorse Malvaceae Stinging nettle Prunus Bud Essential oil
