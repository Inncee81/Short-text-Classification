how do i eliminate mushrooms from growing in my garden charlie is right fungi are beneficial if the mushrooms are sprouting from your mulch then the tree that your mulch was made from carried the spores mushrooms associate with particular tree or plant species using a different kind of mulch will help but chances are that in removing mulch you will just spread the spores if they are in your lawn the mushroom you see is the reproductive or fruiting body of the fungi remove it as soon as it appears to prevent the spores being released this keeps them away from pets or children who might sample a poisonous one the difficulty is they probably blew in from a fair distance and will reappear they will not cause grass disease so they are more a risk to children or pets and then only if harmful when you pull the fruiting body there are mycelium still in the soil there when they have regrown and if the soil is wet enough they may refruit you will have to watch this patch if the fungi are growing in a ring they may be 'fairy ring fungi all varieties of grass are susceptible to this and there are several fungi species that produce the rings the rings serve to stimulate the grass caused by the release of plant nutrients as the fungal hyphae decompose organic matter in the soil later if the fungus becomes very old it may crowd the grass out of the inside of the ring this is what lead to the belief fairies danced there beating down the grass inside their dance area increase the fertilizer to grow the rest of your lawn as quickly so the ring is hidden with equal grass growth try hasta gro liquid lawn food mushrooms grow on carbon rich decaying matter like wood they in turn supply nitrogen to the plants grass is a nitrogen hog give the grass the nitrogen it wants and it will probably out compete the fungi another reason for fungi in lawns is buried wood for them to grow on buried scraps of construction lumber dead tree roots or other organic matter can support fungi until the decomposition is complete again remove them by picking or by digging up what they are growing on you can sometimes eliminate mushrooms growing from buried organic matter by applying a nitrogen heavy fertilizer but it you certainly can by removing their food source if you just laid sod and these popped up due to the water needed to establish the sod they will just go away once you go to watering only inch a week however mushrooms are a healthy sign in your garden they are indicating an active recycling of the mulch thatch into soil the breakdown of yard mulch etc is the same as decay in the forest of leaves and other fallen debris this cycles back into soil and is available to the plants again fungi are active both in the decay and in symbiosis with your plants plants feed fungi to attract them certain mushrooms form a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of plants ranging from trees to grasses plants with fungal partners can resist diseases far better than those without so if you dig through your garden and see cottony white threads they are doing their job some of these fungi are even predatory eliminating pest nematodes before they can attack your plants fungi and soil bacteria called actinomycetes both have cottony threads and are there to help your plants Bacteria Carnivorous plant Diseases of the honeybee Wood Beetle Hamster Earthworm Ecology Sewage treatment Mycorrhiza Irrigation Organic farming Soil Mosquito Chlorophyta Carbon dioxide Spore Orchidaceae Eutrophication Banana Agriculture Old growth forest Flowering plant Garden Strawberry Vermicompost Wheat Global warming and agriculture Pesticide Lawn Fruit tree propagation Lawn mower Organic gardening Root Foodborne illness Fish farming Mulch Sugar beet Nitrogen Peat Apple Manure Botany Tomato Domestic rabbit Tooth Burial Organic horticulture Vegetation Mushroom hunting Biodiversity Acorn Carbon dioxide sink Fertilizer Alternation of generations Bonsai Phytophthora infestans Food Prostate cancer Houseplant Pneumonia Physiological plant disorders Termite Acid rain Cheese Chernobyl accident Tobacco Peach Tree Pansy Auxin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bamboo Sequoia Wildfire Peanut Biology Vegetarianism
