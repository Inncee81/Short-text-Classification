block paving problem i spent hours today jet washing all the moss and weeds from the gaps around the blocks it nearly killed me is there a liquid product i can pour in the gaps that will set hard and stop the weeds and moss it's a huge garden and weed killer is not very effective and has to be applied to often so costs a fortune jason f will that put burn marks on my paving nope it will not leave any marks on your hardscape i was concerned with this too but it does not i promise i think highly of the device and think more gardners and homeowners would benefit from it in the spirit of ben franklin there are even designs for weed flamer nozzles and attachments that are officially listed as public domain as the device is such a useful tool particularly as an alternative to chemicals if you are handy you could build it with common plumbing fixtures but the store bought ones are pretty cheap too here is the link to the designs to build one the simpler design is listed second on the page http www plantsciences ucdavis edu ltras itech flame html ps even if you don't care that they are better for the environment they still work better than chemicals hi flame weeders are highly effective for these situations they are proven to treat weeds and other growth for entire seasons rather than a few weeks you get from week killers they don't spread chems' and are very affordable my neighbor introduced me to the practice i was skeptical at first but the weeds he destroyed in spring didn't grow back while i was reapplying round up in just a few weeks i decided to give it a hand with a plumbers torch bucks for the canister and it lasted all summer i then bought the torch weeder for bucks it was easier to use and more effective over the plumbers torch turns out torch weeders are very popular in europe and it is a mystery why they are not more common in the usa i would reccomend it good luck Weed control Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Knots Landing Organic farming Agriculture Wario Herbicide Japanese toilet Casting Portable stove Cancer Plastic Pesticide Sewage treatment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Haloalkane Biodynamic agriculture Welding Hard disk Cannabis cultivation Waste management Olympic Games Euro Poker jargon Hemp Organic food Illegal drug trade Toilet paper Autonomous building Energy development Fire extinguisher Big Brother (USA TV series) Explosive material Seismic retrofit Jet engine Gypsy moth Hand grenade Bong Floppy disk Digital circuit Economy of Africa Glossary of firefighting equipment Strap-on dildo Fountain World Wide Web Computer Wood Spacecraft propulsion Second Battle of El Alamein Intellectual property Theory of conduct Solar power Capitalism The Chemical Brothers Piccolo Junior Saga Externality Upholstery Frank Whittle Book Microeconomics DDT Hash table Prostate cancer Windows 2000 Burning Man Unemployment Textile manufacturing Molotov cocktail New York Giants Menstrual cup Sugar beet Dundas Square Naval mine M16 (rifle) Bicycle lighting PHP Equine conformation Inkjet printer General Dynamics F-111 Chemical warfare Central processing unit Major League Baseball television contracts Blonde on Blonde Green Revolution Sears Catalog Home Hydrogen economy Public good Motorcycle Smoke-screen Anchor Wheel of Fortune Windows XP CPU design Yu-Gi-Oh!
