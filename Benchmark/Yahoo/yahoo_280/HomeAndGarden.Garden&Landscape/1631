what is on the bottom of my tomatoes still on the vine looks like they're spoiled non have ripened yet early girl roma better boy are the types i've been using miraical grow from the get go it could be rotting from the tomatoes touching the ground but if they're not touching the ground it may be blossom end rot a calcium deficiency due to soil moisture problems that prevent calcium from making its way to the fruits it can occur even when there is abundant calcium in the soil poor drainage root damage and soil ph that is too high or too far below the optimum inconsistent watering or too much nitrogen magnesium potassium sodium ammonium salts or a deficiency of soluble calcium salts cause a decrease in calcium can be contributing factors does this describe your tomatoes the first visible symptoms of the disorder is a small darkened or water soaked area around the blossom end of the fruit appearing about time the fruit begins to ripen the spot darkens enlarges and becomes sunken as the fruits mature large lesions may show concentric rings the affected tissue is leathery and firm unless invaded by secondary decay organisms remove affected fruits to improve the development of other healthy fruit on the plant you can correct the problem by improving drainage watering plants consistently as needed mulching plants to conserve moisture to provide a more uniform water supply to provide calcium eggshells can be crushed and added to the soil foliar sprays of calcium won't correct blossom end rot once it has occurred on the fruit but it can help prevent the condition from occurring on developing fruit soil applied treatments and prevention by cultural practices are generally preferred over sprays chelated calcium solutions also provide an excellent source of calcium gypsum compost improves drainage water early in the day give plants room so they don't stay wet fluctuations in soil moisture during periods of rapid plant growth create moisture stress and limits calcium distribution to the fruit make sure the plants are getting at least and inch of water per week if fertilizer is needed reduce nitrogen levels by using fertilizer in place of windy conditions in the spring coupled with low relative humidity can cause high transpiration rates that can induce blossom end rot as does planting too early while the soil is still cold or undergoing severe hardening off fortunately by the time a second set of fruit begins developing your plants will have expanded and developed a root system capable of gathering and delivering calcium to the tomatoes good luck hope this helps Houseplant Eutrophication Global warming and agriculture Carbon dioxide Tooth Weathering Soil Irrigation Explosive material Sulfur Psoriasis Portland cement Gypsy moth Vitamin C Hydroponics Coffee Comfrey Agriculture Decompression sickness Tofu Compost Vermicompost Atherosclerosis Thermal power station Fire extinguisher Urinary incontinence Garden Strawberry Apple Iron Water Earthworm Corrosion Milk Caliche Soil life Sorghum Ammonia Osteoporosis Desertification Nutrition Common cold Hypoglycemia Insulin Cannabis cultivation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gas metal arc welding Green Revolution Puberty Cancer Hemp Prostate cancer Cheese Edible salt Weed control Protein-energy malnutrition Drainage Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Seismic retrofit Plant Fire fighting Organic farming Bacteria Rebreather Peach Acne Folic acid Equine conformation Nuclear power Protein Anorexia nervosa Hamster Ecology Banana Lake Tooth enamel Deforestation Soils retrogression and degradation Cephalic disorder Boron deficiency DDT Androgen insensitivity syndrome Water (molecule) Chlorophyta Diseases of the honeybee Stroke Bipolar disorder Cyanide
