i plant sunflowers every year from seeds i buy at the store i grew some huge ones this year and want to use the seeds from the ones i grew for next year how do i preserve the seeds so they don't go bad or rot thanks this is an easy one actually all you need to do is set them out on a dry paper towel on the counter if you can also set them on a raised screen or cookie cooling rack that would be better as all sides would dry evenly with the increased airflow now often times sunflower seeds are pretty dry when ready to harvest but we want to make sure you should then take the seeds and put them into a porous paper based envelope to store them in the little manilla ones for coins buttons and little kid teeth are really awesome to use but you can even use old envelopes that you get in the mail or even brown paper lunch bags then you take a decent amount of rice put it in a like envelope or bag and that will be your moisture absorber you then put the seeds and the bag in an airtight jar and store it in a cool dark dry place in the oh basement perhaps the reason i keep stressing dry is that moisture among other things is a key trigger for germination the seeds need to achieve a certain level of saturation before they start to grow cool is also important because warmer temps encourage and initiate growth some seeds actually need a period of stratification a cold dormancy before they will start to germinate i hope this helps Stratification (botany) Cannabis cultivation Seed Germination Tobacco Houseplant Carnivorous plant Jute Acorn Coffee Rice Vermicompost Tofu Mattress Textile manufacturing San Pedro cactus Illegal drug trade Bonsai Orchidaceae Cereal Fancy rat Common bean Food preservation Peanut Upholstery Flowering plant Dairy Pachypodium Sorghum Urinary incontinence Sugar beet Chocolate Pachypodium bicolor Carbon dioxide Comfrey Oscilloscope Green Revolution Bread Bong Seedbank Desert Sento Apple Neolithic Revolution Sprouting Deforestation Fire fighting Sugarcane Precipitation (meteorology) Dietary fiber Instant coffee Carburetor Mount St. Helens Cruising (maritime) Straw-bale construction Hay Plant Envelope Brewery RISC Gramophone record Fecal incontinence Synthesizer Flax Weed control Weed Coriander Mulch Milk Beer Temperature Vanilla Airbag Hot air balloon Yerba mate Cannabis (drug) Poker jargon Gibberellin Moss Gaucho (insecticide) Welwitschia Effects of global warming Weather lore Alfalfa Norman Borlaug Agriculture Confidence trick Global warming Famine Potato Plastic Blood (computer game) Idli Compost
