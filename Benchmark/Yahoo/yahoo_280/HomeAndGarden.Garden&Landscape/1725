avacado tree does the pit from an avacado actually grow a tree if you plant it i know it's probably a dumb question but i would like to plant an avacado tree how big do they get and what do i need to start it thanks pierce the seed with its pointed end up partially through with toothpicks on three or four sides to hold it on the top of a jar or vase partly with water in to weeks when roots and leaves are well formed the plant is set in potting soil unless they're moved into soil they are also easily sprouted in a well drained or inch pot of porous fertile soil the top of the seed should just barely peek above the surface of the soil if the soil is kept fairly moist and the temperature is between and degrees the seed will begin to sprout and a pretty leafy plant will develop when the seedling reaches inches it should be pinched back to about inches to produce a rounder fuller plant avocados grown inside thrive in sun or in a good lighted location once they've filled their pots up with healthy roots they should be potted in larger ones re potting should be done in the spring watering should be done so that the soil never becomes really dry but isn't ever soggy and waterlogged they should be fertilized with a balanced houseplant food every two or three weeks in the summer and about every six weeks during the winter it's also a good idea to mist the leaves of your avocado if the air in your home is very dry indoor trees need low night temperatures to induce bloom transplanting should be done in early spring potted plants should be moved outdoors gradually Houseplant Avocado Garden Strawberry Bonsai Wood Hydroponics Carnivorous plant Weed control Tobacco Hippeastrum Pachypodium Apricot Drainage Begonia Pine Irrigation Leaf Orchidaceae Alfalfa Hamster Fruit tree propagation Pachypodium ambongense Coast Douglas-fir Seed Tea Wheat Climate of the United Kingdom Soil Textile manufacturing Hemp Giant Sequoia Soil life Christmas tree Sugar beet Tofu Earthworm Coconut Pachypodium baronii Olive Stratification (botany) Gypsy moth Soil pH Desert Sprouting Knife Pachypodium brevicaule European Beech Wisteria Fancy rat Weed Pachypodium bicolor Black pepper Coffee Root Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Fertilizer Deforestation Geography of Albania Compost Autonomous building Elis Prefecture Pruning fruit trees Venus Flytrap Photosynthesis Caatinga Desertification Yosemite National Park Pea Wildfire Lake Bamboo Carbon dioxide San Pedro cactus Red Alder Snooker Cookware and bakeware Kudzu Banksia Opportunity rover Poker jargon Dead Sea Sequoia Organic farming Drooping Brome Ficus elastica Sunflower
