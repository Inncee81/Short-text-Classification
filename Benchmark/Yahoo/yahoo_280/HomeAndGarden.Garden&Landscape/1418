why won't my rose bush produce new buds after i trimmed the first blooms off my potted rose tree produced a lot of beautiful blossoms when i first got it in the begtinning of summer after the blooms finished blossoming i trimmed them down thinking i'd get new growth but there's no sign of new growth it's been over a month now also some of the leaves are turning yellow and brown i water the tree at least every other day so i don't think it's from lack of water help when i deadhead my spent roses i just pop the tops off just below the rose hips it then takes about weeks to a month for them to rebud and bloom the more you prune off the more the plant has to rejuvenate itself my leaves turned brown too but i found that my husband was watering the leaves in late morning a no no for sure pots can dry out in the summer and i sometimes water my plants or times a day depending where they are located in reference to the sun otherwise you might be cooking the roots good drainage is very important too you don't want root rot Hippeastrum Plum Houseplant Rose Leaf Physiological plant disorders Pruning fruit trees Orchidaceae Peach Apple Wood Apricot Fruit tree propagation Kigo Tea Carnivorous plant Textile manufacturing New York Rangers Capercaillie Garden Strawberry Begonia Cannabis cultivation Teapot Comfrey Tobacco Bamboo Wisteria Grafting Pansy Pine Black pepper Sunflower Snooker Auxin Cleveland Browns Loganberry Coffee Flower Sugar beet Tillandsia Coffea The Chemical Brothers Olive Pruning Camellia sinensis Gooseberry Coconut Weed control Brooklyn Botanic Garden Essential oil Eucalyptus Cosmic year Perfume Plant Irrigation Apical dominance Pachypodium Rambutan Japanese tea ceremony Desert Tofu Monofloral honey Cincinnati Reds Hemp Drainage Chinese calendar Aston Villa F.C.
