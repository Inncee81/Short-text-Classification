will i damage a well established tree by using vegetation killer in a large bed underneath the previous owner of my house made a huge flower bed under a yr old dogwood i have screened the area put a combination of mulch and small stone and have tried to plant items such as ferns and hostas because the area is so big it is hard to maintain and there are so many weeds and wild flowers they choke out everything i would like to just leave the rocks and mulch but i'm afraid if i use vegetation killer i will damage the tree it all depends on the type of chemical and how it kills the vegetation if you use a chemical that is spread on the ground and watered in so that it is absorbed by the plant roots then you will surely damage the tree on the other hand if you use a chemical that is sprayed onto the offending plants so that it is absorbed throught the leaves then the risks are minimal at worst just be careful not to apply it on a windy day and avoid any spray contacting the tree check your local nursery for a specific vegetation killer that will suit your purpose there are some that kill everything they come in contact with others target specific plants Weed control Gypsy moth Fire fighting Weed Irrigation Herbicide Sewage treatment Comfrey Vegetation Plant Agriculture Soil pH Hemp Illegal drug trade Pesticide Bonsai Carnivorous plant Garden Strawberry Xeriscaping Fern Peach Brewery Kosher foods Mulch Thermal power station Textile manufacturing Tree Glossary of wildland fire terms Alfalfa Professional wrestling holds Flax Poker jargon Vermicompost Biological pest control Lawn mower Pottery Kudzu RuneScape skills Hydrochloric acid Dogwood Apple Malaria Olive Wood Bong Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Hydroponics Organic food Shotgun Fire extinguisher Sugar beet Wind power Soils retrogression and degradation Tiberium Cancer Green Revolution Naval mine Leaf Houseplant Yosemite Valley Atlanta metropolitan area Fancy rat Bamboo Terran (StarCraft) Garden Solar power Elephant Pollinator decline Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Beetle Absinth Wormwood Chatsworth House Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Hop (plant) Capercaillie Ivy Pansy GunBound Naruto jutsu Blood (computer game) Fertilizer Yosemite National Park Old growth forest Nuclear power Cannabis (drug) Date Palm Gas metal arc welding Hosta Organic horticulture Surveillance
