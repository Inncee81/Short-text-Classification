there are no plants in my pond so how did snails get in there i know if i'd just asked how snails got into my pond people would say that they came off of plants i'd bought well i don't have plants in my pond i'm wondering how i found a snail in there i brought him in and he's happily residing as my betta's pet snail just wondering how he ended up in a pond nowhere near any other bodies of water also do pond snails survive the winter same can be said for water bugs who magically find their way to ponds snails can come from many sources and they are beneficial to ponds by eating the algae and other crud things in the pond snails can live for a while out of water so the can travel especially in humid or damp conditions snails can also hibernate during drought conditions they lock themselves in their shells to protect themselves they can hitchhike with birds or be inadvertantly carried by other critters like racoon or deer who frequent ponds do not add salt to your pond the salt can hurt too many other things as well as make the pond unsuitable for plants to grow in like in any pond the snails are there for a reason chances are they will survive the winter but that also depends on how deep your pond is and if it freezes in the winter if the snails are natural to your area then they will survive be careful adding pond snails or plants or anything from outside to your indoor aquariums i never do because you never know what other hitchhiking parasites or pests your are adding that will kill you aquarium fish or cause other problems Aquarium Snail Marine aquarium Goldfish Lake Fish farming Biological pest control Introduced species Koi Water garden Hedgehog Hydroponics Shrimp farm Water resources American Alligator Tilapia Sea-Monkey Sewage treatment Animal Myxobolus cerebralis Plant Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Carnivorous plant Fauna of Australia Ecology of Hong Kong Fishing Pesticide Sodium chloride Gypsy moth Ecology Cyanide Winter Hunting Fugu Europe Houseplant Murray River Diseases of the honeybee Shark Carbon dioxide Pond Bladderwort Foodborne illness Water purification Discus (fish) Clownfish Thermoregulation Roman eating and drinking Hemp Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong One Piece minor characters Sea ice Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Antarctic krill Pikmin Aquaculture Hitchhiking Timon and Pumbaa The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Zion National Park Hibernation Coral reef The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Great Salt Lake Sauna Agriculture Krill Gray Wolf Chlorophyta Red imported fire ant Gardening Food preservation Weed control Boom Town (Doctor Who) Orca Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Minor Harry Potter Beasts Neopets Dead Sea Lawn Great Lakes Bedbug The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Slug Ayyavazhi mythology Soil life Global warming and agriculture Salt Lake City, Utah Wetland Eutrophication Bird migration
