i sprayed my black eyed susans with dish soap and water to get rid of aphids and now the flowers are dying what happened i've seen way too many suggestions here on usuing soap as an incecticide and it does work however the formulas they often give here are to times too strong of a formula and also they don't mention that after about an hour you are supposed to rinse all the plants well and get the soap off or it smothers them i use it on my garden faithfully and have lovely veggies and herbs also they dont mention that some dishsoaps are also concentrated so you are adding probably times the amount suggested if you use it this is copied from link below which soap is best the best type of soap for killing insects is debatable some recommend pure castile soap or liquid hand soap like ivory but others endorse various name brand liquid dish liquids most often dawn and ivory detergents are good choices because they are not affected by minerals in hard water unlike non detergent soaps however detergents are reputed to be more damaging to plants if used excessively if you choose to use a dish detergent make sure to rinse your plants within an hour of applying the insecticide also do not spray plants on very hot or humid days as the plant will be more prone to burning always test a small area of the plant that is not too visible before applying and insecticide some species especially those with lightly colored foliage are more likely to be burned by soaps soap insecticide recipes a one to two percent concentration of soap in water is an appropriate dilution for insecticide soap this mixture will kill insects without risking burning the plant this equates to approximately five tablespoons of soap per one gallon of water most recipes recommend using two teaspoons of dish detergent per quart of water while those who use castile soap should add one or two tablespoons per quart of water blend the ingredients in a large pot or bucket and then transfer them to a spray bottle as needed the mixture will keep indefinitely you may also wish to add some herbs known to repel if not kill many common garden pests try a handful of any of the following horseradish cayenne pepper garlic or onions make a diffusion by pouring hot water over the plant of your choice sealing it in a container overnight and straining it add the spice infused water to a basic soap insecticide for its extra repellant properties again make sure that you test a small area of the plant before you douse it with the spray as some plants are very sensitive to these spices application deadhead the flowers and hope they come back cut them down to main stem Soap Coffee Tofu Vinegar Bread Chile pepper Rum Houseplant Haggis Mayonnaise Fire extinguisher Tea Laundry detergent Fire fighting Soap bubble Pesticide Cajun cuisine Chili con carne Honey Textile manufacturing Garlic Gypsy moth Sulfuric acid Wine Shampoo Beer Japanese tea ceremony Motor oil DDT Russian cuisine Cannabis (drug) Brewery Curry Peruvian cuisine Explosive material Plastic Hard water Common cold Ramen Pansy Tattoo Jewish cuisine Alcoholic beverage Pottery Cannabis cultivation Dishwasher Hamster Cooking weights and measures Glycerin Molotov cocktail Pizza Menstrual cup Dishwashing Apple Gumbo Ocean thermal energy conversion Hydrochloric acid Ammonia Comfrey Solar power Organic farming Carbon dioxide Cuisine of Denmark Sewage treatment Gaucho (insecticide) Malaria Diseases of the honeybee Cuisine of Brazil Food Herbicide Agar plate Coca-Cola Mosquito Cookware and bakeware Western blot Lavender Milk Sulfur Arsenic Gas metal arc welding Idli Rebreather Bong Sichuan Pepper Glass Essential oil Sorghum Uranium Onion Pepper spray
