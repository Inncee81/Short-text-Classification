what are these worms eating my pine trees recently i noticed loud grinding noises in my pine trees among my backyard these are loud noises and can be heard from across the yard earlier today i pulled some bark off only to find several holes into the tree and these worms that are a white gray color they look like they have sections on their bodies and they have pinchers on them that they use to dig into the tree they have mostly killed the tree so far but what are they and how do i get rid of them before they move to the next tree blackhorned pine borer it's actually a beetle but the larvae are borers adults appear in early spring and fly to host material where they deposit eggs beneath bark scales on dead trees or on cut wood that has seasoned over winter the larvae feed in the phloem and outer sapwood making broad meandering intertwined tunnels in the wood and pushing large quantities of frass through small holes in the bark pupation occurs in the wood in long cells plugged with wads of fibrous frass there is usually one generation per year they generally will not attack a healthy tree but are attracted to dead dying diseased or stressed trees so although it appears that they have mostly killed the tree in fact your tree was most likely already dying from something else they just showed up to make the most of it one of the control recommendations prevention is to keep healthy trees in good condition by pruning out damaged wood and maintaining good cultural practices such as proper watering and fertilization Wood Beetle Diseases of the honeybee Pine Biological pest control Giant Sequoia Earthworm Campfire Snake Olive Honeybee Mosquito Apple Coast Douglas-fir Kakapo Bonsai Flowering plant Spark plug Bee Spruce Budworm Avalanche Insect Capercaillie Bladderwort Pruning fruit trees Butterfly Root Bamboo Dandruff Chicken Vermicompost Oak Aphid Sudden Oak Death Ivory-billed Woodpecker Elephant Coconut crab Tree Baylisascaris Schistosomiasis Queen bee Tooth enamel Bagworm moth Hemp Carburetor Gray Wolf Golf Heartworm Honey fungus Hornet Rocky Mountain spotted fever Internal ballistics Glossary of wildland fire terms Axe Yellow Onchocerciasis Eucalyptus Tobacco Hiking American Black Bear Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carpal tunnel syndrome Phloem Seismic retrofit Tarantula Immune system Eye Worms weapons and tools Biology Carpenter bee Dog Tsetse fly Fruit tree propagation Dutch elm disease Bark beetle Bong Longleaf Pine Ant American Alligator English longbow Decibel Spider Logging Drainage Cancer Mushroom hunting Apoptosis Comfrey Sexual dimorphism
