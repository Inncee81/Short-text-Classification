why have my cucumbers gone yellow when they aren't fully grown this is from dr lynette morgan there are many causes of yellowing in cucumber plants everything from major nutrient deficiencies and toxicities to pests such as spider mites that are small and difficult to see there are also many diseases and viruses that can cause plant or fruit yellowing so it s almost impossible to guess what is causing your particular yellowing problem however here are a few possible causes nitrogen deficiency will cause older leaves to turn a uniform pale green to yellow this condition spreads to younger leaves up the plant plant may be very stunted in severe deficiency conditions phosphorus deficiency will cause the oldest leaves at the base of the shoot to turn bright yellow and the leaves will die prematurely potassium deficiency in cucumber will cause yellowing and scorching of the older leaves symptoms begin at the margins of the leaf and spread between the veins out to the center magnesium deficiency causes yellowing of older leaves the symptoms begin between the major veins which retain a narrow green border a light tan burn will develop in the yellow regions if the deficiency is severe manganese deficiency will cause the middle or upper leaves to take on a mottled pale green or yellow appearance with green veins iron deficiency causes the youngest leaves to turn pale green or yellow with green veins in severe cases the affected leaves may appear light yellow to white boron deficiency causes both leaf and fruit symptoms with the appearance of a broad yellow boarder at the margins of the oldest leaves fruit may become stunted develop mottled yellow streaks and produce corky markings other problems that may cause yellowing include excess nitrogen chloride toxicity salinity damage boron toxicity herbicide damage and phosphorus toxicity since there is such a wide range of potential nutritional problems that could cause yellowing it might be a good idea to obtain a well balanced nutrient mix and apply this to the plants to see if that helps spider mites can also cause yellowing of the whole plant this starts as a speckled appearance that gradually gets worse until the leaves and fruit become bronzed in appearance eventually the tissue becomes brown and dried spider mites are very small and difficult to see but if you look on the undersides of leaves for a very fine webbing and tiny orange dots this pest is likely to be the problem mites are difficult to control but there are now predators that can be purchased for biological control also soap and oil sprays can sometimes be effective if applied correctly there are also a few diseases that can cause yellowing but often the symptoms of disease appear in isolated spots that rapidly spread causing other symptoms such as the appearance of fungal spores or wet rots there are also a number of viruses diseases that could cause these symptoms as well mosaic viruses can affect cucumbers cucumber mosaic virus results in older leaves turning yellow and drying up new leaves sometimes wilt and die and there will be a slow decline of the plants some viruses are carried by insects such as aphids others can be carried by infected seed there aren t any cures for virus infected plants they are best removed and destroyed http www growingedge com community archive read php c pd q good luck hope this helps Physiological plant disorders Pansy Diseases of the honeybee Soil pH Weed control Gypsy moth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Agriculture Sewage treatment Cucumber Carbon dioxide Folic acid Nutrition Leaf Organic farming Green Revolution Coeliac disease Cancer AIDS Wheat Pesticide Iron Variegation Cirrhosis Pneumonia Vitamin C Prostate cancer Protein-energy malnutrition Asthma Stomach cancer Anemia Aloe Tomato Explosive material Tobacco Rocky Mountain spotted fever Plant breeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Global warming and agriculture Dog Hypoglycemia Psoriasis Food Common cold Shrimp farm Hamster Multiple sclerosis Organic food Soil life Comfrey Insulin Potato Color Decompression sickness Peanut Spider Diabetes mellitus Apple Wood Anthrax Maize Cannabis cultivation Genetically modified food Herbicide Bacteria Garlic Plant Smoke-screen Common bean Crohn's disease Aluminium Organic horticulture Canary Atherosclerosis Rapeseed Cephalic disorder Ecology Parkinson's disease Mosquito Pachypodium brevicaule Coffee Magnesium Vegetarianism Ultraviolet Fibromyalgia Equine conformation Zinc Black Death
