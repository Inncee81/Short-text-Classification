where can i garden year round i want to move somewhere where i can always have a vegetable garden and get my food from it midwest winters don't allow for a garden more than months out of the year hi i've lived in both florida and pennsylvania florida is hot enough to have a garden all year round especially southern florida the problem is it is very hot in the summer and most veggies don't do so well when the tem is above every day for months on end plus gardening in that kind of heat is not fun either i would think california would have a milder climate that doesn't get that cold and may allow for gardening year round you can also try a greenhouse or cold frames to exend your growing season good luck K__ppen climate classification Climate of India Greenhouse Climate of the United Kingdom Bird migration Solar power Orlando, Florida Miami, Florida MRE Pea Renewable energy Urban heat island Mediterranean climate Garlic Autonomous building Pensacola, Florida Monsoon Market gardening Cereal Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University Key West, Florida Continental climate Kigo Manchuria California Carbon dioxide New York Knicks Autumn Alcohol fuel Gardening Milankovitch cycles Season Geography of Afghanistan Water Effects of global warming Memphis, Tennessee Chatsworth House El Ni__o Daylight saving time United States Beekeeping Agriculture Global climate model Capercaillie Spring (season) The Midnight Sun 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Desert Botany Curitiba Watermelon Geography of Peru Barbecue Burnie, Tasmania Potato Geography of Bolivia Little Ice Age Arizona Climate of Salt Lake City Hobart Biology of the Sierra Nevada Geography of Pakistan Minor league baseball Ponderosa Pine Sugar beet Breakfast American Black Bear Mitigation of global warming Diseases of the honeybee Paprika Extreme weather Hydroponics Tampa, Florida Pumpkin Refrigerator car National Football League Japanese calendar Climate change Good Times International League Honeybee Troms__ I.L.
