solar lights i just purchased a small statue from a catalog that is supposed to be solar lighted it comes with an on off switch i didnt turn the switch on and when it got dark the statue didnt light up the sun was out strong all day stupid question but do i have to keep the on off switch on all day it is like a yard light most will not charge the battery if the switch is off i took one apart to see how it worked and when the switch is turned off it breaks the connection between the solar power and the battery and between the battery and the light plus you do want to leave the switch on all the time it is made to auto turn on and off on it's own Solar power Solar panel Flashlight Solar system Switch Battery (electricity) Solar cell Hybrid vehicle Solar eclipse Game Boy Advance Spacecraft propulsion Renewable energy Electrical generator PlayStation Portable General relativity Semiconductor device Transit of Venus Diode Black hole Toyota Prius USS Tunny (SS-282) Oscilloscope Thermostat Energy development Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Future energy development Day Solar flare Uninterruptible power supply Thermal power station Comet Locomotive Aurora (astronomy) Planet Ekadasi Sun ISS Solar Arrays IPod Autonomous building Neutrino Mars Exploration Rover Alternator Electric boat Moon USS Thresher (SS-200) Melanin Corona Mars Polar Lander Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Battery electric vehicle Spark gap Dark matter Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory USS Texas (BB-35) Solar power satellite Laptop Geomagnetic storm Electric vehicle USS Wahoo (SS-238) Aircraft engine controls Mouse (computing) Extrasolar planet Wild ARMs 2 Heliocentrism Baseball USS Washington (BB-56) Mount Washington Cog Railway Radio Solar time Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February USS Johnston (DD-557) Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Fan (implement) Modified Newtonian dynamics Mariner 2 Telephone exchange Extraterrestrial skies Automotive lighting West Side Highway Kryptonite Liquid crystal display Incandescent light bulb Hydrogen vehicle Digital photography USS Tang (SS-306) Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Lawn mower USS Triton (SS-201) Toronto Subway and RT Rail terminology Ford Ranger EV Venus Creationist cosmologies William Herschel USS Whale (SS-239) Jack plug Physics Solar sail
