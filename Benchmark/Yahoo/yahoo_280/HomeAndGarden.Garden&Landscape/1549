i have a few hydrageas that i have had for three to four years and they have not bloomed except the first year i live in sanford nc what am i doing wrong some varieties don't bloom year after year the mophead rounded varieties are notorious for not blooming year after year also a lack of blooms could be due to pruning at the wrong time there may be a general lack of phosphorous in the soil too much nitrogen may have caused a lot of leafy growth at the expense of blooms or sometimes hydrangea will leaf out early in the spring during a warm spell and then get caught in a late spring freeze if the new growth came only from the ground then types of hydrange that blooms only on old wood will not bloom this year the smooth hydrangea hydrangea arborescens bloom on new wood so if you prune in late winter or early spring you won't accidentally cut off this year's flowers others like some mopheads and many big leaf hydrangeas h macrophylla bloom on old wood so any late season or fall or winter pruning you do erases next year's flowers you can prune a third of the stems of mophead hydrangeas h macrophylla to the ground after blooming and cut off flower heads when they become tattered but do not prune the flowerless straight shoots without side branches because these are the ones that will branch out and flower next year they are heavy feeders to encourage flowering use a fertilizer low in nitrogen and with a phosphorus content over an n p k ratio of is ideal fertilize them regularly organic soil enriched with compost is best if using store bought fertilizers you don't want to fuss with a scheduled feeding of fertilizer you can also use a slow release fertilizer like osmacote or use manure around your plants water on a regular basis too much shade will also retard the development of flowers full sun can scorch the leaves so part sun to shade is best morning sun and afternoon shade is ideal in frost zones winter protection planting in an area away from drying winter winds helps good luck hope this helps Fertilizer Leaf Carnivorous plant Soil pH Bonsai Hemp Houseplant Alfalfa Olive Apple Soil Pruning fruit trees Tobacco Weed control Eutrophication Physiological plant disorders Wisteria Comfrey Tea Vermicompost Pachypodium ambongense Flowering plant Wood Green Revolution Bamboo Hippeastrum Desert Organic farming Peanut Begonia Sewage treatment Atlanta metropolitan area Peach Pruning Apricot Nutrient Humus Gooseberry Pansy Garden Strawberry Fruit tree propagation Biodynamic agriculture Kudzu Prosopis cineraria Orchidaceae Cannabis cultivation Alder Zion National Park Sugar beet Soils retrogression and degradation Plant Moss Pinophyta Manure Climate of the United Kingdom Organic gardening Anemone Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Textile manufacturing Wheat Phosphorus Bladderwort European Beech Deforestation Jute Ecology Aloe Venus Flytrap Earthworm Sunflower Tillandsia Algal bloom Flax Irrigation Oat Logging Hop (plant) Wildfire Lilac Banana Global warming and agriculture Pachypodium brevicaule Pachypodium bicolor Lake Energy development Vegetation Plum Elm Livestock Nuclear power
