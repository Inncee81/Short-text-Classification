why do i suddenly have brown mushrooms in my brand new lawn we recently had our backyard redone our landscaper and his team took out existing cement and lawn added raised beds and brought in new topsoil and sod for a brand new grassy lawn they laid the sod about weeks ago i went outside this morning to find that seemingly overnight dozens of small brown mushrooms have come up through our brand new lawn help we have been in this house for two years and have never seen even one mushroom prior to now i have a month old son and am concerned that they could be poisonous and of course having spent a significant sum on our new backyard i'm not happy that it is now covered in mushrooms we live in the bay area so get lots of daytime sun and lots of nighttime moisture from the fog is this normal what do we do should the landscaper be responsible for remedying the situation and most important how can i tell if the mushrooms are safe for my son to be near sounds like your contractor did a good job mushrooms calling them toadstools hurts there feelings are a sign your lawn is healthy and getting adequate moisture they are breaking down organic material into usable nutrients think of it as composting in place some known as mycorrhizal mushrooms are even better for it they form a symbiotic relationship with the grasses roots by storing and exchanging water and nutrients the only thing that concerns me is your son he's at the grazing stage where everything new goes in the mouth for investigation but you already know that assume any mushroom as harmful for his sake you can pick'm kick'm or mow'm to remove them and you don't need to wear gloves even the most poisonous can't be absorbed through the skin in fact the most deadly mushrooms can be nibbled tasted and spit out as a means of identifying without harm i do it all the time rscott Soil life Mushroom hunting Compost Houseplant Lawn Urinary incontinence Comfrey Honey fungus Fungus Vermicompost Mario Rice Lawn mower Guinea pig Mattress Deforestation Composting toilet EastEnders Anchor Weed control Mushroom Infantilism Mushroom poisoning Omega-3 fatty acid Organic farming Tofu Sewage treatment Straw-bale construction Sod Button mushroom Super Mario Bros.
