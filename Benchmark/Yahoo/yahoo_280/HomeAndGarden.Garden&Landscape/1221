cure for mosquito infestation help my family has just moved into a cute basement apartment in a rural wooded area the home is great and has plenty of room for my son to play outdoors unfortunately he hasn't been able to stay out without being coated with bug spray due to the clouds of mosquitos that attack anyone who steps outside i know that they breed in standing water so we've searched the nearby area trying to find any moisture but we've been unsuccessful in finding the source our new yard doesn't really have much grass but is underneath a lot of big oak trees that have built up a layer of leaf mulch underneath any suggestions on making our yard safe i can't seem to find a product to eliminate the mosquitos without finding a water source or invoving things like the citronella candles a little dangerous with a yr old child the bug spray works pretty well but these bugs are so bad that anyone coming in from the driveway gets bitten several times before they get to the door try a citronella plant i heard those work pretty good either that buy a bat box and hang it up on one of the oaks bats will eat the mosquitos you can buy both products at home depot or lowes i do beleive Mosquito Gypsy moth 2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore Essential oil Malaria Wildfire Wood The Time Machine Bedbug Fire fighting Treehouse of Horror V Hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Biological pest control Christmas tree Irrigation Tick DDT Bombing of Hamburg in World War II Jumpstart 3rd Grade RuneScape quests Anopheles Cymbopogon Kitchen Domestic rabbit Acorn Pok__mon Abilities Upholstery Asian tiger mosquito Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blood (computer game) Monster Rancher monsters McMansion Plastic Rent (musical) Apple The Legend of Zelda series enemies Textile manufacturing Carnivorous plant Lechaina Fast bowling Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Conker's Bad Fur Day Syphon Filter Rose (Doctor Who) Desert Vampire Sluggy Freelance Bacon USS Trigger (SS-237) Pok__mon types Chatsworth House Houseplant Columbine High School massacre Debugging The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe FoxTrot Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism De Havilland Mosquito Bulk vending Plant RuneScape skills Pollination Kodocha Poker jargon Flowering plant Bat Signs Mulch Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Customs and etiquette of Japan Table tennis Desertification Chinglish Pottery Tobacco Dog Atlanta metropolitan area Hemp Thermal power station Whitton, London RuneScape locations GunZ The Duel Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal Evidence of evolution Brewery Chagas disease Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Wood carving The Invisibles Guqin Door Jayne Mansfield Bethalto, Illinois Bat Boy Cat Camp Lazlo The Star Wars Holiday Special Equine conformation The Basement Tapes
