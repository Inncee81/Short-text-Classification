how to train an ivy plant novice i just bought a baby ivy plant my idea is to get it to climb up a large trellis or other freestanding support to go in our solarium when do i start to train it to go up the support it is very small should i wait until it's much bigger or start right away you can begin training ivy as soon as the trailers are long enough to reach where you want them to go ivy won't curl around its support so you'll need to tie it i like zipties available at any hardware or general store like wal mart because they are so adjustable eventually when the stems reach a quarter inch or so diameter the ivy plant will grow some hair like clingers that will attach to your trellis or whatever else it comes into contact with Ivy Vine Poison-ivy Wal-Mart Ivy Mike Tire Dog agility Leaf Pachypodium bicolor Ivy League Hard disk Root Toxicodendron Fancy rat Aerial root Tree Glossary of firefighting equipment Equine conformation Pachypodium baronii Teller-Ulam design Curling Sears Holdings Corporation Mango Hair Haircut Apple Tomato Plane (tool) Cucumber Drill bit Pennsylvania State University Fossil fuel power plant Red Sox Nation Reggaeton Fixed-wing aircraft Creeping Charlie Textile manufacturing Castle Bravo Climbing equipment Fancy Crane Wrigley Field Peanut Table saw Bladderwort Springfield 1903 rifle Pachypodium ambongense Glossary of climbing terms M16 (rifle) Cannabis cultivation Lionel Corporation Lawn mower Hamster ITunes Music Store Bridgewater, Nova Scotia Tic-Tac-Dough Oscilloscope Cuscuta GunBound Pole vault Wisteria Berkshire Hathaway University of Michigan Cable car (railway) Straw-bale construction Weed control Maize Palm OS Rigging Isabella "Ivy" Valentine Pachypodium key to species Elis Prefecture Plant stem Pittsburgh Steelers Ammunition Gwen Stefani Mattress Whitney Houston Atlantic Coast Conference Ethernet Naval Station Norfolk Flowering plant Gramophone record Operation Ivy (band) Pedro Mart__nez Satyr Bong Rose Whip Carnivorous plant U.S. 4th Infantry Division Amateur telescope making Wood The Game (college football) Counter-Strike RISC Jerry Coleman Bamboo Space Shuttle external tank Irrigation Pachypodium brevicaule
