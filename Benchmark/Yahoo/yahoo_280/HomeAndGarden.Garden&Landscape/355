why is it bad to water the lawn when the weather is hot firstly because it's a waste of time and water established grass will recover from periods of drought without watering it might look a bit brown but it will recover if you have a new lawn it would need some help though secondly unless you really really soak the lawn it encourages the roots to come to the surface to the water which in the long run will be counterproductive because in dry periods the water is found deeper in the ground and if all the roots are just under the surface the grass can't get to it you really don't need to water an established lawn but if you do do it in the evening so the sun doesn't scorch the grass through the water droplets and it doesn't just evaporate Lawn Water Irrigation Evaporation Opportunity rover Renewable energy Desertification Rice Weather lore Xeriscaping Tennis Brewery Sorghum Water vapor Rain Flax Cloud Autonomous building Wildfire Effects of global warming Desert Steam engine Fog Nuclear fallout Pok__mon Abilities Air conditioning Deforestation Climate of the United Kingdom White phosphorus incendiary Atlanta metropolitan area Common cold Sewer Tick Persian Gardens Fire extinguisher Physiological plant disorders Comet Leaf Pachypodium Sugar beet Thermoregulation Gypsy moth National Weather Service The Championships, Wimbledon Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Relative humidity Car washing techniques Lake Lawn mower Anchor Agar plate Ecohydrology Kahoolawe Soil Water resources Textile manufacturing Equine conformation Carnivorous plant Cricket pitch Hyperthermia Drought Dry cleaning Coffee Root Mower 3 Feet High and Rising Sod Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Laws of cricket Lechaina A151 road Larry Walters Bonsai Prosopis cineraria Humidity Yarrow Black pepper Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan Mattress Natural disaster Flood geology Tofu Moss Transformers: Energon Saturn Comet Hyakutake Coal Energy development Venus Groundwater Wetland Survival skills Wood pulp Weathering Dishwasher Boiling point Comfrey Dundas Square Pachypodium habitats
