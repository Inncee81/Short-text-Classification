why are my cucumbers turning yellow orange in my garden i have jalepenos tomatoes and pumpkins please help hmmm it sounds like they are getting too ripe that's the color they usually turn can you tell us more is the discolored area softer in texture how big are they how big are they supposed to be also are they shriveling up if they are full sized and soft in the discolored area then they are probably getting overripe pick 'em sooner the other possibility that i can think of which i don't think is too likely is they are sitting in a wet area do you have poor drainage where they are is it mulched how frequently are they watered the plant itself could be over watered or the fruit could be making contact with ground that is too wet oh and i guess i just thought of one other possible culprit how often do you fertilize how much do you fert they could be getting too much food for their own good the first thing you should do would be to observe your own practices of the basics feeding water light soil conditions etc i would then take your observations and then compare them with what the seed packet says you should be doing then if you don't have one i recommend a book on veg growing they are very handy lastly adjust and apply what you have learned hope that helps Tomato Pumpkin Wood Fruit Hamster Soil pH Mulch Hemp Garden Strawberry Fruit tree propagation Carnivorous plant Ketchup Physiological plant disorders Agriculture Weed control Irrigation Pansy Apple Breastfeeding Textile manufacturing Flowering plant Earthworm Peanut Organic food Weed Acorn Seed Global warming and agriculture Houseplant Leaf Neolithic Revolution Pine Bladderwort Vegetarianism Veganism Cannabis cultivation Date Palm Fancy rat Wheat Potato Opportunity rover Black pepper Mattress Flax Tillage Peach Green Revolution Cheese Organic farming Species Desert Peruvian cuisine Sewage treatment Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Comfrey Soil life Mushroom hunting Strawberry Soil Japanese toilet Upholstery Gardening Coffea Common bean Noni Cuisine of Brazil Equine conformation Leather Genetically modified food Dog Mango Kitesurfing Root Soils retrogression and degradation Hydroponics Stratification (botany) Jewish cuisine Electrophysiology Car handling Dog training Theory of conduct Tobacco Compost Pollination Color Carburetor Broom (shrub) BZFlag Plantain Extreme Programming Goldfish Vitamin C Tire Avocado Lawn mower Pinophyta Tooth enamel Sorghum Bong
