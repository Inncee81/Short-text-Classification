do i have to remove a clematis plant that has gotten wilt from the root or may i just remove the vines i only have one healthy one left of and don't want to lose that one too any ideas on preventing traeting wilt is it true that the plant may grow back next year clematis wilt is caused by the fungus phoma clematidina spores are produced from tiny fruiting bodies on the infected stems and are spread by water splash the fungus can remain in the soil for many months in old infected plant tissue cut back the wilted shoots to healthy tissue this may mean pruning below the soil surface clean out all old and infected clematis plant material from around your plant s do not allow fallen leaves to remain in fall destroy burn or bury deep or remove this debris from your site be sure to wash your pruning tools with a bleach or alcohol solution and dry between cuts the plant does not need to be dug out because new shoots may develop below the wilted section later in the season or the following spring mulch around your clematis to help prevent future splashing of spores on to your clematis leaves Plant Comfrey Honey fungus Weed control Pruning fruit trees Flowering plant Soil pH Gypsy moth Phytophthora infestans Wood Olive Physiological plant disorders Bamboo Bonsai Soil life Sugar beet Orchidaceae Hemp Garden Strawberry Carnivorous plant Gooseberry Spore Kudzu Fruit tree propagation Leaf Eczema Tobacco Mushroom Biological pest control Desert Bacteria Pruning Black pepper Tea Foodborne illness Irrigation Water purification Fireblight Lichen Banana Erosion Root Deforestation Carbon dioxide Sterilization (microbiology) Dutch elm disease Fecal incontinence Diseases of the honeybee Tooth Vegetative reproduction Apical dominance Wound Jute Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Biological warfare Hop (plant) Phytophthora cinnamomi Cannabis cultivation Brewery Cancer Maize Mycorrhiza Wisteria Tooth enamel Soil Tomato Prostate cancer Drill bit Chlorophyta Agricultural wastewater treatment Pansy Tattoo Apple Sudden Oak Death Hippeastrum Drainage Beetle Cytomegalovirus Lung cancer Moss Chamaecyparis lawsoniana Logging Menstrual cup Compost Textile manufacturing Immune system Halo: Combat Evolved Acorn Sugar Fancy rat
