best wild flowers for the edge of woods i want to buy some flower seeds to throw out at the edge of the woods on our property i'm thinking i might like a seed mix where flowers bloom at different times during the year i need something that is easy to plant since i want to cover a large area so throwing out some seeds would work out well my hobby is digital photography so i would like to plant something that is eye appealing and that attracts butterfilies bees etc also where can i find a good deal on flower seeds do i purchased these online or local i am located in northern alabama thanks for the help i have in general found that tossing seeds in areas results in feeding the ants birds and so on i presume because i rarely see plants it would be a waste of money the only time i have had success is when i had heaping amounts of wild flower seed harvested from daisies and black eyed susans and the like and scattered them in a waste area i did get flowers from that but i would suspect that one in seeds sprouted which is why they make so many you'd do better getting plants or growing them in the spring in little pots and planting them out you can often get divisions of plants from friends and neighbors and family if you want buy seeds take a look at wildseed farms catalog which is in fact recommended by the alabama wildflower advisory both links are in sources if you purchase flowers take a look at the wildseed farms catalog as a reference it has a ton and a half of info and these wilder flowers are great for woodland edges enjoy Flower Flowering plant Carnivorous plant Cannabis cultivation Watermelon Apple Deforestation Pollinator decline Pollination Peanut Jute Weed control Honey Illegal drug trade Alfalfa Poker jargon Luther Burbank Insect Light pollution Vermicompost Textile manufacturing Sugar beet Spider Maize Alcohol fuel Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Renewable energy Draw poker Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Tobacco Pikmin Monsanto Betting (poker) Orchidaceae RuneScape skills Durian Hemp Banana Garden Strawberry Fish farming Houseplant Comfrey Eucalyptus Sunflower Johnny Appleseed Wood Pinophyta Green Revolution Tree Black pepper Elis Prefecture Garden Coconut Vanilla Wheat The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Cannabis Fancy rat Acorn Rambutan Seed Cyclamen Ginkgo Craps Avocado Domestic rabbit Rose Henry W.
