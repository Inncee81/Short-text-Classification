not sure i have enough sun insects for my pitcher plant indoors i live in the desert and wonder if i should take my plant outside for sunlight and bugs and bring it back in to keep it from burning when it gets too hot also what bugs do they attract it is clearly a sarracenia a bog plant you are right to worry about them drying out outside you can give them bright light instead of full sun so they don't burn full spectrum grow lights can be a helpful suppliment as bugs go they need a minimum of a year they attract gnats flies wasps actually any thirsty bug can get trapped in it i've been growing them for over years and don't seem to have a problem with the plant not catching enough food unless i keep the plant in a closed terrarium do not fertilize their natural habitat is low in nutrients so fertilization can kill them they seem to tolerate more moisture than other plants although right now my husband is trying them outside on the patio for the nd summer they are in pots placed in an open plastic storage box with an inch of water to because it's almost a desert out here and the water evaporates quickly so we try to keep it from dropping below with the pot about as tall as the sides of the container they seem pretty happy but temperatures haven't gotten over yet mostly in the s unusually nice we'll see how it goes most plants grow leaves for their environment which can easily die when the environment or lighting changes but too much of a change can cause too many leaves to die and kill the plant best of luck these are fairly tough as carnivors go Venus Flytrap Houseplant Sarracenia Desert Compost Hydroponics Solar power Deforestation Renewable energy Orchidaceae Cannabis cultivation Vermicompost Plastic Hippeastrum Irrigation Bonsai Gypsy moth Tea Pachypodium Organic farming Jute Pitcher plant Mosquito Leaf Acorn Fish farming Dead Sea Plant Bog Poker jargon Environmental concerns with electricity generation Prosopis cineraria Textile manufacturing Desertification Carbon dioxide Earthworm Darlingtonia (Sarraceniaceae) Energy development Sorghum Alcohol fuel Wood Sun Sunlight Photosynthesis Sustainable agriculture Agriculture Beetle Sugar beet Ocean thermal energy conversion Sarraceniaceae Tillandsia Tobacco Insect Bladderwort Rainforest Cat Basil Rice Fancy rat Honey Moss Survival skills Weed control Pachypodium baronii Illegal drug trade Begonia Water Capercaillie Fertilizer Comet Gardening Cannabis (drug) Ultraviolet Effects of global warming Christmas tree Carburetor Carbon dioxide sink Power station Nuclear reactor Dairy Thermal power station RuneScape quests Sewage treatment Autonomous building Nuclear power Banksia Tofu Explosive material Frog
