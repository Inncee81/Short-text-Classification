can corncobs help the growth of plants can it be a fertilizer ground corncobs are used as an organic mulch to prevent weed germination and growth thereby reducing competition for light water and nutrients the resulting fewer cultivations mean less damage to the roots mulch protects soil from compacting rains foot traffic drying winds and heat allows flexibility in fertilizing and watering since the ground corncobs can be raked back from the plants it should normally be applied uniformly three to four inches deep around the base of the plant using ground corncobs as a mulch reduces soil erosion and the splattering of soil on the plant's leaves and fruit during rains or sprinkling this can reduce losses to soil borne diseases when applied to cool season vegetables like broccoli cabbage and english peas in midspring ground corncobs can help to keep the soil from rapid warming and drying and can extend the growing and harvest periods when incorporated into the soil ground corncobs improves water holding capacity nutrient availability and aeration of the soil it has some fertilizer value and is a good soil conditioner when worked into the soil improving both the physical and chemical properties of soil be careful ground corncobs are low in nitrogen as they decompose nitrogen is drawn from the soil causing a shortage of nitrogen in the mulched vegetables to prevent this add one fourth pound ammonium nitrate or its equivalent to each bushel of corncobs before applying mulch when it is time to side dress pull the mulch back from plants and apply fertilizer to the soil surface http msucares com lawn garden vegetables mulching index html good luck hope this helps Soil pH Weed control Mulch Comfrey Agriculture Sewage treatment Maize Carnivorous plant Fertilizer Irrigation Soil Eutrophication Hydroponics Weed Earthworm Organic farming Global warming and agriculture Desert Explosive material Houseplant Deforestation Cannabis cultivation Hemp Physiological plant disorders Alfalfa Compost Sustainable agriculture Soils retrogression and degradation Root Garden Strawberry Bonsai Sorghum Ammonia Nitrogen Gypsy moth Oat Desertification Jute Soil life Peach Organic gardening Ammonium nitrate Humus Peanut Sugar beet No-dig gardening Dune Vegetation Green manure Organic horticulture Herbicide Banana Lawn Wildfire Organic food Shifting cultivation Tobacco Erosion Biogeochemical cycle Ecology Fruit tree propagation Soil science Crop rotation Lake Nitrogen cycle Yosemite National Park Brewery Olive Lawn mower Pansy Nuclear power Masanobu Fukuoka Alcohol fuel Drainage Kudzu Flowering plant Prosopis cineraria Stratification (botany) Seismic retrofit Biodiesel Potato Rice Solar power Seed K__ppen climate classification Water (molecule) Corrosion Illegal drug trade Vitamin C Genetically modified food Fire extinguisher Hamster
