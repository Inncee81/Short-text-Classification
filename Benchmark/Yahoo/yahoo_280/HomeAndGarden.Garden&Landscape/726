how do i make my backyard river flow faster without having more water input i have a waterfall river pond combo in my back yard the river is basically level with the pond dirt making the river banks it's about ' long from waterfall to pond i don't want to add any additional pumps to input more water i guess it's a mater of how the water is restricted as it flows down the river could it be a matter of more river rock dams larger flat toped rocks that would create a water run thereby creating more velocity water flow ie speed is controlled by gravity you need to raise the height at the start of the 'river's' run to speed up the flow Siphon Carburetor Dam River Whitewater Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Waterfall Mississippi River Coriolis effect Murray River Jet engine Bong Levee Gas metal arc welding Zambezi Canal lock Sewage treatment Potomac River Pump It Up Sailing 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Water turbine Yosemite National Park Propeller Axial compressor Hydropower Fish farming Fuel injection Swimming pool Niagara Falls Hydroelectricity E85 Stream Lake Burley Griffin Mount St. Helens Erie Canal Erosion Great Salt Lake Electrophysiology Items in the Metroid series Huron River (Michigan) Thermal power station Impact crater Bay of Fundy Tide Energy Nile Turbocharger Faster-than-light Dundas Square Fountain Renewable energy Genesee River Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Supercharger Solar power Cavitation Glacier Water resources Assonet River Tuolumne River Spacecraft propulsion Dog agility Escape velocity Turbojet Basement Geology of the Grand Canyon area Brewery Glossary of firefighting equipment Diesel engine Concrete Vacuum cleaner Water garden CPU design Car handling Weir (dam) Los Angeles River Motorcycle Sediment Dairy Gatun Dam Mystic River Gold standard Victoria Falls Digital circuit Oscilloscope Salt River Project Action potential Adirondack Mountains Tap (valve) Yosemite Valley Rhine Lift (force) INMOS Transputer Gliding Fish ladder Swimming Lighting
