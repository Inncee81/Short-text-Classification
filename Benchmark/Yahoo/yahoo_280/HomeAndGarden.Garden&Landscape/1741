procedure for starting a lawn i moved into my house and found that the back lawn which had been lush with grass only a few weeks before was now dead and basically a dirt lot it's a strip of land about x and i have a small dog so i'd have to keep her off of it what is the easiest way for me to regrow the lawn step by step would be helpful since i have almost no gardening experience and i'm on a low budget nothing is wrong with your yard it sounds as if you have a full strain of bluegrass planted there which explains it turning brown bluegrass goes dormant every summer to protect itself but if you want to replant it there i would first till it up and get yourslef a fescue blend of grasses with some prerenial rye grass in it till it first then take your garden rake and level it all out then sow the seed there for an area x you will need about lbs of grass seed to get great coverage after you seed it then use your rake to get it blended into the soil the seed needs to have good contact with the soil after you get it raked in if you want a green lawn fast then place a sprikler onto it and water it in leave the sprinkler on fro about one hour a day both in the ealry morning and late afternoon do not water in the heat of the day it will burn the seed and new grass Lawn Lawn mower Weed control Hemp Irrigation Herbicide Flax Seed Tobacco Agriculture Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Gardening Comfrey Wildfire Bread Garden Strawberry Flowering plant Textile manufacturing The Championships, Wimbledon Hamster Compost Cannabis cultivation Fancy rat Operation Market Garden Thermal power station Barley Tillage STS-59 Atlanta metropolitan area Chatsworth House Pok__mon types Bluegrass music Weed Carnivorous plant Sowing Alan Arnett McLeod Fruit tree propagation Chernobyl accident Plant Golf Tick Bowls Dolly Parton Zuiderzee Works Unreal Cereal USS Trigger (SS-237) Turnip (brassica rapa) Sewage treatment Equine conformation Palouse Zoning Weather lore USS Tigrone (SS-419) 2003 North America blackout Peanut USS Tunny (SS-282) Snooker Hydroponics Vermicompost Apple USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Xeriscaping Neighbours Desertification Pea Green Revolution Phish Shifting cultivation Oat Tennis Sorghum Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Battle of Tarawa Pebble bed reactor Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Rigging Guinea pig USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Derbyshire lead mining history Cannabis (drug) Organic farming McMansion Coffee Joni Mitchell Fescue Autonomous building Croquet The Time Machine USS Alden (DD-211) Fast bowling Mulch Giant Sequoia Japanese tea ceremony USS Yorktown (CV-10)
