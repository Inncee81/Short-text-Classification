anybody have a good semi permanent environmentally responsible way to kill grass to mark an athletic field i am sorry however i will ask do you have a groundscrew there are two methods of marking a field of play for virtually every sport i admit i know not a thing about cricket the two methods are either lime or a paint compound both the lime and paint are applied using guides the mlb prefers lime whereas the nfl and ncaa prefer paints if you were to strip or paint a number on you lawn every week using either compound what do you think would occur turf paint emerged in the early 's to allow for multiple events to occur in a venue the lines while still long were far different than the mid field markings for ncaa and nfl games the genuis george toma of kansas city found a paint that would eliminate the residue of a college game in time for a pro team to reline the field george is also responsible for the green sand teams play on bare and beaten fields but appear on tv as green due to introduction of ryegrass and green sand any marking on a field is toxic to turf itself astro turf does not have this problem however it also does not cover with the remedy lime burns the soil after multiple applications paint you have to paint over and imagine what that does to a turf some ncaa teams are attempting to paint the sidelines endzone etc at the beginning of the year then using chalk to remark them the groundscrew merely follows the markings chalk is still an alkaline the marking kills the grass to begin with thus there is no real solution to your problem one thing i always considered for what it is worth is to lay out a ' wide sideline including markers yardlines on both sides that extended and were incorporated into the grass fields this would eliminate the need for lime and paint and could be put in place in hours one of my first jobs when i officiated football games was to make sure the width of the field was correct sometimes we had to change the lime line with todays techs i am sure we could make the merger of the lines and the field secure for all the players until then natural elements in excess are a hazard greatest question i have ever had the honor of responding gjgjobs yahoo com Ultimate (sport) National Football League St. Louis Rams Baseball Golf Tennis New York Giants American football strategy Glossary of American football College football Monday Night Football Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXXVI Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Bengals New England Patriots Marching band National Football League Lore Super Bowl Georgia Institute of Technology Texas Longhorn Athletics Jim Thorpe Canadian football Houston Astros Carolina Panthers Lawn Comparison of Canadian and American football Athletics Volleyball Syracuse University Orange Middle Tennessee State University Cleveland Browns Indoor football October 2005 in sports Soil pH Super Bowl XXI Indianapolis Colts Dallas Cowboys Laws of cricket Football (soccer) January 2005 in sports NFL on television Cricket pitch Tag Major League Soccer Paintball American Football League Oakland Athletics Super Bowl XXXIV December 2004 in sports University of Arizona Jacksonville Jaguars November 2004 in sports New York Jets Indiana State University Baylor University Arizona State University Herbicide Memorial Stadium, Clemson University of Texas at Austin Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXV Auburn University Buffalo Bills Giants Stadium National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) Oklahoma State University - Stillwater Lacrosse Joe Paterno Explosive material Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium September 2005 in sports Casting Official (American football) Scientology beliefs and practices AFL-NFL Merger Super Bowl I Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXVI College basketball Deion Sanders Blackburn Rovers F.C.
