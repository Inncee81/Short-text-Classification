how can i keep the neighborhood cats out of my flower bed i have tried moth ball bug spray etc i getting desperate it sounds like the problem is your neighbors not the cats i would talk to the neighbors or better yet leave strongly worded flyers on their doors no need to leave your name let them know that any stray cats will be live trapped and delivered to the local shelter where they can pay a fine to get them back you should stress that cat feces spread disease including toxoplasmosis which is very dangerous to people with diminished immune systems and unborn children cat owners need to wake up they leave their animals at risk to disease infestations and injury clearly they leave their animals at risk to ssholes like the previous posters who recommended the use of poison their animals also create a nuisance to neighbors a risk to the other pets in the neighborhood and kill migratory song birds as for your gardens i have a few solutions cats prefer soft dry sandy dirt for their litter they don't like wood mulch mulch is one of the best products you can use in your garden especially cedar mulch cedar smells great to us but not cat's don't like it it's cheap around per large bag aside from being attractive a layer of mulch keeps the soil cool retains moisture and prevents bacteria and disease in the soil from splashing onto your plants before you spread the mulch pick up any feces in the garden water thoroughly to dilute or rinse away urine then spread the mulch if possible run a water sprinkler on low in the garden at night when cats are most acitve others have recommended orange peels or orange spray i've never tried it but i do know that cats hate citrus however the peels will also decay and mold and i'd rather not have mold in my gardens there are repellant sprays available but they need to be applied after any watering or rain best of luck to you Hamster Cat Gypsy moth Irrigation Mulch Carnivorous plant Diseases of the honeybee Fancy rat Weed control Essential oil Garden Strawberry Soil pH Guinea pig Toxoplasmosis Feral cat Mosquito Domestic rabbit Cheese Apple Pesticide Fire fighting Dog Compost Vitamin C Urinary incontinence Vermicompost Tobacco smoking Water Dairy Legionellosis Coffee Sento Autonomous building Biological pest control RuneScape quests Tobacco Fire extinguisher Food preservation Wood Pansy Plastic Renewable energy Chinchilla Honey fungus Physiological plant disorders Foodborne illness Christmas tree Nuclear fallout Tofu Malaria Survival skills Psoriasis Stratification (botany) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Perfume Pet skunk Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Flatulence Tuberculosis Acorn Acne Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Common cold Community emergency response team Desertification Pneumonia Sulfur Tooth enamel Diabetes mellitus Nutrition Feces House Mouse Organic gardening Hedgehog Air pollution Nuclear power Chagas disease Car washing techniques Characters of Naruto Bedbug Vegetarianism Mattress Tick Polyethylene terephthalate Genericized trademark Tea Water purification Chicken Tattoo
