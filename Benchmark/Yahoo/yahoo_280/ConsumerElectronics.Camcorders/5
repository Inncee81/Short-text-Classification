sony handycam dcr trv digital error e fix myself and how i have a sony handycam dcr trv digital and it shows e i know i am suppose to call sony but i was wondering if i could fix it myself and how i could do it thank you this particular error usually signifies a stuck internal lens try turning the camera on removing the tape and then zooming in and out as you whack it a few times against a semi hard surface don't bump it hard enough to shatter anything inside or out but aim for just hard enough to make a sticking lens release if this does not work then you must bite the bullet and either send it to sony for service or replace it please let me know if this works for you wk Sony DVD Digital photography Camera PlayStation 2 Photography Compact disc Sony Computer Entertainment DV Zoom lens View camera Error correction and detection Dither Camcorder Leica Walkman Volleyball Floppy disk Copy protection Digital cinematography Hard disk Memory Stick MP3 Digital camera Videocassette recorder Videotape Digital single-lens reflex cameras PlayStation 3 Anamorphic widescreen Game controller Laser engraving Nintendo 64 Contact lens Compact audio cassette PlayStation Portable Stage lighting Poker jargon Lens (optics) Peter Gabriel Photographic lens Quarashi Modchip Bluetooth MiniDisc Digital cinema Rangefinder camera DualDisc Time-division multiplexing Cinematography Electronic journalism Late Night with Conan O'Brien Sony Pictures Entertainment Panavision Analog-to-digital converter Handheld game console Secure Digital card Frogman Resident Evil 4 USB flash drive IPod Resident Evil (video game) Modem Point and shoot camera Nintendo DS Aladdin (1992 film) Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Internal ballistics M4 Sherman Nikon Corporation Headlight M16 (rifle) Universal Serial Bus Contax Analog stick Digital circuit 8 mm video format The Sims 2 Microdrive Digital camera back Konica Minolta Oscilloscope Xbox Tire VHS Linux kernel Digital recording Laserdisc The Inside Heinkel He 100 Super Audio CD Sound Blaster Nintendo GameCube Enlarger IMAX Eye Thunderball Hamming code Ebook Retronym
