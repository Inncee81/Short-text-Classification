approximately how many minutes does a gb sd card record using a hd digital camcorder i'm planning to go snowboard this year and i don't have a camcorder so i was viewing many different types of camcorders and i found some that are high definition and they are not very expensive so i want to know how this deal of sd cards work i couldn't find any info in the camcorder's technical details about how much video it records the sd card technical detail does not say anything either so if anybody that knows a little about this can help me i will appreciate it also if you can give me an advice of what could be a nice hd camcorder that won't go over or what do you recommend me to buy having in mind that the device will work in low temperature i'm worried about the quality but if there is not much difference between a regular digital camcorder's quality of image and a high definition one also let me know thanks and excuse my english hi on a gb sd card you can store minutes of data with high quality but if u reduce the pixel setting it can go upto min also which is sufficient also allways carry extra batteries and memory card this will help u i think u should go for panasonic hdc sd this is a really good hd camera price is a bit high around but worth putting the money Camcorder DV High-definition television 8 mm video format Secure Digital card Videotape Digital camera VHS Atari 8-bit family Charge-coupled device Digital video DVD Laserdisc Digital cinema Compact audio cassette Betacam Surveillance Blu-ray Disc Television RGB color model S-VHS Oscilloscope Compact disc Color Graphics Adapter Stereoscopy S__CAM Nintendo 64 Videocassette recorder Computer Pixel Digital cinematography Digital television PC Engine Digital Video CD MiniDisc Warez Nintendo DS Digital8 Holography Atari ST Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Raster graphics Teletext Professional video camera Virtual memory Enterprise content management Extended display identification data Tungsten Handheld CPU cache ATI Technologies ZX Spectrum FireWire Fairlight CMI PlayStation 3 Leica Internet fraud Nintendo Revolution Gramophone record Movie projector NTSC PlayStation Portable Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter MP3 Flash memory Audiophile Memory card Archos PNG Musical Instrument Digital Interface Screenshot IPod Radeon USB flash drive Game Boy Covert listening device Poker jargon Sound Blaster Wal-Mart Universal Serial Bus DVD-RAM CPU design Mattress Camera Mutual fund Windows Vista Gross domestic product Computer printer Xbox 360 Jumpstart 3rd Grade
