how can i transfer mini dv to dvd hiya well it's a bit more troublesome if you're new to this but we all need to try at least through trial and error as anyone new to this will find on all dvs or cam corders you have what you call a usb port this usb uses what you call a fire wire port or usually you can see this on your desktop named as you first need buy the fire wire cable from there you can use windows movie maker to extract or sometimes depending on the system you have extract direct i'm just trying tell you the easiest way there are several ways to convert to dvd and one of the first tools i used to use before nero was a cool programme called tmpgenc download all the latest codecs too so extracting it only does not make it into a dvd but tmpgenc is designed to do this for you after this stage then use nero to burn but to tell you the truth it's not really easy at first and just like me years ago spent hrs and hrs studying this so good luck pal and keep trying till you succeed DVD Universal Serial Bus Xbox 360 PlayStation Portable Video codec IPod Windows XP PlayStation 3 Apple Macintosh Bluetooth Musical Instrument Digital Interface Camcorder High-definition television Commodore 64 Xbox IMac Slackware RS-232 Warez H.264/MPEG-4 AVC MP3 Parallel port Digital rights management Television OpenBSD Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation 2 USB flash drive Digital circuit Common Unix Printing System Computer virus Mac OS X Linux Macromedia Flash Perl AmigaOS Digital audio player Apple Computer Windows Vista Mozilla Firefox IBM PC compatible LiveCD Nintendo Revolution Forth programming language Serial ATA Sharp Zaurus Mac mini Sound card Digital photography Dolby Digital Screenshot S__CAM Creative Zen Machinima Floppy disk Oscilloscope Game programmer Video Knoppix Sound Blaster Disk image Mandriva Linux Printed circuit board Digital video recorder BitTorrent Computer bus PIC microcontroller Hard disk DivX TeX ATSC Modem Transformer Ethernet Serial port M60 machine gun MPEG-2 Streaming media D-subminiature AirPort Java programming language FireWire Atari 2600 CPU design RISC Windows 98 PowerPC Modchip Advanced Audio Coding MDAC SUSE Linux Jon Lech Johansen PCI Express Symbian OS Electronics USB mass storage device class Compiler optimization 64-bit Digital television
