administrators password okay so i know the password to my account which is the only administrators account on my computer but when i tried using windows recover console and i wanted to check my c drive and it asked for my administrator's password so naturally i typed in my password but it said it was an invalid password i tried about more times and gave up how do i find this administrator's password that i never knew existed and please don't give me any of that maybe you're not typing it right crap i know my own passwords it's possible that there is no password for the admin account when you are prompted for the admin password in the recover console just press enter and see if that works Password Password cracking RuneScape cheats Windows 2000 Secure Shell Windows XP Passphrase GameFAQs Metroid Buffer overflow System/36 Password (game) System/34 Cheating in Counter-Strike Stopping e-mail abuse Internet fraud E-mail spam Neopets Blue screen of death User (computing) Password (video games) Novell NetWare Telnet Kerberos (protocol) Something Awful Forums Ninja Gaiden System administrator Cross site scripting Surveillance SHA hash functions Brute force attack X display manager Internet forum MMORPG Virtual Network Computing Oracle database 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Rootkit Columbine High School massacre Zero-knowledge proof Digest access authentication Two-factor authentication Control-Alt-Delete Microsoft Dictionary attack Unix security Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Slashdot subculture Identity management Internet Relay Chat Cryptography Atari Wi-Fi Protected Access Database 11001001 (TNG episode) RSTS/E Expert system File Allocation Table Social engineering (computer security) C Sharp Ronald Reagan Game programming Jumpstart 3rd Grade Debugging Knoppix Cheat code Cryptographic hash function File Transfer Protocol Danger Hiptop Redundant array of independent disks Common Unix Printing System Video game console Secret sharing Database management system Booting Remote administration Shibboleth Monkey Island Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ecco the Dolphin Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Memento (film) Quantum computer Doctor Who (Enemy Within) The Legend of Zelda series Federal Standard 1037C Phishing The Long Game Malware Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Empty Child Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Computer and video games Concurrent Versions System Gmail Uniform Resource Locator Domain Name System S/KEY Cypherpunk MapleStory
