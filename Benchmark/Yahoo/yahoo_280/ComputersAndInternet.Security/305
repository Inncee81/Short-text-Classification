is it possible that my boyfriend can track my activity keystrokes and text from his computer how can i tell i need to before sure before throwing around accusations the technical answer is yes other answers have done a good job of explaining the details of keyloggers a good techie can find a key logger but a well designed keylogger will run sys level privaledges and will not be detectable from taskmanager remember windows hides stuff from you and if you know the os fairly well you can use it to hide your programs including a keylogger as well more importantly than whether such an app is running why would he do such on your machine why would you care if your not saying anything you don't want him to hear or know about if you have such things then he's not the one anyway anybody you can't share your life with you should not waste time on there are more serious trust issues involved and i recomend dumping the bf as the relationship if it's devolved to this has more serious problems then wipe and load your machine to give yourself a sense of security and prevent your soon to be ex from using any software he's planted on your machine he does not need access to your machine ie and outlook are all he needs so email or web pages he's crafted could have done anything he wanted to your machine switch to firefox to reduce such problems use a good firewall like zonealarm again to reduce problems and never use outlook there are a dozen alternates use one of those outlook is known as outbreak in security circles because of it's rampant lack of security features your soon to be ex can use email to just reinstall any trojans and keystroke loggers if you use outbreak best to block his email completely or read it on neutral machines a relationship with that severe a lack of trust will not last long in otherwords upgrade to boyfriend Spyware Pretty Good Privacy Malware Windows XP Windows 2000 Computer virus Phishing Stopping e-mail abuse USB flash drive Mozilla Firefox Computer insecurity Mach kernel Outlook Express Mozilla Application Suite Trojan horse (computing) AmigaOS RuneScape cheats Password Common criticisms of Microsoft 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Rootkit E-mail Computer Computer security Surveillance Trusted computing Mouse (computing) Domain Name System CPU cache Perl Emacs Gmail Microsoft Windows Mac OS X Blue screen of death Software engineering IBM PC compatible Python programming language XML Windows Server 2003 Opera (web browser) Spam (electronic) NeXT Anti-virus software Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Windows Vista ZX Spectrum HTTP cookie OpenBSD Firewall (networking) Copy protection Novell NetWare Computer multitasking Anonymous remailer Mozilla Thunderbird Buffer overflow Linux Virtual memory Macromedia Flash Computer forensics E-mail spam Microsoft Office Hotmail Lotus Notes Atari 8-bit family Apple Macintosh Plame affair File Transfer Protocol WordStar Microsoft .NET Comparison of web browsers Burroughs B5000 Floppy disk Ajax (programming) Outsourcing Barbara Boxer BASIC programming language System 7 (Macintosh) Typewriter Embedded system Control-Alt-Delete Email authentication Customer relationship management Greasemonkey Digital rights management Compiler optimization Web crawler Backdoor Hardware random number generator Public-key cryptography X Window System Computer surveillance
