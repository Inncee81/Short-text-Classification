keppra has helped my movement disorder but one doctor said the medicine was working because i wanted it to i was on keppra for a few months last year to stop the movements hemiballismus i was told to stop the med when my main neurologist felt the problem was fixed the movement started up again and i went back on keppra i am now free of the movement problem one dr i saw thought i was only stressed and needed counseling and that the med was working only because i wanted it to i was given depakote first and it did nothing for me is there such a thing as the dr said i am fine at home with a loving husband of almost years and loving children and grandchildren a wonderful church family friends etc yet she thinks i am a basketcase sometimes movement disorders can be caused by stress or psychological trauma this is called somatization a physical symptom occurs in the body because of something in the mind and subsequent neurochemistry caused by the stress reaction it does not mean that a person is faking a disorder something is indeed happening in the nervous system to cause the problem although it might not be a purely physical problem in these instances as in the case of certain types of seizures that mimick epilepsy for example medication often does not work psych counseling is recommended but it is very difficult to get pts into such treatment and docs are often reluctant to get into the topic with pts anyway it's easier to give them an antiepileptic or some such drug in your case medication did work it is not unusual for one medication to work when another doesn't it however is not unreasonable for a physician to consider that a movement disorder is caused by a psychiatric problem but if you are functioning well now and think that you are ok and that treatment helped you but your doctor thinks you are a basket case dump that doctor fast and find someone who is more sympathetic to you Epilepsy Anxiety Medicine Traumatic brain injury Post-traumatic stress disorder Bipolar disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Psychiatry Hypoglycemia Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Psychotherapy Autism Alcoholism Schizophrenia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Multiple sclerosis Mental illness Transsexuality Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lamotrigine Psychosis Psychoanalysis Cephalic disorder Chlorpromazine Cerebral palsy Psoriasis Combat stress reaction Controversies in autism Obsessive-compulsive disorder Cancer Stomach cancer Drug addiction Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Herpes simplex virus Scientology beliefs and practices Stress (medicine) Borderline personality disorder Essential tremor Stuttering Sigmund Freud Migraine Parkinson's disease Hypnosis Dissociative identity disorder Folic acid Coeliac disease Traditional Chinese medicine Diabetes mellitus Fibromyalgia Alzheimer's disease Meditation Charles Darwin's illness Rabies LSD Panic attack Drug abuse Stroke Abortion Osteoarthritis Asthma Psychology Doxepin Palliative care Diazepam Reparative therapy Paracetamol Baldness Electroconvulsive therapy Lupus erythematosus Adult attention-deficit disorder Decompression sickness Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Seizure Prostate cancer Vigabatrin Transactional analysis Primidone Psychopharmacology Narcolepsy Huntington's disease Antidepressant Terri Schiavo Clomipramine Carpal tunnel syndrome Psychosurgery Mental Health Act 1983 Alcoholics Anonymous Pain Osteopathy Chiropractic Balance disorder Haloperidol Narcissism
