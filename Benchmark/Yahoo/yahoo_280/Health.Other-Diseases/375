should i be worried a couple of days ago i went to the doctors and was diagnosed with parvo th disease my symptoms were diahrea nausea tingling joint pain and cold symptoms the joint pain has gone away with the diahrea nausea but i still have the tingling i figured it was because parvo lowers red blood cell count and they carry oxygen so i was just expierencing lack of oxygen to certain parts at times the tingling was patch mostly in my torso lasting seconds was this a good guess i am starting to worry i am also having a hard time remembering things on the tip of my toung although that may be from my lack of sleep lately parvovirus is not a disease caused by mosquitoes it's a virus i wouldn't be too worried as long as your doctor is aware and you are being treated it should resolve itself one thing i can tell you to just be aware of sometimes having fifths disease is a precursor to having an autoimmune disease arthritis lupus hypothyroidism etc not always though if you are having memory issues though you might want to ask your doctor to check your thyroid sometimes hypothyroidism causes memory problems hypothyroidism can be considered an autoimmune disorder depending on why you have it if you have it but is easily treatable i'm sure it's just the regular fifths disease though and you'll be fine soon probably once you feel better you should go to your doc for a followup and then also see about checking your thyroid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Autoimmune diseases Traumatic brain injury Chronic fatigue syndrome Stomach cancer Lupus erythematosus Coeliac disease Rheumatoid arthritis Multiple sclerosis Hypothyroidism Hyperthyroidism Psoriasis Carpal tunnel syndrome Prostate cancer Pneumonia Cirrhosis Myocardial infarction Lyme disease Anemia Fibromyalgia Cancer Folic acid Crohn's disease Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Malaria HIV test Arthritis Stroke Paresthesia Migraine Clinical depression Conjunctivitis Angina Hepatitis Endocrinology Immune system Muscle Parkinson's disease Tuberculosis Panic attack Chemotherapy Sleep Obsessive-compulsive disorder Cerebellum Gastroparesis Ebola Paget's disease of bone Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Equine conformation Leukemia Dog Rocky Mountain spotted fever Asthma Addison's disease Hyperprolactinaemia Thyroid Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Balance disorder AIDS Red blood cell Turner syndrome Decompression sickness Liver Foodborne illness Hypoglycemia Graves-Basedow disease Parvovirus B19 Radiation poisoning Hirschsprung's disease Childbirth Thyroid cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Post Polio syndrome Cancer of the larynx Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Dermatology Gout Hemoglobin Addiction Reiter's syndrome Haemochromatosis Tobacco smoking Penis Adjustable gastric band Aspartame Dementia Beh__et's disease
