my mom's having problems seeing and she's taking caduet and lipitor my mom is taking caduet and lipitor and she's having problems focusing and what's called diplopia or double vision i found these are side effects for this medication does anyone know if she stops it if her sight should return to normal also are there other medications that will do the same type of things that might be used as replacements for this medication her eyes are not yellow and she has had liver tests which are ok ooops it isn't lipitor it was caduet and ambien she was taking i'm going to have her ask her doctor about those you mentioned and look them up for her online thanks so much do you think she can correct the problems she's got with muscle weakness by stopping and doing eye exercises first i would question why your mother is being given doses of the statin drug atorvastatin aka lipitor which is also a component of caduet she may be overdosed on the statin side although diplopia is more associated with the calcium channel blocker component of caduet amlodipine aka norvasc the risk here is rhabdomyolysis a painful breakdown of muscle tissue there are many alternative calcium channel blockers that can be tried including procardia and cardizem your physician hopefully should know the side effects for each Statin Atherosclerosis Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insulin Diabetes mellitus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Familial hypercholesterolemia Aortic dissection Cancer Paracetamol Myasthenia gravis Topiramate Calcium channel blocker Propranolol Myocardial infarction Medicine Stomach cancer Growth hormone treatment Diabetic neuropathy Urinary incontinence Rhabdomyolysis Pfizer Inc.
