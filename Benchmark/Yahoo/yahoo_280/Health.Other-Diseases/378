what are your migraine triggers the things that trigger migraines for me are paint fumes bright light i wear sunglasses most of the summer strongly flavoured cheese dark chocolate and stress i wish i knew i have woken up in the early hours of the morning with my flashing lights my migraines normally come in groups of three and i have over a large number of years tried to find what triggers them i had been going to a research centre where we logged everything we ate drink i did this for two years and could find no appreciable triggers from food many people blame foods as triggers however foods are not thought to be common triggers suspect a food as a trigger if a migraine occurs within six hours of eating it if a migraine often occurs after eating the suspected food and cutting out the food reduces the number of migraines some people need a combination of triggers to trigger a migraine for example some women may only get a migraine if they drink red wine and are having a period another example is that a food trigger may only trigger a migraine if you are also over tired or stressed Migraine Chronic fatigue syndrome Chocolate Urinary incontinence Meal Tyramine Fecal incontinence Roman eating and drinking French cuisine Multiple chemical sensitivity Breakfast Cluster headache Cuisine of Denmark Tooth Japanese tea ceremony Wine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Monosodium glutamate Sun Wood Customs and etiquette of Japan Welding Soft drink Korean cuisine Coffee Elephant Food Lamotrigine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Asthma Menstrual cycle Caffeine Neuralgia Hypoglycemia Healthy eating Chrono Trigger Cannabis (drug) Color blindness USS Trigger (SS-237) Coeliac disease Dairy German cuisine Food preservation Herpes simplex virus Plastic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Lightning Cuisine of Argentina Veganism Dream Theater Word of Wisdom Stone Age Vomiting Aliens of London Psychosis Humphrey Bogart Lucid dreaming Multiple sclerosis Sin City Rosacea Acne Cuisine of the Philippines Propranolol Cheese Pasteurization Daylight saving time In-N-Out Burger Mouth ulcer Mid-Autumn Festival Trailer Park Boys Diabetes mellitus Lupus erythematosus Tsunami Open cluster Brown Bear Carnivorous plant Kosher foods Internal ballistics Giraffe Foodborne illness Baldness Emergency contraception Spider Traffic light Tooth enamel Sunglasses Sonic the Hedgehog Cat Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Conker's Bad Fur Day Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Brazil Vulcan (Star Trek) Chicken Peanut
