could appendicitis be the cause of my stomach pain it's happened times in the past month i get extreme pain in my stomach that comes on slowly and escalates pretty badly it's happened at night each time and i eventually just have to go to bed because the pain is so bad the next morning the pain is gone this past time last night was the worst i was in tears and about to go to the hospital until i realized that curling up in a ball hurt worse than spreading out so i spread out and laid down and tried to press on my stomach to see if it hurt in certain spots more than others it was hard to tell this morning my stomach feels weird and a little sore like i did sit ups all night but the pain nausea is gone if you have appendicitis i was under the impression that the pain came and then it would eventually burst i didn't think that you could have been that would eventually subside and then may come back is this true any other explanations for my pain can't find any dietary factors that seem to be the link thanks also there is nausea almost to the point where i feel like i want to vomit but never actually vomiting my boyfriend suggested i might have to use the bathroom but it didn't feel like that i also didn't have gas or anything the next morning my poop was green and soft i don't know if that has anything to do with it or if it was just something i ate that did that also each time this has happened times over past couple of weeks it has gotten worse first time not so bad last night was very bad taking tums also does not seem to help please help there is a chance it could be your gall bladder i had gall stones didn't know it the attacks were horribly painful i thought it was in intestinal issue i have i would sometimes throw up and have diarrhea the next day the frequency varied but it actually went on for years before it got bad enough for me to go to the er you should see your doctor and discuss the symptoms if you have another one you could just go to the er and they could do the tests needed to diagnose you there good luck Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Babe Ruth Cancer EastEnders The Shining (film) Group A streptococcal infection Ebola Diarrhea Shaggy dog story Coeliac disease Myocardial infarction Migraine Milton H.
