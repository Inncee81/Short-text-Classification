malpractice do i have a solid case after giving birth to our third child i elected to have my tubes tied to make a long story short the doctor who performed the procedure tied and cut my renal artery rather than my falopian tube it was several hours before the problem was discovered he admitted that it was his fault and that he has no idea how he mistakenly cut the wrong thing although he admitted his mistake and corrected the problem can i still sue do i have a solid case i lost over units of blood was in icu for days and the recovery unit for another days i had exploratory surgery to find fix the mistake incision is not healing properly in my opinion this is an excellent example of what malpractice suits are intended to address while i'm sure it was not an intentional mistake the doctor showed gross negligence in cutting a major artery rather than your fallopian tube as with any malpractice suit you have to ask yourself what your goal is are you wanting to stick it to the establishment and get rich or are you mostly concerned about covering your current and future bills and maybe something for your pain and suffering in a case like this i would have no problem with taking the gloves off and going after whatever you can especially since this could have been a fatal mistake if it was me i would mainly be worried about my current and future medical bills rather than trying to get rich but i tend to be of the mind set that just because i can sue doesn't mean i should sue Medical malpractice Prostate cancer Myocardial infarction Aortic dissection Tort reform In vitro fertilisation Childbirth Stroke Spina bifida Medicine Terri Schiavo Adjustable gastric band Church of Christ, Scientist Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia Kidney Intensive care medicine Endometriosis Apollo 8 Caesarean section Ectopic pregnancy Software testing Kingdom Hospital John Edwards Tourniquet Folic acid Organ transplant Negligence Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Urinary incontinence EastEnders Renal cell carcinoma Theory of conduct Intersex surgery Angioplasty Abortion Syringomyelia Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Intact dilation and extraction Hillary Rodham Clinton Transsexuality Dissociative identity disorder Non-economic damages caps Terri Schiavo timeline Bush v.
