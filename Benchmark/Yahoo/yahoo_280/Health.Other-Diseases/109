is it possible for an infection after a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy even with antibotics i have been taking my antibotics after my surgery of t and a but in the back of my throat it is becoming green and there are huge bumps on my tongue and i'm wondering if i am over reacting or if i should get it checked right away sorry antibiotics spelled it wrong as a health therapist i always had advised my clients and patients to always let me know after the first day if there are any reactions with meds or surgery problems that they may have from their doctors if the meds are forcing your body to react to it for certain reasons you should just go back to your doctor to visit him and just let him know nicely that the medicine is incorrect see your doctor or physician that you had taken these meds from let them know the amount of time you had taken the meds and that what are your bodily functions like when you are on your meds and as well let the doctor know about the process since after your surgery you had hope that this helped Medicine Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer Traditional Chinese medicine Folic acid Traumatic brain injury Pneumonia Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Multiple sclerosis Alternative medicine Common cold Asthma Physical therapy Oral sex Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Malaria Physician Surgery Crohn's disease Cancer Ayurveda Rabies Medical prescription Obesity Tonsillectomy Osteopathy Dentistry Doctorate Adverse effect (medicine) Emergency department Orthopedic surgery Iatrogenic Blood Homeopathy Group A streptococcal infection History of medicine Tattoo Publicly funded medicine Hypoglycemia Avicenna Nutrition Epilepsy Hepatitis Cellulitis Sleep apnea Naturopathic medicine Medical school Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Psychiatry Stroke Dialysis Intensive care medicine Allergy Migraine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Blood transfusion Mesothelioma Infectious disease HIV Gastroparesis Charles Darwin's illness Natural health Radiation therapy Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Plastic surgery Insulin Cirrhosis Amiodarone LASIK Paracetamol History of intersex surgery Cytomegalovirus Coeliac disease Medical record Master's degree Osteoarthritis Multiple chemical sensitivity Diabetes mellitus Acne The Contender (television series) Colorectal cancer Medicare (Canada) Bill Frist Al-Razi Drowning National Health Service History of male circumcision Atherosclerosis Psychotherapy Nurse Chagas disease Medical analysis of circumcision Abortion
