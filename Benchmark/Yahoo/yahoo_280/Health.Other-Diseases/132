eating after food poisoning i don't know if it was food poisoning or what but i felt nauseous all last night from pmish til this morning then slept a couple of hours and don't feel nauseous do you think it would be okay to eat or is it still in my system usually it is wise to begin feeding your belly with liquids when you are overcoming a stomach ordeal try small sips of water gatorade soda for a half an hour and see how they sit don't try milk or juice right away because the clear liquids are easier to digest once you are fine with liquids you can have try crackers toast soup and gradually build up from there if you only felt nauseous and never threw up then you'll be fine today but if you were throwing up start slowly with the liquids as described i'd still suggest small amounts of food for today just to baby your belly back to health hope you're better Breakfast Chocolate Stomach cancer Soft drink Milk Fugu Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia Diarrhea Tofu Food Nutrition Tooth Cat Russian cuisine Fecal incontinence Drink Egg (food) Jewish cuisine Honey The Amber Spyglass Adjustable gastric band Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cheese Hamster Pancake Tea Snake Botulism Gastroparesis Foodborne illness Polychlorinated biphenyl Chicken soup Gastrointestinal tract Cuisine of Denmark Insomnia Guinea pig Sewage treatment Peanut Capercaillie Omega-3 fatty acid Coeliac disease Bread Raw food diet Vitamin C Soy milk Shaggy dog story Gastroesophageal reflux disease Soup Coffee Chernobyl accident Sugar beet Ice cream Fancy rat Aerial (dance move) Koala Binge eating disorder Suplex Vomiting Night (book) The Shining (film) Porridge Sauerkraut Spider Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rocko's Modern Life Stomach Termite Sugar Flatulence Ramen Cuisine of Brazil Tomato Bottlenose Dolphin Word of Wisdom Wine Comanche Rebreather Biscuit Milton H.
