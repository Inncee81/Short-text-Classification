i just had tests the doctor told me i may have a terminal disease i had some tests done yesturday but i don't know how to tell my family or even if i should should i wait for the results i'm not sleeping and if i tell them i could be worring them for nothing what should i do i'm really scared at this point it is may have if you have a sibling or someone you are close to who you could talk to them about your fears around this it might help you to sleep at night often just discussing our fears with someone can really help put things in perspective also even if you are told you do have a terminal illness don't let that deprive you of hope there are many people who are alive who have had terminal illnesses who miraculously recovered their health i agree it would be wise to wait to tell anyone who might become hysterical or interfering with your choices you don't want the added burden right now of having to take care of someone else's feelings and worries Prostate cancer Abortion debate Milton H.
