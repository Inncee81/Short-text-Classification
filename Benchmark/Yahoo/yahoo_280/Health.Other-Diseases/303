xanax for medical procedure can anyone give me any feed back on using xanax for a medical procedure my doc prescribed it because i am very anxious over a painful medical test i have to have i was under the impression that xanax is usually for generalised anxiety disorder i don't have generalised anxiety problems its just over this one test i had this test once before without a sedative and had a panic attack i am supposed to take one mg pill minutes prior and can repeat with a second dose if necessary any feedback on the meds would be appreciated geeze people i have only pills and will only take it for this one test i do not have a anxiety disorder anyone can get anxious over a painful medical test to the pharmacist that responded thank you so much i feel better about it now my husband will be driving me home it is very common for xanax to be prescribed for a medical procedure especially if you are known to be anxious the dose that you wrote is also the most common way to take it for a medical procedure it is perfectly acceptable to take this medication if you are nervous for a procedure it works in your brain to decrease this anxiety take the first dose as directed take the second dose if you still feel very anxious about your procedure while xanax can be used for generalized anxiety disorder it is more commonly used for acute anxiety as needed antidepressants such as paxil are more commonly used for generalized anxiety disorder the most common side effect of xanax is drowsiness so make sure somebody can drive you to the doctor's office hospital for your procedure while xanax can be addictive when taken for long periods of time it is highly unlikely that you would become addicted to this medication after taking pills for a procedure valium is also a benzodiazepine and works in exactly the same way as xanax it just stays in the body for a longer period of time it also has the same risk of addiction very unlikely when taking it for one procedure there is no reason to take valium over xanax as they are in the same class and work the same way Clinical depression Alprazolam Panic attack Antidepressant Clomipramine Maprotiline Addiction Drug addiction Opioid Doxepin Paroxetine Benzodiazepine Sedative Multiple sclerosis Bipolar disorder Anxiolytic Medicine Obsessive-compulsive disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chlorpromazine Trimipramine Methamphetamine Venlafaxine LSD Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Chronic fatigue syndrome Alcoholism Traumatic brain injury Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Paracetamol Anorexia nervosa Antipsychotic Prostate cancer Tianeptine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Haloperidol Cannabis (drug) Transsexuality Drug abuse Flunitrazepam Caffeine Pneumonia Epilepsy Folic acid Bupropion Electroconvulsive therapy Sleep Hypoglycemia St John's wort Hypnosis Psychopharmacology Buspirone Stuttering Medical prescription Propranolol Tobacco smoking Stroke Lorazepam Topiramate Diabetes mellitus Fluoxetine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Parkinson's disease Post-traumatic stress disorder Menstrual cycle Rabies Psychosis Narcolepsy Aspirin Controversies in autism Methylphenidate Controlled Substances Act Chlorprothixene Anticonvulsant Cocaine Withdrawal Lamotrigine Meditation Analgesic Chemical imbalance theory Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Buprenorphine Traditional Chinese medicine 5-HTP Tricyclic antidepressant Atherosclerosis Childbirth
