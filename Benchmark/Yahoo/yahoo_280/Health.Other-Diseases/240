any one know what the form of epilepsy that does not cause fits is called i believe it just causes changes to the mood that last for short periods of time but no fits anyone got this form or know about it i would be grateful for info thanks introduction epilepsy is a disorder that disrupts the transmission of electrical signals inside the brain although you may assume that epilepsy always causes episodes of uncontrolled movements and loss of consciousness the condition is actually quite variable symptom episodes known as seizures are often subtle causing strange sensations emotions and behavior some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds when having a seizure while others have full fledged convulsions about one in people in the united states has experienced an unprovoked seizure at some point in life however a solitary seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy many people for example children with high fevers experience one seizure and then never have another one but after you've had two seizures the chance that you'll have additional seizures increases dramatically at least two unprovoked seizures are required for a diagnosis of epilepsy the onset of epilepsy is most common during childhood and after age but the condition can occur at any age treatments may leave you free of seizures or at least reduce their frequency and intensity many children with epilepsy even outgrow the condition with age signs and symptoms because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in brain cells seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates a seizure can produce temporary confusion complete loss of consciousness a staring spell or uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure in most cases a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time so the symptoms will be very similar from episode to episode but some people have many different types of seizures with different symptoms each time doctors classify seizures as either partial or generalized based on how the abnormal brain activity begins when seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one part of the brain they're called partial or focal seizures seizures that seem to involve all of the brain are called generalized seizures in some cases seizures can begin in one part of the brain and then spread throughout the rest of the brain partial seizures simple partial seizures these seizures don't result in loss of consciousness they may alter emotions or change the way things look smell feel taste or sound complex partial seizures these seizures alter consciousness causing you to lose awareness for a period of time complex partial seizures often result in staring and nonpurposeful movements such as hand rubbing lip smacking arm positioning vocalization or swallowing generalized seizures absence seizures petit mal these seizures are characterized by staring subtle body movement and brief lapses of awareness myoclonic seizures these seizures usually appear as sudden jerks of your arms and legs atonic seizures also known as drop attacks these seizures cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down tonic clonic seizures grand mal the most intense of all types of seizures these are characterized by a loss of consciousness body stiffening and shaking and sometimes tongue biting or loss of bladder control Clinical depression Electroconvulsive therapy Diabetes mellitus Stroke Cancer Brain tumor Neurofeedback Schizophrenia Multiple sclerosis Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sleep Parkinson's disease Addiction Absence seizure Cerebral palsy Consciousness Autism Alcoholism Panic attack Chronic fatigue syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Migraine Asperger syndrome Action potential Syringomyelia Chlorpromazine Asthma Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Menstrual cycle Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Hypnosis Apoplexy Milton H.
