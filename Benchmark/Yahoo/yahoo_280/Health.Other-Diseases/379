acid reflux maybe i haven't been able to eat much more than a few bites for the past two weeks as well as not able to drink more than half a cup of water each day everytime i do i feel like soemthing is in my throat it feels like it's gagging me or my stomach gets upset like im going to throw up my mom thinks it's h pylori i went to the dr they scheduled me an endoscopy sp sept i can't go a whole month barely eating i hardly have any energy left just walking upstairs make my heart pound for about min does anyone know what this is or similiar or have any advice i havent taken any meds because i dont know what i have dont want to mess up my stomach throat even more should i try to find another dr that does endoscopy i was even thinking of going to the hospital for iv feeding but i dont think i'd be allowed to do that any advice or anything thanks for all the anwsers so far i talked with my mom and we're going to try to get them to schedule faster or find someone else she says i may have to go to my dr but i know that she won't be able to do anything about it as she's not a specialist she's my regualr dr and so far ive been eating ice cubes as it's not too much water and it's in small amounts ive also frozen gatorade and am eating those it seems a little strange to me that your doctor would let your endoscopy appointment be so far away when he she knows you have barely been eating or drinking i would've thought that he she would have tried to get you in as a priority if you want to you could try a second doctor and see what they say if your symptoms become severe you could go to the emergency room for treatment in which case if they fear you are becoming dehydrated they will give you an iv before you go run to another doctor or the emergency room why don't you pick up some tums or rolaids from the drugstore use those a little bit before you eat and see if it helps your symptoms i'm also quite surprised that your doctor didn't put you on a day trial of prevacid my mom had symptoms like this and her doctor put her on a day trial of prevacid she's been pretty much fine ever since and now her doctor writes a prescription for it anyways definitely try the tums rolaids before eating if this doesn't help see if you can find another doctor if you become severely ill and desperate pay a visit to your local emergency room also try drinking easier said than done i know more than of water if you become dehydrated you'll become very ill feeling and it could become potentially life threatening if not treated hope this helps feel better Stomach cancer Gastroesophageal reflux disease Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gastroparesis Diarrhea Coeliac disease Dehydration Breastfeeding RuneScape quests First aid Kodocha Theory of conduct Clinical depression Hyperthermia Fecal incontinence Pneumonia Bipolar disorder Milton H.
