does x rays cause any damage to you like lost cells or anythings like that list the things x rays will damage x ray dangers x rays are not the harmless miraculous health helps we used to think they were instead x rays are something many people will want to avoid unless absolutely necessary x rays are not the best diagnostic tool for all things how much radiation does a person receive in an average dental x ray here's a comparison measured in millirems the standard measure of radiation absorption by human cells in millirems flight from los angeles to paris cosmic rays millirems chest x ray l film millirems contamination mile from three mile island during nuclear accident millirems apollo x astronauts on moon flight cosmic rays millirems dental x ray whole mouth millirems on site dose at three mile island accident millirems breast mammography film millirems current n a s yearly occupational exposure accumulative limit is millirems it becomes questionable whether each visit to a docter dentist should be almost the equivalent of visiting a nuclear power plant during an accident or if it should use up almost one fifth of what the n a s considers a yearly maximum for folks working around radiation exposure to x rays leads to leukemia and other cancers long term exposure to even small levels of x rays may be hazardous x ray radiation is ionizing which means that it can create harmful free radical chemicals in the body these chemicals can mutate dna which can result in cancerous cells x rays are photons x ray radiation is not a persistent radiation that means that once the power is off the x rays are gone x rays cannot cause other objects to become radioactive it kills the heart and the blood vessels as far as the human body is concerned there are three systems which are affected by x rays first is the genitalia which if affected may have a negative effect on the progeny the other main system that is affected is the skin you can get a rash hair loss and apart from being cosmetically harmful they also predispose to cancer the third system that is affected is the blood if the red blood cells are affected then you can suffer from anaemia and if the white blood cells are affected they can attack your immune system and make you vulnerable to various diseases ionizing radiation dislocates electrons atoms h o radiation h o e oh h h oh h o early cell death inhibited cell division genetic modification of chromosomes the risks to a fetus from x rays fetuses are more susceptable than adults to the damaging effects of x rays partly because their cells are rapidly dividing and growing into specialized cells and tissues if x rays cause changes in these cells there is a slightly increased chance of birth defects or certain illnesses such as leukemia later in life however most birth defects and childhood diseases are not attributed to exposure to any known harmful agent during pregnancy damage to fetal cells may result in miscarriage birth defects or mental impairment depending on the amount of radiation and the stage of pregnancy the risks are higher during the first three months of pregnancy first trimester it is important to note that most of these effects do not usually occur below mgy more radiation than three pelvic ct scans or abdominal x rays there is an increased risk of childhood cancer from dna damage regardless of when in pregnancy the radiation occurred the risk is believed to be proportional to the amount of radiation i e the smaller the amount of radiation the smaller the risk of cancer most studies show no increase in childhood cancer from small amounts of radiation however one study identifies the chance of a childhood cancer from abdominal x rays in the mgy range at about one in births in comparison the chance of a childhood cancer in the general population is about two to three in births Poison Traumatic brain injury Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Herpes simplex virus Depleted uranium Nuclear explosion Carcinogenesis Asthma Growth hormone deficiency X-ray Nuclear technology Atherosclerosis Birth weight Breastfeeding Ovarian cancer Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Alzheimer's disease Decompression sickness Methamphetamine Human skin color Cytomegalovirus Ozone layer Twin Urinary incontinence Malaria Plutonium HIV Ataxia telangiectasia Omega-3 fatty acid Technetium Acne Ozone depletion Tooth enamel Insulin Thimerosal Malignant melanoma Sexual differentiation Schizophrenia Geomagnetic storm Background radiation Acute myelogenous leukemia Magnetic resonance imaging Ionosphere
