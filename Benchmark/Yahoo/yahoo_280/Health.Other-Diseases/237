what is avascular necrosis last year i had to have a total hip replacement due to avn but my surgeon was not giving me much info on the following questions can it spread i am now having pain in my lower back other hip and knee what treatment can be given less evasive the better as i have also got dilated cardiomyopathy and other illnesses will this affect me for the rest of my life finally what can i do myself to help my own body because of the avn serious answers only please many thanks ok i'm going to give you the run down on avn to help answer your question first as far as the spreading goes the pain you are suffering in your lower back hip and knee are most likely tied to the cartilidge in those areas not getting the blood it needs to keep it healthy i would recommend taking glucosimine chondroitine to help with lubricating said cartilidge as for the avn hopefully this will answer all of your treatment questions avascular necrosis avascular necrosis is a disease resulting from the temporary or permanent loss of the blood supply to the bones without blood the bone tissue dies and causes the bone to collapse if the process involves the bones near a joint it often leads to collapse of the joint surface this disease also is known as osteonecrosis aseptic necrosis and ischemic bone necrosis although it can happen in any bone avascular necrosis most commonly affects the ends epiphyses of long bones such as the femur the bone extending from the knee joint to the hip joint other common sites include the upper arm bone knees shoulders and ankles the disease may affect just one bone more than one bone at the same time or more than one bone at different times avascular necrosis usually affects people between and years of age about to people develop avascular necrosis each year orthopaedic doctors most often diagnose the disease the amount of disability that results from avascular necrosis depends on what part of the bone is affected how large an area is involved and how effectively the bone rebuilds itself the process of bone rebuilding takes place after an injury as well as during normal growth normally bone continuously breaks down and rebuilds old bone is reabsorbed and replaced with new bone the process keeps the skeleton strong and helps it to maintain a balance of minerals in the course of avascular necrosis however the healing process is usually ineffective and the bone tissues break down faster than the body can repair them if left untreated the disease progresses the bone collapses and the joint surface breaks down leading to pain and arthritis avascular necrosis affects both men and women and affects people of all ages it is most common among people in their thirties and forties depending on a person's risk factors and whether the underlying cause is trauma it also can affect younger or older people causes avascular necrosis has several causes loss of blood supply to the bone can be caused by an injury trauma related avascular necrosis or joint dislocation or by certain risk factors nontraumatic avascular necrosis such as some medications steroids blood coagulation disorders or excessive alcohol use increased pressure within the bone also is associated with avascular necrosis the pressure within the bone causes the blood vessels to narrow making it hard for the vessels to deliver enough blood to the bone cells injury when a joint is injured as in a fracture or dislocation the blood vessels may be damaged this can interfere with the blood circulation to the bone and lead to trauma related avascular necrosis studies suggest that this type of avascular necrosis may develop in more than of people who dislocate their hip joint steroid medications corticosteroids such as prednisone are commonly used to treat diseases in which there is inflammation such as systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease and vasculitis studies suggest that long term systemic oral or intravenous corticosteroid use is associated with of all cases of nontraumatic avascular necrosis however there is no known risk of avascular necrosis associated with the limited use of steroids patients should discuss concerns about steroid use with their doctor doctors aren't sure exactly why the use of corticosteroids sometimes leads to avascular necrosis they may interfere with the body's ability to break down fatty substances these substances then build up in and clog the blood vessels causing them to narrow this reduces the amount of blood that gets to the bone some studies suggest that corticosteroid related avascular necrosis is more severe and more likely to affect both hips when occurring in the hip than avascular necrosis resulting from other causes alcohol use excessive alcohol use and corticosteroid use are two of the most common causes of nontraumatic avascular necrosis in people who drink an excessive amount of alcohol fatty substances may block blood vessels causing a decreased blood supply to the bones that results in avascular necrosis other risk factors other risk factors or conditions associated with nontraumatic avascular necrosis include gaucher's disease pancreatitis radiation treatments and chemotherapy decompression disease and blood disorders such as sickle cell disease symptoms in the early stages of avascular necrosis patients may not have any symptoms as the disease progresses however most patients experience joint pain at first only when putting weight on the affected joint and then even when resting pain usually develops gradually and may be mild or severe if avascular necrosis progresses and the bone and surrounding joint surface collapse pain may develop or increase dramatically pain may be severe enough to limit the patient's range of motion in the affected joint in some cases particularly those involving the hip disabling osteoarthritis may develop the period of time between the first symptoms and loss of joint function is different for each patient ranging from several months to more than a year diagnosis after performing a complete physical examination and asking about the patient's medical history for example what health problems the patient has had and for how long the doctor may use one or more imaging techniques to diagnose avascular necrosis as with many other diseases early diagnosis increases the chances of treatment success x ray an x ray is a common tool that the doctor may use to help diagnose the cause of joint pain it is a simple way to produce pictures of bones the x ray of a person with early avascular necrosis is likely to be normal because x rays are not sensitive enough to detect the bone changes in the early stages of the disease x rays can show bone damage in the later stages and once the diagnosis is made they are often used to monitor the course of the condition magnetic resonance imaging mri mri is quickly becoming a common method for diagnosing avascular necrosis unlike x rays bone scans and ct computed computerized tomography scans mri detects chemical changes in the bone marrow and can show avascular necrosis in its earliest stages mri provides the doctor with a picture of the area affected and the bone rebuilding process in addition mri may show diseased areas that are not yet causing any symptoms bone scan also known as bone scintigraphy bone scans are used most commonly in patients who have normal x rays a harmless radioactive dye is injected into the affected bone and a picture of the bone is taken with a special camera the picture shows how the dye travels through the bone and where normal bone formation is occurring a single bone scan finds all areas in the body that are affected thus reducing the need to expose the patient to more radiation bone scans do not detect avascular necrosis at the earliest stages computed computerized tomography ct scan a ct scan is an imaging technique that provides the doctor with a three dimensional picture of the bone it also shows slices of the bone making the picture much clearer than x rays and bone scans some doctors disagree about the usefulness of this test to diagnose avascular necrosis although a diagnosis usually can be made without a ct scan the technique may be useful in determining the extent of bone damage biopsy a biopsy is a surgical procedure in which tissue from the affected bone is removed and studied although a biopsy is a conclusive way to diagnose avascular necrosis it is rarely used because it requires surgery functional evaluation of bone tests to measure the pressure inside a bone may be used when the doctor strongly suspects that a patient has avascular necrosis despite normal results of x rays bone scans and mris these tests are very sensitive for detecting increased pressure within the bone but they require surgery treatments appropriate treatment for avascular necrosis is necessary to keep joints from breaking down if untreated most patients will experience severe pain and limitation in movement within years several treatments are available that can help prevent further bone and joint damage and reduce pain to determine the most appropriate treatment the doctor considers the following aspects of a patient's disease the age of the patient the stage of the disease early or late the location and amount of bone affected a small or large area the underlying cause of avascular necrosis with an ongoing cause such as corticosteroid or alcohol use treatment may not work unless use of the substance is stopped the goal in treating avascular necrosis is to improve the patient's use of the affected joint stop further damage to the bone and ensure bone and joint survival to reach these goals the doctor may use one or more of the following treatments conservative treatment medicines to reduce fatty substances lipids that increase with corticosteroid treatment or to reduce blood clotting in the presence of clotting disorders nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs may also be prescribed to reduce pain reduced weight bearing if avascular necrosis is diagnosed early the doctor may begin treatment by having the patient remove weight from the affected joint the doctor may recommend limiting activities or using crutches in some cases reduced weight bearing can slow the damage caused by avascular necrosis and permit natural healing when combined with medication to reduce pain reduced weight bearing can be an effective way to avoid or delay surgery for some patients range of motion exercises may be prescribed to maintain or improve joint range of motion electrical stimulation to induce bone growth conservative treatments have been used experimentally alone or in combination however these treatments rarely provide lasting improvement therefore most patients will eventually need surgery to repair the joint permanently surgical treatment core decompression this surgical procedure removes the inner layer of bone which reduces pressure within the bone increases blood flow to the bone and allows more blood vessels to form core decompression works best in people who are in the earliest stages of avascular necrosis often before the collapse of the joint this procedure sometimes can reduce pain and slow the progression of bone and joint destruction in these patients osteotomy this surgical procedure reshapes the bone to reduce stress on the affected area there is a lengthy recovery period and the patient's activities are very limited for to months after an osteotomy this procedure is most effective for patients with advanced avascular necrosis and those with a large area of affected bone bone graft a bone graft may be used to support a joint after core decompression bone grafting is surgery that transplants healthy bone from one part of the patient such as the leg to the diseased area commonly grafts called vascular grafts that include an artery and veins are used to increase the blood supply to the affected area there is a lengthy recovery period after a bone graft usually from to months this procedure is complex and its effectiveness is not yet proven clinical studies are underway to determine its effectiveness arthroplasty total joint replacement total joint replacement is the treatment of choice in late stage avascular necrosis and when the joint is destroyed in this surgery the diseased joint is replaced with artificial parts it may be recommended for people who are not good candidates for other treatments such as patients who do not do well with repeated attempts to preserve the joint various types of replacements are available and people should discuss specific needs with their doctor for most people with avascular necrosis treatment is an ongoing process doctors may first recommend the least complex and invasive procedure such as protecting the joint by limiting movement and watch the effect on the patient's condition other treatments then may be used to prevent further bone destruction and reduce pain it is important that patients carefully follow instructions about activity limitations and work closely with their doctor to ensure that appropriate treatments are used as for the dilated cardiomyopathy cardiomyopathy dilated definition dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the heart becomes weakened and enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently the decreased heart function can affect the lungs liver and other body systems there are several different types of cardiomyopathy dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form there are many causes of dilated cardiomyopathy they may include nutritional deficiencies valvular heart disease anemia stress viral infections rare alcoholism alcoholic cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease dilated cardiomyopathy occurs in an estimated out of people it can affect anyone of any age although it is most common in adult men risk factors include obesity cocaine use a personal or family history of cardiac disorders such as myocarditis and alcoholism symptoms swelling of feet and ankles swelling of the abdomen pronounced neck veins loss of appetite shortness of breath especially with activity shortness of breath which occurs after lying down for a while fatigue weakness faintness sensation of feeling the heart beat palpitations pulse may feel irregular or rapid decreased alertness or concentration cough low urine production need to urinate at night note symptoms of heart failure often develop gradually some chest pain may also be associated with this disease signs and tests cardiomyopathy is usually discovered on examination and testing for the cause of heart failure tapping the area with the fingers and feeling the area may indicate enlargement of the heart listening to the chest with a stethoscope reveals lung crackles heart murmur or other abnormal sounds the liver may be enlarged neck veins may be distended heart enlargement congestion of the lungs decreased movement functioning of the heart or heart failure may show on echocardiogram chest x ray chest ct scan cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography nuclear heart scan muga rnv an ecg may show conduction disturbances or arrhythmias and may indicate enlargement of the ventricles heart biopsy may be helpful to distinguish dilated cardiomyopathy from other diseases lab tests vary depending on the suspected cause treatment the patient may need to stay in the hospital until acute symptoms start to go away treatment is focused on relief of symptoms digitalis vasodilators drugs that dilate blood vessels ace inhibitors diuretics water pills nutritional supplements and other medications may be prescribed to reduce symptoms the underlying cause should be treated some patients may require a biventricular pacemaker an implantable defibrillator may also be needed to correct any severe arrhythmias abnormal heart rhythms a biventricular pacemaker with defibrillation capabilities is available a low salt diet may be prescribed and fluid may be restricted in some cases the patient can usually continue their regular activities if tolerated daily monitoring of body weight may be advised weight gain of or pounds or more over or days may indicate fluid accumulation smoking and drinking alcohol may worsen the symptoms if the heart function remains poor a heart transplant may be considered expectations prognosis the outcome varies some patients remain in a stable condition for long periods some continue to get gradually sicker and others quickly get worse cardiomyopathy can only be corrected if the underlying disease can be cured complications congestive heart failure arrhythmias pulmonary edema side effects of medications including low blood pressure lightheadedness and fainting lupus reaction a group of symptoms including a skin rash and arthritis headache gastrointestinal upset calling your health care provider call your health care provider if you have symptoms of cardiomyopathy if chest pain palpitations or faintness develop seek emergency medical treatment immediately prevention eat a well balanced and nutritious diet exercise to improve heart fitness stop smoking and minimize alcohol consumption i hope this information can shed some light on your questions best of luck and you will be in my prayers
