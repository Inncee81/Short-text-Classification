digestive problems im for about a year now i've been having problems with my digestive tract well i'm not even sure if it has to do with my digestive tract i've been to the hospital about times within the year of this problem for the same problem and they keep writing it off as a peptic ulcer but things just dont add up when they prescribed antacids pepcid zantac it would make me feel better for about weeks and then it would make me feel even sicker than before so i'd stop taking them i would then get better and it would stop for i'd say about maybe weeks and then the symptoms would come back my symptoms are about minutes into eating something my stomach would feel like it was on fire as though i'd had eaten glass i'd have to drink something to dull the pain then around the time i'd be going to bed my stomach would start hurting as though someone had stabbed me then i'd feel severly nauseause as though ready to vomit i'd then break out into a cold sweat sorry they only allowed me a certain amount of space so i will continue after the cold sweat i'd start burping as though i'd have drank a glass of soda i'd still feel very nauseouse sorry i always have trouble spelling that i would be up all night and then when morning came i couldnt stay awake any longer and i'd fall asleep and then when i'd wake up i think that i'm better but as soon as i would eat something the process repeated itself all over again when i'd go to the hospital they did an ultrasound and said nothing was there that they could see did blood work so the first time they said gastroentiris gave me some zantac and sent me home second time they did blood work took a pregnancy test see what use that'll do i'm not sexually active and told me peptic ulcer deisease i believe it has something to do with my stress but yet when i'm calm and happy i still get sick ive missed school so much that i've been held back also i forgot to mention that i become very constipated when this happens and the hospital has never checked me for h pylori they would always tell me when i went to the hospital to keep on a bland diet ive been on a bland diet for over a year now the one thing thats really gets me is i havent losed large amounts of weight maybe pounds at the most i dont eat spicy foods anymore i havent drank soda in over years i drink water green tea and fruit juices but mostly water ive tried so many things with my diet but nothing works ive even tried just saltines for a whole day to see if the way i was eating was the matter but id still get sick also my uncle who doesnt live with me is showing the same symptoms and signs as me and it seem we both start feeling better get worse comes back both at the same time wow so young to be experiencing such pains ailments things your doctor won't tell you is the fact that down in your stomach there supposed to be millions of benefitial bacteria that exist live there soley fro the purpose of breaking down helping you to properly digest your food for some reason these bacteria are probably dead in your stomach no longer performing thier natural function the doctor may give you a little something to treat the syptoms that your experiencing but he will do nothing in the way of leading you to actually heal the problem he makes his fortune in life by showing you how to live with your ailment by the use of the pharmacudical drugs that he wants to sell you now you may begin to resupply your body very slowy by eating digesting fermented foods such as greens sour kraut things like this your health food store provider will be able to help make the right choses for you you will not be able to simply grab a pill filled with these living bacteria ingest them most of them would simply be washed directly through your system the process must be done naturally just as your food would be digested if you don't get this situation took care of soon you'll be a miserable wretch in just a few years it'll take just that much longer to get things right again Urinary incontinence Medicine Peptic ulcer Fecal incontinence Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Foodborne illness Crohn's disease Pneumonia Breastfeeding Vitamin C Veganism Adjustable gastric band Insomnia Cancer Cirrhosis Helicobacter pylori Stomach Fugu Insulin Coeliac disease Mouth ulcer Gastroparesis Coffee Gastrointestinal tract Traumatic brain injury Folic acid Psoriasis Tocopherol Medical prescription Chocolate Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Nutrition Alcoholic beverage The Amber Spyglass Pregnancy Cheese Ulcerative colitis Diarrhea Food Milk Anorexia nervosa Babe Ruth Alcoholism Bread Common cold Episodes of Lost (Season 1) First aid Sewage treatment Gastric acid Dietary fiber Dieting Caffeine Osteoarthritis Botulism Kodocha Hamster Tea Childbirth Heartburn Paracetamol Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anxiety Migraine Myocardial infarction Milton H.
