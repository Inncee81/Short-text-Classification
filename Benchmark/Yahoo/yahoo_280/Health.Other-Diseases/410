should marijana be legal i believe it should im seeing all of these petitions around the internet trying to make weed legal one idea i saw was make weed legal just like alcahol only ppl years or older are aloud to buy it and can only have a maximum of oz on them i think its not a bad idea it would probably generate some revenue into the economy of course it should it would be taxed like cigarettes and alcohol and no one would be taking the risk of getting tainted weed the drug dealer would be out of the marijuana picture marijuana helps with conditions such as anxiety aggression anorexia arthritis aids cancer chemo therapy nausea vomiting insomnia etc it does not damage the liver as alcohol and most prescription meds do no one has ever died of an od of marijuana you would need to eat more than your body weight to do so and even then i don't think it would happen weed mellows people out unlike coke meth crack etc which makes people aggressive people worried about lung cancer don't need to smoke weed they can vaporize it our government is highly unlikely to decriminalize weed as it would ruin the alcohol tobacco and pharmeucital industries industrial hemp would ruin the forestry paper industry along with the textile industry etc Cannabis (drug) Medical cannabis Illegal drug trade Tobacco smoking Arguments for and against drug prohibition Cigarette Cocaine Methamphetamine Legal issues of cannabis Hemp Health issues and the effects of cannabis Cancer Lung cancer Paracetamol Anorexia nervosa Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Bupropion Stomach cancer Folic acid Traumatic brain injury Psoriasis Prostate cancer Recreational drug use Haloperidol Drug abuse Controlled Substances Act Alcoholism Clinical depression Lorazepam Word of Wisdom Aspartame Doxepin Opioid Medicine Hypertension Diazepam Cannabinoids Panic attack Dioxin Economy of Norway Coffee Acupuncture Narcotic Nicotine Chlorpromazine Publicly funded medicine Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Tobacco advertising Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Trazodone Economy of the United States Gout Migraine Vomiting Anxiety Hashish Insomnia Caffeine Health insurance Consensual crime Addiction Stroke Alcoholic beverage Radiation therapy Tetrahydrocannabinol Post-traumatic stress disorder Drug addiction Tocopherol Bong Economy of the Central African Republic Radiation poisoning Rabies Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Smoking pipe Black market Charles Darwin's illness Mesothelioma Rheumatoid arthritis Peter McWilliams Hypoglycemia Agriculture Clomipramine Duesberg hypothesis Marijuana parties Adjustable gastric band Coeliac disease Parkinson's disease Anesthesia Ionizing radiation First aid
