do people with autism know that they are different just curious i'm interested in a lot of different disablities and conditions and also why are most autistic people males i think it has to do with the xy chromosome because u only need one trait of autism to get it if u are a guy and if u are a girl u need i've recently been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder pdd nos to be exact at years of age while growing up i was being bullied at school verbally and by being excluded from games and stuff i'd say that was a fair hint that i was somewhat different i just didn't understand what was so different about me i tend to say that i don't see myself as i do things so if i do something weird i usually don't notice unless someone points it out so i'd say that yes people with autism may realise they are different depending on the severity of their condition they just might not realise entirely what makes them different also i'm a girl as you may have guessed from the avatar i never realised there were more male autists than female so i wouldn't know why that is but i suppose your explanation with the chromosomes is as good as any alternatively maybe it manifests itself more clearly in males or maybe girls just aren't diagnosed as often and there's just as many of us but most don't know i wouldn't know i'm not an expert but i suppose it is a possibility especially as i myself have been diagnosed rather late jo Autism Controversies in autism Autistic community Autistic spectrum Autism epidemic Autism rights movement Autistic culture Pervasive developmental disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Speculation of famous people who might have autism Ethical challenges to autism treatment Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Neurodiversity Rain Man Color blindness Refrigerator mother Neurotypical Dyslexia Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Autistic savant Stuttering Species Thimerosal Simon Baron-Cohen Autistic enterocolitis Cancer Homosexuality and transgender Sensory Integration Dysfunction Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Facilitated communication Intelligence quotient Coeliac disease Bernard Rimland Generation Rescue Adult attention-deficit disorder Social rule Schizophrenia High-Functioning Autism Bipolar disorder Cephalic disorder Philosophical skepticism Stewie Griffin Procrastination X chromosome History of intersex surgery Andrew Wakefield Disability Auditory processing disorder Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Left-handed Obsessive-compulsive disorder Aspies For Freedom Eugenics The New School at West Heath Alzheimer's disease M.I.N.D.
