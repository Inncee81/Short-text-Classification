i have a multinodule goiter why do i have this and why does it continue to grow i have had biospy done it is benien my tsh was and my t and t were in the high end of the normal range i am a fifth generation woman to have a goiter in my family i am a years old female i am trying to figure out why this runs so heavily in my family and by the way my family has a history of autoimmune disease such as r a and reiter's syndrome i am the first to have reiter's syndrome in my family and so on i am trying to make since of all of this since my goiter continues to grow i am having another ultrasound next tuesday i live in the us so iodine is not the issue there has to be a reason even a hidden one because this goiter issue just runs to hard on the family to be just simple gentics except maybe a certain thyroid or pitutary disease from what you wrote i guess you've already read extensively regarding multinodular goitre mng and other autoimmune diseases all i can tell you is this the more it runs in the family the more likely that this is due to genetics autoimmune diseases have a tendency to occur together ie if you have grave's disease there's a higher likelihood that you'll have other autoimmune problems like reiter's and ra my advice is for you not to search too hard for some other cause of the hereditary mng it may be difficult for you to blame it all on genetics but that's the way it is besides iodine you should ask your doctor about other alternatives many centres in the world will offer a total thyroidectomy for mngs that continue increasing in size as there is a possibility that one of the nodules may turn malignant in the future the downside of surgery is that you'll have to be on thyroid replacement medication for life on the other hand radioactive iodine can sometimes make one more prone to cancer and will also eventually lead to hypothyroidism and need for thyroid replacement Thyroid cancer Graves-Basedow disease Thyroid Autoimmune diseases Hyperthyroidism Cancer Hypothyroidism Turner syndrome Coeliac disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cirrhosis Hearing impairment Congenital hypothyroidism Colorectal cancer Ionizing radiation Chernobyl accident Prostate cancer Endocrinology Anemia Radiation therapy Hepatitis Chronic fatigue syndrome Aortic dissection Ovarian cancer Breast cancer Stomach cancer Endometriosis Reiter's syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome Thyroid hormone Multiple sclerosis Cephalic disorder Hypoglycemia Medicine Down syndrome Rheumatoid arthritis Cryptorchidism Edible salt Addison's disease Malignant melanoma Hypertension Chemotherapy Liver Obesity Esophageal cancer Abortion Fibromyalgia Infertility Growth hormone deficiency Human cloning AIDS Myasthenia gravis Nutrition Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome PNG Growth hormone treatment Intersex surgery Bipolar disorder Stroke Traumatic brain injury Potassium iodide Mesothelioma Autism DNA repair Angioedema Arthritis Acne Soft tissue sarcoma Radioactive contamination Bone marrow transplant Amiodarone Pulmonary embolism Von Willebrand disease Prenatal diagnosis Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Hypopituitarism Obstetrics Psoriasis CPU cache Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Shetland Sheepdog Epilepsy Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Oncology Autism epidemic Sickle-cell disease Osteoporosis Iodine
