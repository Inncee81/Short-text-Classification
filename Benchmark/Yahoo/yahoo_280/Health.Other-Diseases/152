blood in stool and other digestive problems ive recently been having to go to the bathroom more frequently lately like times a day sometimes usually the stool is either soft or kinda hardish soft lol i know it sounds nasty but just being honest anyways ive also been farting alot and then this morning when i took a crap there was blood on the poop and a lil bit after i wiped what could this be you must go to the doctor immediately you may be allergic to something which is not dangerous but and this is important blood in stool is always a signal to see a doctor it may just be a warning but pay attention you should get a colonoscopy this is a procedure where you are mildly sedated and the gastro enterologist inserts a thin really thin tube with a tiny camera into the colon via the rectum do not be embarrassed this is a relatively painless procedure less than a headache but it is incredibly important there have been cases where young people say years old have had colonoscopies and it was discovered that they had polyps small to medium sized little bumps on the colon walls the doctor just snips them off no pain but if these polyps do not get removed they may eventually break through the colon wall and then you are in real and serious trouble many people's lives have been saved by this simple procedure many people don't get a colonoscopy because they are too embarrassed to do it this you must get over if it is the case with you not getting this treated could kill you look at tony snow the white house press officer he has had colon cancer twice you do not want to risk this happening to you go now please save your life the physician might also try to find out why you are having so much gas in your body do you use aspartame or other artificial sweeteners the ingredients in these sweeteners sometimes cause trouble in the bowel as the ingredient sorbitol causes water to be drawn from the body quickly resulting in loose stool and gas other possibilities are allergies to gluten a wheat or maybe lactose a milk ingredient these are all controllable with changes in the diet the blood though is the most important symptom do not ignore this situation colon cancer is a terrible nightmare and death from such a disease is a horror show get to a doctor and very good luck to you Crohn's disease Hemorrhoid Coeliac disease Colonoscopy Cancer Urinary incontinence Diarrhea Prostate cancer Sugar substitute Irritable bowel syndrome Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Folic acid Stomach cancer Flatulence Dietary fiber Chronic fatigue syndrome Food allergy Virtual colonoscopy Ebola Endometrial cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Constipation Gastroesophageal reflux disease Stroke Adjustable gastric band Mouth ulcer Milk Hirschsprung's disease Medicine Eczema Tocopherol Vegetarianism Pneumonia Lactose intolerance Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Familial adenomatous polyposis Acting President of the United States Traumatic brain injury Sento Toilet humour Hamster Malaria Acne Bread Multiple chemical sensitivity Soft drink Food Hay fever Clomipramine Colony in Space Mesothelioma Schistosomiasis Decompression sickness Doxepin Japanese toilet Hypoglycemia Ileostomy Barium enema Laxative Childbirth Saccharin Jam (TV series) Pitaten Soft tissue sarcoma Allergy Migraine Enema Healthy eating Multiple sclerosis Coffee Radiation therapy Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Menstrual cup Aortic dissection Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Caves of Androzani AIDS Ovarian cancer Diabetic retinopathy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Endometriosis Abortion Group A streptococcal infection Gastroparesis Sugar Glycogen storage disease type I Hypertension
