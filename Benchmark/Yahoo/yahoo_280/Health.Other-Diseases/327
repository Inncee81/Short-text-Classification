red green colorblind toddler my son is nearly and he is above average in most things like numbers letters etc however he knows all his colors but can not seem to tell the difference between red and green at all everything red is green to him i should add that my own grandfather had red green color blindness and it was only detected when he tried to join the navy in wwii when he was the other thing i wonder about is if he is when he sees grass how does that appear to him if color blind any thoughts opinions etc much appreciated thanks he's going to the eye doctor on tuesday he loves purple and talks about purple a lot but if you line colors up he names every one correctly except red which he says is green without fail i didn't know i was red green color blind until i joined the army the way it works is when the colors are close together they blend for example if a traffic light was lit up at the same time green and red i would not be able to tell which color was which but since they are occuring at seperate times they are distinct then the grass should look green Color blindness Color Traffic light Georges-Pierre Seurat Dragon Booster Rayleigh scattering Synaesthesia Camouflage Beret Light-emitting diode Color theory Purple Eye Colours, standards and guidons Eye color Color vision Rainbow Traffic sign Wassily Kandinsky New York City Subway nomenclature RGB color model BZFlag Logo CIE 1931 color space Link (Legend of Zelda) Lightsaber Unreal Stereoscopy Primary color Color space Shaggy dog story Billiards Green Teletubbies The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Peafowl Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Mnemonic Pixel Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Heterochromia Red state vs. blue state divide Negima Red Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion MBTA nomenclature PNG Tag Timeline of alternative rock The Red Green Show Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Cube (film) Wallpaper group Bicycle lighting Railway signalling Liturgical year W.I.T.C.H.
