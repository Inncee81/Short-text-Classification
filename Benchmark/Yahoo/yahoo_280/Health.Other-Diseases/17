appoinment with surgeon for gallstones okay i've been diagnosed with gallstones i made a follow up appointment with a surgeon to see what i have to do about them but i was wondering what should i expect at this appointment is he going to just talk to me and tell me about it or will there be some kind of exam don't believe the person who said their gall stones were dissolved by pills this is impossible when you see the surgeon he will probably just do a verbal history stuff like what kind of pain you had where the pain is or was was it after eatting a particularly fatty meal she he may do an exam of palpating your tummy but there should be no invasive exams believe me you want to deal with this gall stones can get out of the gallbladder and cause an obstruction and you don't want pancreatitis Gallstone Gallbladder Abdominal pain Cholecystectomy Acute pancreatitis Stomach cancer Obesity Ovarian cancer Deep vein thrombosis Bile Vitamin Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gynaecology Cancer Medicine Kidney stone Hepatitis Pneumonia Lithotomy Physical examination Cholesterol John Ashcroft Gastroparesis Surgery Fecal incontinence Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pancreatic cancer Colorectal cancer The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Insulin Abdominal examination Coffee Utilitarianism Intussusception Cholecystokinin Liver Gerund Cystic fibrosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bowel obstruction Sickle-cell disease Urinary incontinence Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Atherosclerosis Terri Schiavo Transsexuality Breast cancer Crohn's disease Decompression sickness Acromegaly Hamburger Paget's disease of bone Endoscopy Dyslexia Rich Mullins Fatty acid Cirrhosis Obstetrics Jaundice Slander and libel Carl Peter Thunberg Milton H.
