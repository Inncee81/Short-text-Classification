do kidney transplant patients always have to take predinsone if they do not have an exact match donor i received a new kidney about months ago i am very happy i am just curious if patients are ever taken off prednisone afterward if they did not receive the kidney from an exact match donor i am just wondering if i will have to take this drug my entire life i have already gained pounds in months i am worried how much i would gain if i remain on this drug for many years i only take mg once a day my kidney did not come from anyone related to me and was not a perfect genetic match i was told i will have to take anti rejection medications for the rest of my life i guess i am just hoping maybe i might be lucky enough not to have to take this one medication predinsone due to the weight gain issue prednisone is a corticosteroid that helps prevent and treat rejection of transplanted organs it may be used for long term perhaps lifetime immunosuppression or in higher doses for treatment of rejection the dosage however differs from patient to patient your nephrologists will determine when and if you may stop prednisone if you are on other immunosuppressants like prograf and myfortic cellcept as commonly is the case your doctor might taper off the prednisone over a period of time taking a patient off prednisone results in severe withdrawal symptoms and hence the patient needs to be taken off gently over a couple of months weight gain is a common problem this is because the drug changes the way fat is spread around the body in my case i was on mg of prednisone for a couple of months had a living related donor and then was taken off it by reducing the dosage mg over a couple of months while i was on prednisone i developed the classic moon face it took months after stopped dosage for my face to shrink back i would suggest that you speak to your nephrologist about your concern he is really the best person on advising you the head of the transplant clinic where i am treated once told me that the best results for sustaining a graft is received by a combination of drugs one being prednisone it is very important that you control your weight gain so please try please follow a low fat food regimen and exercise walking walks wonders i am on such a diet exercise plan ever since my transplant i did not lose any weight but did not gain any either good luck Folic acid Chemotherapy Crohn's disease Prostate cancer Asthma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Clinical depression Hypertension National Kidney Foundation Singapore Stomach cancer Rabies Radiation therapy Urinary incontinence Dialysis Lupus erythematosus Diabetes mellitus Migraine Psoriasis Bipolar disorder Cancer Antiretroviral drug Tocopherol Immunosuppressive drug Growth hormone treatment Glucocorticoid Aspergillosis Chlorpromazine Kidney Obesity Antidepressant Paget's disease of bone Cytomegalovirus Atkins Nutritional Approach Paracetamol Hypoglycemia Dieting Osteoarthritis Addiction Ulcerative colitis Nephrology Opioid Anorexia nervosa Health insurance Weight training Multiple myeloma Turner syndrome COX-2 inhibitor Doxepin Organ donation Multiple sclerosis Breast cancer Tuberculosis Antipsychotic Sildenafil IgA nephropathy Hepatitis C Kidney transplantation Colorectal cancer Alcoholism Parkinson's disease Malaria Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Stem cell Pneumonia Drug abuse Osteoporosis Alternative medicine Vitamin C HIV test Buprenorphine Stroke Leukemia Shock Trimipramine Diabetic nephropathy Cirrhosis Human cloning Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Epilepsy Duesberg hypothesis Clomipramine Polycystic ovary syndrome Radiation poisoning Lung cancer Alzheimer's disease Kaposi's sarcoma Cystic fibrosis Adjustable gastric band Diazepam Myasthenia gravis Emergency contraception
