can someone who is on blood thinner still have a blood clot that causes a tia although anticoagulants are often called blood thinners they do not really thin blood warfarin prevents the production of certain proteins that are necessary for blood to clot heparin and newer low molecular weight heparins interfere with the complex process of blood clot formation heparin and warfarin prevent new clots from forming and may prevent existing clots from getting larger they do not break up clots anticoagulants should only be used when a blood clot is suspected of causing the stroke or transient ischemic attack tia because anticoagulants increase your chance of bleeding you need to have regular blood tests to monitor blood clotting time while taking these medications some safety tips when taking anticoagulants may be helpful such as taking your medications at the same time each day and watching for signs of bleeding so the answer is yes esp if a person on blood thinner such as coumadin eats iron rich foods e g spinach making the blood thinner ineffective Stroke Pulmonary embolism Coagulation Warfarin Myocardial infarction Atrial fibrillation Deep vein thrombosis Blood plasma Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Antiphospholipid syndrome Atherosclerosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Aspirin Low molecular weight heparin Subdural hematoma Tocopherol Hemorrhagic stroke Thrombocytopenia Folic acid Cardiovascular disease Blood pressure Transient ischemic attack Apoplexy Blood Blood transfusion Menstrual cycle Atrial septal defect Malaria Stomach cancer Coronary heart disease Dieting Vacutainer Intracranial pressure Cirrhosis Prothrombin time Urinary incontinence Mesothelioma Cancer Oral contraceptive Nutrition Prostate cancer Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Ximelagatran Anemia Intravenous therapy Dialysis Haemophilia Natt__ Aphasia Thrombolytic drug Knife Crohn's disease Wound healing phases Thrombophlebitis Insulin Needle aspiration biopsy Psoriasis Cryonics Multiple sclerosis Veganism Enzyme Complete blood count Paracetamol Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Glycogen storage disease type I Ischaemic heart disease Vitamin C Platelet Atheroma Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Von Willebrand disease Pharmacology Origin of life Angioplasty Hip fracture Migraine First aid Cephalexin Hematophagy Disseminated intravascular coagulation Hemoglobin D-dimer Lung cancer Amiodarone Androgen insensitivity syndrome Aortic dissection Automated analyser Drowning
