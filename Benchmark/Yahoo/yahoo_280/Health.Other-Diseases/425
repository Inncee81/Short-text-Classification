what are bone bleeds my aunt has bone bleeds in her skull never heard of it bone is a living vascular organ containing channels for blood and bone marrow when a bone is cut during surgery bleeding can be a difficult problem to control especially in the highly vascular bones of the spine and sternum bleeding from soft tissue is normally stopped using a cautery that creates heat causing blood vessels to collapse and become sealed since the blood in living bone flows through channels in the bone that do not collapse a cautery is not effective in preventing bone bleeding blocking the holes in the bone typically stops bone bleeding this can be done by mechanically blocking the holes tamponade effect or by inducing a blood clot to form in the past the easiest and most common way to stop bone bleeding was to apply bone wax which is made from beeswax the bone wax is smeared across the bleeding edge of the bone blocking the holes and causing immediate hemostasis because of the complications associated with the use of bone wax newer water soluble hemostatic agents such as those made from alkylene oxide copolymers have been developed hope this helps all the best to you and your aunt Traumatic brain injury Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Stroke Leukemia Stomach cancer Blood Bone marrow transplant Platelet Bleeding Chemotherapy Knife Coagulation Anemia Terminal ballistics Tourniquet Medicine Intracranial pressure Casting Bone fracture Atherosclerosis Blood vessel Shock Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Paget's disease of bone Aortic dissection Cephalic disorder Blood pressure Bone Childbirth First aid Wound healing phases Circulatory system Cirrhosis Bong Drill bit Crohn's disease Biomechanics Autopsy Hip fracture Paracetamol Subdural hematoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Endometriosis Human physiology Atheroma Atrial septal defect Hemorrhagic stroke Puberty Acne Apoplexy Intravenous therapy Thermostat Carburetor Turner syndrome Head Tyrannosaurus rex Myelodysplastic syndrome Myocardial infarction Black hole Decompression sickness Penis Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) Menstrual cycle Prostate cancer Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Glass Corrosion Lung Diabetes mellitus Pressure point Wisdom teeth Gramophone record Cardiovascular disease Insulin Tuberculosis Orthopedic surgery Nitrous oxide Mesothelioma Equine conformation Bruise Sternum Plastic Thrombocytopenia Acute respiratory distress syndrome Sickle-cell disease Human skeleton Bloodletting Ceramics
