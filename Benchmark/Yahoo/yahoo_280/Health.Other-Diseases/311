poison question for a book i'm writing any nurses doctors pharmacists out there writing is my hobby i've got a howdunit book on poisons but i'm still having trouble coming up with the right method of poisoning i need for a murder mystery i'm writing nothing i have read about has fit my needs perfectly yet so any suggestions would be appreciated here are the specifics the poison would need to conform to an older person with health problems might have a perscription with enough of the drug to kill someone it has to be something you could mix in alcohol without the victim detecting it too soon it would be nice if it were also available on the street so a character who is a local druggie would make a good suspect the death should be fairly quick an hour or less because my murderer won't have enough access to the victim to engage in systematic poisoning any ideas thanks thanks holyguacamole and yes i'm totally harmless but my characters aren't digitalis sounds promising would a teenage druggie have it as a recreational drug though or i guess i could choose to direct suspicion towards a girl whose trying to lose weight wikipedia mentions that as an abuse although that would require me to rethink a sideplot i've got going hmmm thanks i agree digitalis is good but it would be hard to get it's never used for recreational purposes so it's not likely you would get it on the street there is the plant but it would take a lot and i'm not sure how that would work if it were ingested you typically get side effects from touching the plant i would say arsenic rat poison it's readilly available anywhere you would purchase pest deterrents it works very quickly if a person were to take enough at once although you often hear about slow poisoning to avoid detection and it's virtually undetectable when mixed in food or drink a prescription med that could be used any type of narcotic pain reliever or sedative oxycodone morphine xanax all meds that someone could have a prescription for as well as are often found on the street by abusers Drug addiction Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Controlled Substances Act Medical prescription Sedative Prohibition (drugs) Paracetamol Migraine Diazepam Hypoglycemia Analgesic Addiction Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Arguments for and against drug prohibition Oxycodone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Illegal drug trade Opioid Cocaine Convention on Psychotropic Substances Medicine Poison Pope John Paul I Anorexia nervosa Clinical depression Drug test Drug abuse Narcotic Emergency contraception Alcoholism Assassination Medical cannabis Osteoarthritis Cannabis (drug) Rape Alprazolam Prostate cancer Anxiety Cancer Clomipramine Alcoholics Anonymous Bipolar disorder Serial killer AIDS reappraisal First aid Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) CPU cache Traditional Chinese medicine Biodiversity Stomach cancer Stroke Aspartame Breastfeeding Alcoholic beverage Methamphetamine Asthma Maprotiline EastEnders Flunitrazepam Nitrous oxide Harold Shipman Morphine Haloperidol Dog Common cold Humphrey Bogart Diarrhea Urinary incontinence Antidepressant Rush Limbaugh Clandestine chemistry Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Sin City Publicly funded medicine Homeopathy Cat American Psycho Vegetarianism Folic acid Hamster Food Marsh test E-mail spam Rat Park Ricin Platoon (film) Contract Pneumonia Domestic violence Doxepin Human sexual behavior Cyanide Codeine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
