a question about insomnia okay i have it set on my mind that i suffer from insomnia because i can't sleep at nighttime and i've tried almost everything but in the mornings the less sleep i get the more awake i feel the next day and the more sleep i get the more tired i am when i wake up does anyone know how to explain this as to the phenomenon you're mentioning i think it has something to do with sleep inertia when your body is used to resting for long periods of time waking up becomes more difficult but don't think you don't need the sleep you're missing long term effects will show up i'd suggest analyzing your lifestyle do you try to sleep at the same time every day you should do you eat healthy and exercise regularly are you stressed worried right now are your bed and bedroom comfortable any medications that could produce this side effect etc etc if there isn't a physiological thing going on i'd say you need to psych yourself for sleep each night with a ritual try to sleep everyday at pm for example read a little and play soothing music or whatever works for you also avoid exercise close to bedtime and make sure to eat a good dinner Sleep Narcolepsy Urinary incontinence Lucid dreaming Chronic fatigue syndrome Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Sleep debt Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Fight Club Psoriasis Milton H.
