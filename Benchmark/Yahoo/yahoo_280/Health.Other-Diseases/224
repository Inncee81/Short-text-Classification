can people with cystic fibrosis be around other people with cf is there any medical reason why two people with cf cannot be around each other there are a number of benefits of people with cf being around each other primarily understanding of each other i went to a camp for cf kids every summer for years when i was growing up and the experience was fantastic those were some of the best weeks of my childhood and were the highlight of my summers i lived in a town where there were few other cf'ers and none were my age so it was great to have that sense of belonging the primary concern of cf'ers being around each other lies around the pseudomonas bacteria there are two prominent types in the cf population pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas burkholderia i think of them as type a and type b virtually all of us have type a colonized in our lungs by age and there's nothing we can do to prevent it however when the time comes for lung transplant the transplant centers are very famliar with how to handle it unfortunately type b presents many more complications with transplant and most of the centers will not transplant someone with type b my particular center has tried it a few times but the patient has never survived very long so they now have a 'ban' on transplanting patients with type b some of the cf centers have even taken the approach of separating patients by their pseudomonas type and they are seen separate days or times of the day in clinic you didn't mention the reason for your question so i hope i have provided enough information to help best wishes Cystic fibrosis Pneumonia Pseudomonas Organ transplant Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Proteobacteria Growth hormone treatment Bone marrow transplant Human cloning Radiation therapy Lung cancer Prostate cancer Cancer Insulin Diabetes mellitus Stomach cancer Asthma Emphysema Stroke Lupus erythematosus Ulcerative colitis Cytomegalovirus Health insurance Liver Multiple sclerosis Transplant rejection Melioidosis Psychology Migraine Tocopherol Colorectal cancer AIDS Traumatic brain injury Tuberculosis Aspergillosis Brain tumor Immunosuppressive drug Clinical depression Gram-negative Pulmonary alveolus Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Bill Frist Crohn's disease Leukemia Acute respiratory distress syndrome Gene therapy Burkholderia Bronchitis History of cancer chemotherapy Liver transplantation Alternative medicine Paracetamol Malignant melanoma Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Human lung Amiodarone Pulmonology Rabies Hepatocellular carcinoma Diarrhea Death Abortion Plutonium American Red Cross Public health in mainland China Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Physical therapy Graft-versus-host disease Endometriosis Hepatitis C Androgen insensitivity syndrome Drowning Hypoglycemia Expert system Stem cell National Kidney Foundation Singapore History of intersex surgery Quorum sensing Heterozygote advantage Atheroma Kidney transplantation CPU cache Xenotransplantation Publicly funded medicine Cholera Dialysis Organ donation Hypertension Intravenous therapy Metastasis Antiretroviral drug Aphasia Immune system Food and Drug Administration Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Genetics Spirometry
