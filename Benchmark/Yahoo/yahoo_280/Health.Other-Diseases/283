i've had a warm sensation on the inside of my left foot for the past few days it started off happening only about twice a day now it's multiple times in an hour there's no pain no swelling nothing when i have the warm sensation i touch the skin on the inside of my foot and it still feels cool even though the warmth is felt internally does anyone have an educated suggestion as to what this could be hmmm that's a tough one i'm thinking something neurological maybe an irritated nerve in your lower spine or maybe just the nerve in that particular spot in your foot i wouldn't worry about it unless it persists for longer than a couple weeks in the meantime pamper that part of the foot maybe there is an minor injury one that isn't severe enough to hurt but the heat sensation is there nonetheless but i'm not really qualified you know i'm not a pediatrist or anything just giving my thoughts that's all Traumatic brain injury Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Pain Penis First aid Massage Carpal tunnel syndrome Fecal incontinence Local anesthesia Alexander Technique Urinary incontinence Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Multiple sclerosis Milton H.
