lymph node okay i've been having this bump on my neck for really long really long it's not so big but you can feel it if you feel carefully and when my head is raised you can feel it but it's not really big i went to the doctors but he said it's not anything serious my mom will take me to the doctors again is it lymph node or is it something else should i be really concerned i'm female my mom says it should be fine because it's small doesn't hurt and quite a few people have those kinda stuff it's actually quite small i'm skinny cm ' and weigh around kg lbs front side quite up i had it ever since i think started my period does this have anything to do with that i also have a lymph node issue on the side of my neck near the clavical i've read up on it quite a bit and apparently as long as it's not growing and is on the softer side and moveable as opposed to fixed and hard it is probably okay as you probably know lymph nodes can raise when your body is fighting off an infection and can take quite a while to go down also sometimes they go up and never go down and people worry but it's probably nothing i saw my doctor recently and asked about the one i had found on the side of my neck that sounds a lot like yours he felt it didn't seem too concerned but said keep an eye on it in case it grows i did have multiple bug bites on my neck several months before so he said that could do it either way if the doctor said it wasn't serious i'd take his word for it but if it changes then go back to the doctor and tell him about the change asap btw if it's really bothering you though you could go back to the doctor and ask more about it it's better you understand than worry about it Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Lymphatic system Lymph node Breast cancer Metastasis Cancer of the larynx Radiation therapy Milton H.
