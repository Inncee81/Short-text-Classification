what is the average amount of studying on a regular school week for a student with ap classes and honors i plan to take spanish language ap calculus ab ap chemistry ap united states history ap english honors physics honors you'd be surprised what you can get away with i m going to ramble here for a bit but i m feeling nostalgic about high school being over i think i m going to miss my ap classes it s nearly impossible to give an average amount a lot of it depends on you how much do you usually have to study do you always do your math homework or do you feel like you understand it without doing the work a lot of the rest of it depends on your teachers some give more homework than others and some just teach better than others but that is quite a lot you ve got going there especially in the math department ap chemistry is by far one of the hardest ap classes and tests it s the only one i took that i felt like i had a ton to do and i can t imagine taking it with physics and calculus going at the same time anyway chemistry is just constant new information things to memorize vocabulary formulas ideas chemists chemicals ions reactions on and on and on it ll be the class you have the most and the hardest homework from don t get me wrong i loved every minute of it and i m actually good at it but it was hard it s impossible to give a nightly or weekly amount of work there will be weeks that you have very little homework and weeks that you re spending every moment from the time you get home from school until class the next day working frantically contacting friends for help figuring and refiguring problems yelling at your calculator and generally trying to figure something out but oh the joy of finally getting it ap calculus is actually not bad i did bc not ab but same difference and it s one that you get a pretty set schedule for you ll find out in the first few weeks whether you ll have a half hour of homework or a full hour a night or whatever and you ll have about the same amount every day all year i doubt it ll be any more than that it s basically math as you ve had it in the past you get a new concept a lecture and are given problems from the book you ll occasionally want to study for a test once you get closer to the ap test in may you may have more work each night with review material but for most of the year it s not bad apush is a lot of reading but cough only if you want to do it it depends on how your teacher does it if you have a few pages you need to read a night go ahead and do it you shouldn t have any more than a half hour to an hour a night really how my ap history teachers have always done it though is to give you a chapter and expect you to have it read by a given date everyone puts it off until the weekend before and reads the whole chapter or more precisely most everyone puts it off until the night before then skims the chapter copies someone else s notes and calls it a day lol you can make it a nightly thing though and i suggest you never read apush material for more than an hour at a time it s too easy to zone out and waste your time skimming the words without taking in what you re looking at but reading and listening to lectures and taking notes over both is about all you ll have to do for apush do not ever let yourself get too behind in the reading this is the type of reading that very quickly adds up to an impossible task if you let it there are huge chunks of us history i totally don t know because i let it pile up put it off and never got around to reading it lol physics in my experience ap physics c is mostly class work rather than homework it s a matter of taking the math you ve learned in other classes and reapplying to physics it s not much different than a math class really new concept problems bookwork a lot of busywork and again it ll depend on your teacher but i never did much studying outside of class for physics i have no idea about ap spanish a lot of my friends were in it and they seemed to stress a lot about the tests but not worry about it much except when they had a test i did take both years of latin and years of french though so i can say that language classes are mostly as you ll already know having gotten to ap vocabulary new words refining grammar concepts not a lot of real homework for the class but a lot of studying if you want to memorize the vocabulary well and to really get the language honors english is more of the same english as usual you ll have vocabulary to study but the only time you should have real homework is when you re reading a book for class or having to write an essay when you do have a book or an essay it can be a lot of work but there s no real studying as such involved unless you actually study the vocabulary a lot but back to my original statement you d be surprised what you can get away with i took ap tests my senior year but my day went something like this homework for ap calc was done after i got to school and before class started or not at all the teacher figured it was our business whether we did it or not so i rarely did french homework was done during the last few minutes of calculus ap government homework and reading done during french ap physics homework done during government ap literature during physics get the idea it s all about the short term memory and you can trade homework studying hours at night for units of stress during the day it works nicely well up until it doesn t it can be very taxing actively putting things off can be stressful in itself and well i suppose if you wanted to you could spend every waking hour studying and perhaps have less stress but i did very little homework actually at home ap chem my junior year was an exception granted most of my work during other classes studied the bare minimum and had a very high gpa passed all my ap exams never had too much of a mental breakdown and am starting college in the fall with credit hours to my name it can be done really average amount of studying as little as you can get away with or as much as you need with all of that going at once you probably will have at least an hour of homework and or studying a night spilled over from what you can get done during the day but it s not as much as you would think if you really want to or find that you need to study more you can up it to an hour or two a night good luck sorry
