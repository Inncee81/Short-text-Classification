if i am decent at playing the fife will flute be easy to play how does the difficulty of the fife compare to the difficulty of the flute are the embouchures the same or similar which is harder to play when i have the fife down will i also have the flute down as i have never played the fife and can only play the flute i cannot compare the difference of the difficulty level but i do know what a fife is if you are indeed decent at playing it then i doubt you'll have a difficulty playing the flute as long as you can make a sound from the fife it shouldnt be much different than a flute but the flute has a few more finger holes im sure you'll be able to play the flute i have faith in you even though i dont know you but still good luck Flute Western concert flute Fife (musical instrument) Clarinet Embouchure Recorder Tin whistle Transposing instrument Marching band Shakuhachi Ney Saxophone Di Zi Native American flute Piccolo Woodwind instrument Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Trumpet Knife Nose flute Native American music Drill bit Multiphonic Oboe Beatmania IIDX Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias In The Groove (game) Big band Harmonica Fast bowling Pump It Up Ocarina Carnatic music Bassoon Brass instrument Vibrato Authentic performance Violin Indigenous peoples of the Americas Table tennis Uilleann pipes Naruto jutsu Neanderthal Harmonic series (music) Baritone saxophone Non-native pronunciations of English Grade (climbing) Fife Zoroaster Bass guitar Bong Hornbostel-Sachs Pretty Good Privacy Music lesson Difficulty level Characters of Naruto Equine conformation Star Trek Customizable Card Game Pop'n Music Double bass Music of Ireland Drilling and threading Music of Brittany Quizbowl Salad Fingers Classical order Gramophone record Esperanto as an international language Music of the United States Diablo II: Lord of Destruction RuneScape quests Whitewater Tablature Traditional Chinese musical instruments Prehistoric music Volleyball Concerto Dyslexia Orchestra Unemployment The Boys of the Lough Ruy Lopez Sega Saturn Bagpipes Raith Rovers F.C.
