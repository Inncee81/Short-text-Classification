please explain guitar learning help how do you know how many times to strum each chord and what rythme to use i can play and switch the chords fine i just dont know how many ttimes and when to strum each chord any advice find the meter in the song you're trying to learn if it's then listen for the strong beat and if you hear a total of beats per measure then you can break down the rythm by process of elimination if it's not heard right away in for example you could have quarter notes to equal a measure or eighth notes or sixteenth notes per measure and just know that you can combine all of these as long as it equals beats per measure also there are dotted notes which represent that note plus half of that note and watch out for rests make sure the note is sustained and if not then there is a rest which represents a note value good luck Musical notation Musical terminology Chord (music) Time signature March (music) Tonality Blues Notes in__gales Musical mode Time Out of Mind Trance music Sampling (music) Olivier Messiaen Interval (music) Violin Rhythm Harmonica Music theory Guqin Trey Anastasio Video game music Hey Jude Bass guitar Authentic performance Banjo Echoes (1971 song) Metre (music) Double bass Twelve string guitar Shine On You Crazy Diamond Musical analysis Jazz Mouse (computing) Consonance and dissonance Music genre Power chord Royal Assent A Day in the Life Arab music Audiophile I Want to Hold Your Hand Music Electronic organ Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Trigonometric function Accordion United States dollar Hearing impairment Ear training Equal temperament Songwriter Eddie Van Halen Mandolin Tristan chord Consensus decision-making A Hard Day's Night (song) Guitar Counterpoint Bluegrass music Goldberg Variations Quarashi Bossa nova Poker jargon Electric guitar Slide guitar Big band Pop punk Electronic countermeasures Focus (album) Timpani Key (music) Mass Opportunity rover 10cc Hipparchus (astronomer) Acoustic guitar Blood on the Tracks Brian Jones (musician) Explosive material Herbie Hancock Freestyle music (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Beat (music) Inversion (music) Slapping A Tonic For The Troops Stanley Jordan SAT Layla Optigan United States Senate Modulation (music) Lebesgue integration Diatonic functionality Tempo Finale notation program
