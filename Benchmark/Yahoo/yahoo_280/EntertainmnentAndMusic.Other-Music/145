i need to make a long that is less than minutes long i write my own music i write progressive metal but i try to branch out to other types of music every time i write a song on guitar pro i check the midi to see how long the song i have so far is which at that stage isn't really a song but a mixture of riffs and with about done i've got over minutes of music therefore every time i'm completely done with a song it is up to minutes max but average around minutes i play in a band and write all of the music and with the songs i have fully completed none of them are under minutes i atleast want to make one any tips from fellow song writers yes in essence i'm trying to make a short song that is about minutes no other song writers have gone through this it sounds like you are putting too much into a song the short formula holds listener interest primarily on the radio but also in a live band like the one person said use a simple standard formula to make it shorter if you are putting a bunch of different riffs into songs then maybe you can simplify them that way also then you have more riffs to make more than songs a lot of people think that making longer songs makes them more of an artist less commercial maybe i find my art of any type is better when i put limits on it forces me to make each smaller part more perfect Heavy metal music Progressive rock Music genre Judas Priest Songwriter Sampling (music) Video game music Rush (band) Nu metal Umphrey's McGee Grunge music Boards of Canada Time Out of Mind Multitrack recording Red Hot Chili Peppers Jethro Tull (band) Peter Gabriel (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Funk Synthesizer Thrash metal Metal music Pantera Led Zeppelin Harmonica Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) Quarashi The Wildhearts Pump It Up Disco Rock (music) The Who Doom metal Popular music Tool (band) Pain of Salvation Joy Division (band) Music history of the United States (1980s to the present) Therion (band) Iggy Pop MTV2 Collective Soul Shine On You Crazy Diamond Bluegrass music Roxette Riff Van Halen Musical Instrument Digital Interface Black Sabbath Guitar solo Louie, Louie Beastie Boys Queen (band) Bitches Brew Double bass John Frusciante The Smiths Bon Jovi Jazz Gothic metal Adore Extended play Genesis (band) March (music) Rhythm guitar Hall & Oates Blonde on Blonde Burzum Opeth Sly & the Family Stone Frank Zappa Slide guitar Metallica Art rock Morse Code Planet Waves Indie rock Brian Jones (musician) Leaf Daryl Hall Clarinet Bohemian Rhapsody Bass guitar Bruce Dickinson Fear Factory Hey Jude Ride (band) Oasis (band) Extreme music Dream Theater Britpop KMFDM King Crimson Overkill (band) DrumMania The Beatles The Beatles' influence The Allman Brothers Band Trombone Music of Louisiana
