you have the power to change rock history but you can only choose one of the following elvis or the beatles choose only one way it which the history of rock n roll would be different the beatles never broke up and none of them died in they just released their th album and are preparing for a massive world tour or elvis never died he lost weight got in great shape again and still makes movies and albums to this day i would love to have heard a s version of the beatles and see if they developed and changed the way the rolling stones did in that era at the same time i think elvis could have continued to do great work his best stuff was his later stuff in my opinion i would love to have heard him work with other great rock and country musicians the beatles they were the most influential band of the th century changing the face of music they also changed their style as they went along i would be really interested in whether they would have continued to put out progressive music Rock and roll American rock The Beatles' influence Cover version Rock (music) Please Please Me The Beatles History of the Beatles The Waterboys Buddy Holly Roy Orbison Led Zeppelin Music genre Paul McCartney Queen (band) Timeline of trends in music (1960-1969) Billboard Hot 100 The Beach Boys Elvis Costello I Want to Hold Your Hand Heavy metal music Britpop King Crimson Music video American Pie (song) Classic rock Music history of the United States (1960s and 70s) The Band Bee Gees Beatles for Sale Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) Paul Is Dead British rock Tribute band Electric Light Orchestra Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1930-1970) Albums that have been considered the greatest ever Sgt.
