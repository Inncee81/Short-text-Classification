attention people who have given into band fan clubs i know the whole concept of fan clubs for bands is a bit lame especially how nowa days you have to pay for a year's membership etc but some of my favorite bands save the sellout speech thanks have them and they offer oppurtunities for meet and greets i was thinking of paying the for the boys like girls' heroes heroines club only because of the meet and greet chance is this a good idea do you think i'd actually get the oppurtunity to meet the band or what psh meet greet honey you shouldn't have to pay money for something that you could make happen yourself with enough persistence you can meet any band and it's a bit cooler if its not one of those busy meet greets but of course if you really really are fond of the band go for it Therion (band) Selling out Queen (band) Miss Saigon Kurt Cobain A-ha Brian Jones (musician) The Beatles ABBA Hardcore punk The Beach Boys Yoko Ono Legion of Super-Heroes The Libertines Good Charlotte Theory of conduct Red Hot Chili Peppers Duran Duran The Chemical Brothers Scouting John Frusciante Butters Stotch Jim Morrison Anime Milton H.
