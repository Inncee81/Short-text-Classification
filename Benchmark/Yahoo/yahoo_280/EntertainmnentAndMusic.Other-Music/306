what's your favourite neil young song i can't really decide it might be 'don't let it bring you down' or 'broken arrow' or 'only love can break your heart' there's one thing that neil young does better than almost any songwriter alive bittersweet just that voice a guitar and his idiosyncratic lyrics can create a unique mood as seen on songs like the needle and the damage done birds very underrated song one of the best break up songs ever recorded in my opinion tired eyes helpless expecting to fly harvest some of his real classics are better live powderfinger from live rust messy but still incredible version harvest moon from unplugged overall a poor album but this was a highlight Neil Young Powderfinger Rod Stewart Queen (band) 10cc Bon Jovi Crazy Horse (band) Bee Gees Bryan Adams Roxette R.E.M.
