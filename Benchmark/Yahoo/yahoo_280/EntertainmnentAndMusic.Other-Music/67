a question on my new bass i got my new fender standard jazz bass yesterday but the amp didnt come in till today which i will go and pick up i was playing it without an amp and it had a decent amount of fret buzz on the e and a string is this normal for a new bass i am sure it wont be heard over the amp but i just want to know i bought it from a fender dealer had it checked and everything if you bought the bass from a fender dealer they owe you a free set up it's one of the perks for buying in a real store all new instruments need to have the intonation checked the truss rod adjusted and the bridge height set these things are just set to an approximate standard at the factory but must be dialed in for each individual instrument i've seen instruments come set up perfectly from the factory but those are the exception rather than the rule if you bought it from the internet any reputable guitar shop with an authorized service center will take care of you for around do not attempt to set the bass up yourself an untrained person attempting a truss rod adjustment can permanently damage the neck Guitar Bass guitar Electric guitar John Myung Double bass Fret Intonation Fender Telecaster Violin Jimi Hendrix Mike Watt Floyd Rose Rickenbacker Rhodes piano Stevie Ray Vaughan Fender Hurdy gurdy Slide guitar Harp Fender Stratocaster Tablature Bassoon Blood on the Tracks Gibson Les Paul Leo Fender Timpani PRS Guitars Instrument amplifier John Deacon Anthony Jackson Trombone Joy Division (band) XML Alexi Laiho Mandolin Authentic performance Musical notation Lute Banjo Classical guitar Jaco Pastorius Music Man (company) John Paul Jones (musician) Fender Precision Bass Cello GURPS Acoustic bass guitar Wheel of Fortune Steinberger Twelve string guitar Sundial Loudspeaker Buddy Guy Trumpet Blackjack Wes Montgomery G&L Saxophone Bass clarinet Microeconomics Betting (poker) Bill Wyman Tuning Adam Jones Poker jargon Fingerboard Contract bridge Alembic Inc Viol Green Day Bitches Brew Chick Corea Musical tuning Grateful Dead Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Shine On You Crazy Diamond Pedal steel guitar Telephone numbering plan Les Claypool Modem The Beatles' influence Piano Epiphone Autograph Lap steel guitar Blues Brian Jones (musician) Acoustic guitar Clarinet Handloading Bridge (stringed instrument) Resonance Harmonica Operational amplifier Just intonation John Frusciante Dixieland Bluegrass music Truss bridge
