can i replace hard guitar chords with easier ones i have a book that has some rareish guitar chords and i heard that you can take a chord like cmaj and just play like a c chord or something and it will sound so similar it doesn't really matter is this true and does anyone know of a site or something where i could find common replacements for difficult chords this is basically true however the song may not sound quite perfect because sometimes a note from the vocal melody is represented in the chord and is the reason for the artist's chord choice being precisely what it is for example your cmaj has a 'd' note in it the th and perhaps that is an important note to make it sound just right the trick to substituting extended chords like ths ths ths etc with simpler ones is to know the chord's basic triad component by that i refer to the root rd and th of the chord and whether the triad that they form is minor major diminished or augmented and if it's appropriate to make the chord a th you'll need to know if it's a major or minor seventh note that's needed and so you can never quite get away without knowing some harmony facts it's not that difficult the cmaj chord you cite is a cmaj chord with an added th or made even simpler its base triad is a c major chord with each simplification you remove an element of the harmony and while it will sound ok because the notes you're playing are in the full chord it will not sound as good as it could if you'd just learn the full chord some common chord families are shown below using c major cmaj cmaj cmaj cmaj cadd cadd minor cm cm cm cm cm cm dominant cmaj c c c c diminished cdim cdim a k a cm b augmented caug a k a c c c suspended chords are neither major nor minor because they have no rd which defines major minor csus c sus csus Tonality Seventh chord Chord symbol Interval (music) Harmonica Musical mode Diatonic functionality Blues Consonance and dissonance Modulation (music) Music genre Key (music) A Hard Day's Night (song) Tritone Counterpoint Power chord Trance music Chord progression Accordion Jazz Serialism Classical music era Violin Meantone temperament Bass guitar Barbershop music Bebop Neo-classical metal Mathematics of musical scales Music Time Out of Mind Vowel Diminished scale Klezmer Heavy metal music Just intonation Modal jazz Baroque music Hangul Sonata (music) Figured bass Blood on the Tracks 10cc XML Ear training Wolf interval Sonata form Trey Anastasio Big band Bohemian Rhapsody Romantic music Circle of fifths Contract bridge Perfect fifth Music theory Central processing unit Sacred Harp Esperanto as an international language Guitar Symmetry Steely Dan Level (music) Electronic organ Songwriter Video game music Eddie Van Halen Gothic rock March (music) Freestyle music Visual Basic Greek language Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Picardy third Twelve-tone technique History of sonata form Herbie Hancock Microeconomics Mouse (computing) Twelve string guitar Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven) Hip hop culture IP (complexity) Metal music Pump It Up Optigan
