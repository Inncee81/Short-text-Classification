learning guitar i've just started learning guitar i know all of the chords but i'm having trouble moving quickly from chord to chord i have to stop look at my fingers and reposition them and so each song i try to play is slow and choppy any tips i took lessons for years and the best thing do is practice going up and down scales every day as much as you can i know this is boring but it will really make you a better player it loosens up your fingers and increases response time you'll develope a more natural feel where each note is and finger positioning practice practice practice hang in there you'll get it Violin Bass guitar Guitar Harmonica Chord (music) Tonality Tablature Double bass Slide guitar Timpani Brian Jones (musician) Eddie Van Halen Musical notation Music theory Music lesson Figured bass Uilleann pipes Volleyball Key (music) Romantic music Chromatic scale I Want to Hold Your Hand Saxophone Modal jazz Power chord Slack-key guitar Pedal steel guitar Twelve string guitar A Hard Day's Night (song) Rhythm guitar Bagpipes Diving Time Out of Mind Double stop Authentic performance Transposing instrument Sonata (music) Blues Electric guitar Blood on the Tracks Aerial (dance move) Musical terminology Music Harp Guitar solo Music of Ireland Inversion (music) Piano Chopsticks Buddy Guy Jazz Ear training Trumpet Trey Anastasio Clarinet Electronic organ Stiff Little Fingers Conducting Minor scale Synthesizer Menstrual cup Dobro Western concert flute Fret Umphrey's McGee Video game music Chord progression GuitarFreaks Ukulele Gothic rock Big band Swept wing A Day in the Life Bossa nova Hey Jude Highway 61 Revisited Mandolin Fingerpicking Music of Hawaii Perfect fifth Acoustic guitar Just intonation Fielding (cricket) Non-native pronunciations of English Classical music era Tenshinhan Multiphonic Stanley Jordan Free jazz Slow Train Coming Arab music Mac MacLeod Capoeira Banjo Diatonic functionality Mao (game) Slapping Berimbau
