in afi's hit song love like winter i have asked many many different people this question and every one of them has been as confused as i am about the answer maybe you have an idea in the chorus of the song davey sings i met my love before i was born he wanted love i taste of blood he bit my lip he sings the chorus three times in the song and although in the second of the three he uses the word she instead of he the first and last are sung with the word he they aren't gay so why would he sing about his first love being a man and having him bit his lip dont try to tell me that he is singing that line on behalf of the females listening to the song because we all know that rockstars dont pretend they are a girl singing about their male lover wow i cant believe that of you so far are sitting there trying to explain it with hes gay davey havok is not gay nor is he bi sexual and any internet site that you mave have read this rumor is simply a rumor he has never said this not in an interview not on stage not in a book not in a magazine not on a website he's not gay and neither is the rest of the band please try to come up with a better guess than that in the website songmeanings net someboy posted his theory and by the site it's the most accurate one so far first verse is told from the girl's pov she is telling this guy who is in love with her that he should stay even though she is not available all the winter references you know emptiness blah blah because she's dating someone else but in the first chorus she says that it's something inevitable that they'll be together it's in the blood i met my love before i was born second verse is this guy's pov 'i barely dreamt her yesterday' i'm supposing refers to the surrealness that this person just pops into your life and you are so in love with them note that he refers to himself as 'i me ' etc but then there's a 'his ' ''she said it seems you're somewhere far away' to his face' means that she's speaking to someone else and i think that someone else is the other guy she's seeing basically she leaves him Avenue Q Little Britain AFI (band) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
