is it possible to fix skips on vinyl acetate records i have a couple of original early 's records that skip on a few songs i hope that it's possible to repair the record i can't believe this all you can really do is increase the tracking weight of your tone arm that may get you through the skips beware added weight may damage the stylus or the record try small adjustments if you are successful consider quickly recording the record to cassette cd old records don't heal like skin they will only deteriorate more good luck Gramophone record Phonograph Compact audio cassette Sound recording Magnetic cartridge Single (music) 8-track cartridge Seismometer Tocopherol Unusual types of gramophone record Mixtape Adjustable gastric band All Things Must Pass Roxette Fixed-gear bicycle Weight training Hidden track Girls Aloud VHS Disc jockey Crass Records The Mountain Goats 8 mm video format Stylus AFI (band) BMW E34 B-side Compact disc Joy Division (band) Resident Evil (video game) Blonde on Blonde Let It Be Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Skin The Beatles discography Heinkel He 112 The Beatles bootlegs Bicycle brake systems Freestyle music The Fragile Pete Atkin Hamming code Human League Car handling Oral contraceptive Tesla coil ITunes Skip James Heinkel He 100 Inflation Bicycle DIY ethic Advance Wars: Dual Strike Uranium The Misfits Videocassette recorder Pearl Jam Multitrack recording UK Singles Chart Handloading MiniDisc Chumbawamba Van Morrison The Emancipation of Mimi Pink Floyd Armored Core President (game) Joker (comics) Ballot Result The Rutles M16 (rifle) Swingout Journey (band) 2005 Atlantic hurricane season M4 Sherman Blur Interval (music) Helicopter Digital recording Hip hop culture Vinyl roof Remix Daniel Johnston Scar Dassault Mirage III Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Twelve Swords of Power Rancid Galactic Civilizations Abbey Road (album) Bean-Spill Electrophysiology Team Fortress Classic De Lorean DMC-12 Knife Second Battle of the Atlantic Continuation War A Day in the Life Please Please Me Walkman
