what do you think of the new usa today rankings i think they look good for the most part i definately agree with the top two florida might be a little high sorry mike d and take it easy on the pac will ya but will probably end up staying in the top not sure if ohio state should be quite that high georgia is definately going to prove they deserve it be up there penn states a little shaky for me to tcu is going to be living large when they upset texas i could probably go on forever but what do you think i take a lot of small issues with them like texas barely beat iowa and sucked a lot last year should they be also florida and lsu should start lower they need to prove something with all new players i disagree penn state i would put top ten and remove wisconsin sorry bucky wisconsin just isn't that good watch michigan game nfl draft pick osu could be dropped out for all i care my biggest issues are west virginia about spots too high and louisville is above some really good teams that are just better in general i think a lot of teams were voted high for having easy schedules which pisses me off a lot oklahoma is not better than georgia auburn if a team wins out fine i'll consider them but don't make it so that they have to get upset by south florida to get knocked out of title contention i think auburn should be the top team from the sec and should be top i also like florida state and ucla but i understand why they're ranked low based on bad records from last year where is oregon i'd sure as hell take them over boise state NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Fight song Mack Brown International League College football October 2005 in sports Southeastern Conference College rivalry Houston Nutt Big East Conference Atlantic Coast Conference Joe Paterno Iron Bowl Maxwell Award 1984 NBA Draft January 2005 in sports St. Louis Rams New England Patriots Newsweek's List of the 1,000 Top U.S. Schools (2005) 2004 College World Series Hayden Fry Carolina Panthers March 2005 in sports Local access and transport area Oklahoma State University - Stillwater Current sports events Cleveland Browns State supreme court Poker jargon U.S. presidential election, 2008 Norway national football team New York Giants NFL Draft USC Trojans Football Democratic Party (United States) Theory of conduct Cincinnati Bengals United States district court Buffalo Bills Louisiana State University Pittsburgh Steelers Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act National Football League College basketball Midwestern United States Highest-income places in the United States Highest-income counties in the United States December 2004 in sports Texas Longhorn Athletics United States Attorney BCS title game 109th United States Congress College soccer Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Sports Car Club of America U.S. House election, 2004 Auburn University Sigma Nu Ninety-sixth United States Congress Cooperative extension service Ninety-fifth United States Congress World Series Marching band Super Bowl XXVII New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets U.S. presidential election, 2004 Alpha Gamma Delta U.S. House election, 2006 Twin cities American Football League U.S. National Cemetery Nick Saban Miami Dolphins University of Florida Ric Flair Phi Kappa Psi Thirty-second United States Congress Troy Glaus Jacksonville Jaguars Kappa Sigma Pi Kappa Phi Luther Head National Football League Lore Georgia Institute of Technology Historic regions of the United States Episcopal Church in the United States of America San Francisco 49ers New York Knicks Southern United States Gannett Alpha Epsilon Pi
