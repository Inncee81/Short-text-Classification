anyone else sick of the sec is the toughest football conference bs my theory is that since all the sec schools are so terrible at academics apparently all you need is middle school education to get in the football players do not have anything to study for and all they do is practice football yet the sec teams lose to usc all the time sick of it naaah i think it is entertaining how a majority of the fans of sec teams need some type of validation as if there is some magic formula to say so and so is the best conference or the toughest if you are a real college football fan you know there is no best conference like i said if they need to feel valid by saying such things go right ahead while the rest of the country enjoys the game of football for what it is Southeastern Conference Bowl Championship Series National Football League Atlantic Coast Conference College basketball University of South Carolina Auburn University Pacific Ten Conference American football Second Houston Nutt Joe Paterno University of Alabama University of Notre Dame University of Arkansas USC Trojans Football Nick Saban University of Kentucky St. Louis Rams Big East Conference University of Southern California College football Orlando Magic Texas Longhorn Athletics Tulane University Buffalo Bills Georgia Institute of Technology Ivy League July 2005 in sports Sam Barry New York Giants New England Patriots Mack Brown Culture of the United States University of Florida The Football League Pittsburgh Steelers Miami Dolphins AFL-NFL Merger Pennsylvania State University Arkansas Razorbacks University of Mississippi Carolina Panthers New York Jets Newcastle United F.C.
