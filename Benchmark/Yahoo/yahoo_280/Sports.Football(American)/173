my th grade son is playing his first year of junior high football this upcoming season and his best friend who's playing too is saying over and over again that he can't use his new nike air huarache k 's because they have detachable cleats why would it matter can someone that knows about younger guys playing football enlighten me somehow i could see if they were metal cleats but they are not metal cleats just detachable cleats with the aid of a lil tool that came with them in the shoebox i plan on asking the coach tomorrow just to be sure but had they not wanted a specific kind of cleat would they not have specified that desire to us parents his friend does not know what he is talking about he can wear detachable cleats it is a good thing because when his friends molded cleats wear down your son can replace the cleats that are worn on his Shoe Softball Nike, Inc.
