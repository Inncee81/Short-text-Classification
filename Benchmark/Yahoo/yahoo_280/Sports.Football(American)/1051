will roger clemens play long enough to get to wins he currently is years old and has career wins if not will he at least play next year and if he does will it be one of these month type contracts he has gotten the past years i think people should come to the conclusion that roger isn't juicing anymore come on people the guy was roiding lots of speculation out there which made him be a power pitcher longevity well into his 's and he's not worth million if he comes back next year i think teams should only sign him if he is going to play the full year and if so he is worth in my opinion million ok people whoops i know i messed up why is everyone saying why did you put it in the football don't you realize that i made a mistake deal with it you can't switch categories after posting it can you and if so how no way he gets i agree with you about the steroids he has to be juicing Roger Clemens American football Major League Baseball television contracts Professional wrestling slang Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays Nolan Ryan Alex Rodriguez David Wells Randy Johnson Houston Astros Baseball Stars Pete Rose Tris Speaker Oakland Athletics Norway national football team Bud Selig 2003 World Series David Beckham National Football League Lore New York Jets Satchel Paige Poker jargon Mark McGwire Sammy Sosa Cheating in poker New York Knicks Pedro Mart__nez Michael Owen Barry Bonds National Football League Red Sox Nation 2005 World Series No-hitter John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Babe Ruth Association of Tennis Professionals Newcastle United F.C.
