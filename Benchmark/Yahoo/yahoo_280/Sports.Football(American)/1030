michael vick is he in jail or what no he is currently out on bail awaiting trial which is currently set on november th i know you didn't ask but this case really bothers me alot i have no earthly idea why a man who makes million dollars wants to be betting on dog fights unless he enjoys it and i'm not on board with the group that is saying we shouldn't say anything until the trial because i have seen interviews with numerous people and and an entire family who witnessed mr vick at these events actively participating and placing bets paying one man dollars for just one bet the whole thing really makes me sick to my stomach i ain't no peta freak or a vegan but torturing dogs and training them to tear each other apart is just sickening to me not to mention illegal mr vick may be facing rico charges by the end of august which carry a very heavy jail sentence that is why tony the co defendant in the case flipped and is testifying for the feds rico charges have to do with a criminal enterprise such as gambling and trafficking across state lines the penalty in rico cases is much more serious so mr vick could be facing a much longer prison sentence if the government goes that route Mumia Abu-Jamal Prison Plame affair Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Schapelle Corby Bail 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Wyatt Earp Miscarriage of justice Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Unlawful combatant Mensal__o scandal EastEnders Beltway sniper attacks People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Remand Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tupac Shakur Murder Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution Symbionese Liberation Army Gambling Cockfight Crime in Australia Martha Stewart The Untouchables Charles Graner Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Mike Tyson John Allen Muhammad Fred Phelps Vladimiro Montesinos George Galloway Mercenary Match fixing Scopes Trial Katelyn Faber Amnesty International Arguments for and against drug prohibition Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia Mordechai Vanunu Ethel and Julius Rosenberg Status of religious freedom in Iran Fred A.
