dallas cowboys odds to go all the way in my opinion the cowboys have the potential to go all the way and not only that win the super bowl they are loaded with talent and if they can play consistent through out the year you might as well punch their ticket not only that they play in the nfc so to think they dont have a shot is crazy if you putting your money on the saints eagles or bears your odds are not much better especially the saints cowboys will win it all write it down i honestly think we are witnessing the beginning of the next cowboys dynasty romo is already an pro bowler meaning he's one of top quarterbacks in the league they have the best tandem in runningbacks and they are really young too to is a beast and probably will get at least tds this year if he stays healthy plus the defense is the best in the league i would be surprised if the boys lose more than one game this year Super Bowl XXVII Dallas Cowboys New York Giants Super Bowl Carolina Panthers Pittsburgh Steelers National Football League Super Bowl VI Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XIII National Football League Lore St. Louis Rams Donovan McNabb Super Bowl X San Francisco 49ers Troy Aikman Professional American football championship games Indianapolis Colts Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XII New England Patriots Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXXVI American Football League Joe Gibbs Philadelphia Eagles Denver Broncos Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl I Cris Carter Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XVII Monday Night Football Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl XXI Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXXI Miami Dolphins Atlanta Falcons Buffalo Bills Terrell Owens Pro Bowl Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXIX Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXII NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXXV 2005 NFL season Baltimore Ravens Washington Redskins Robert F.
