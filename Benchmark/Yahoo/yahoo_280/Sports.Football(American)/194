why is there no playoffs system for college football like they have in college basketball but college basketball seedings rankings are kinda weird too with the ncaa tournament considered the strength of schedule or whatever why can't both of these sports especially college football have a normal playoff system because the ncaa has not decided to put one in place the bcs was intended to at least help but it's turned out to be mainly a joke i think the real problem with a football playoff system is that it would add too many weeks to the season even if it was just the top teams you're talking about more weeks of games and if you did start a playoff with the top teams how do you select which teams go is it simply a matter of taking in the coach's poll or some other poll also i think a true playoff system would minimize all the bowl games and those bowl games are major money generators Bowl Championship Series National Football League Playoff NCAA Division I-A national football champions Playoff format Texas Longhorn Athletics College basketball National Basketball Association College football Atlantic Coast Conference New York Giants Mack Brown Big East Conference Georgia Institute of Technology NFL playoffs Pittsburgh Steelers Tulane University Super Bowl Carolina Panthers USC Trojans Football New England Patriots University of Maryland, College Park Cleveland Browns John Calipari NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Major League Baseball television contracts Super Bowl XXVII Joe Paterno Sam Barry New Mexico Lobo Basketball Southeastern Conference World Football League Syracuse University Orange February 2005 in sports Sudden death University of Texas at Austin Minnesota Vikings University of Houston Arkansas Razorbacks December 2004 in sports Stanley Cup National Hockey League Oklahoma Sooners American Football League Norway national football team March 2005 in sports NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 University of Connecticut Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXXI Kansas City Chiefs Football World Cup Women's National Basketball Association University of Arizona Michigan Wolverines Basketball BCS title game Cincinnati Bengals Arizona State University Auburn University American football Yao Ming National Football League championships Buffalo Bills San Francisco 49ers Monday Night Football Match fixing New York Knicks Baseball Michael Jordan San Antonio Spurs Orlando Magic Single-elimination tournament Miami Dolphins Toronto Raptors Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium Luther Head Dan Marino Houston Nutt Boise State University Super Bowl V Chinese Basketball Association New Jersey Nets New York Jets Memorial Stadium, Clemson Washington State University Oakland Raiders University of Texas at Dallas Donovan McNabb Canadian Football League Indianapolis Colts Tournament January 2005 in sports NBA Finals August 2005 in sports June 2004 in sports
