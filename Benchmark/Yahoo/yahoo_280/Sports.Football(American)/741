at what age can children join a competitive football league like peewee ive seen some little ones greetings i have seen some of those pee wee teams but i really don't think young children should go for football there are other team sports that are very good for kids to learn to be team mates baseball and soccer are two good examples i know i'm going to get pelted with tomatoes for this answer but if you can keep your child off the gridiron you are most likely going to find a happier situation there is much less chances of getting hurt in soccer and baseball if you really insist on entering your child in football i would suggest or when teamwork has been firmly established in the child's life soapbox alert soapbox alert under no circumstances should a young girl years old be allowed to go out for cheerleading this is an an abomination and to do so is just praying for a disastrous teenage lifestyle the only people it benefits are the preening parents who have no idea what kind of pandora's box they are playing with girls should also enter sports like soccer or baseball or karate at that age end of soapbox alert just my two bits worth take care Football (soccer) American football Sport Baseball Playoff Rugby football Football The Football League Major League Baseball television contracts Major League Soccer Los Angeles Dodgers Topps Salary cap Boston Public Indoor soccer Gaelic football Sport in Ireland Draft (sports) College football National Football League Sudden death Cranford, New Jersey Football in the United Kingdom Sports in Puerto Rico The Giver David Beckham Ultimate (sport) Women's football (soccer) Theory of conduct Sports timeline Major professional sports league Playoff format Bundesliga (football) Major League Baseball Rugby union Softball Tie (draw) Pee Wee Reese University of Houston Peanuts MLB on NBC EA Sports 1919 World Series United States men's national soccer team Fox Broadcasting Company Transactional analysis Football (soccer) positions Lou Gehrig Melbourne Cricket Ground Minor league baseball Culture of the United States Martial art Rugby league in Australia Cleveland Browns University of Denver The Sporting News Professional sports University of Miami Relegation Cincinnati Bengals Canadian Football League Baylor University Australian rules football Associated Press Athlete of the Year National Hockey League All-Star Game National pastime Baseball statistics History of rugby union Gaelic Athletic Association Damon Allen Pitaten Football in England Humphrey Bogart FA Premier League Lacrosse National Soccer League (Australia) Japanese baseball 2004-05 NHL lockout Jim Thorpe Paintball All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship FA Cup Glossary of American football Ayrton Senna Breastfeeding Overtime (sport) Good Times Jupiler League World Football League Babe Ruth About a Boy Save (sport) 2005 World Series Rugby league Sport in the United Kingdom Rugby league in England Williams College Atlantic Coast Conference Norway national football team
