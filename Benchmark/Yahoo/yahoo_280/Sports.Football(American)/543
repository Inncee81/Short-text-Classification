who is the highest nfl draft pick to never sign a contract i was looking at a number of the hold outs on contracts and many of the players have waited until the start of the season but the first round picks always seem to eventually sign i was wondering if there were any st rounder picks that did not sign if they don't sign with the team that drafted them what does the team get in compensation can the player be drafted again by another team i think to need to clarify a bit bo jackson's and charlie ward would both qualify drafted but did not sign that year eli manning does not since he did sign that year with his rights being traded and the team he was drafted by being compensated i just checked ward was not drafted in the first round which is why he chose to go into the nba instead of play for the nfl bo jackson as pick overall appears to be the best answer bo jackson was selected overall in by the tampa bay buccaneers he never signed with the bucs instead chosing to play baseball for the royals he did go back into the draft in where the raiders got him in the th round Oakland Raiders National Football League New York Knicks New England Patriots New York Jets Reggie Jackson New York Giants NFL Draft San Francisco 49ers Ryan Leaf Reserve clause Chicago Bulls Cincinnati Bengals Toronto Raptors NBA Draft NFL playoffs, 2002-03 American Football League Jon Gruden Baltimore Ravens Brett Favre Los Angeles Clippers Steve Young (athlete) Minor league baseball World Series San Antonio Spurs Continental Basketball Association Portland Trail Blazers Jerry Rice Cleveland Browns Orlando Magic Super Bowl National Basketball Association St. Louis Rams Steve Nash Warren Sapp United States Football League Salary cap January 2005 in sports National Football League Lore Minnesota Vikings Detroit Lions Minnesota Timberwolves 2004-05 NHL lockout Super Bowl XXXVII Chicago White Sox Monday Night Football Super Bowl XXVII Vinny Testaverde Carnell Williams Trent Dilfer Major League Baseball Bo Jackson June 2004 in sports September 2005 in sports Dallas Cowboys Eli Manning Jacksonville Jaguars Damon Allen Los Angeles Kings AFL-NFL Merger December 2004 in sports Kansas City Chiefs Peyton Manning Utah Jazz Houston Rockets San Francisco Giants Cleveland Cavaliers Warrick Dunn John Elway Yao Ming Miami Dolphins LeBron James Major League Baseball television contracts NBA Draft Lottery Washington Redskins Illinois Fighting Illini Troy Glaus NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Randy Moss Memphis Grizzlies Satchel Paige Rich Gannon Wheel of Fortune
