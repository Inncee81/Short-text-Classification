was anybody else impressed with brian lenorad from the rams or just me iam fully aware that this is preseason folks iam only saying i did not expect him to do squat and so far he has impressed me a lot more than well adrian peterson calvin johnson etc hard to say from pre season but it least i saw nothing to complain about and he was quite good at rutgers man who woulda thought people would brag on rutgers football twilight zone dude and the rams definately has an offense that will utilize him i thought when he was drafted it was a very interesting choice even if it seemed a bit early to go after him but there was a lot of that this year hope he has a great career even if the niners are gonna keep ballin against the rams but i hope he runs all over the seagulls and cards Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers New England Patriots St. Louis Rams Kansas City Chiefs National Football League Super Bowl XXXIV New York Giants American football Cincinnati Bengals Kurt Warner New York Jets Carolina Panthers Dallas Cowboys NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 1957 World Series Sports timeline NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Random access memory Boston Red Sox Miami Hurricanes Football Baltimore Ravens Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XIV Big East Conference Oklahoma Sooners Houlihan's Stadium Joe Namath Free will Houston Rockets Ty Cobb The Twilight Zone Minnesota Vikings National Football League Lore John Elway Jerry Rice Rutgers University Super Bowl IX Madden NFL NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Predestination Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXXVI Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Super Bowl XIII RAM Racing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Super Bowl XXVII Manny Ram__rez Super Bowl X Hard disk Baseball Yao Ming Tennessee Titans Toronto Blue Jays Brett Favre Poker jargon Julius Hodge Steve Nash Tony Stewart Indianapolis Colts Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXI Color Graphics Adapter Larry Bird USC Trojans Football Super Mario 128 American football strategy Social rule Seattle Mariners Sheffield United F.C.
