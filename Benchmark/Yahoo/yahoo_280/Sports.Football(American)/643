jersey numbers did they just allow the nfl wr's to wear single didget 's on their jersey well all u guys r sayin no but how come the browns and the cheifs both have recievers that have single digit jerseys wrs are required to wear or the reason some wrs are currently wearing single digit numbers is because it is the preseason and they are able to wear them since there are limited numbers available until their correct numbers become available after other players are cut assuming they aren't the ones that are cut currently randy moss is wearing but he will have to switch once the rosters are reduced down to players here are all the required number combinations for each position quarterbacks placekickers and punters wide receivers and running backs and defensive backs offensive linemen linebackers and defensive linemen and tight ends or if all are taken all numbers are based on a player's primary position and they can move to another other position during the game if a player wearing comes into the game as an eligible receiver they must inform the referee that they are going to be an ineligible number playing an eligible position so that they don't get flagged for illegal touching if they are given the ball during the play some players have tried to petition to have different numbers usually their college numbers but nobody has been successful last year reggie bush tried to get but his petition was refused Glossary of American football American football Super Bowl X Cincinnati Bengals National Football League Wide receiver National Football League Lore Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVI Offensive team New England Patriots American football strategy Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl IX Defensive team Super Bowl XXIII Canadian football Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XIII Miami Dolphins Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIX Lineman (football) Super Bowl XII San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XVIII Quarterback Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XI Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl VII Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XXXVIII Randy Moss Super Bowl XXXI American Football League All-Time Team Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl I Running back 2005 NFL season Official (American football) Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XX Volleyball Comparison of Canadian and American football Miami Hurricanes Football Jacksonville Jaguars St. Louis Rams New York Jets Buffalo Bills Baseball NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXXV Oakland Raiders Clemson University Michael Vick Softball Tight end Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl Baltimore Ravens Snooker Arena football Tony Dungy Joe Paterno San Diego Chargers Punt (football) Rugby union positions Basketball Super Bowl XXXIX American Football League NFL Draft Philadelphia Eagles Table tennis Jerry Rice Terrell Owens NFL Most Valuable Player Award Joe Gibbs Water polo 1973 NFL season Washington Redskins Madden NFL Denver Broncos
