should the pacman be allowed to wrestle the tennessee titans petitioned for a court order to prevent pacman jones from participating with tna at an upcomming event since he has been suspended for a year should he be allowed to seek employment elsewhere one one hand the titans have a sizable amount of money invested in pacman jones and possibly have a right to protect that investment the majority of nfl players have contract stipulations which prevent them from participating in dangerous activities i know wrestling is scripted but there are a number of professional wrestlers who are seriously injured every year so i think that the titans do have a right to try and stop jones from injuring himself however kevin green and brian urlacher have both participated in professional wrestling and since pacman has been suspended for a year i don't know how much his contract with the titans really stands for right now i think it's pretty darn hypocritical of the nfl to keep him from earning a living while they have decided not to pay him pacman jones definitly should be allowed to perform in a wrestling ring if that is what he decides to do Professional wrestling slang Professional wrestling National Football League Professional wrestling match types World Wrestling Entertainment A.J.
