i believe that roethlisberger is going to be one of the greatest qb's to have ever play the game what do u all think what are some things he could do to be better i think that he has done alot in his short career he is awesome a natural born football player he played other sports in high school too go steelers ok i take pride in my team and i love my qb i wouldn't tear you up if you expressed how you feel about ur qb don't do it to me i asked for constructive critisism if you don't like the question you don't have to answer what is up with you ppl if i see a question i have no interest in i keep moving y r ppl so ignorant grrrr isn't it funny how someone can have a great couple of seasons followed by a few bad mistakes and all of a sudden they are has beens let's see another guy come thru what he has doing as well as he has i admit he needs to stay off bikes without a helmit but he went thru alot and i think he does one he l of a job i think roethlisberger is a great quarterback with one not so spetacular year a and years with a super bowl ring and he's regarded as 'bad' i mean one mediocre year and everything starts dissing him saying he's a burned out quarterback if you got in a motorcycle accident mid summer missed training camp got an emergency appedectomy and a concussion mid season along with the pressures of the super bowl champs i think the odds are against you but with bruce arians making adjustments to the playbook to big ben's benefit tongue twister he'll do much better this year i'm a steelers fan that has been at big ben's side the whole time even during his darkest games raiders and i haven't walked out on him anyways he's only entering his th year and if he keeps it up he'll be playing for a long long time with the steelers go steelers Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Ben Roethlisberger Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XIV Buffalo Bills National Football League Lore New England Patriots Super Bowl IX Super Bowl St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl X National Football League New York Jets Miami Dolphins Jacksonville Jaguars Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXXIX NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXVI Baltimore Ravens Brett Favre Bud Adams Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl III Super Bowl XIII American football American Football League Super Bowl XVIII Kurt Warner Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl IV Kansas City Chiefs San Diego Chargers Tommy Maddox Super Bowl XXXI Sports betting Tennessee Titans Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XXIII Donovan McNabb San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XIX Monday Night Football Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XXXIV Indianapolis Colts January 2005 in sports Babe Ruth John Elway Iron Bowl Tom Brady Johnny Unitas Super Bowl XX Terrell Owens Al Michaels Super Bowl II Troy Aikman November 2004 in sports Super Bowl V Jerry Rice Professional American football championship games Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXI Denver Broncos Dan Marino December 2004 in sports Philadelphia Eagles Quizbowl David Beckham Super Bowl XVI Rod Woodson NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl VI Jake Plummer Super Bowl XXXIII Terry Bradshaw Super Bowl XV Warren Sapp Sydney Riot of 1879 Joe Gibbs
