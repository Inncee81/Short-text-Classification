is lsu better than they were last year if you beleive so please state why and if you say matt flynn beat a declining miami team i could care less they did lose to florida and an above average not great auburn team they lost quite a few playmakers as evident by the draft i personally think they are the flavor of the week like last year's auburn team and everybody was wrong about them i think it is just the habit of over ranking sec teams that seems to be happening each year wow they beat tennessee so did penn state wow they beat arkansas so did wisconsin wow they beat notre dame so did usc and michigan with just as much authority i see zero quality wins even though evry person answering this question will say sec rules and not back it up with anything more than look our teams are ranked high deserving voters suck hey lsu balls please do not base your decision solely on stats stats tend to be skewed when ul lafayette and tulane and fresno are involved here are your rankings though since you forgot them scoring d rushing d passing d total d solid and you only lost starters on defense but one was landry and i am glad an lsu fan sec conference admits to having a favorable schedule matt flynn was ranked th by http rivals rivals com viewrank asp not rd you idiot lsu balls he was in the same class as j russell redshirt i guess this does not mean he sucks i do not solely beleive in recruiting rankings but i like to get the story straight or just follow the opposite of lsu balls that was th among quarterbacks kyle wright leak robert lane dennis dixon tommy grady clayton richard and about other guys not named matt flynn hey dude ohio state gets to start off the year th after one loss deserving you be the judge as far as what the other guy said lets not forget that tennesee lost to penn state and arkansas lost to wisconsin a wisconsin team that started th and appeared to be just another unranked team and tennesee appears to be ranked higher to start the season than penn state opinion matters more than games apparently lsu balls i am just taking your answers and adding truth to them i hate when people mix up facts and opinions people need to get their information straight and not just assume a conference is good because people voted them as being better use an open mind lsu is pretty much guaranteed a bcs birth based on their initial rankings i personally feel it could be unfair but then again i am not a voter the guy down my street who only watches cbs unfortunately is a voter last time i called you out and proved your azz wrong your recent comeback is i am too busy making money to get my facts straight i enjoy seeing you struggle to hold your dignity what do you do for a living because i would like a job where i can make up stuff and have people believe in me just because you work at a cash register does not mean you can keep all of the money people give you i hope you make a lot of money because it is sort of like my money to since i own you better or not they will lose to vtech early and never recover it really doesn't matter lsu balls even though he was super sarcastic actually sounded like he made a little sense lsu has one of the softest schedules i can remember but they dump on teams like usc i don't get it San Francisco 49ers USC Trojans Football Cleveland Browns Iron Bowl Super Bowl XXVII Mack Brown New York Jets Louisiana State University National Football League Pittsburgh Steelers October 2005 in sports Fight song Buffalo Bills Southeastern Conference Texas Longhorn Athletics Nick Saban Super Bowl IX College football Major League Baseball television contracts American Football League Super Bowl X Donovan McNabb National Football League Lore Poker jargon Atlantic Coast Conference Baltimore Ravens Carolina Panthers 2004 College World Series St. Louis Rams Joe Paterno Super Bowl XIII December 2004 in sports Big East Conference Super Bowl XXIV Kyle Broflovski Auburn University Super Bowl V Boston College Athletics Norway national football team BCS title game International League College rivalry Karl Rove Super Bowl III The Contender (television series) Appeal Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XVIII Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XIX Steve Nash Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXVI November 2004 in sports Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XIV NFL Draft Brett Favre Plame affair Arkansas Razorbacks New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Sydney Riot of 1879 Big Brother (USA TV series) Kansas City Chiefs World Series Time Out of Mind Yao Ming American football Satchel Paige Kasparov versus The World Game show September 2005 in sports NBA Finals Boston Red Sox Democratic Party (United States) Super Bowl XXXIV Make money fast Super Bowl XVII Jeopardy!
