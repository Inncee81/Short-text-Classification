who would win the ' hurricanes or the ' huskers wouldn't this be a great game i think it would be a great game since both teams basically steam rolled all of their competition in their respected years i kinda think the canes would take this even though the huskers scored more points in their championship year i think miami's defense would be able to control the huskers offense and pull it off i would agree with you here the reason why is the overall games of how balance the canes is they got a great defense that can stop the run and the pass and the special team is great as well and the hurricanes got more overall speed on the defense too and the offense is well balance lead by willis mcgahee games and the huskers are just power run one dimensional games the option which the canes can easily stop the run because of the great speed of that team to proof it no one is using the option run anymore because teams have figure out how to stop them i say canes win hand down Volleyball Miami Hurricanes Football Buffalo Bills Water polo Cleveland Browns Cincinnati Bengals American football Glossary of American football Table tennis Pittsburgh Steelers Softball New York Giants Super Bowl XIV Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl IX National Football League Lore Ultimate (sport) Rugby union Boxing Carolina Hurricanes Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXV NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 New England Patriots San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XVII Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXXV NBA Finals Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXVII National Football League Super Bowl VI Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXXVI Ice hockey Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXXI Team Fortress Classic Basketball Super Bowl XXXIII September 2005 in sports Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXIII Larry Bird Super Bowl V New York Jets Alex Rodriguez Super Bowl XXXIV American Football League Super Bowl XIII International League Indianapolis 500 Super Bowl XXXVIII New York Knicks Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXVI American football strategy Bowl Championship Series World Series Super Bowl XXII Counter-Strike English cricket team St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XII Super Bowl II Super Bowl XXVIII Offensive team Los Angeles Kings Baltimore Ravens Michael Jordan Rugby league Donovan McNabb GunBound Steve Nash Willis McGahee Norway national football team Chicago White Sox Baseball Running back Golf Utah Jazz University of Miami Iron Bowl Tennis Kasparov versus The World Toronto Raptors Boston Red Sox Super Bowl VIII Touch football (rugby league) Canadian football
