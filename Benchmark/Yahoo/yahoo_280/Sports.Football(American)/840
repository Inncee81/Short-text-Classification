with starters returning does ucla stand a chance at being a contender this year i love college football and on paper ucla looks like they could have a great team this year what do you think taking a look at their schedule thanks cruiser id say they have a great shot at a good bowl but i just dont see them beating cal and usc cruiser makes a good point w the or st game but i think or st has been an up and down team they beat a team they should lose to and then will lose to a team they should kill i wouldnt be surprised if ucla went into corvalis and pulled out a win with that said i also woudlnt be surprised to see them finish w only losses they may be the best conference rd place team in the country imagine them pulling off the upset over cal and go into the usc game undefeated asuming usc is also undefeated that would be awesome as much as i hate ucla and nd i always cheer for them when theyre not playing usc id love for both teams to only have loss every year and have that loss be to usc id love to spoil theyre seasons just like ucla spoiled ours last year as a fan that feels soooo good Bowl Championship Series USC Trojans Football Sam Barry Mack Brown Texas Longhorn Athletics University of Southern California Cincinnati Bengals New York Giants Super Bowl Pittsburgh Steelers St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXVII Boston College Athletics Pacific Ten Conference Joe Paterno Hayden Fry 2005 English cricket season New York Jets New England Patriots The Contender (television series) November 2004 in sports Indianapolis Colts Carolina Panthers December 2004 in sports Indiana Pacers Buffalo Bills University of California, Los Angeles Fight song NBA Finals Paul Levesque Nick Saban Playoff New York Knicks Denver Broncos Houston Nutt Miami Dolphins October 2005 in sports College football National Football League Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Matt Leinart Kansas City Chiefs Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics English cricket team Toronto Raptors National Football League Lore Brian Close Michael Jordan Big East Conference Ken Jennings Philadelphia 76ers Montreal Canadiens Houston Rockets Toronto Blue Jays International cricket in 2005 Bear Bryant Kurt Angle San Francisco 49ers British Columbia Lions Bobby Knight Norway national football team Damon Allen Chicago Bulls Michigan Wolverines Troms__ I.L.
