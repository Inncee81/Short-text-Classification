question why people dis good basketball players why do people dis great baketball players and say example pgoint gaurds say player a avergerd pts assist stls a game no ring but never had a supporting cast around him and his team never had a chance go anywhere and dudring his time fans all ways said man his team suck and den why do player b averge pts assists wins championships plays with a big man and he has an all star supporting cast his team is always favorite win the title and in the 'ship he plays the same as the season wh can't player a be better than player b player be benifeted from having a good supporting cast who' a better player since this is ho ys say bill russell who only had beat teams win a championship gets credit over guys like wilt who dominated against russelle but russell temams was better or sayin tim duncan in his prime is better than shaq and shaq averaged almost pts a game in his prime winning is important but not when the guys aren't equally talented because the fans the media the organization the coach and the players all have one major goal from the beginning of the season and that is to win a championship the goal title is often emphasized instead of the journey preseason season playoffs a player could lead the league in any or many categories win numerous mvp or defensive player of the year awards be an all star selection many times or selected for all nba team or nba defensive st team many times in their career but it would all go to waste if they never won a championship it would mean that player was a good individual player kobe anyone but he did not have what it takes to get his team over the hump what is it that separates a wilt chamberlin from a michael jordan we all know wilt was far more dominating in his days that they had to change the rules to curve his effectiveness i'm pretty sure he had at least or basketball stars on of his teams during his career but he never managed to form a dynasty the way michael has that just shows you power of team's effectiveness is far more greater than an individual talent is towards a championship i do agree with you that wilt chamberlin was a far more complete player and the most dominant center to ever play the game in comparison to bill russell but defensive wise bill was at the head of the pack because he was able to slow wilt down enough so his teammates can score more points on the offensive end if you were to put chamberlin in this day and age and you pair him up with a kobe bryant or a dwyane wade you could be looking at multiple championships or even a potential dynasty boston had too much talent back then and the luck of the irish seems to be getting them lucky most of the time because now they've added all stars to play alongside another one in paul pierce to be lucky enough to be considered not just a good but an nba great player you need to have talent and you need to be in the right place at the right time imagine if kobe never got drafted by an l a team that had a shaq in his prime at the time imagine if mj never retired imagine if shaq never got traded to miami imagine if magic never got drafted by a team that featured kareem and worthy how many players would miss out on winning an nba title so talent can only get you so far but sometimes you need a little ok a lot of luck to get far in this league sometimes that means being given the opportunity to play for a championship contending team as a rookie where you don't have to shoulder much of the burden for your team's success or it could mean being in the right place like sam cassell in houston at the right time like robert horry in his different championship teams no matter how you put it being very talented doesn't always guarantee a championship or a hall of fame status but if you're talented you're lucky and you overcome obstacles thrown in your path then your chances of becoming a successful nba legend is pretty darn good Dallas Cowboys Rasheed Wallace St. Louis Cardinals January 2005 in sports Philadelphia 76ers Kansas City Chiefs Hakeem Olajuwon Tim Duncan San Francisco 49ers Jerry Lucas Houston Astros Allen Iverson Phil Jackson Super Bowl IX LeBron James American Football League Minnesota Vikings Golden State Warriors Wayne Gretzky Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXV National Football League Lore Baseball New Mexico Lobo Basketball St. Louis Rams Pete Rose Women's National Basketball Association Minnesota Timberwolves Cincinnati Reds Emanuel Gin__bili Norway national football team Boston Bruins Super Bowl X Continental Basketball Association Karl Malone Chicago White Sox Charles Barkley Luther Head Atlanta Braves Super Bowl XXVI Boston Red Sox Baltimore Ravens College basketball NBA Draft Dirk Nowitzki Detroit Red Wings Toronto Blue Jays New York Jets Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl VI Seattle Mariners Syracuse University Orange Super Bowl XXIII Florida Marlins International League
