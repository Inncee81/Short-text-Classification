which nba team do you think has the best fans alright i don't even think this is close i think the lakers have the best fans by far and i don't even live in l a i went to a game there when i was on vacation and the crowd was absolutley nuts i mean they sell out every game and the fans are nuts so i gotta give it to them who do you think has the best fans don't say golden state because they only supported them for one year you've probably never been a golden state game so maybe that is why you've formulated such a bias conclusion if you were to attend one oakland's playoff game even before they beat dallas this year you could be finding yourself standing the whole game just so you won't miss out on an important play or basket the noise is just so loud you may even need earplugs the next time you attend the golden state warriors have the best fans because even though we've been through a year playoff drought but when it comes postseason time you know the fans will always be there NBA Finals New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Philadelphia 76ers Houston Rockets Golden State Warriors San Antonio Spurs 2005 NBA Finals Utah Jazz Los Angeles Clippers Playoff Miami Dolphins Rasheed Wallace Michael Jordan Boston Red Sox Steve Nash National Football League New Jersey Nets Minnesota Timberwolves 1986 NBA Draft Los Angeles Lakers January 2005 in sports National Football League Lore December 2004 in sports Dream Team Julius Erving Super Bowl Cleveland Browns Pat Riley Yao Ming 1987 World Series St. Louis Rams New England Patriots Detroit Pistons Derek Jeter Chicago Bulls November 2004 in sports Kansas City Chiefs Phoenix Suns Detroit Red Wings Shaquille O'Neal Los Angeles Kings National Hockey League rivalries 2004 American League Championship Series Boston Bruins St. Louis Blues (hockey) International League 2005 NBA Playoffs New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Oakland Athletics Reggie Jackson Orlando Magic Denver Nuggets NBA Draft Toronto Blue Jays Vince Carter Cincinnati Bengals Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Philadelphia Eagles Minnesota Vikings Cleveland Indians 2005 World Series Emanuel Gin__bili Mario Lemieux St. Louis Cardinals American Football League Derek Fisher Oakland Raiders Chinese Basketball Association 1981 baseball strike Major League Baseball television contracts New York Jets Dallas Mavericks Curse of the Bambino Seattle Mariners Women's National Basketball Association Los Angeles Dodgers 1986 National League Championship Series Toronto Raptors Continental Basketball Association Carolina Panthers Philadelphia Flyers Chicago White Sox Cotton Fitzsimmons Baltimore Ravens Toronto Maple Leafs Super Bowl XXVI ESPN25 The Malice at The Palace National Hockey League Milwaukee Bucks Karl Malone NBA Live series
