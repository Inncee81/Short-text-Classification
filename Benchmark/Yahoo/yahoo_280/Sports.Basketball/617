why is it that people are always on the jordans titles and never really say anything about russel who has the most championships then anyone in sports i no eras may have somthing to do with it but but i dont think jordan is the greatest player to play the game i would say wilt or russel one avereged points a game in a season scored pts and is a great defender and one was a great winner leader defender rebounder blocker and jus cuz jordan wins titles and hit buzzer shots which i do still admire why do they make it seem like jordan is better then russel or chamberlin everyone is always comparing someone to jordan and the truth is there can only be jordan and kobe and i would never put jordan a top dunker maybe or so my conclusion is michael jeffery jordan is not the greatest player in the nba in my opinion right on i have been tryin to ppl that if not russell its abdul jabbar he is amazing on the court top dunkers vince carter julius erving larry nance dominique wilkins josh smith Boston Celtics Larry Bird Kevin McHale NBA Finals Houston Rockets Lakers-Celtics rivalry Los Angeles Lakers Minnesota Timberwolves New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Julius Erving Philadelphia 76ers Gary Payton (basketball) Michael Jordan Wilt Chamberlain Chicago Bulls Kobe Bryant Ramon Rivas Dream Team Flip Saunders Basketball 2005 NBA Finals Los Angeles Clippers Phoenix Suns New Jersey Nets Dennis Johnson Bill Walton Yao Ming Essendon Football Club Allen Iverson NBA Live series Steve Nash National Basketball Association Bill Russell (basketball) Tim Duncan Rangers F.C.
