who's better who's a better pg nash changes the game and jason kidd does people say nash nash has won mvp's kidd should've won when he took new jersey to the finals the first time nash is great but remember he had the offense and players tailored made just to his abilities remember when he was with dallas and be for e thet he was jus considered a top pg now he's the best but if u look at it closely jason kidd can be a top pg in any sysytem and he can rebound get steals same number assisist compared the scrubs he msotly plays with other than richard i can't shoot jefferson and carter so if u look at it jason kidd is the best pg but u can make a good argument steve fuckin nash lol i agree with rey and b nut by far because their complete analysis really hits the spot nash may have won mvp awards but i don't think he was ever the best point guard to play for the suns kevin johnson was the team that kidd took the nba finals years ago with kenyon martin richard jefferson kerry kittles dwarfs in comparison to the team nash currently runs with amare matrix bell diaw barbosa even though it's true that many players have improved their careers playing with steve like bell barbosa quentin richardson joe johnson but the same can be said of jason kidd what happened to kerry kittles after he got traded from new jersey to the clippers was kenyon martin the same player after he left new jersey and signed that fat contract with denver even richard jefferson would become a nobody if he were foolishly to go anywhere else like nash those who played alongside kidd have seen their points and field goal percentage productivity increase thanks to the easy opportunity jason creates granted kidd has never won an nba title but so hasn't nash nash can shoot lights out from the perimeter but kidd can drive and finish plays or dish it to a teammate for an easy layup nash can not finish a play on his own which was exposed by the san antonio spurs in the playoffs this past season when they chosed to single coverage him with bruce bowen the spurs glued the rest of the other players to nash's teammate to make it almost impossible for the suns point guard to pass it to them if jason kidd were in that situation he'd be putting up points in a hurry thanks to the single coverage situation a point guard who can't score at will can not be a threat to penetrate and open up the perimeter for shooters on the outside when you factor in the the fact that steve isn't a reliable defender nor does he help out on the boards you will see just how valuable kidd is as an asset to his team the sun's system really catered towards nash's strength and weaknesses but it doesn't mean he is the best point guard in the nba that title belongs to baron davis January 2005 in sports Cincinnati Bengals Jason Kidd Dream Team Indiana Pacers Utah Jazz Pittsburgh Steelers Minnesota Timberwolves Houston Rockets Miami Dolphins Shaquille O'Neal Toronto Raptors December 2004 in sports National Basketball Association Rasheed Wallace Super Bowl XXI 1986 NBA Draft 2005 NBA Finals New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets New England Patriots Buffalo Bills Julius Erving Hank Aaron Orlando Magic Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXVI San Francisco 49ers Basketball Dallas Mavericks Emanuel Gin__bili Boston Red Sox World Series Cleveland Browns NBA Draft David Robinson (basketball player) Kenyon Martin 1957 World Series Dennis Rodman Super Bowl XXIV Luther Head Mario Lemieux National Football League Lore Toronto Blue Jays Kansas City Chiefs Houston Astros July 2004 in sports Detroit Tigers Alex Rodriguez Denver Nuggets St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XIX National Football League Super Bowl XXIII Water polo Robert Horry Kobe Bryant Wayne Gretzky San Francisco Giants Super Bowl XIII Charles Barkley Glossary of American football Three-point field goal Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXXIV Pete Rose 2004 World Series Baseball Super Bowl I Andr__s Galarraga New York Yankees Super Bowl XXXIII Playoff New York Jets Amare Stoudemire Slam Dunk Contest Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XVI Oakland Athletics Super Bowl X Karl Malone Super Bowl XV
