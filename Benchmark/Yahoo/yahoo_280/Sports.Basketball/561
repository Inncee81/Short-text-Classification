i love basketball and im help me i just turned and i love basketball i can do tricks ending in lay ups or close range shots but in the ymca gym i can barely get in a freethrow by jumping i hate that is there anyway i can get better at shooting a basketball because i have good form and position but still i have to resort into bad form in a game so i could get in a good pointer which i would probably miss is there any way if so please define and i was wondering do weights stunt your growth first of all using weights a lot will stunt your growth especially during your age right now i would focus more on aerobic exercises like running biking and jumping rope things that can also help you in basketball for example jumping rope really improves your jumping ability and speed as far as shooting i would suggest learning from the pros try to use the shooting positions of ray allen and allan houston both of them really have nice form and another great shooting aid especially for free throws is dr tom amberry's method here's his website http www freethrow com index htm and you can look for his video online or maybe at your local libraries ok good luck Autograph New Jersey Nets Phoenix Suns Time Out of Mind Nottingham Forest F.C.
