is yao ming overrated what do you guys think about yao ming do you think he is overrated and that the rockets should have at least title by now give me some good reason thank you guys i don't think yao ming is overrated now i'm not saying yao is that great of a center but currently he is the best center in the nba later on dh will be but one thing people are forgetting that as a ' center it isn't that easy to play just look at shawn bradley how did his nba career end up did he ever average over points per game yao is improving his post moves every year and his footwork is excellent for a big man once yao gets into his rhythm it's almost impossible to stop him in the post and it's almost impossible to block his jumper now i'm not saying yao doesn't have any weaknesses because he does he stamina is limited and cannot grab many rebounds due to that yao doesn't have enough energy to hustle for boards yet he averaged about rebounds this past season the reason the rockets have not even gotten out of the st round with the t mac yao or francis yao combo is because they don't have many role players or a good bench but they are improving on that with the addition of steve francis this year i'm betting the rockets will get out of the st round maybe houston was where steve wanted to stay the entire time and will step his playing like he did when he was with them years ago who knows i guess we will have to see in october Houston Rockets Orlando Magic Chicago Bulls NBA Finals Los Angeles Clippers Luther Head Steve Nash Amare Stoudemire Toronto Raptors Tracy McGrady Chinese Basketball Association NBA Draft Basketball Poker jargon Kenyon Martin National Basketball Association Wilt Chamberlain Shaquille O'Neal 1986 NBA Draft December 2004 in sports San Antonio Spurs New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Larry Bird New Mexico Lobo Basketball Center (basketball) Tim Duncan Predrag Stojakovi__ Minnesota Timberwolves Hakeem Olajuwon Equine conformation Dikembe Mutombo Scottie Pippen Kareem Abdul-Jabbar January 2005 in sports Philadelphia 76ers Ben Wallace Utah Jazz 2005 NBA Finals Rasheed Wallace Chris Webber Buck Williams Robert Horry Table tennis Team Fortress Classic Wayne Simien Chess strategy and tactics Denver Nuggets Pittsburgh Steelers Dirk Nowitzki Dennis Rodman Glossary of partner dance terms Indiana Pacers Cincinnati Bengals Betting (poker) Rodney Rogers Boston Bruins Pete Rose Jermaine O'Neal Draw poker Kobe Bryant Pat Garrity Jerry Krause New York Giants Boston Celtics Tris Speaker Doug Collins Pat Riley Skateboarding trick Julius Hodge Patrick Ewing Poker Norway national football team Karl Malone Piccolo Junior Saga Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Chris Dudley Quizbowl Dana Barros February 2005 in sports Miami Dolphins Glossary of American football Texas hold 'em 2004 NBA Finals Danny Fortson The Silence (The Twilight Zone) Swingout Don Nelson Pok__mon Trading Card Game Aerial (dance move) Winning Streak
