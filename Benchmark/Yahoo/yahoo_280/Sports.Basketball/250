i just read that a los angeles radio station said c webb is close to signing with the mavericks has anyone else heard anything on this if so give me a website to go to lol maybe webber and dirk can join forces in choking together at the last second with dirk missing a last shot like he always does while webber grabs the rebound and calls a timeout that the team doesn't have ok that was kind of cruel but it was funny hahaha Twin Cities Public Television
