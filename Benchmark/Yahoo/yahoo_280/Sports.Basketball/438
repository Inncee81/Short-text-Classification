what is with all of these old and retired nba players returning to play kevin willis penny hardaway and now reggie charles oakley and allan houston are thinking about returning don't get me wrong i like all of them but physically they can't perform the way they used to i think allan houston is going to make the biggest impact as a spot up shooter with a very deadly shot he'll be effective off the bench reggie can't run anymore and it will be easy for teams to put a defender on him standing at the three point line charles oakley is a joke penny's quickness is gone and i think he'll become frustrated with his limited mobility but pat riley did sign him so theres a huge chance that i'm wrong reggie miller definitely won't be coming back allan houston and penny hardaway had to leave the nba early because of injuries if they hadn't had injuries they might have already been playing charles oakley is a delusional old man ESPN January 2005 in sports Electronic Arts Kevin Garnett December 2004 in sports EA Sports November 2004 in sports Monday Night Football George Mikan June 2004 in sports The NBA on NBC HyperText Transfer Protocol Bobby Knight Tim Duncan Minnesota Timberwolves 2004 NBA Finals October 2004 in sports April 2005 in sports National Basketball Association Larry Bird June 2005 in sports Boston Celtics Amare Stoudemire Women's National Basketball Association February 2005 in sports Sports timeline July 2004 in sports March 2005 in sports NBA Finals Madden NFL Shaquille O'Neal ESPN NFL Football Archie Moore Al Michaels Wilt Chamberlain Mullet (haircut) Michael Jordan Major League Baseball television contracts Stormfront Studios Shaun Livingston Kevin Nash Emanuel Gin__bili Dream Team August 2004 in sports Dream Job (Season 2) Power forward (basketball) Sextant Bill Simmons Around the Horn Family Guy Pete Maravich 1990s Phoenix Suns Hunter S.
