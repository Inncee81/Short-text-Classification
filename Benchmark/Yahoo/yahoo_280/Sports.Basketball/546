your opinion spurs or pistons who's more boring the spurs or pistons cause they have similar styles of team play similar style they both play physical and effective team defense with the pistons being slightly dirty whereas the spurs are very dirty pistons play a guard centered offense that is highly team oriented and relies on screens and offensive sets also prince sheed rip and billups take about the same no of shots and shoot from almost the same spots on the floor they're a jump shooting team who prefer the footer with of them having point range and they're not very effective at scoring inside the spurs are so radically different on offense san antonio's offense revolves around tim duncan either he scores over his man or he gets doubled and passes it out or if he fails to score over his man then the refs call a foul and he gets free throws the spurs play an inside outside game with a highly effective slasher distributing kicking out the ball and a dominate inside player much like the miami offense revolves around shaq and wade the spurs use duncan and parker only without the dunks and personality it's not our fault they have the personalities of rocks the nba is a source of entertainment it's a viewers' sport and the big statue and le boring need to at least trash talk a bit after they win to show that they've got some spunk i know that knee in the groin or foot you stuck under that jump shooter is a way of letting your actions on the court speak for you but i'd really rather hear duncan diss someone in an interview however as a comparison between the two a defensive jump shooting team with few dunks few fast breaks and not a lot of blocks gets the nod as being more boring the spurs are pretty exciting when you watch ginobili come off the bench he can flop to the floor before any opponent even noticed he came off the bench he can tumble in a heap when the other guy's feet ahead of him and moving in the opposite direction and amazingly the refs still give him free throws oh and he can also hit wild layups and knock down the lefty style horry and bowen are also prone to violence and injury of other players giving the spurs the bad attitude they need reminiscient of the pistons bad boys era parker can make circus layups and duncan can use the glass of course duncan can block shots which is always a plus because i love blocks sheed doesn't nearly block as much and they've lost ben who woulda given pistons the edge in dunking shot blocking energy plays and watching him take free throws and wondering how many he'll brick or whether his shot will even hit the rim Tottenham Hotspur F.C.
