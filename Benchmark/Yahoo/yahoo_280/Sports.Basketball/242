do you think that nowitzki's game has decreased i am a dallas fan and a big supporter in nowitzki but in the past two years or so i've have seen his game decrease in certain ways don't get me wrong because i still see him as an awesome basketball player but what i'm really saying is that i've saw much better in him a little bit longer ago but i still am happy for him that he's recieved that mvp i just think it came two years a little too late what i'm also saying is his performance can be really low when it matter's the most say when he lacked his game in the nba finals i usually look at average steals per game and average blocked shots per game to tell when a player has lost a step dirk had career lows as a starter in steals and blocks per game looking at dirk's stats other than his fg his three point fg and his ft dirk had his best year in years as a nba starter in shooting but still duncan outshot dirk from the field by and nash outshot dirk by from the field while nash outshot dirk by about from three point land dirk shot his normal from the free throw line as did nash shoot right at dirk's steals and blocks per game as a starter were way down to his lowest level ever as a starter with one of dirk's worst years in rebounding and dirk's lowest three point fg output as dirk only made three point fgs for the entire regular season dirk has a rep as a three point shooter but only made three pointers over an game regular season this past year dirk had his lowest scoring average in his last three years and his second to lowest scoring average in his last last five years in summary dirk had one of his worst years ever as a starter in the nba and was given the mvp i would not disagree with your comment if dirk received his mvp two years ago in but dirk receiving the mvp for the season is ridiculous in one of dirk's worst years as a year nba starter i think that this year's mvp for dirk was a makeup call for not giving dirk the mvp two years ago while i feel that steve nash earned the mvp a year ago in with amare out all year while in steve nash had just about a career year across the board with personal bests in almost every statistical category including his highest scoring average and his most assists per game average i do not see how steve nash could receive the mvp but be denied the mvp award for nash having his best year ever in the nba during the regular season dirk's stellar year which i agree with you was in which was of mvp caliber but dirk in my opinion lost about two steps between the season and his mvp year where dirk only scored three pointers all year i agree entirely with your comments and would not object had dirk received the mvp in even though dirk's season was one of his worst as a nba starter the mvp voting in my opinion should have gone as follows steve nash tim duncan dirk i do not jump on avery johnson's bandwagon where he stated that the mvp is the best player on the best team in the league as that is the first time i have heard that definition for a mvp in any sport nash in set personal bests in points per game assists per game fg three point fg and his typical or so ft not to mention another outstanding year in rebounding nash had a career year in dirk in was at a career low in many categories near career lows in other categories and with average statistics at least for dirk in most other categories i firmly believe that the mvp award was a makeup for not giving it to dirk in but dirk did not deserve the mvp in as dallas won all of those games with a very long bench of at least players contributing in every game which resulted in dallas excellent regular season record Cincinnati Bengals Michael Jordan David Robinson (basketball player) Donovan McNabb Luther Head Los Angeles Clippers Basketball Super Bowl XXVII Houston Rockets Shaquille O'Neal 2005 NBA Finals Wilt Chamberlain Wayne Gretzky Toronto Raptors January 2005 in sports Utah Jazz San Francisco 49ers New England Patriots World Series Mario Lemieux New Jersey Nets 1957 World Series Allen Iverson Pat Garrity Pittsburgh Steelers New Mexico Lobo Basketball Ben Wallace Andrew Bogut Julius Erving Super Bowl IX Dallas Mavericks Super Bowl XXVI Three-point field goal Baseball Toronto Blue Jays Hank Aaron Rasheed Wallace National Football League New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Super Bowl XIV Ty Cobb Sandy Koufax Super Bowl XII Chicago White Sox Super Bowl XXI Minnesota Timberwolves Dream Team Chicago Blackhawks Super Bowl XIII St. Louis Rams Kansas City Chiefs Dikembe Mutombo Volleyball Troy Glaus Super Bowl XXXVI Baseball statistics Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl V Randy Johnson Super Bowl XXV Scottie Pippen Karl Malone Batting average Buffalo Bills Jerry Lucas Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Robert Horry Detroit Tigers Gary Payton (basketball) Pete Rose Pedro Mart__nez Eurobasket 2005 Wayne Simien Julius Hodge Seattle Mariners December 2004 in sports Philadelphia 76ers Hakeem Olajuwon
