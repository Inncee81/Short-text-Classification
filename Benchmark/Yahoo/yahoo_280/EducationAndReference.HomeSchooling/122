my daughter's father my ex husband won't consider homeschooling do you have any advice i would be the one homeschooling her and i plan to change the way i earn a living to be able to have the time everyday to spend with her she is about to begin the rd grade and has been in different schools so far for various reasons the school she attended in nd grade and will continue in unless i can do something about has math and reading average standards of about each when the national average is about approx you see she is a very bright child and has always been not bragging it's just the truth she's always gotten a's and b's and would get honor roll except that she loves to talk can't ask for everything lol i tried to explain that the curriculm in the school was obviously a problem and that it didn't matter if she got a's and b's if the work was easy basically she needs and deserves to be challenged it's very hard here to find a great school with space for her most go by an annual lottery which does not give us good odds of her getting in do your research you don't need a teaching degree all of the teachers in her school have one so what happened to thosed kids are you saying that they are all the problem she loves to talk didn't say it was a problem or that i was trying to fix it i plan to put her in activities that she can't do if we don't get home from school and work until about pm and she goes to bed at there's homework dinner bath and geez that's about all there's time for if i'ld be home with her all day teaching and spending time with her why should i not do that instead of spending about hours together each day during the week much of which is spent running around and doing things to get ready for tomorrow there is no time for fun except on the weekends when she wants to hang out with her grandmom plus she spends time with her dad this way we will have the time for quality time and enjoying each other not every school has gifted programs and even when they said they would put her in an advanced reading class they didn't do anything very differently then the regular reading class as i also said it is very hard in this area first of all to find a good school second of all that will have a space for her how many schools do i keep trying now that can't be good for her were we live they have better schools for middle school kids and if they works out she might be back in school in years and we definitely some really good high schools but she is going to need the credentials to get in the school why pick a kid with a's and b's from a bad school when you can get them from good schools instead littlebarb her teaching credentials include being her daughter's mother she seems to have actually graduated the grade she'll be teaching her one and only student and it sounds like she's able to research and read a teacher's manual in third grade it's not terribly difficult to teach one student not knowing her or her situation other than what is written i find it pretty antagonistic that you would judge her so harshly please get the facts on homeschooling rather than just the stereotypes on to our regularly scheduled question if you have sole custody it's really your decision your ex though he can state that he disagrees wouldn't have much of a say in it if you're in a joint custody situation though that could get a bit sticky you may need to get your attorney involved i understand where you're coming from i pulled my son in first grade for the same reason he was years ahead of his class and very verbal and quite frankly he wasn't learning a thing he was bored silly his teacher not knowing how to handle him threatened to recommend adhd testing and medication it was starting to take more time calming him down from his day at school and unlearning the habits that he was being taught than it does to homeschool him for bright kids especially the ones that don't fit neatly into their school's gifted class pattern homeschooling can be a great option my son is starting th grade at age he is on grade level in a few subjects and on a th th grade level in others he is also dyslexic he is very verbal very hands on and our school system just plain isn't able to accomodate him the majority of the teachers in our district are just not trained to work with gifted kids much less those who don't sit still and listen at all times i'm not saying they're bad teachers many of them are very good but gifted education is a whole different ballgame gifted kids deserve an education on their level but it's not always available in the classroom i would suggest contacting hslda the link is below they are very well versed in the laws in every state and they can tell you what you need to do they can also most likely put you in touch with a homeschool group in your area that can help you http www hslda org default asp bhcp good luck with everything it sounds like you're doing the right thing GED Milton H.
