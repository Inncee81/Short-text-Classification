public school private school homeschool pros cons first it will be helpful to recognize that there are differences among the three general categories you've listed these differences may be in terms of philosophy curriculum rigour or policy some of these things will overlap between the public and private school universes it is quite possible to have both traditional and progressive schools in either the private or the public sector there are liberal arts schools in the public sector and there are vocational schools in the private sector one should also bear in mind that the term public school can include charter schools and various tax subsidized alternatives to the traditional neighborhood school having said that the public school is tax subsidized so the student's family doesn't have to pay tuition generally there are some fees but they tend to be small public schools are required to accept all students that live within their neighborhood area can typically reject students from outside that area geographic segregation and have to justify expelling a students that is disruptive or maladjusted to the school all races and socio economic groups must be treated in an egalitarian fashion which often results in confused values and watered down curricula the curriculum in a public school can be set at the state level the school district level or the school level and is often driven by political forces public schools as a socialized institution typically disconnect the family the education consumer from the producer the school economically eliminating the feedback that a market can provide as a result the legislative bodies over schools typically enact accountability measures these typically have mediocre success and always result in administrative overhead that removes resources from the classroom the private school is usually funded through a combination of tuition and donations a trade off must exist between the resources of the school and the cost to the family some of these schools offer assistance and scholarships to those in need those that can pay more are apt to attend better schools resulting in better educations for their children since the school is dependant on the payment of tuition these schools are directly accountable to the families that pay to send their children and must satisfy them paying the tuition also results typically in a higher motivation to succeed in the student private schools can be either religious or secular though there are more religious schools than non religious as a result private school curricula often reflects the values and ideaologies of the sponsoring organization there is concern that such schools may not provide an appropriate balance in representing other viewpoints private schools tend to be more elitist than their public counterparts private schools tend to emphasize academics and generally don't have athletics and other non or extra curricular programs unless there is a source of funding for them usually in the form of donations private schools are not geographically segregated and typically don't provide student transportation with the result that it is often necessary to commute fairly large distances to deliver and pick up students schools are free to determine their own admitance policies and can reject or expell students that don't fit within the schools business model curriculum decisions are made by the school its sponsoring organization and must be responsive to the demands of the market nevertheless the private school patron must accept the offering from a particular school or take his or her business elsewhere there are too many different variations of homeschool to list individual pros and cons in general terms homeschool is a decision to take personal responsibility for the education of the child every pro for one person could be a con for someone else but that someone else may choose a different path which will negate the whole issue anyway a typical critic of homeschool will argue that there are fewer resources available to the homeschool student than there would be in a school environment or that homeschool children are not as well socialized as their schooled peers on the other hand a typical proponent of homeschool will claim that there are more resources available and that homeschooled children are better socialized because they aren't subject to the artificial reality of age segregated classrooms and the other non real world conditions that exist in the school especially public school setting the reality is that the availabity of resources and the level of social education is dependant on the individual situation the real answer to you question depends on what you want in the education of your child Students'
