i have this horrible fear of throwing up can i stop it i can actually pinpoint when it started back in fourth grade the stomach flu was going around and i was avoiding everyone who got it so much i actually stayed away from them i was afraid every time someone coughed they would throw up too now it's not so bad when someone says they feel sick i tell myself 'what if you didn't hear them say that you would never have known or worried' and it works somewhat i have a feeling that if i throw up naturally i'll get over it but i haven't thrown up in years and i don't want to force myself to throw up but is there an alternate way of getting over it this is actually kind of embarrassing for me to ask this but i know i'm not the only one and i just want to get rid of this fear please help also i'm not sure if i put this in the right category but this is my first time asking a question here lol i don't know if i can actually answer your question i have the same fear of throwing up and when people do it makes me want to as well it helps me to close my eyes and just breath really deep perhaps even use ice to cool u off and shock you a little into not thinking about it if you actually are sick and the sickness causes throwing up its aweful i know but it does kinda help your body get better quicker so just think ok i have to otherwise i'm gonna be sick forever even though it may not be true lol but something to that affect i hope i helped a little best wishes Night (book) Milton H.
