i'm not sure what i'm experiencing all last fall and winter i was really depressed to the pint where i didn't even want to get out bed anymore all i did was sleep i could sleep until in the afternoon and turn around and take a nap at it was getting too out of hand i didn't want to tell my parents because i was afraid that i would tell them and find out there was nothing wrong with me i didn't want to feel stupid so i just hoped it would go away i was a the point where i needed to get help then around spring my mood started to change i would go to school some days sometimes lasting a week and i'd be crazy happy it was weird then other weeks i'd be depressed and i angered easily now its summer and i feel fine like nothing was wrong in the first place sometimes i get really down but for the most part i'm pretty happy sometimes i get a little crazy and i talk alot which isn't really like me i'm a pretty quiet person i get in these crazy moods i'm just wondering if anyone has any idea what this is at first your symptoms sounded like sad seasonal affective disorder it makes you down in winter and back up in spring then you mentioned the fast talking and crazy moods that sounds more like manic depression which is an illness of mood swings at it's extremes it can actually give hallucinations paranoia speedy talking and super happiness for little reason the depression is like any severe depression only a psychiatrist can diagnose this illness my ideas are just some experience and a few classes i'm surprised your parents haven't noticed are you always awake and alert when they are home you do need to talk to them you should make an appointment with a mental health professional to determine if you do need more treatment and perhaps supportive drug therapy ask for help tell your parents what's been going on with you for the last year i'm sure they will want to help you Bipolar disorder Clinical depression Psychosis Traumatic brain injury Sleep Schizophrenia Narcolepsy Methamphetamine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychiatric hospital Milton H.
