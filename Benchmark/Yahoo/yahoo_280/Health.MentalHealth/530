is something wrong i've been shy my whole life but the past few years it's gotten out of control at school i don't say anything i just sit at my desk while everyone around me jokes with their friends it used to bother me alot but i'm so used to having no one to talk to now i feel like that's just how it is when i say i don't talk i mean it i don't say anything i can't i don't know how to talk to people i don't think they'll like me and i'm so afraid of saying something stupid that i just keep quiet i used to spend lunch period in the bathroom because it was better than sitting by myself even when people do talk to me i think they don't really want to or they are just making fun of me i want to connect with people but i can't being like this has made me really depressed my parents don't get it they think i just need to talk more and everything will be fine but i can't i get really mean and i'm aware i am but i can't help it i just can't stand being this way anymore please help i've been the same way before it could be a form of social anxiety you think that people are constantly watching and judging you all the time i know how problematic those feelings can be if you want you can message me and talk about it describe more of the feelings you've been having and the types of thoughts you encounter while out in public chances are i've had them before too i wish you the best Social rule Shaggy dog story Friends Columbine High School massacre Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye Anxiety George Costanza Kodocha The Smoking Room Milton H.
