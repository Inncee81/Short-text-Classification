im terrified of someone breaking into my house i was home alone for the night once im and somebody broke in they stole some stuff and had a gun i hid out silently crying behind the little crack behind my couch now i have a horrible fear of being alone of night and worst of all burglers how can i heal and get over my fears the best advice i can give to you is when you know your mom or dad isn't going to be home spend the night somewhere else or beg your parents for a watch dog that is horrible i feel so sorry for you arm yourself with a baseball bat and some pepper spray keep the spray under your pillow also keep your bedroom door shut and locked if you have a lock on it my aunt used to keep a glass with some forks and spoons in it by her windows so that she would hear someone if they tried to get in the best defense is to take self defense it will help you not to feel like a victim but will give you the confidence to fight back if you need to good luck sweetie Fancy Crane Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sin City The Shining (film) Signs Jam (TV series) Miss Saigon The Inside Baseball Babe Ruth Richard Chase Shaggy dog story Blood Simple W.I.T.C.H.
