is bullying 'belittling someone and making yourself superior or more powerful' in this story bully or not my brother made alot of belittling jokes to me and argued with my over life and parenting decisions and made me feel embarrassed and inferior i told him this is how i felt and please stop my brother was rude in return and said that i can't take a joke so i told him i and my children felt bullied and to stop or stay out of our lives he got very angry and phoned me and was swearing and yelling when he stopped i said a few things and he started yelling again and swearing i listened for awhile and finally hung up so he emailed me 'i love you and will forever but until you get over your issues and quit creating conflict wherever you go we will never have a normal relationship if you can't get over the past you will die a old alone and bitter woman' i am wondering if that email is another form of bullying it once again made me look inferior and him superior my girlfriend thought this was more bullying but i am not sure so i am wondering what others opinons would be your question really touched me because i've been there i lived years with an abusive sister i was blind because i was taught that that kind of behavior was ok well it isn't i used to make excuses and defended her for years until i actually saw the very real brutal repercussions it was an awful shock and i wondered how i never recognized it people underestimate the damage done by bullies they don't realize the truly destructive wound left by verbal abuse i didn't even realize it was abuse because it wasn't physical this kind of devastation isn't against the body it attacks the soul it destroys the victims from within like being caught by a spider you are slowly wrapped in a web of manipulation lies and deceit once entangled you no longer have the strength to struggle or the will to leave isolated from everything you love they feed on your energy draining you sounds bleak i know but that is how it works people who suffer abuse have many more physical problems and illnesses the things i ve seen now i m trying my best to help prevent and heal abuses you see by the time my sister was done with me there was nothing left she had stripped away my hopes and dreams my pride and endurance my friends and family the list goes on i couldn't even stand to be seen on the street because i felt an embarrassment to my children i ended up with a severe breakdown i believed that i was the problem because abusers make it look like it s the other person it took my children to open my eyes my son had me listen to an atlantis morset song saying it was my sister i believe the song is called perfect i had to listen several times for it to really sink in when i realized what he was trying to tell me it hurt deeply but it wasn't until i caught my daughter mutilating her exquisite body that i knew i had to leave you see my sister s daughter did the same thing when she was young that s when i knew it wasn't me i wasn't the main problem like she led me to believe she was a bully is no joke their cruel intentions h a r m period as for me and my sister well we don't speak my other sisters gave up on her too sad but true i cannot say i don't love her or miss the good times we had but i am so much happier and so are those who've gotten away from her i would like to have helped her but she couldn't hear anything negative about herself she could only point out everything wrong with me plus things that didn't even apply things that were really her i don't want to tell you to stay away from your brother forgiveness became necessary for my healing hate anger and resentments were harming me and my family still separation became my only option after the horrible things she did for myself and my kids it was our only solution here s a poem i wrote after leaving my sister about the power of words beware the words you choose it s not hollow when the bible states in the beginning was the word words divulge opinions and truths they convey the abstract and absurd they help poets compose their poems they can embody a friend or foe enlightening a love of the passion one holds or striking a powerful blow beware oh friend the words you use to cause one pain and sorrow though they suit your needs today you may repent them on the morrow the right words chosen with care can shatter the strongest man they can demolish the brightest dreams and crush the gentle lamb an angry tongue can change your life a life you once enjoyed once harsh words escape your lips they can never be made void it may seem gratifying at the time to bring your love to tears but bitter words can pierce the heart and fester through the years look intensely upon yourself find the scars that lay thereon reminders of ancient wounds though physical pain is gone look now deeply into your heart recall when you were young are there wounds that still ache from words of a hostile tongue merciless vindictive callous words carry a deadly stinger many years may pass away but their painful wound may linger if this was your intent if you're conscious of what s inflicted in wounding another s heart you can t escape unaffected each conquest has a cost it s victory with a double edged sword its harsh bittersweet taste yields a dissonant heart as reward dispensing lies won t help cause your heart knows the truth for the cold hard reality is a brutal heart can t be soothed residue of your words clings to you a gloom you can t escape with each wound that you inflict a darker soul takes shape
