guilt issues anxiety my yr old daughter went to talk to the counselor today to find out what is wrong she has been taking cymbalta for depression for about a year and for the past weeks has had changes in her demeanor lots of anxiety she started a new job weeks ago but never got through a day without crying and then feeling guilty about crying she ended up having to quit because of the tremendous stress she felt at work even though in her own words i don't know why i feel so stressed the job isn't that hard and my boss tells me i'm doing a good job but felt so overwhelmed she didn't think mentally she could continue so the counselor today said she has guilt issues and anxiety she wants to meet with her again to see if they can figure out where the guilt issues stem from she has a very good and stable home life and has never given us an ounce of trouble she hasn't experienced any type of personal trauma or loss and has never been guilted or shamed by us what could cause guilt gretch wow your comment about describes her to a t i can definitely see that being the case with her intro yes she saw a mental health counselor magic i have asked her what she thinks could be the cause of her feeling this way and she says i don't know and i know it sounds ridiculous she really liked the counselor and wants to go back thanks for the into on cymbalta i will be talking to her doctor tomorrow there are many things that could cause guilt i have struggled with this myself throughout the years i am by the way sometimes guilt stems from the anxiety anxiety can cause a person to become obsessive if she is trying very hard to be perfect then slipping up could cause guilt also she is which means she is probably figuring out what to do with her life or might be about ready to leave for college i had that crisis last year at this time and i was also very anxious if this is the case i would just try to be encouraging and help her to build self confidence many times i have had to switch medications because my body would build up a tolerance for them and they would no longer be beneficial you did the best thing you possibly could by taking her to see a counselor for now i would just suggest that you be patient with her if she wants to talk listen if she doesn't want to talk don't push the issue i hope this helps best of luck to you and your daughter Procrastination Psychoanalysis Social rule Friends EastEnders Narcissism Bipolar disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder Anxiety Post-traumatic stress disorder Scenes from a Memory Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Transactional analysis Suicide Kodocha Traumatic incident reduction Alcoholics Anonymous Plame affair Cannabis (drug) Milton H.
