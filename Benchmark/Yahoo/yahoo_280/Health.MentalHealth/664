personality issues i'm really confused ok i can be two very different people at times and it's really concerning me like about two weeks ago i was at the mall with my friend and was very excited and very happy and during the time when she went to go get lunch and got back to me my mood had completlel changed i lost all intrest in the day and didn't even care about anything anymore and what confuses me is nothing happened to trigger these feelings i was just sitting there and it just hit me it happens all the time and it's really starting to worry me plus i have nightmares all the time and i think there are people in my head i'm not kidding they told me their names and everything and we just sort of talk some times one yells at me and is really cold hearted and the other one talks to me like a counseler or something and there's like two more but they barely ever speak i get angry really easily for no reason like someone will ask me a question and i'll just go off and so people tend to not want to get close to me which is fine with me because i really don't care for the human race but also i do i have very different feelings and i feel like i am two people but it's all so confusing does anyone know how to fix this problem mood disorders affective disorders depression mania bipolar disorder the fundamental abnormality of an affective disorder is a disturbance of mood
