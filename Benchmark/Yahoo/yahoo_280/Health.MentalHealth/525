how to talk to counselor about cutting ok to put it plainly i cut like once a week idk if i'm going to get addicted in fact i don't even want to stop i get state a's and my family loves me but i still cut i don't got really any friends well like but iv finally decided to go talk to a school counselor then it hit me how wtf do i just walk in there and be like i'm depressed counsel me i don't think so lol anyone got any ideas ok to specify im im not suicidal and im anot addicted well at least not yet idk i kinda want attention but at the same time i do it for stress i just don't no what to do i don't want to get addicted or anything when i was younger i used to cut too i have over on my body but i've quit cutting for the most part by now since you are only the counsellor will tell your parents about your cutting a lot of counsellors are really silly when it comes to cutting and think it's a suicide attempt or that you'll kill yourself doing it although i've never encountered this personally i've had doctors see my cuts and a psychologist none which made much of a deal about it it was clear i wasn't cutting to kill myself it's really hard to cut 'too deep' and not once did i ever get an infection it's not something that you can get locked up in the psychward for as an adult as a teenager you have like no mental health rights so your parents can get you locked up and even force fed medications on a whim in my experience a psychologist or psychiatrist will like to focus mainly on the issues that cause you to cut yourself cutting on it's own is considered a symptom of an underlying problem not a disorder itself i think they think there's no point in talking about it as a main issue really and i agree it's better to work on the causes of your cutting than worrying about stopping if you focus on the cutting you'll never stop and could even make your problems worse because not being able to quit can cause feelings of guilt shame and helplessness and cutting will be on your mind all the time cutting is a coping mechanism you need to learn better coping mechanisms and keeps on your mind when i was younger i used to really worry about cutting i joined a support group i tried to focus on quitting cutting without worry about my other problems the cutting got worse until i stopped worrying about being a 'cutter' and faced the real issues i think it's probably safer for you to just talk to your school counsellor about your depression issues for now this way you're not risking your parents finding out and all the drama that that may cause or an involuntary hospitalization you say you're depressed so if you work on the depression get help for your depression you should find that you're not cutting as often or even at all Clinical depression Bipolar disorder Psychotherapy Self-harm Transsexuality Ex-gay Anxiety Adult attention-deficit disorder Suicide EastEnders Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Narcissism Prostate cancer Reparative therapy Medicine Mental illness Autism Procrastination Cult Psychiatry Psychoanalysis Chronic fatigue syndrome Psychosis Hikikomori Borderline personality disorder Methamphetamine Sigmund Freud Psychiatric hospital Obsessive-compulsive disorder Tobacco smoking Anti-psychiatry Breastfeeding Unemployment Drug addiction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma About a Boy Drug abuse Post-traumatic stress disorder Abortion Domestic violence Teenage suicide Grief Infantilism Scientology beliefs and practices Panic attack Combat stress reaction Anorexia nervosa Stress (medicine) Childbirth Traumatic brain injury Days of our Lives Friends Meditation Controversies in autism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Deprogramming Hypnosis Shaggy dog story Mental health Aikido Social rule Antidepressant Fathers' rights Kurt Cobain Psychopharmacology Electroconvulsive therapy Stuttering Involuntary commitment Charles Darwin's illness Medical views of suicide Alcoholics Anonymous Hearing impairment Ethics Sleep Paroxetine The Lovely Bones Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Alzheimer's disease Empathy A Course In Miracles Sex education Exit counseling Goodness and value theory Knots Landing Stomach cancer Sexual addiction Binge eating disorder
