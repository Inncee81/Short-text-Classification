why am i having these nightmares i am having nightmares a lot and they concern me they are all about ghosts and dead people and people not knowing that there was even a ghost i just woke up from a dream and can't get back to sleep and here is what happened it was dark i was in my room and i walked into the hallway my moms room is right across the hall and i see a little white figure staring up at me of course i scream and run downstairs to my mom she didn't hear my scream but i guess i was holding a manga and she started reading it random anyways so i was very scared so i grabbed her hand something i always do when i am scared all of a sudden our hands kept like shocking i dunno how to explain it but ever few seconds the screen in my head went black and i saw a little bit of white where our hands are to represent the shocking i woke up of course almost to tears because of how scared i was i realized that i think the shocking may have been my heartbeat interrupting my dream help i recently had a nightmare like this not long ago it was odd me my best friend britany and two elderly people were walking down a hallway i don't know what hallway it was though one part of me remembers it to be a long white hallway one part remembers it to be a long hallway with only a bit of light so anyways there were no windows just doors i think i touched the door handle to open the door and all of a sudden i saw a ghost and i like shocked as if a big wave of electricity went through me it feels like i did it in real life too i fell to the ground in my dream and everyone got down to help me they didn't see the ghost another dream i had was that i was at my grandmas house and it was a huge infestation of ghosts everywhere i guess in the dream i tried to knock myself out or something to get them away from me once i did that i woke up it was a short dream if it helps for the first dream my old friend britany doesn't like me anymore i can't get out of my bed at all after i have a nightmare if i get on the computer or something it's in the corner of the room so i keep looking behind me to make sure nothings there also whenever i see something white ever i get scared even if it's just my eyes tricking me i can't type very well because of my fright at the moment but please ignore i try to think of happy stuff when i wake up from the bad dream but the happy stuff seems to turn into something that i just dreamed about this may be odd but whenever i have one of these nightmares i usually wake up with my teddy bear not in my hands ha ha yes i use a teddy bear it helps but could this be causing it do i just need something to hold onto while i sleep maybe it is a good thing i can't remember all of my dreams if you believe in the spiritual world then these nightmares might mean that you are in tune to that world and these spirits are trying to communicate with you in your next dream try to talk to one of them are you having any life issues that has affected you strongly lately some say that dreams are the brain's way of sorting out the days events try to change your interpretation of the dreams use words that are not as strong instead of ghosts refer to them as spirits the shocks think of it as a tingling sensation i do not know about but some people say that they can control their actions in their dreams you should try that too when you experience the shocks don't fear it but focus on it and focus on what it is doing to you take control of the shock and redirect it somewhere else in regards to your teddy bear does it have a name some people have security items in their life that makes them feel better some have security blankets and some have teddy bears sleeping with a teddy bear provides a 'safe' atmosphere it increases your feeling of security is your teddy bear with you in your dream that you are able to talk about it is a good sign maybe talk to your mom about it dreams are only nightmares when you fear them ie the dream was written for you usually with strong emotions do an edit so that it is not as strong if you take the time to understand the dream then you would not fear them as much The Amber Spyglass Out-of-body experience The Shining (film) Milton H.
