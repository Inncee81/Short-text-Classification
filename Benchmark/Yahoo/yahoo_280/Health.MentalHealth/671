could it be depression my mom is a manic depressive my brother is depressive and everyone in my mom's family is depressed i tend to have a lot of the depression signs by a lot i mean only a few i don't have i am constantly fatigued but also very jittery at the same time like my mind never stops moving and coming up with new ideas but my body feels tired all the time and i am constantly fidgeting the only way to explain this would be the fatigue from depression i am stressed all the time i feel like everything around me is dark and morbid and i am constantly thinking negative thoughts i always demean myself and justify everyone else could i actually have depression or is it just my mind trying to convince me i have depression i have read tons of books about depression and all signs point that i'm depressed but is that because my mind is trying to convince me i am or could i actually be depressed i don't have a song to quote you but i will give you my opinions instead first i think that when we read diagnoses we often then feel like we have the symptoms of whatever it is most people feel depressed at sometime or another for instance if you got fired from your job or your best friend moved away this is situational depression because a specific trigger can be identified however chronic or major depression is ongoing and has to do with the synapses in the brain not connecting i think the fact that you are questioning if you are depressed is reason enough to go to your doctor fact is that depression does run in families as far as feeling jittery and fatiqued at the same time depression often comes with anxiety and irritabiity so my suggestion is to see a doctor or another professional Clinical depression Psychosis Bipolar disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Anxiety Transsexuality Schizophrenia Adult attention-deficit disorder Hypnosis Fibromyalgia Post-traumatic stress disorder Charles Darwin's illness Kurt Cobain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psychiatry Empathy Procrastination Meditation Anorexia nervosa Multiple chemical sensitivity Autism Parkinson's disease Traumatic brain injury Coeliac disease Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Borderline personality disorder Drug addiction Hypoglycemia Alexander Technique Stomach cancer Methamphetamine Traumatic incident reduction David Hume Transactional analysis Theory of conduct Stress (medicine) Sigmund Freud Homeopathy Panic attack Homophobia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Antidepressant Hypertension Cognitive therapy Intelligence quotient Psychoanalysis Alzheimer's disease Sexual orientation Asperger syndrome Self-harm The Catcher in the Rye Narcissism Milton H.
