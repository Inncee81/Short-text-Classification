cure for the blues i have dealt with depression and anxiety since i was probably or and i'm almost now it's getting to be almost too much to handle and i don't know what to do about it i have seen or different therapists and none of them have been able to help none of them have offered to prescribe me anything and i'm not sure i'd want any pills anyway i want to truly feel better not just cover it up with medication i don't know where to turn for help anymore i'm beginning to think that it's not going to get any better i'm tired of not sleeping or eating and crying every day sometimes i really wish that i could just die but i keep holding on i feel like i have nothing to look forward to but i keep hoping it will change i think of how much it would hurt my grandparents if they were still living anyway what is the best thing for me to do to fix me i read that taking st john's wort helps but i haven't tried it yet you sing this song day oh dayyyoh day light come and i want come home come mr talliman tally me bananas Clinical depression St John's wort Antidepressant Transsexuality Jon Secada Psoriasis The Cure Reparative therapy The Band Ex-gay Chronic fatigue syndrome R.E.M.
