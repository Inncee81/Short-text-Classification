can a residential treatment center deny treatment i live here in wi and my child is in need of rtc she's currently misdiagnosed with bipolar and is using substance or substance abuse there is a rtc that will address all of her needs and get her on track to a healthy lifestyle but they say that they don't feel their program would benefit my child this rtc boasts intense therapy in all aspects of their care but they have referred me to out of state in illinois and mn the facility in mn has referred me to south dakota to send my child how can i actively participate in my childs recovery if she is in illinois or south dakota i have adequate insurance to cover cost of rtc but seems like the facility don't want to take a chance on my insurance insurance has informed them that there is no limited bed stay and my only cost is for deductible i feel that my child is being discriminated against in some form or or another and why can't she be treated in her home state i'm having a big problem with this yes a private psychiatric or medical facility can deny treatment to patients whose conditions are not immediately life threatening and refer out medicine at least in the usa is not socialized as it is in canada and the uk for example and is a privilege rather than a right your child may or may not benefit from the particular program in question it sounds like the facility there believes that your child would be better served elsewhere when facilities refer out there is an excellent reason keep in mind your child means to a rtc as ugly as it sounds that is the bottom line not all rtcs will benefit all children hollering discrimination when a particular rtc does not meet your needs or when the facility that will meet your child's needs is inconvenient to you is not going to help your child discrimination has not occurred just because you do not happen to live near a facility that is equipped to treat your child unfortunate sure discriminatory not by a longshot if your child needs residential treatment the likelihood that you'll find a good one next door is slim you may need to get used to the fact that this will definitely present an inconvenience and possibly considerable expense to get your child the treatment he she needs i encourage you to do what needs to be done get on the phone with the facilities to which you were referred and see what you can do about arranging an intake ask them about ways in which you can still be an active participant in your child's treatment e g weekly family therapy sessions where you participate via phone the idea of residential treatment is to remove the child from his her current environment for an extended period of time as hard as this may be for you to swallow you are part of the current environment even if you lived next door to an rtc you would only be allowed to visit most likely for very circumscribed periods of time in other words the physical location of your child's rtc makes little to no difference in the larger scheme of things Health insurance Bipolar disorder Prostate cancer Psychiatry Publicly funded medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Clinical depression Stomach cancer Medicine Insurance Infantilism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Opposition to cults and new religious movements Addiction Schizophrenia Stroke Cancer Borderline personality disorder Psychoanalysis Drug addiction Electroconvulsive therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Anorexia nervosa Psychotherapy Folic acid Homeopathy Breastfeeding Church of Scientology Terri Schiavo Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Involuntary commitment Mental illness Discrimination Canadian and American health care systems compared Psychology Urinary incontinence Ex-gay Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hypoglycemia Psoriasis Password Autism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Same-sex marriage Drug abuse Legal aspects of transsexualism Adult attention-deficit disorder Alternative medicine Milton H.
