healthier alternative to zoloft i take zoloft mg day and it helps a good bit is there anything non pharmaceutical herbal etc that i could use as an alternative if i decide to stop taking it due to some personal side effects on it for ocd and anxiety but this low dosage has helped a lot i just think about kidney and liver etc damage later on in life i don't want to sacrifice my physical health for my mental health it's not any worse for you than an herbal treatment if you're tolerating it well if you're not tolerating the zoloft why not try another antidepressant i suppose you're getting sexual side effects well there are other options apparently wellbutrin is supposed to help i know when i was taking prozac my sex drive was insanely high so there you go st john's wort is commonly used but like other herbal remedies only helps with mild cases of depression if you're bad enough to need zoloft it probably won't help at all besides just because it's 'natural' doesn't make it safe st john's wort does have plenty of unpleasant side effects and does interact with prescription medications too other herbal 'medications' will have side effects and interactions too you should consider therapy in addition to your medication if you use both your chances of being cured and not needing medications are much higher cbt is suposed to be really good for anxiety Clinical depression Herbalism St John's wort Obsessive-compulsive disorder Chlorpromazine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Clomipramine Bipolar disorder Bupropion Sertraline Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypoglycemia Paroxetine Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Maprotiline Diazepam Psychopharmacology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alcoholism Homeopathy Electroconvulsive therapy LSD Psoriasis Multiple sclerosis Fluoxetine Folic acid Borderline personality disorder Venlafaxine Stuttering Paracetamol Psychoanalysis Trimipramine Fibromyalgia Herpes simplex virus Stomach cancer Hepatitis C Anorexia nervosa Vitamin C Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Migraine Cancer Emergency contraception Radiation therapy Ulcerative colitis Propranolol Doxepin Tobacco smoking Addiction Insomnia Autism Transsexuality Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Traditional Chinese medicine Acne Drug addiction Psychiatry Withdrawal Pharmaceutical company Fluvoxamine Medical cannabis Pneumonia Chemical imbalance theory 5-HTP Alternative medicine Torture Kevin Trudeau Premenstrual stress syndrome Off-label use Cocaine Sigmund Freud Premature ejaculation Cannabinoids Theory of conduct Cognitive therapy Tocopherol Cannabis (drug) Natural health Stroke Naturopathic medicine Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Psychiatric hospital Panic attack Patent medicine Psychosurgery Rabies Traumatic brain injury
