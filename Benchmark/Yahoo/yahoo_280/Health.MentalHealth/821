bipolar sometimes i worry i have bipolar disease i don't have serious mood swings i'm happy most of the time and every once in a while i go into these really sad depressed moments where i don't want to be around anyone and i just cry these last for a few days and then i'm happy again but when i'm happy i'm not crazy happy just normal it's just when i'm sad i get really sad and everything bothers me and makes me cry i know people with bipolar and their symptoms are a lot more aggressive then mine but is it possible to have a minor case of bipolar or does anyone know what could be wrong or is this normal thank you i am years old nothing serious has happened in my life no deaths etc i don't know what triggers the sadness when i get in these moods everything just makes me sad and irritated i never have any manic phases only occasional depressive days depending on your age bit of depression can be due to hormonal changes and will ballance out if you are a young woman or mature woman nearing menopause this could be reason for your mood swings it would be helpful if you start to mark these times into your calendar and after few months you will see if there is any patern during the month if you will find it unbearable visit your family doctor and complain about it however i would recommend that you start taking notes dates etc so you have something to base your complaint on if you would be bi polar you would suffer extreme mood swings which would definitely interfere with your life good luck even with clinical depression Bipolar disorder Clinical depression Borderline personality disorder Mania Hypoglycemia Breastfeeding Menopause Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Antidepressant Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Traumatic brain injury Pitaten Lamotrigine Breast cancer Insomnia Coeliac disease Haloperidol Psoriasis Social rule Anorexia nervosa Prostate cancer Antipsychotic Urinary incontinence Kodocha Chronic fatigue syndrome Psychiatry Schizophrenia Primidone Charles Darwin's illness Mental illness Transsexuality Venlafaxine Multiple sclerosis Acne Cancer Maprotiline Endometriosis Rape Shaggy dog story Dysmenorrhea Stroke Mood stabilizer Oral contraceptive The Smoking Room Anxiety Childbirth Pneumonia Anger management Pregnancy Adult attention-deficit disorder Cardiac arrhythmia Polycystic ovary syndrome Seasonal affective disorder Fibromyalgia Panic attack DSM-IV Codes Multiple chemical sensitivity Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Paroxetine Narcolepsy Jam (TV series) Milton H.
