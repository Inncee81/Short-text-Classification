i don't know what's wrong w me emotionally my thoughts are driving me crazy it's ruining myself and any romantic relationship i have when i'm in a relationship i become very afraid i'm not good enough and that i'm gonna be left like i get very jealous and am afraid the other person's gonna leave me for someone else and they get sick of it and leave anyway and my emotions are driving me crazy it's not that i'm depressed all the time but sometimes my moods change really quick like i'll become extremely angry or extremely anxious to make myself feel better and somewhat stable i often drink or smoke cigarrettes anything to make me feel somewhat good i just don't feel like i'm good enough and am not confident in who i am i'm a year old female btw p s i can't afford counseling so that's out of the question for now i guess i'm just desperate for some clarity sometimes i will feel somewhat happy too but my moods fluctuate constantly so it's usually never like that for like oh and i'm not pregnant either you sound as though you have some issues with self esteem which i had at your age too part of it just takes time to be able to accept yourself for who you are and be satisfied with who you are i don't think anyone ever is totally satisfied it is good that you realize that these things are happening and that they are not healthy there should be some type of clinic in your area so you can speak to someone about your mood swings i know you said you can't afford but often there are free clinics and counselors who charge a fee based on your income you probably pay more on the unhealthy cigs and booze if you use these things to help your moods you could very well get stuck in a downward spiral believe that you're worth it and seek out some professional help for your mood swings and anxiety and just be patient with the jealousy issues because they will disappear as your self confidence grows believe in your self and invest in your health and you'll be just fine good luck Psychoanalysis Transsexuality Clinical depression Narcissism Sigmund Freud Borderline personality disorder Bipolar disorder Psychotherapy Anxiety Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Humphrey Bogart The Smoking Room Arguments for and against drug prohibition Nicomachean Ethics Dead Like Me Everwood Meditation Scientology beliefs and practices R.E.M.
