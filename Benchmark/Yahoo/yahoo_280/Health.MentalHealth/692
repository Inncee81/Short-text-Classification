you know your in this part of your body forgive me if this is posted in the wrong section i know this is a really weird thing to ask but i've wondered why we know we are in the 'head brain' area i was lying in bed with my eyes closed thinking of this like say a blind man was lying down and never saw anything in his life he would know he was by his head rather than by his feat is it because the brain is there i apologise for how silly this question may sound u u this is an important question about where our identity comes from even if some can't read it well enough to understand that what you're saying is not magical we do indeed associate ourselves more with our head than our feet it sometimes helps if i get a pain in my foot to think of it as being so distant from the real me that's harder to do with pain around the head that's one reason migraines demand one's attention as much as they do part of this is because so many important parts of us are in our head such as our mouth for eating and speaking and our eyes we recognize others and their emotional states by their faces so we know our own face is just as important the me in my head is much more in the front of my head than the back of my head not only because of my eyes and mouth if we notice a sight or sound off to one side we might turn our whole body toward it but we might also just turn our head somehow all of these sensory and motor experiences add up so that we identify ourselves with our head much more than with our feet despite that some ancient people thought the brain did nothing but cool the blood they saw our presence in our head as more intangible even a spirit that left our mouth with our last breath maybe the reality of how we see ourselves needs some improvement even over how we see ourselves today questions like this help that if you're crazy it's not because you ask this question maybe you're not asking the right people neuroscientists would know what you mean you wouldn't even have to apologize to them they ask much crazier questions than this Dyslexia Traumatic brain injury Aphasia Cognitive science Brain Neuro-linguistic programming Happy Tree Friends Milton H.
