is this normal for a year old my almost year old son cries at the drop of a hat especially when he does not get his way i'm concerned because he seems to get upset over stupid things example i put too much or too little cereal into his bowl and he flips out crying and yelling that i did the wrong thing he is so smart and knows how to say may i please have more less sometimes he will give the polite answer and be so good it blows me away other times he just flips out at day care he will often cry when he cannot do something instead of asking for help there have been no stressful family or other issues that i can think of his dad and i are happily married we never give in to crying we are very consistent and this has been occurring on and off for over a year i cannot pinpoint an exact trigger is this normal if not what should i do since you and your husband seem to be very consistent and are aware of the little things that are triggering him i'd say seek some kind of intervention especially if this has been going on for quite a while his coping mechanisms are at risk he seems frustrated and unable to deal with situations that should really not be that big of a deal your son may just be seeking attention or there may be something bothering him that he cannot at this point talk about a counselor family therapist or school psychologist may help you pinpoint the issue best of luck Autism About a Boy Social rule Psychotherapy Psychoanalysis God Emperor of Dune Theodicy Characters in the Smurfs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Kodocha Traumatic incident reduction Laura Schlessinger Ethics Polygamy Abortion Bubble Bobble The Lovely Bones Fathers' rights Anger management Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Suicide Transactional analysis Anorexia nervosa EastEnders Shaggy dog story Game show Transsexuality Prostate cancer Hikikomori Frankie Laine Cancer Fast bowling Poker jargon Calvin and Hobbes Chronic fatigue syndrome Grief Singlish Friends Floppy disk Bernard Williams The Adventures of Pete & Pete Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Married... with Children 2000 Australian Grand Prix Legacy of Kain Philosophy of language Traumatic brain injury Gramophone record Divorce Narcissism LaVeyan Satanism Controversies in autism Self-harm Exit counseling Stuttering Asperger syndrome Family Guy Trailer Park Boys Rain Man Procrastination Democratic Party (United States) Second language acquisition New York Giants The Ashlee Simpson Show The Smoking Room Human adaptation to space The Inside Hypnosis A Course In Miracles Marathon (computer game) Bipolar disorder The Invisibles Theory of conduct Serial killer Charles Darwin's illness Normal distribution Meditation Cheating in Counter-Strike Stroke Hillary Rodham Clinton 1956 Hungarian Revolution Betting (poker) Scientology beliefs and practices Panic attack Miscarriage Probability Lie American Dad!
