brain goin double speed hey sometimes rarely everything around me seems to be happening faster its as if my brain stepped up a gear its hard to describe but its weird and a bit annoying aswell i wonder if anyone else has experienced this it happens really rarely maybe times a yr tops i remember a time when it happened a few times in a row but it rarely happens now thanks take the mick if u like p s just re read that and its a bit of a jumble sorry its just i cant think of a way of explaining it i hope someone can understand me s haha charlie thought sum would say that i dont booze and hav neva smoked drugs the times i remember this happening i must have been under lol normally i need to distract myself from it sorry more detail its like i know everything is going normal speed but its sorta isnt maybe its once stuff goes into my brain it seems it happened twice as long ago thus making stuff seem like its going faster not sure not had it for ages so its really hard to explain sandy interesting idea about a seizure i didnt know that they could be purely in your mind interesting to know what it could be simple partial seizure i think would be it as i say its is very rare and doesnt really happen any more so i dont think i would need to go see my doctor about it overkill p but interesting to know all the same thanks thanks h i looked up racing thoughts that seems to describe it very well although i dont seem to have it as bad as is described im not worried just happy to know thats what it is so i can let someone know if it happens again sounds like you are having racing thoughts often associated with psychosis usually caused by stress do not panic though as it is easily controlled by meds go explain to your doctor as if left untreated you could have a major crisis Psychosis Epilepsy Hypnosis Stroke Clomipramine Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Schizophrenia Clinical depression Scientology beliefs and practices Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.
