afraid of heights when i think of climbing high poles trees ladders i get this tingling feeling in my feet toes mostly and my fingers i can only assume this is a fear of heights however when i actually do go up on things high up i don't get the same feeling it's odd i'm only afraid of heights when i think about them before or afterwards yet when i'm in the act of being high off the ground i'm perfectly fine does this happen to anyone else also does anyone else get that tingling sensation in your feet and fingers when you think of hieghts for example balancing on something high off the ground just imagining it i get tingles the first reply nailed it in my opinion in my case i never had any fear of heights at all and in fact was excited by them i always loved the window seat on a plane enjoyed the view from tall buildings and climbing trees in my neighborhood the place where i have a problem is when i don't feel as though i'm in complete control i know that sounds silly i mean i wasn't the one flying the plane and people fall out of trees all the time but i never doubted the pilot and felt in control while holding the branches but you put me on the top of a building that has no railings and i won't get within feet of the edge ladders didn't used to bother me but as a kid i never had a reason to climb them very high these days when i sometimes have to use a ladder to reach the roof of a two story house i damn near need a diaper if a breeze blows while i'm on it you seem to be the complete opposite perhaps you're afraid of depths lol my simple answer to the title of this question would be not when i'm on the ground Shaggy dog story Diving Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an B-47 Stratojet Milton H.
