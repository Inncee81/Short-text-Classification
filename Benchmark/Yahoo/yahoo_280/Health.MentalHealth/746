what can i do about the horrible loneliness of being a yr old widow i am so depressed alot i deeply loved my husband and lost lost him my heart goes out to you honey i don't know what i will do without my guy hopefully what i am telling you i will do as well first thing take refuge in your religion if you don't have a refuge this might be a good time to discover what you believe and hope about life and death it may be very soothing and give you a deep sense of life unfolding as it should personally i am a buddhist and i find get strength and peace in it it helps to remind me that we are bags of skin and will return to the spirit from which we came it reminds me to be loving and kind harmless and not greedy if you are sad and wretched for more than a couple of weeks which you will be please seek professional help this is not to imply that you are crazy or should get over it on the contrary it means that you by yourself have to figure out how to make the rest of your life meaningful and to honor the love of your life by being in life you know he would want you to have a nice life useful and pleasant despite losing your partner you would want him to love life and do something good if he was here and you were gone right not just to sit around miserable every day right next if you work take a part time job at night or volunteer somewhere you love like the symphony or theatre even the zoo or a museum this will get you off the couch and dressed and out the door a couple night a week so you are not becoming a couch cushion it will make nights go along faster and give you new people to meet don't tell anyone about your loss start new take really good care of your health go to the doctor and get a check up eat well take all the junk out of your house keep fresh fruit and vegetables on the table so you remember to eat them take up some sort of exercise real exercise not shopping or sitting in the yard go for short walks and go a little further every day buy some dumb bells and do light weights take a yoga class or start swimming do something every day not as punishment or to get in shape but because it makes you feel so good afterward it makes your skin and body and mind jump for joy get a haircut dye your hair something mild not orange or black have your nails done take bubble baths pamper yourself but not with food or stuff do nice things go on a vacation with a grand daughter or neice or sister go fishing or antiquing or horseback riding go on a cruise or some other vacation that your husband didn't want to go on but you do if you still have time to be horribly lonely volunteer to read at a hospice or hospital write letters for older people or kids every where you look there is someone who needs you every where you go say nothing about being a widow or being depressed or sad you can still feel those things but new people will not be nearly as sympathetic as you would like give others and yourself a chance to get acquainted with the you that is in there and not part of a couple you are in the world by yourself married or not in love or not you breathe for yourself ache for yourself overeat all by yourself and cry alone no one can live your life for you no one can die for you either make the most of the years you have to learn explore love and discover and honor your marriage and its gifts by being the best person you know how to be because you knew and loved so deeply you will always love him miss him and be lonely but you can also use the time to cherish your life reach out to others who are in pain and take good care of the bag of skin you have please contact me if you would care to correspond Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten The Lovely Bones Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Marilyn Monroe Fecal incontinence Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Clinical depression 613 mitzvot John the Baptist Knots Landing Eastern Orthodox Church The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sharon Tate Care Bears Jon Secada Days of our Lives Mojave people Pysanka Scientology beliefs and practices The Emancipation of Mimi Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ludwig Wittgenstein Simone Weil Comanche YuYu Hakusho The Inside Customs and etiquette of Japan Kodocha Japanese tea ceremony Little Britain The Shining (film) Time Out of Mind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban George Burns Futurama (TV series -
