anorexia discussion i had another question previously about how my friend is going threw the same thing i did with anorexia i had great advice so she wanted to talk to me but it was on msn it wasn't face to face as i would have preferred but she confessed to me i tried to help her but she doesn't think its that serious and she just left she thinks its okay to not be hungry i feel like i failed i explained to her what i went threw and that getting better isn't easy i'm still working on that it's hard for me to see her go threw this because she means a lot to me she also told me not to tell any of our other friends but i'm debating i promised her i just want her to know that if she wants to get better she will i told her that is there anything else i can tell her please she means so much to me i just is there something i can do for her she really doesnt think shes sick and i'm worried please anything how about discussing it with her parents it's better to piss her off as a friend then to sit around waiting for something terrible to happen to her if she said not to tell then she knows there's something wrong and she doesn't want people to find out if i were you i'd try to find her help in anyway possible even if that means telling people and making her mad just let her know you told to help her not to hurt her Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Pitaten EastEnders Friends Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jam (TV series) God Emperor of Dune Nico Robin Conspiracy (TNG episode) Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban One Tree Hill (TV series) Extreme Programming Pok__mon Live!
