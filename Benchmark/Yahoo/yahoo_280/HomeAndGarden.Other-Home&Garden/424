anyone know what i could do detur kids from spray painting my house i have contacted the police and they said there is nothing i can do until we catch them they keep spraying the same things over and over on different property owners please help this has been going on for over a year now sorry also have major dog allergy also have way to mnay restriction on fencing in the home owener assosciation rules to mess with getting that done not to mention the expense because of the odd terain from the backyard that backs up n the woods first i would determine why they are spraying your house are they doing the same to other houses in your area if you are being singled out then find out why as far as a deterant video camera are always a good idea but i would go one step further and install motion sensative lights that will brighten your house when some gets close to it the distance can be set to whatever range you want it to be if you belong to an association and they have rules against fences the go in and ask for a waiver of the rule due to the problem you are having if they reject your request put up the fence anyway and then let them fight you its ultimately your property just make sure you have everything in writing when asking for your waiver when you put your security cameras fake or not make sure you have some signs that tells them there is video being taken if this has happened repeatedly call the police and ask for a drive by during the suspected hours of vandalism if the little tikes see more police in the area they may find something else to do last idea depending on which wall and where it is located dont make it easy for them to get to it put some trash cans in the way that they have to move put a wood pile there whatever you can think of that would cause them to think it is not worth the effort and go on to something else so lights camera and make it harder to get to the wall if this doesnt work hire a person to walk the area during the hours you think there are attacking your house if four houses are involved and they are together get all four owners involved and come up with a plan that each can contribute to if hiring someone is the answer Automatic number plate recognition Road-rule enforcement camera Wrigley Field Plame affair Crime prevention through environmental design Scientology beliefs and practices Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Poker jargon Baseball Death Note Equine conformation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Softball Social rule Easement Drag racing Volleyball Property (ownership right) Fire fighting Aliens of London Escape from New York Stereoscopy Columbine High School massacre Theory of conduct Mixed martial arts Martial art Mouse (computing) Trademark United States House of Representatives CPU cache Ownership Time Out of Mind Table saw Karl Rove 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Israeli West Bank barrier The Inside Bad Wolf Shaggy dog story Montgomery Burns Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Digital camera American Psycho 21 July 2005 London bombings Ethernet Privacy Estoppel The Star Wars Holiday Special Golf Johnny 5 Canadian Senate Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Extreme Programming Fencing 2004 World Series Tag 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression The Apprentice 2 Closed-circuit television Opportunity rover Light pollution RuneScape quests Air traffic control Oplan Bojinka Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Bluetooth Truth Jennifer Lopez Lechaina James Hanratty Survivor (novel) Deep Impact (space mission) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Big Brother (USA TV series) View camera EastEnders McMansion General relativity Copyleft Canadian House of Commons Ferengi Bristol Grammar School Scientific method Jam (TV series) Digital photography Dutch Schultz Spyware Reservoir Dogs Hey Jude Dog training Patent Theodicy Hard disk Function (mathematics) The Lovely Bones
