can i use vegetable oil on wood outside i have a small deck outside and we plan to replace it soon i have a recently expired bottle of veg oil and i was wondering if i can put it on the deck to help it last just a little longer instead of just throwing away the vegetable oil anything that repels water will help the wood last longer but you might have unintentional side effects such as animals licking the deck Beer Charcoal Renewable energy Fire extinguisher Virtual Realm Soap Plastic Flax Biofuel Hamster Biodiesel Economy of Kuwait Veganism Essential oil Beverly Hills, California Cruising (maritime) Drill bit Deforestation Ship naming and launching Energy development Gasoline Wrigley Field Olive Ice cream Rigging Soybean Essex class aircraft carrier Vegetable oil Perfume Bong Yu-Gi-Oh!
