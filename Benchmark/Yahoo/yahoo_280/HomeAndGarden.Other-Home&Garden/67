is it safe to prune back my nectarine tree it is only three years old and it's the second year it's had fruit last year it only got a few nectarines this year it is overloaded and the branches are drooping also it's been months and only a few of the fruit closest to the trunk are starting to mature i think if i trimmed the excess that the tree wouldn't be so overwhelmed and would be able to make better fewer fruit but it's only my theory i really don't know i've been told that if we trim it back while it's got fruit that it will kill the tree i find this hard to believe but i don't want to do it and kill my tree because i don't know what i'm talking about help pruning should consist of removing the laterals that have fruited and thinning out the new laterals that have grown also cutting back the top growth keeps the tree from growing too tall it sounds as if you need to thin your tree take off all small and diseased fruit do the pruning after the tree has finished fruiting if it is only maturing near trunk then sounds like your tree needs either more watering or some sort of fertiliser check with your garden center good luck Pruning fruit trees Peach Fruit tree propagation Pruning Olive Bonsai Apricot Wood Equine conformation Banksia Bamboo Apple Gypsy moth Wisteria Gooseberry Moss Coffea arabica Durian Plant Coffea Apical dominance Christmas tree Giant Sequoia Black pepper Auxin Coconut Tree Hamster Ginkgo Grafting Acorn Date Palm Rainforest Tooth European Beech Vanilla Sequoia Kakapo The Time Machine Coffee Dutch elm disease Plum Mushroom hunting Flowering plant Seed Refrigerator car Elephant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Woodworking Pachypodium Comfrey Gardening White Spruce Morphology of Pachypodium Capercaillie Pine 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Honey fungus Citrus Collision detection Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Deforestation Rambutan Knife Reservoir Dogs Thuja plicata Root Minor characters in Morrowind Garden Strawberry Poker jargon Elm Fecal incontinence Pesticide Shark Logging Onion Prostate cancer Tobacco Campfire 2003 North America blackout In vitro fertilisation Luther Burbank Orchard Black Spruce Foodborne illness Fruit Banana Pubic hair Sphenoid bone Normal distribution Loganberry Pachypodium baronii Ethylene Pitaten Drainage
