can you bulid a two story house cheaper than a one story everything i've read or heard and logic tells me that for the same square finished footage a two story is cheaper it would need half the size of basement and roof there is the additional expense of a stairway but if it is over basement stairs doesn't require more square footage i suppose there are some internal things that could be more like furnace vent or fireplace chimney have to be longer a two story is certainly more efficient use of land but if you have a huge lot guess that wouldn't be an issue Stairway Bungalow Basement Property tax Chimney Kitchen Solar power Piccolo Junior Saga Wood fuel Winchester Mystery House Autonomous building Fireplace Furnace Solar cell The Basement Tapes Arlington House Bristol Grammar School The Brady Bunch Paradox Transformer Computer Sin City Floppy disk Elevator Seismic retrofit McMansion Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory DVD Hydrogen economy Derbyshire lead mining history CPU design Dynamic random access memory Theory of conduct Digital photography Little Britain Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Extreme Programming Stove Modem Fiddler on the Roof RuneScape quests Electric arc furnace Urban sprawl Taxicab Law of value Animal Crossing Christmas EastEnders Stairway to Heaven Heinkel He 100 Trafalgar Square Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Radio masts and towers System/36 Jenova Hash table 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sport utility vehicle Tudorbethan architecture The Curse of Fenric Ventilation Andravida Rock Follies Alcohol fuel Stars!
