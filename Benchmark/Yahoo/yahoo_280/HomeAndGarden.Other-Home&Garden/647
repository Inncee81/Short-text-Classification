how long can lavendar keep its scent i've just plucked some its dry and its only the top purple part contrary to the first answer i know that dried lavendar can keep it's scent for ages and ages it is only when it is fresh not dried that that air scent lasts such a short time a couple of years ago i made sachets out of dried lavendar i took from my garden to this day when i crush the little cloth sachet in my hand a very strong and clear scent of the lavendar inside is emitted without any friction it will last a super short time if used as a sachet or if it is rubbed in any way the oils inside the dried lavendar will last for months and in my experience even more than a year the sachets i made are kept in my dresser drawers everything in those drawers continue to smell very clearly of lavendar so i suppose the staying power of the scent is dependent on the way in which the dried herb is used i read that lavendar was found in the tombs of the pharoahs of ancient egypt and it still had maintained it's scent now that's a long time also here is a site that give all kinds of info about lavendar including reference to the shelf life of lavendar's scent years they claim see last few lines of the entire article http www incensewarehouse com spotlight on lavender ep html hope this helps ps did you know that you can throw these sachets in the clothes dryer instead of a dryer sheet to help make your clothes smell fabulous when they're dry and did you know that dried lavendar acts as a moth repellant in your closet interesting eh Lavender Tofu Yarrow Mummy Sage Animal communication Dog Nepeta Essential oil Thermal power station Textile manufacturing Psoriasis Noah's Ark Mosquito Cat Cannabis cultivation Cascading Style Sheets Charles Goodyear Coriander Paris Hilton Sea level rise Massage Undergarment Culture of Korea Cinnamon Garlic Flax Christmas tree Strap-on dildo Diving suit Odor Olfaction Basil The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bong Human sexual behavior Casting Theory of conduct Rose Menstrual cycle Jewish cuisine Shaggy dog story Obedience training Biological pest control Fancy rat Upholstery Eddie Guerrero Ginny Weasley Japanese tea ceremony Cross site scripting Motor oil Tobacco HTML Skunk Lower North Shore (Sydney) Sperm Whale Billiards Aloe Durian Kain (Legacy of Kain) Domestic goat Black pepper Soap American lobster Stage lighting Friction Air pollution Classified information Pharaoh Laundry Pet skunk Transformer Papyrus Carbon dioxide Natural gas Pottery Climate of the United Kingdom Hemp Fire Clipperton Island Trapping Domain Name System Kakapo Top-bar hive Microeconomics Sonic the Hedgehog The Amber Spyglass Burial Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coconut crab Flood geology Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Aromatherapy Emergence Harp Housebreaking Uniform Resource Locator
