is the swiferwetjet a good buy i have wooden floors i bought one i have acid stain concrete floors and my mop left water marks unless i dried it with a towel after i moped so i thought i'd try the wet jet but the cleaner left streaks also i use mine everyday and love it but i don't use it the way your suppose to i use a plain damp wash cloth on the bottom of mine sometimes it slides off but i spray my floor with lysol and mop with the wash cloth on the bottom of the swiffer it is the only thing that doesn't streak on my floors it's the same as if i was on my hands and knees with a cloth but a lot easier on the back i just change the cloth after a section you might like it for touch ups but to deep down clean it gets expensive to change the cleaner and pads often i love mine but like i said i don't use it the way your suppose to Upholstery Mattress Dry cleaning Vacuum cleaner Japanese toilet Aerial (dance move) Washing machine Naval mine Seismic retrofit Car washing techniques Fire fighting Opportunity rover Drill bit Wok Soap Japanese tea ceremony Genericized trademark Diving Towel Chair Fencing Fecal incontinence Skateboarding trick Laundry Menstrual cup Customs and etiquette of Japan Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Justification (theology) Blood Simple Reinforced concrete Billboard Hot 100 Manicure Wound Boat building Violin Volleyball Irrigation Clothing Toilet paper Social rule The Dalek Invasion of Earth Milton H.
