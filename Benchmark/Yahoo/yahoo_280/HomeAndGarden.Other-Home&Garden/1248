can bats fly into your house through an open door we own home that was newly constructed years ago and never had a problem with bats until this last month we found a dead bat weeks ago after having company over the prior weekend it was clenched to the side of a wicker planter then again found another dead bat yesterday in a garbage can in a basement bathroom of all places my husband is thinking they entered through a door seeing that they both were found dead would that mean that they couldn't exit and they did enter through an open door it's a weekend lake home so we never noticed either bat flying around found them after they died yes they certainly can i had one get into my house that way i had to have it removed as it was still living when we found it the next day thast being said though since you have found i would have a larger concern which is that they could possible be getting in through your roof you could even possibly have a colony of them living up in your attic i'd get an inspector out asap and have then check your attic space it could just be that a screen over a vent is broken or missing and a couple got in that way or maybe there is a gap and you've got a whole colony up there hard to tell without checking but i'd get someone up there asap to check it out Hamster Trapping Fancy rat Food Cuisine of Denmark Ferret Garfield Spidey Super Stories Breakfast RuneScape quests Poker jargon Piccolo Junior Saga Baldrick Mousetrap Rais massacre The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Taboo food and drink House Mouse Kitchen Salad Fingers Mouse Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Elevator Cube (film) Dairy Peanut butter Diseases of the honeybee The Dalek Invasion of Earth Sausage Cat Genericized trademark Fecal incontinence Guinea pig First Battle of the Atlantic Mouse (computing) Bad Wolf Textile manufacturing Bong Battles of Lexington and Concord Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Customs and etiquette of Japan Kenny McCormick Toilet humour Tlingit Goofy The Empty Child The Inside Conker's Bad Fur Day GunZ The Duel Discworld gods Ant World War Three (Doctor Who) Hot dog Hunting Fishing Phoebe Halliwell Volleyball Dean Koontz The Brady Bunch Drawn Together Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Shen Gong Wu Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Domesticated turkey Universal Serial Bus Cuisine of the Philippines Eric Cartman Bat Creatures in Bionicle Honeybee EastEnders Recurring South Park characters Alaga__sia The Curse of Fenric USS Zane (DD-337) The Doctor Dances Cheating in Counter-Strike Japanese tea ceremony Jumpstart 3rd Grade Meal Carbon dioxide Seismic retrofit Rat Pet skunk Bladderwort Joke Social rule Textile manufacturing terminology Tire Dog training Tag Shaggy dog story Fast bowling Microwave oven The Ark in Space AFI 100 Years series Castle of the Winds Modest Mouse
