i live in central arkansas the other day i got zapped by black wasp out of the blue people are telling me it was a mud dauber but i saw of them circling a paper nest what zapped me left itchy welt with brown mark that faded overnight and left a dimple hole mud daubers can and do sting but not without complete provocation i've even laid my hand on them twice that i recall and never been stung they sting as an absolute last resort however a paper wasp gives very little warning all you have to do is breath on one the wrong way and they will nail you they are very protective of their nests and guard them viciously i had a nest growing in an empty bird house on my fence i also had tomatoes on that fence all i did was pick a tomato and vibrated the fence a little and the little bugger nailed me on the finger didn't really hurt that bad but i was lucky because they tend to attack as a group sounds like you were lucky too the paper wasp is the most aggressive and that is probably what gotcha i normally don't suggest killing wasps because most are beneficial but paper wasps are dangerous so i suggest that you get rid of the nest if you can you can purchase some raid wasp and hornet killer with a foot reach for safety for comparison mud dauber the only wasp with a thread waist they come in many colors including pure black some blue and brown harmless http images search yahoo com search images view back http a f fimages search yahoo com fsearch fimages f adv prop dimage fr dyfp t va dmud bdauber sz dall w h imgurl www thebestlinks com fimages fa fad fmuddauber jpg rurl http a f fwww thebestlinks com fmud dauber html size kb name muddauber jpg p mud dauber type jpeg no tt oid f a e f e a ei iso paper wasp http images search yahoo com search images view back http a f fimages search yahoo com fsearch fimages fp dpaper bwasp ei dutf fr dyfp t x dwrt js d ni d w h imgurl static flickr com f f c dfc m jpg rurl http a f fwww flickr com fphotos fchi liu f f size kb name c dfc jpg p paper wasp type jpeg no tt oid bfa c b d fusr chi liu tit yellow paper wasp hurl http a f fwww flickr com fphotos fchi liu f ei utf src p good luck Hornet Wasp Butterfly JPEG USS Wasp (CV-18) Ant Flickr HTML element Spider Africanized bee Web browser Paper wasp Blue Tit Red imported fire ant USS Washington (BB-56) Tarantula USS Wasp (CV-7) Biological pest control Dog Sub-Zero Yellowjacket Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Professional wrestling holds Paul Is Dead Uniform Resource Locator Digital photography Milton H.
