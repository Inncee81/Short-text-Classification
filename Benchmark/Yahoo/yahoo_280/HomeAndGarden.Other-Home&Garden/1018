dryer vent heating dog house i was wondering if it would be safe possible to heat my dog house with the dryer vent he is a husky and does not need constant heat nor does it want it so the dryer heat would be sufficent we do one three loads a day i was wondering if this is unsafe or if anyone had any suggestions on how to do this safely i am thinking it's a great way to recycle the lost heat we pay for does anyone have any suggestions or comments thank you ok before i get anymore rude comments back not all of you yes my dog is an outside dog not indoors he's a husky i had him inside for awhile and he hated it he'd constantly want to be let out and i'd have to drag him inside so i decided to let him have full rein of the backyard i would never chain him so i'm building a dog house and looking for ways to warm it a little in the winter he slept on top last winter but we brought him into the garage two nights that were really cold anyways just to clear things up for the not so smart looking for solutions not critisism this is a really clever idea although i would be worried about the lint blowing into the living space as a potential solution why not consider venting the heat under the dog house assuming it is elevated this might give you a radiant heat effect and would prevent the exhaust from going directly into his living space since heat rises it should still be relatively effective just make sure that you allow for some outbound ventilation under the house so that the exhaust has someplace to flow through also if you insulate the roof of the dog house it will help retain both this heat and your dog's body heat if this doesn't work think about installing an actually radiant heating grid like you would find installed under tile under his floor you could turn it off and on with any timer last bit of advice i promise get an indoor outdoor lcd thermometer with a remote sensor and place the sensor in his dog house that way you can tell if the house is adequate protection from the heat or cold they only cost about and are well worth it good luck Solar power HVAC Furnace Autonomous building Diving suit Kitchen Wind power Basement Renewable energy Heat Transformer STS-114 Energy development Carbon dioxide Nuclear power Air conditioning Carburetor Thermostat Combine (Half-Life 2) Thermal power station Futurama (TV series - season 5) Space Shuttle external tank 2005 United States Grand Prix Glossary of firefighting terms Dialysis Glossary of firefighting equipment Refrigerator Traffic light Air-raid shelter Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insulation Mars Exploration Rover Passive solar Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Rebreather Syphon Filter Future energy development Spacecraft propulsion Elevator Atmospheric reentry B-47 Stratojet Hamster Vacuum Dog Pebble bed reactor Door Ocean thermal energy conversion Electrical wiring The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) The Amber Spyglass Wind Piccolo Junior Saga Stirling engine Mercury Atlas 6 Light-emitting diode Colonization of the Moon E85 Diesel engine Casting Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Dundas Square Mattress Radon Swimming pool RFID Modem Barbecue Hydrogen economy Drill bit Fire fighting Internal ballistics Cat Kim Possible The Death Gate Cycle Straw-bale construction Nuclear reactor Climate of the United Kingdom Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Volleyball The Inside Sento Avenue Q God Emperor of Dune Water Air pollution The Ark in Space Swamp cooler Jet engine Weather lore
