windowless air conditioners i live on the nd floor of an apartment complex we are not allowed to put air conditioners in our windows for liability issues easier for someone to break in but it is getting so hot here i have looked for ones i can sit on the floor with no worries of water leak i am finding prices well above is there a cheaper option fans are just not cutting it anymore if possible can you show links i am so new at this and not sure what is best on the market is about what you can expect to pay for a portable air conditioner they still need to be vented out the window though air conditioners produce hot air so an exhaust hose runs from the back of the unit and out the window it is in my lease that we can't have window air conditioners i live on the nd floor but i think its the equality policy they can't let just the nd floor residents have the window air conditioners and not let the st floor residents not have them it might be the screens as well they may not want the screens removed as well as the physical look of the property with people having air conditioners sticking out random windows the exhaust hose is not a problem i can have it in the window and close it down on it not squishing it though and pit some sort of insulation around it to prevent air from going outside how can somebody break in on the second floor i would want something in writing from the apartment management that you aren't allowed to use a window air conditioner what is the difference between an open window to let in some cool air and having an ac in the window is about what you can expect to pay for a portable air conditioner they still need to be vented out the window though air conditioners produce hot air so an exhaust hose runs from the back of the unit and out the window portable air conditioners don't work nearly as well as a window air conditioner you are probably going to want to get the most powerful one that you can afford one of the or btu units i haven't purchased one yet myself but have been reading about them and saw them on ask this old house the ac's usually come with a window insert that holds the hose i would look at the danby models if you can i think they have a year warranty where most others have a one year warranty Fire fighting Solar power Glossary of firefighting terms IBM PC compatible HVAC IPod Air conditioning Microsoft Windows Electrophysiology E85 Jet engine Autonomous building Apple Computer Glossary of wildland fire terms Nuclear power Surveillance Windows Vista Bong USB flash drive De Lorean DMC-12 Sento Leasehold estate M16 (rifle) Visual Basic Rebreather Town gas Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Oscilloscope Windows XP Hard disk Free trade Computer virus Window Commodore 64 Brewery Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Scuba set Gramophone record Diving regulator Futurama (TV series - season 5) Carburetor X Window System Floppy disk Bulk vending American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Spark plug Combine (Half-Life 2) Billboard Hot 100 Insurance Intellectual property Internal combustion engine Plastic Vacuum cleaner ZX Spectrum Contract Teen Girl Squad Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Housing cooperative Warranty Mattress Atari ST Keynesian economics Casting Handheld game console Mach kernel Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Wildfire AmigaOS Windows Server 2003 Nuclear power phase-out PowerBook History of Microsoft Windows Two-stroke cycle Dodge Charger Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Digital photography Engine cooling Hydrogen economy Energy development Undergarment Fuel cell Lighting Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Japanese toilet System/36 B-47 Stratojet Automobile Heinkel He 100 Warez Ethernet Thermostat Arianne
