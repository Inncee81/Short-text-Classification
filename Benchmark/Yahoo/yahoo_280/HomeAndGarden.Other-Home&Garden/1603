why do some states use gas over electric stoves i used to live in seattle every stove i ever had was electric until i moved to the east coast i really got used to gas and liked cooking with gas stoves very much now i have moved to va where my apartment has electric why such a change i tend to see more gas stoves in the midwest or east coast and electric in the west is that an overall feeling why do you think this is or am i just too bored at work overanalyzing i think a lot of it has to do with when gas electricity became available in a particular area here electricity was kind of late getting to individual homes as compared to more urban areas consequently most of our parents grandparents were brought up in houses which used either wood or coal stoves for heating cooking you tend to stick with what you know grew up with and gas is the most like the wood coal stoves as it cooks with a flame on the other hand i think as far as your rental that many landlords install electric stoves because it may be a cheaper option as far as the appliance itself and in installation there is a little less danger of fire vs gas stoves especially with someone who is inexperienced in using gas stoves some people are uncomfortable cooking with gas stoves personally i love my gas stove Refrigerator Sento Ice cream Dundas Square The Brady Bunch Changeroom McMansion Courtyard Audi A2 Swimming The Time Machine Car handling Whitton, London Backdoor Kitchen White House The Smoking Room Rum Car body style Enlightenment (Doctor Who) Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Saki Planet of the Daleks Invader Zim St. Elmo's Fire (film) Blankets (graphic novel) Stairway Neopets Autonomous building Freezer Poker jargon Erectile dysfunction Electroshock gun Colony in Space Abbey Cyberspace Utility Food storage The Death Gate Cycle Bong Items in the Metroid series Behavioral finance UK telephone numbering plan Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Grace Cossington Smith Easthampton, Massachusetts Thermal power station Jam (TV series) Shaggy dog story Fulham F.C.
