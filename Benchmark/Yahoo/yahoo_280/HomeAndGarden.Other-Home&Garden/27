how can i safely remove hornet bee nest on balcony without harmful chemicals i just moved into my own condo there are balconies one is large and one is small there is an obviously active nest in the corner of the smaller balcony i can see its inhabitants are striped yellow and black i don't know if they're bees or hornets i'm afraid to knock it down because the balcony is small so there's nowhere to run away to on the lower balcony is another nest where i haven't seen any activity so it might be safe to just knock it down i prefer not to use harmful chemicals if i can avoid it not only because bees and hornets are useful creatures but also because i think pesticides are generally bad for the environment does anyone have any suggestions i don't want to be afraid to go out onto either of my balconies thanks this is probably a nest of yellow jackets vespula sp or paper wasps polistes sp you're right these are beneficial insects the larvae have an insatiable appetite for grubs and caterpillars if you knock it down the queen and her daughters will likely try to build another one here are two suggestions buy some pure gum spirits of turpentine at a hardware store then splash some on the nest this will instantly kill any wasps it touches and any remaining wasps will abandon the nest note this is a natural product it's basically just distilled pine sap it can still damage plants i wouldn't recommend pouring some on your grass but it's a lot more friendly than the organophosphates found in commercial insecticides oil of peppermint or peppermint extract in a small spray bottle also works great with the oil you may want to mix it with some water and dish soap before you use it try not to get any on your hands or they will smell fresh for a day and a half Biological pest control Diseases of the honeybee Hornet Pesticide Hamster Gypsy moth Paper wasp Wasp Honeybee Ant Essential oil Organic farming Bumblebee Perfume Fire fighting Yellowjacket Mosquito Insect Apple Carnivorous plant Honey Coffee Redundant array of independent disks Gaucho (insecticide) Yellow Beehive (beekeeping) Fire extinguisher Water Alkane Vegetarianism Pesticide toxicity to bees Energy development Chicken Ecology Bee German Wasp Gasoline Sulfur Red imported fire ant Olive oil Kosher foods GunBound Common Wasp Sewage treatment Vinegar Capercaillie Organic food Illegal drug trade Alcohol fuel Apocrita Turpentine American Black Bear Breastfeeding Carpenter bee Green Revolution Car washing techniques Africanized bee Uranium Insecticide Water purification Biodiesel Skunk Enzyme Nuclear power Soap Caterpillar Solvent Bulk vending Sulfuric acid Agar plate Gooseberry Solar power Aromatherapy Tobacco Pesticide poisoning Cannabis (drug) Sustainable agriculture Bee learning and communication Durian Bong Rosin Autonomous building Desert locust Weed control Oddworld Benzene Cochineal Hydrochloric acid Beer
