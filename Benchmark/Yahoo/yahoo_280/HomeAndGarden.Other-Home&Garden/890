how to get rid of wasps under driveway it seems some wasps yellowjackets have set up home under our driveway through a little crack between the cement and the garage wall they're smart little buggers their area is not easily accessible to us because there is brick on the wall that ends about an inch or so above the driveway how do we kill them without ideally getting stung ourselves the typical sprays foams can't be pointed into the hole because it's hard to access yellowjackets are somewhat harmless right now but within the next few weeks they're going to start getting agressive and they are nasty if they think their nest is in any danger which they can think simply by you walking by the nest not to mention that the queen will stay there during the winter and there will be a ton more wasps in that nest next year i've got two kids and we frequently have other kids over their protection is more important to me than the wasps instructions for treating wasp nests nest removal or getting rid of wasps particularly social wasps is a fairly simple process finding the nest usually entails a quick survey for heavy wasp traffic during dusk or dawn when wasps tend to return to the nest once the sun is down for the evening and you ve noticed less traffic near the nest dress yourself with multiple layers of clothing and find a pair of gloves just in case then go out to the nest and spray the entrance with any wasp killing agent like raid for example spray liberally but avoid inhaling too much of the poison most wasp poisons kill on contact but it s best to be safe by slowly leaving the area sudden movements can attract attention which wasp killer you use depends on where the nest is for nests that are located underground you will want to use a wasp killer that is not labeled as a projectile spray you want very little spray for yellow jacket nests that are found underground for nests that are elevated you will want to find a can of wasp hornet killer that is labeled as a projectile spray this will ensure a stream of wasp poison roughly feet in length plenty of distance to make a quick escape if necessary repeating this process twice or even three times may be necessary until you re certain the nest has been vacated once you see that there is no traffic it s probably safe to knock down the nest if it s an aerial nest or fill the nest with dirt and gravel if it s in the ground this should be the end of your wasp problem until the next migration cycle Hornet Fire fighting Airport Yellowjacket Africanized bee Ant Seismic retrofit Shell (projectile) Diseases of the honeybee USS Wasp (CV-7) Wasp CPU cache Hamster Ammunition USS Wasp (CV-18) Quicksort Terminal ballistics Biological pest control Animal communication Traffic light Compiler optimization Dundas Square Thermal power station Casting Stopping power Mattress Glossary of firefighting equipment Paper wasp Zerg Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Panama Canal RuneScape quests Drill bit Tag Bee Redundant array of independent disks Hard disk Blood (computer game) Diving suit Chemical warfare Aerial (dance move) Honeybee GunBound Red imported fire ant Naruto jutsu Naval mine Swimming Gypsy moth Air traffic control Haloalkane Motorcycle Air pollution Malaria Welding Space elevator Bedbug Glossary of firefighting terms Extreme Programming Tarantula Carpenter bee Glossary of climbing terms GunZ The Duel Spider Erosion Sniper Illegal drug trade Equine conformation Trench warfare Dinosaur Glossary of graph theory Xenomorph Floppy disk Jackass: The Movie Universal Serial Bus K' Brewery Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Ethernet Land mine Electrical wiring Password cracking Masonry Robot Master Gramophone record USS Tunny (SS-282) Asbestos Linked list Avalanche Rebreather Dog agility USS Yorktown (CV-5) Drowning Terry Bogard Bubble Bobble Resident Evil (video game)
