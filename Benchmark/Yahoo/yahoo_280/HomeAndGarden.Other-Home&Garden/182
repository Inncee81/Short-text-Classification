how to fix a slippery front patio our front patio leading to the front door is very slippery when wet and being rainy season here in florida it always seems to be wet i can't afford to rip it up right now is there anything i can paint on the surface that will prevent it from being so slippery or other low cost meathod making the patio safer i am going to guess that its a concrete patio the easiest and cheapest way is to go to your local home builders store and ask for cement floor paint you can get it with sand in it or you can spread some on while painting make sure you use floor paint other paints will not hold up to the traffic you could also try to etch the surface of the concrete with an acid this will make it a little rougher and less slippery if you etch the surface there is a good chance you will kill all plant life next to your patio because of the rinse water run off good luck Concrete Japanese tea ceremony Slippery slope Opportunity rover Terrazzo Rapid transit Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Dishwasher Stucco Reinforced concrete Printed circuit board Rear wheel drive Xanadu House Portland cement Carnivorous plant Printmaking Seismic retrofit Plastic Fountain Soap Solar power Pavement (material) Naval mine Vacuum cleaner Illegal drug trade Irrigation Masonry Table saw Casting Diving suit Paint Brush Sugar beet Basement Bicycle lighting Anchor Lechaina Kitchen Sailing Wood carving Desert Drawing Dairy Water purification Carbon dioxide Sento Dundas Square Home improvement Tag Hydrogen economy Geodesic dome Bladderwort Wayne Corporation Knife Titanium West Side Highway Capernaum K__ppen climate classification Sewage treatment St. James railway station, Sydney Glass Christmas tree Etching Car handling Floppy disk Photoengraving Shotcrete Semiconductor fabrication Hamster Sport utility vehicle Straw-bale construction Textile manufacturing Paintball Sandpaper School bus Bicycle Anti-lock braking system Plaster Battery (electricity) Fluoride therapy Photolithography Model aircraft Water (molecule) Fire fighting Bamboo Bus models used in New York City Transit Soil Diving Heinkel He 100 Quang Ninh Province Florida Keys Tile Tire Autonomous building Temporal bone Rathfarnham Whitewater
