how do i keep mold from forming on my strawberry jam when i can it of all the jams and jellies that my wife and i can strawberry jam seems to give us the worst problem there should never be any mold present when properly canned sounds like you need to re evaluate your processing get a blue book for canning and follow it exactly this is more of a science than an art for sure my guesses are starting with a product the fruit that is already over ripe if anything use slightly under ripe fruit discard anything that is soft and mushy leaving too much head space in jars distance between product and seal lid jars not actually sealing properly when sealed properly you should actually be able to hear them sort of ping during the night as they seal themselves my grand mother actually used to know the exact counts in her head of what she'd canned that day and as one would ping late into the night she'd be heard saying softly Food preservation Sauerkraut Canning Garden Strawberry Jelly Cheese Fruit Cannabis cultivation Wang Mang Antique fruit jar IP (complexity) Casting Tea Tin can Strawberry Cuisine of Brazil Jazz Waste management Tofu Food Pearl Jam Strawberry Fields Forever Jamiroquai Plastic Fanta Beastie Boys Gatorade USS Tunny (SS-282) Phonograph cylinder Bong Hamster Genericized trademark Grand Ole Opry Peanut butter Loganberry Four sons of Horus Radar USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Table tennis Dr Pepper Porgy and Bess The J.M.
