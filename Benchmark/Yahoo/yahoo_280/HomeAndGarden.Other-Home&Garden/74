fireplace how to use and know if its clean or not my girlfriend and i just moved into an apartment with a fireplace the guy renting it to us said the previous renters just recently had it cleaned how much does it usually cost to get it cleaned how often does it need to be cleaned is there a way i can tell if its too dirty to use how do i use it thanks so much for your help if it's an apartment the landlord should accept the responsibility of having it ceaned after all it's his place that's in jeopardy take a flashlight and look up damper opened of course and look at the flue an inch or two of gunk isn't bad if there is more gunk than open space that is bad only burn hardwood oak etc never burn softwood pine fir and especially not ever any pressure treated wood also ash the wood not the stuff is worthless so don't let anyone ever sell it to you how to use it wow first make sure the damper is open before you do anything put your kindling on the grate starting with the littlest twigs then maybe some bigger pieces then your actual split logs make that a triangular pile two pieces on bottom with space between them one piece on top with split side down some crumpled newspaper underneath the grate should be your starter light that and the rest should ignite since you don't sound like you've ever been a boy scout might wanna check out 'firestarters' they're available in stores or 'fat lighter' pine tree deep roots with lots of flammable sap if the fireplace doesn't have glass doors be sure there is at least a mesh screen in front of it embers will try to fly out and your initial instinct when it lands on the carpet will be to grab it sounds insane but that is what it is also remember that unless you have glass doors on it or it's a woodstove all closed in that you're gonna lose more heat than you gain so it's more of a romantic thing than an energy thing never close the damper when you think the fire is out it's not if you're only going to use it occassionally wait at least hours before you close it check to see if it's safe by running your fingers near the ashes any heat do not close damper cleaning costs since you say it's an apartment are you on the first floor or the th floor you're going to be liable from the roof down that's why i say landlord should assume responsibility i've only had fireplaces in single or double story homes in nc double story last i checked ten years ago was about i've since moved to florida and swore on the bible that i'd never tote another piece of firewood Campfire Wood Wood fuel Kitchen Seismic retrofit Stairway Fireplace Chatsworth House Barbecue Hamster Christmas tree Upholstery Violin Movie projector Door Aerial (dance move) Textile manufacturing Wood carving Internal ballistics Poker jargon Stove Piano Kasparov versus The World Longleaf Pine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Explosive material Pok__mon Chronicles Furnace Piccolo Junior Saga Fire Eucalyptus AFI 100 Years series Portable stove Bass guitar The Time Machine Glossary of wildland fire terms Shaggy dog story Gypsy moth Drill bit Professional wrestling slang Car handling Solar cell Bong Sin City Glossary of firefighting equipment Volleyball Tag Mount St. Helens Jet engine Glossary of firefighting terms Professional wrestling throws Buckingham Palace Dundas Square Drag racing M16 (rifle) RuneScape quests Guinea pig STS-61 Opportunity rover Fire extinguisher Solar power Collision detection Jennifer Lopez Fast bowling Magical objects in Harry Potter Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Coal Bristol Grammar School John Hancock Tower Fancy rat Futurama (TV series - season 5) Satchel Paige The Parting of the Ways Fluorescent lamp Bread Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Humphrey Bogart Carbon dioxide The Star Wars Holiday Special Late Night with Conan O'Brien Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Thermal power station Hindenburg disaster Fossil fuel power plant Chess terminology Charcoal Harp Elevator Empire Burlesque Yosemite National Park Skateboarding trick Dairy
