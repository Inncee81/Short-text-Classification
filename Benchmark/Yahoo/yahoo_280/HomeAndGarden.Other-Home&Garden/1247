mice problem we have been having a bad problem with mice in our house we arnt dirty people but we live in quite an old house and the mice have travelled from our next door neighbours loft into our house its very unhygenic we have put down some traps they just catch the mice they dont kill them and then we release them we cant seem to get rid of them and we catch about one or two mice a week does anyone have any idea as to how we can handle this problem thanks well i think the first thing you should do is seal off your part of the loft once you have this fixed it will be half the battle mice build their nest near a good food source they mainly forage at night eating the first morsel they come across keep all foodstuff safely out of their way in containers cupboards or a refrigerator plug all holes however small with cement or plaster reinforced with wire wool you also need to buy bigger trap s so when they do enter the trap it will kill them they won t have to hang about waiting for you to realize them use bate such as chocolate peanut butter and a great way of catching them is to use spanish chorizo sausage or any other strong smelling sausage place the traps at right angles to the wall with the treadle towards the wall to avoid catching your fingers use a pencil to move the set trap into position make sure you place the traps out of the way of family pet s and warn children not to touch them but i think you really should have words with your neighbor if he is inviting the mice into his home every night for dinner he will never rid the problem and neither will you speak to him first he if is not willing to do anything about it then go to your local council and they will sent the pest control to his house first mice what s next rats Agriculture HyperText Transfer Protocol Tomato Apache HTTP Server PHP Maize Web server Ajax (programming) Flower Alcohol fuel World Wide Web CPAN Domain Name System Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Flowering plant Hamster Peruvian cuisine Genetically modified food Comfrey Luther Burbank Wget Cross site scripting Web application Grafting FAQ Rotten Tomatoes Phishing ImageMagick Uniform Resource Locator Virtual hosting Green Revolution Growing degree day Streaming media Internet privacy Website Introduced species Who is a Jew?
