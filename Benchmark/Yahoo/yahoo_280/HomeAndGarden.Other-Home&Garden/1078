hello i wish a christian interpretation of my dream i had a dream i was in a garden field with corn plants a certain portion in the middle is thick corn plants real green with fruit but no cereals on it while at the surroundings there are some corn plants scattered having distance from each other real green as at the middle but they have healthy fruits a teacher was standing besides the corn plants at the middle talking to me while i was there harvesting sweet potatoes i harvested about kilos or more now i have some idea but i do believe it would be great to have others understanding ideas or interpretations since in a thing their could be different views it is better to consider the views of others in this way more ideas more knowledge thanks a lot i'm not going to claim any sort of special revelation but i think you could maybe draw a parallel between the thick foliage minus the cereals and the unfortunate majority of churchgoers whose lives don't bear spiritual fruit likewise it's those who do bear fruit who seem like the outsiders because they are doing what christ tells them to do not just hearing and then not obeying take a look at john i am the true vine and my father is the gardener he cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful you are already clean because of the word i have spoken to you remain in me and i will remain in you no branch can bear fruit by itself it must remain in the vine neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me i am the vine you are the branches if a man remains in me and i in him he will bear much fruit apart from me you can do nothing if anyone does not remain in me he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers such branches are picked up thrown into the fire and burned if you remain in me and my words remain in you ask whatever you wish and it will be given you this is to my father's glory that you bear much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples also matthew that same day jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it while all the people stood on the shore then he told them many things in parables saying a farmer went out to sow his seed as he was scattering the seed some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow but when the sun came up the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root other seed fell among thorns which grew up and choked the plants still other seed fell on good soil where it produced a crop a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown he who has ears let him hear Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cereal Holy Spirit Agriculture Maize Apple Potato Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Gospel of Thomas Original sin Sorghum Olive Dispensationalism Soul Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Flowering plant Ten Commandments Plant Peanut Hemp Weed control Church of Christ Christian views of Jesus Vegetarianism Pine Christianity Pea Sukkot Tobacco Garden Strawberry Banana Gooseberry Organic food Combine harvester Pysanka Book of Isaiah Sabbath Black pepper Fruit tree propagation Sugar beet Watermelon Hamster Vanilla Trinity Wheat Green Revolution Bonsai Alan Campbell (pastor) Barley Entheogen Jesus John Howard Yoder Pruning fruit trees Sweetcorn Determinism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Meaning of life Kiwifruit Divine grace Merit Satan Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Didache Mary, the mother of Jesus Turnip (brassica rapa) Apricot End times Endowment (Mormonism) Bamboo Coffea arabica Slow Train Coming New Testament view on Jesus' life Coast Douglas-fir Banksia Origin belief Bread Rice Book of Mormon 613 mitzvot Gospel of Mark Sweet potato Simone Weil Historical Jesus Battles of Lexington and Concord Jehovah's Witnesses Baptism Eucharist John the Baptist Apostle Socrates Genesis Acorn Johnny Appleseed Karma
