do heat pumps replace a furnace currently my house has a forced air heating system being run off a furnace that's in a foot crawl space the cooling is through in wall ac units i'm a little nervous about carbon monoxide spreading both under the house through the open area crawl or through the forced air ducts i'm looking into getting a heat pump if i also get an electric tankless water heater for my hot water needs will i still have a need for the furnace or can i remove or disable it also i read the existing duct work can be used for the heat but is it really efficient to have the cool air coming out of the floor also thanks the heat pump plus suplemental electric heating would replace the existing furnace it you want to get rid of combustion heating all to gether most forced air heat cooling systems have the air coming out of floor vents if the forced air heating cooling system is sized and balanced correctly it should work quite effectively leaving the forced air system fan set to continuous keeps the air temperature more even and less tenperature swings i do not know where you are located but forced air heating cooling systems are predominently used in canada most have the vents in the floor and do a fine job of heating and cooling you will have to upgrade your electric service if it does not have enough capacity you will likely require a amp service canada and u s a the existing should fine selecting contractors look up local contractors first work out form the closest to your location if some you trust has had work done similar to yours ask them about the contractor they used if they were completely satisfied with their contractor s ask for their telephone number select at least your are interested do a google yahoo search on each of the contractors you are interested in look for praises check who is writing the praises to see if they have any connection to the contractor scam artists and coffident persons often work in groups google yahoo search the people giving the praise or references when you are satisfied with at least contractors per job have the give you written estimates with details of work to be done terms guarantee s cost of extras how much do they charge if they find something not covered by the contract paymant schedules if necessary and whatever else you can think of to protect yourself if the contractor tries to pressure you into signing the contract immediately with a high deposit more than reject that contractor be careful high pressure can be someone who sounds very convincing but has many reasons why you should sign on the dotted line now it is always good to have another adult with you when a contractor inspects the work to be done if you do not get at least written estimates signed by the contractor not you do not sign yet go back to repeat until you get written estimates signed by the contractor not you do not sign yet read the estimates over with some who has some knowledge of the work that has to be done this may take longer than you thought do not rush into it research resaerch research helps when you are ready choose by bein informed good luck Thermal power station Carburetor Furnace Solar power Explosive material Fossil fuel power plant Internal combustion engine Casting Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Thermostat Fire fighting Heat Hydrogen economy Air conditioning Renewable energy Spark plug Ocean thermal energy conversion Glossary of firefighting terms Energy development Water (molecule) Pebble bed reactor Jet engine Space shuttle main engine Autonomous building Two-stroke cycle Stirling engine Transformer Electrical wiring Solar cell Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Wind power Diesel engine Brewery Carbon dioxide Elevator Vacuum tube Heinkel He 100 Steel Heat pump Steam engine Fuel injection Energy Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Spacecraft propulsion Scramjet Dairy E85 Peltier-Seebeck effect Propeller Refrigerator Tire Three Mile Island Carbon dioxide sink Basement Ceramics Turbojet Laser Hyperthermia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Turbofan Internal ballistics Space Shuttle program Lighting Swamp cooler Solar panel Petroleum Natural monopoly Hubble Space Telescope Sun Glossary of firefighting equipment Alternative fuel Town gas Chevrolet Corvair Incandescent light bulb Passive solar Redundant array of independent disks Iron Gas compressor Coffee Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Environmental concerns with electricity generation Ford Ranger EV Hydrogen Blood pressure Kitchen Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Asbestos Web crawler Bong Rocket fuel Turbocharger Unemployment
