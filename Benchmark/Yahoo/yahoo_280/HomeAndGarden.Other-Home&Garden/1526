huntsman spiders i have a lot of huntsman spiders around my house and im terrified of them so scared i dont wanna fight them but i was wondering if there was any good ways of lowering my fear of them what do u think would be the best method catch them and take them outside they live in nature under the bark of trees how to catch get a clear plastic container the type they sell fried rice in at chinese restaurants is ideal when the spider is on a flat surface eg wall place the container over it then slide a sheet of stiff paper or cardboard or the container lid under the container making the spider run up into the container then place the lid on the container you can then inspect the spider at close quarters without fear and then take it outside don't touch them they can give a nasty nip especially when the females are protecting their egg sacs but they are not poisinous don't worry about being afraid the spider willl be terrified of you Irrigation Glossary of firefighting equipment Diving regulator Jet engine Dundas Square Glossary of firefighting terms Diesel engine Fire extinguisher Electrophysiology Gas metal arc welding Fountain Turbojet Hydraulic machinery Space shuttle main engine Spacecraft propulsion Thermal power station Vacuum cleaner Herbicide Concrete Turbocharger Drip irrigation Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Dialysis Vacuum Hydroponics Woodworking Swamp cooler Injection moulding Air conditioning Pump Intravenous therapy Carburetor Aerial refueling Shotcrete Fire engine Gas tungsten arc welding Fiberglass Circuit breaker Fuel injection Powder metallurgy The Sweetest Apu Enema Turbofan Stirling engine Steam locomotive nomenclature Two-stroke cycle Fire Sprinkler String theory Fossil fuel power plant Urban beach Infusion pump Aviation fuel Portable stove Flamethrower B-47 Stratojet Glossary of wildland fire terms Bong Dam Autonomous building Genericized trademark Model rocket Nasal spray Tesla turbine Nalgene Afterburner (engine) Heat Plasma arc welding Victoria Falls Diode Energy development Diving cylinder Steam engine Fire hydrant Filling station Tier One Smoke-screen Transformer 2004 World Series CLAMP Fire fighting Splash pad Rebreather Turbine Fan (implement) Ocean thermal energy conversion Thomas Cole Brewery Shotgun Breastfeeding Submersible pump Agriculture Fuel pump Hydroelectricity Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Christmas tree Wine making Eldfell Scramjet Operational amplifier
