do spiders pee my parents keep saying this since i was young that household pests like spiders' pee can cause the lips eyes or whatever sensitive body parts to 'rot' how true is that great question here is an article all about it source is sited below here is their question and response question do spiders urinate why i get this question so often i don't know answer spiders have structures designed to get rid of nitrogenous waste these are called malpighian tubules and function in a manner similar to our own kidneys spiders don't produce urine like we do but produce uric acid which doesn't dissolve in water and is a near solid spiders have this alternate form of waste because they can't afford to lose as much water as we do these malpighian tubules drain into an pouch attached to the digestive tract called a stercoral pocket so the uric acid waste from the kidneys is combined and eliminated together with solid waste from the digestive tract in this sense spiders don't deposit separate feces and urine but rather a combined waste product that exits from the same opening anus oh look leah we have the same source you forgot to site your source though Uric acid Insect Renal physiology Urine Sewage treatment Osmoregulation Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Nephron Nutrition Toilet humour Gastrointestinal tract Urinary system Urea Ammonia Biochemistry Cat Animal Nitrogen Urinary incontinence Vitamin C Glycogen storage disease type I Toilet Snake Prostate cancer Protein Water Carnivorous plant Biodiesel Gout Kidney stone Acute renal failure Herpes simplex virus Japanese toilet Hamster Insulin Dialysis Feces Vermicompost Bacteria Reptile Penis Carbon dioxide Tumor lysis syndrome Poison Scorpion Animal communication Hydrochloric acid Tissue engineering Eutrophication Chlorine Cirrhosis Guinea pig Diabetes insipidus Anus Sulfuric acid Dehydration Wilson's disease Nuclear power Urinary tract infection House Mouse Serine protease Cancer Jellyfish Androgen Alkane Urination Cell (biology) Waste Autonomic nervous system Tooth Phosphorus Chlorophyta Natural gas Future energy development Technetium Plastic Stomach Casting Crohn's disease Dairy Pneumonia Liver Alcohol fuel Blood (computer game) Bladderwort Epithelium Acid rain Antibody Defecation Meiosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
