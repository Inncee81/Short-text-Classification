adt alarm stopped working a few days ago the alarm which wasn't set began to go off i ran downstairs punched in the code and it stopped since then it doesn't work at all almost like the power was shut off to it you can push the buttons but it's totally dead i checked my breaker box and it's fine every electrical outlet appliance is working fine it's just the alarm system it never shut down when electricity went out anyway i stopped paying for the service more than a year ago so my question is this can they control the electricity that powers the alarm if i call someone they may sell me another year of service which i don't want does anyone have a suggestion that doesn't involve me contacting adt thanks sorry to say but i think you'll have to call adt to reset it from their office it's wired to them in case of an emergency so they can call the police or fire department Residual-current device Elevator National Electrical Code (US) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets 2003 North America blackout Thermal power station BS 1363 Embedded system X10 (industry standard) Relay Toyota Prius Fuse (electrical) The Star Wars Holiday Special Glossary of firefighting terms Switch Nortel Networks Dennis Rader Daylight saving time Ocean's Twelve 7 July 2005 London bombings Three-phase electric power Glossary of firefighting equipment Poker jargon Distribution board The Inside Urinary incontinence Advance fee fraud Ground and neutral Jean Charles de Menezes Plame affair TGV Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Palm OS Internet fraud Jeff Gannon Abstract data type Electric motor United Technologies Corporation Ring circuit Smoke detector Cable television Firefighter Thermostat Oplan Bojinka Mouse (computing) Punch card Enron Corporation Reservoir Dogs Three Mile Island Fire alarm Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Fire Electrical engineering The Ark in Space Animal Liberation Front EastEnders Security guard Escape from New York Electrician Piccolo Junior Saga Oscilloscope Railway signal Toronto Transit Commission Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Amish Visual Basic STS-61 Hybrid vehicle Shaggy dog story Lineman (occupation) World War Three (Doctor Who) Stopping power Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Telephone numbering plan Citigroup Shadow the Hedgehog Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Voice over IP 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines British national identity card Overhead lines Clarence Thomas Electric power Phreaking Emergency telephone number Sega Saturn Apollo Guidance Computer Appliance Traffic light Railway signalling SS Morro Castle Domain Name System Telegraphy Alarm management
