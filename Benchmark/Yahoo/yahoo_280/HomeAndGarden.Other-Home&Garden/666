pepper spray mace i am looking to get a good non lethal home invasion protection especially what happened in cheshire ct last week cheshire is town away from me i want a long range and maximum strength no wimpy little devices that squirt any suggestions i need brand names model numbers and where to get it regards bob you really do not want to use pepper spray or mace inside your own home the chemicals will linger and everyone will wonder why you're crying all the time i would recommend tazer brand electroconvulsive devices or semi nonlethal ammunition the gauge shotgun holds most of the available rounds and will intimidate burglars quite a bit more than the tazer plus you can upgrade if nonlethal isn't cutting it but be aware that most semi non lethal rounds are likely to be lethal at ranges of less than fifteen feet those that are safe at this close range may do nothing at greater ranges http www hi vel com catalog specialized shotshell ammuniti specialized shotshell ammuniti html Shotgun Shotgun shell Electroshock gun Ammunition M16 (rifle) Team Fortress Classic Riot control .22 Long Rifle M4 Carbine Internal ballistics Police HyperText Transfer Protocol Personal weapon Trench warfare Jet Force Gemini Lethal injection Boxing Beretta 92F/FS SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Cascading Style Sheets British Home Guard Archery Heinkel He 100 Long gun Stopping power Screw M1 Abrams Combine (Half-Life 2) Zerg Sears Holdings Corporation Firearm RuneScape Items in the Metroid series Clinical depression Hard disk RuneScape weapons Artillery Armored Core Paintball Fire fighting Explosive material Mossberg 500 GunZ The Duel Dialysis PlayStation 2 Electroconvulsive therapy Cheshire Cannabis (drug) Rifle Transmission Control Protocol Tank R-Type Pepper spray Krag-J__rgensen M60 machine gun Papa's Got a Brand New Badge Resident Evil (video game) Natural Selection (computer game) Lightsaber Charles Graner Doom enemies Cannon RGB color model Directed-energy weapon Advertising Weapon Capsaicin Diving cylinder Battlefield 2 Betting (poker) World Wide Web Poker jargon Gun politics Structure of the British Army Woodworking Gun safety High-voltage hazards DDT Protoss Character encodings in HTML Diving IA-32 MIM-23 Hawk Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Speed limit Nuclear fallout Royal Marines Space Shuttle program Scarification M4 Sherman Saiga-12 Vitamin C Heckler & Koch G3 The Contender (television series) Nutmeg Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act 5.56 x 45 mm NATO
