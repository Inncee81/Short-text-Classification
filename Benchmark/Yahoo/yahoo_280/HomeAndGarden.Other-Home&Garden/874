where to find huge stackable plastic compost makers i visited some 'old hippie' friends and they had huge stackable compost makers in their city backyard you could then get the bottom layer off must take two people to get the 'finished' compost then use it in your garden the reason i ask is because we have a compost 'bin' which we have used oh ten years now and no one has ever gotten any compost out of it to use ever as the stuff all over the top is so horrifying who wants to bury through it it always stays about feet deep no matter that we have filled it ten years straight now so something that i could 'get' the 'finished' stuff out of would be great i know you are going to say 'make compost areas' but since my husband hasn't dug into the compost in ten years what makes you think he is going to build another compost frame also after ten years and flimsy framing i'm sure if we 'move it' it does have a screen on bottom it will just fall to pieces then i'll have no compost area i guess i have happy earthworms hey check here http www greenhousesandgazebos com compost bins aspx Vermicompost Compost Comfrey Composting toilet Waste management Cardboard Coffee Houseplant Earthworm Sewage treatment Langstroth hive Dairy Donovan Toilet Traditional animation Biodynamic agriculture Autonomous building Volleyball No-dig gardening Chair The Chemical Brothers Roswell UFO incident Drainage Mulch Door Dustbin Lake District Mattress Textile manufacturing Bassoon Poker jargon Upholstery Christmas tree The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bong Stairway Casting Seismic retrofit Amateur telescope making Air-raid shelter Avalanche Paul McCartney Canoe The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Strap-on dildo Osama bin Laden The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bicycle frame Cultural Revolution Legionellosis Cello Equine conformation John Peel Drill bit Violin Muslim ibn Aqeel Anchor DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Light-frame construction Movie projector Geodesic dome Natural building Glacier Flood geology Recycling Hey Jude Burial Timber framing Sampling (music) Harmonica Piano Agriculture Clarinet Great Pyramid of Giza Wrigley Field Domain Name System Desperate Housewives HyperText Transfer Protocol Tuff Erie Canal Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Solar cell Hamster Woodworking Torquay United F.C.
