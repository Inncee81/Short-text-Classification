i live in florida i was wondering how do those nasty palmetto bugs get in houses by the way my house is clean pipes most commonly they come in at a crack where they dug the pipes in or a crack in a closet the pipes that run under your house straight up into your bathroom under the sink are not sealed that tightly think round pipe square hole often if you have a sunroom or screened in porch the seal around the door isn't as good as the outside doors since it doesn't need to meet the same waterproofing standards they can walk into the garage from the outside and then once in the garage there are often cracks where the concrete slabs don't match up especially if the garage was added on later of course they can also come up from inside the pipe itself into the tub or kitchen sink they find ways but most of the time it is into a bathroom or kitchen filthy little things aren't they i live at the beach and i know what you mean can't keep your house clean enough to not have them but every area has something i used to live in the mountains and we had ladybugs and for a month or so you'd have hundreds of ladybugs in your house and nothing you could do about it i poor clorox down the drain and i like to think that does something to discourage them and a cheap method at that but i'm not sure it really works or just makes me feel better about it Kitchen Poker jargon The Brady Bunch Seismic retrofit Dundas Square Shaggy dog story Hogwarts Floor Directory McMansion Jackass: The Movie Knife Drill bit Dairy Domestic water system Plumbing fixture The Shining (film) Japanese toilet Saw II Social rule The Inside Washroom Basement The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Wood carving Ladybug (arcade game) Screw Conspiracy (TNG episode) Dishwasher Bong Dormitory Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Young Ones (TV series) Textile manufacturing Debugging Humphrey Bogart Toilet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drug test Sailing Columbine High School massacre Passive solar Prisons in the United States Bus models used in New York City Transit Ultima Online Jumpstart 3rd Grade Concrete Dymaxion house Fecal incontinence Naval mine Light-emitting diode Diamond Scarlet's Walk Combine (Half-Life 2) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Floppy disk Blood Simple Masonry Equine conformation Brewery Cosmo Kramer Brazing Trapped in the Closet Jam (TV series) King Khalid International Airport Computer security Plastic Dishwashing Russian joke Hebburn The Fairly OddParents Shotgun house RuneScape quests TARDIS Futurama (TV series - season 4) Syphon Filter Wind turbine Internal ballistics Mach kernel Avenue Q The Hobbit Air-raid shelter Toilet paper Diseases of the honeybee Casting Friends Solar cell Flush toilet The Suffering (game) Naruto jutsu The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Eifel Aqueduct Rathfarnham Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Autonomous building Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) EastEnders Anchor Diving Volleyball Abbey About Schmidt
