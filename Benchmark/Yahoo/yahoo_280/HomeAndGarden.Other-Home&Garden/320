i have a ever hot wood fire in the house i just moved into does anyone else have one or know how to use it well i know that you have to start the fire haha and feed it but there are leavers and i don't know what to do with them i guess if i started the fire i could work it all out but i don't wanna go burning the house down i don't but my neighbour has he chops wood up and i assume he feeds the fire which i suppose needs to be started like a coal fire got to say that if you can manage to get it to work you should keep it the smell is phenomenal and it really adds a rustic feel to the neighbourhood Barbecue Fire Phoebe Buffay's songs Campfire Alcohol fuel Russian joke Charcoal Forge Kitchen Technology Fire fighting Dualism (philosophy of mind) Wood fuel Stove Great Chicago Fire Acorn I Don't Wanna Cry Coal Phenomenalism I Want to Hold Your Hand RuneScape skills Chatsworth House Explosive material Great Fire of London Friends Branch Davidian Thermal power station V.F.D.
