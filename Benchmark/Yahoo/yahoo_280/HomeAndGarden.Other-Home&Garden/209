about how many worms should i place in my soil i have an indoor plant that has been growing for about weeks and i have been taking very good care of it the plant is about in tall and i have it tied to a pen to make it strong enough to stand on its own and it is kept in a red party cup my dad and i went fishing today so we had alot of left over worms and i was wondering how many worms i should place into the container to help the plant reach its maximum growing potential any suggestions will be very helpful thank you in advance zero worms your plant is already enjoying the end product of the earthworm earthworms are wonderful and necessary in a compost pile or in the ground because they eat their way through the decaying vegetation and excrete it as a form of fertilizer but your living plant has no decaying parts so the worm does it no good and will only starve planter mix has all the nutrients a young plant needs so just keep the soil moist not wet and when the plant gets big too big for your cup transplant it into a larger pot or into the ground meantime return your extra worms to an area that is damp and rich with grass cuttings and old leaves they will soon turn it all into nice rich soil growing things is one of the most wonderful things i can think of to do enjoy Earthworm Compost Vermicompost Hemp Houseplant Comfrey Tobacco Bonsai Weed control Soil pH Agriculture Organic farming Tea Textile manufacturing Soil Hamster Fruit tree propagation Cheese Desert Hydroponics Humus Jute Logging Garlic Organic gardening Sewage treatment Sandworm (Dune) Composting toilet Animal Garden Strawberry Flax Soil life Mulch Pine Coconut crab Leaf Bamboo Grand Teton National Park Peanut Surtsey Japanese tea ceremony Sugar beet Rainforest Ascariasis Coffee Plant Stratification (botany) Fertilizer Lawn Irrigation Alfalfa Waste management Shifting cultivation Chlorophyta Beetle Lake Gardening Gypsy moth Sugarcane Deforestation Geology of the Grand Canyon area Tofu The Fens Tillage Herbicide Illegal drug trade Manure Dairy Alcohol fuel Weed Olive Opportunity rover Potato Cocaine Tillandsia Flowering plant Agricultural machinery Carbon dioxide sink Chicken Cannabis (drug) Football (soccer) Mnemonic Desertification Annelid Prosopis cineraria Moss Soils retrogression and degradation Fish farming Biogeochemical cycle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Photosynthesis Seismic retrofit Tree Fancy rat
