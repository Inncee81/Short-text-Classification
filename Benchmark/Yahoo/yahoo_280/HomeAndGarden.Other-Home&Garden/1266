for people who lost their water in the west now you've got it back have you noticed any difference in your water supply obviously it's highly chlorinated and undrinkable right now but our water pressure is absolutely crap and our shower temperature not a power shower but one that runs off of the bath taps is a lot more changeable and harder to control than it used to be my partner says it will get better and it's just cos everyone is using so much water catching up on washing etc but surely we all have by now and it should be back to normal i think it's something we will have to sort so what's your experience oof it please im obviously alot happier since it came back on because it was a nightmare and i couldnt move for bottles of water everywhere lol but since it came back on i have found it pretty much the same to be honest maybe it could be something to do with your boiler i dont know but i agree with you that everyone would have caught up with their washing by now i did in the first days of it coming back on hope you sort out your propblem soon and enjoy the water im off to have a shower Color theory Color Wood Wood carving Upholstery Human skin color The Wall Chatsworth House Rococo Bedroom Gatorade Fancy rat IMac Leather Pink Floyd Staining (biology) Mattress Kitchen My Little Pony Yoshi M&M's Pottery Care Bears Pink Floyd trivia Grace Cossington Smith Primer (paint) Sunglasses Common bean Stucco Billiards Furniture Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Netsuke Opal Mouse (computing) Pysanka The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Milton H.
