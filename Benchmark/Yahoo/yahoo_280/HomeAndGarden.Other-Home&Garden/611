how can i make grocery shopping less tedious i hate going to the grocers it takes me about hours to do the shopping if they didn't have this loud music at the stores i would take my mp player any ideas or tips i actually really love to go grocery shopping but maybe that's because i am trained as a chef having come thru some really difficult times in my life i feel incredibly greatful to have enough money to buy healthy foods that are good for me and my family i also appreciate air conditioning when it's f or higher outside and so muggy that i feel i'm swimming in my clothing for me produce is incredibly beautiful to look at and to touch i find it completely inspiring to imagine what meals i'll make with it for the ones i love when i get home i find that if i can focus on beauty gratitude inspiration art and wonderful food that these things make all the difference in my world if i could just find some inspiration in the huge pile of dishes in my kitchen the beds that need to be made every single day of my life the bathroom that keeps needing to be cleaned or the piles and piles of laundry my kids seem to keep making i would be in a much better head space yeah having to do the same things over and over again can be an extreme pain but there can be joy in it too Sears Holdings Corporation Epcot Futurama (TV series - season 4) Supermarket Chinatown About a Boy Little Britain Garfield Current teachings of Prem Rawat Tesco The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Happiness The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Shining (film) Jon Secada Textile manufacturing 1957 World Series Dairy Wal-Mart The Fairly OddParents Fugu EastEnders Real Love (song) Camp Lazlo Ranma __ characters Futurama (TV series - season 2) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Calvin and Hobbes Food Hell's Kitchen (television) Organic food Avenue Q RuneScape quests The Star Wars Holiday Special Fecal incontinence Married... with Children Cajun cuisine Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Social rule Good Times Clothing The Amber Spyglass Japanese tea ceremony Hamster Iron Chef The Apprentice 2 Mahjong Chatsworth House The Jam Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rule of St Benedict Watermelon Friends Ice cream RuneScape skills Diving Sin City French cuisine The Inside Milton H.
