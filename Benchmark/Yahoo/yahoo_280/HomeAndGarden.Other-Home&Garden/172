older houses with strange shower heads in the basement recently i have encountered some older homes with strange features in the basements usually cinder block types i have come across random showers in the corners all that is there is a pipe with a shower head coming out of it and a small drain on the cement floor what are or were these showers used for i'm not quite sure on the age of the houses i would say most likely pre 's and yes there is room for a person to stand underneath i had also seen a tv show where they identified a similar shower as a butcher shower where a butcher would cut up meat in the basement and wash the blood off when he finished working the show was about paranormal activity and the people who lived in the home felt that horrible things had happened in the basement so i'm a bit freaked out by these showers i saw the same show you did and that was the first thing that came to mind but it is still just a shower and not necessarily used after butchering animals i would imagine that they were used to wash off after any chore that was dirty like farming ranching cleaning stalls as well as butchering dinner no reason to be freaked out it's just a shower Kitchen Sento Japanese toilet Milton H.
