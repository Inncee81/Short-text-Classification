another question about building a home is the price ever negotiable i mean its a modular and they are pretty set on pricing but if i have good reasons and concerns of their high costs can i challenge it nope i signed nothing i've read some of your other questions just haven't had time to answer at the right moment here's the deal there are several different types of construction that are called modular homes the classic variety is the double wide built in two sections hauled to your foundation and bolted together these are almost never a good deal long term i don't think this is what you are talking about other systems build the home is sections with varying degrees of finish at the factory fastened together on site and finished out these are usually a good deal better than the double wide but still have some issues some are rather well built but you won't know what you have for or years when things start to settle these are often more expensive than conventional construction the selling points are that they go up quicker in some cases and you can see a duplicate home before you buy the numbers you are talking about do sound a bit high it is hard to say for certain without knowing what is included but i do think you would be doing yourself a disservice if you do not at least talk to a couple of custom builders you should be able to find one that will build something similar to what you are looking at perhaps at a lower price at the very least this would give you some idea what a reasonable price is for your area if you find lower prices and you are set on buying this it certainly would give you some leverage in talking to the dealer about price new home starts are down so there should be some give room in there Supply and demand Contract bridge Illegal drug trade Contract CPU design CPU cache Mutual fund Tariff Economics Modular form Price discrimination Poker jargon Modem United Kingdom corporation tax Atari 8-bit family Bulk vending Drill bit Floppy disk Health insurance Ra (board game) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Wayne Corporation Screw Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Microeconomics FairTax IBM PC compatible Political economy Estoppel Monetary policy Extreme Programming Arbitrage Externality Social rule Passenger car Slide rule Mattress Leica Prices of production Vowel Game show Gross domestic product Milton H.
