self home building permits needed plumbing electricity i want to build a home on my own land not a full sized normal home but something about the size of an apartment the question comes down to if i'm allowed to wire my own house and or if it's as efficient and legal to buy a natural gas generator and use extension cords behind the walls what are the costs involved in and most realistic ways to get water and electricity into a house how much would the cost of doing such things measure up against the price of building materials ie wood and cement for the foundation btw when i say extension cords i mean hooked to a minor say watt generator not a public ie grid power supply i wouldn't dare deal with anything that high voltage i'd compare placing extension cords in the walls for electricity to running garden hoses for water there are proper materials for the job use them or don't waste your time do the job right and you will be better off if you want to operate the house from a portable generator wire it up exactly as if you were connected to the grid install an electrical panel and run proper wiring to outlets lighting appliances etc it will be easy to plug the generator into the panel to power the house if at some time you plan to connect to the grid the house will already be wired and ready to go Solar power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Solar cell Transformer Electrical generator Electrical wiring Renewable energy Incandescent light bulb Welding Spark plug Autonomous building Alternating current Three-phase electric power Hydrogen economy Solar panel High-voltage direct current Electric power transmission Battery (electricity) Fuse (electrical) Ground and neutral Hybrid vehicle Electric motor Electricity meter TGV Nuclear power Energy development Laptop Thermal power station Kitchen BS 1363 Wind power Future energy development Oscilloscope Circuit breaker Transistor Electrical wiring (UK) Vacuum cleaner Manitoba Hydro Universal Serial Bus Loudspeaker Split phase Battery electric vehicle Radio controlled airplane Residual-current device Electric power Fan (implement) Seismic retrofit Rail transport modelling Mains electricity Glossary of firefighting equipment Carburetor Overhead lines Bicycle lighting Thermostat Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Grid energy storage Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Solar power satellite Internal combustion engine 2003 North America blackout Spacecraft propulsion Power cord Glossary of firefighting terms Power line communication X10 (industry standard) Extension Cord Toyota Prius Fuel cell War of Currents Rapid transit George Westinghouse E85 Electricity distribution Lighting Plastic Gas turbine Natural gas Fluorescent lamp Nuclear reactor Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Alternative fuel Sewage treatment Power station Arc welding Lawn mower Circuit design Jack plug Hydraulic machinery Enron Corporation Audiophile Thermocouple
