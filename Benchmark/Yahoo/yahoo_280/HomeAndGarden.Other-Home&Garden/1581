is it ok to dispose of my oil down the rainwater drain i've got about litres of waste car oil to dump and i imagine the easiest method is to tip it down the drain and allow it to break down naturally i was thinking of tipping some sand down afterwards to aid with 'soaking it up' failing that i would have to dispose of it on the edge of the local playing fields as there is a secluded area which it wouldn't pose a hazard no take it to your local council's rubbish tip they will dispose of it all of your suggestions will poison the local environment big style Swimming pool Mixed martial arts Garth Brooks Pikmin Fountain Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Marshall Mathers LP Topps Life insurance Ocean's Twelve Plame affair timeline Tag Full Metal Panic?
