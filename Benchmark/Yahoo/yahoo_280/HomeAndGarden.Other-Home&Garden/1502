i have an ant problem in my kitchen whats the best way to get rid of them their are ants always popping out of no where in my kitchen i tried using lysol but that did not work what are some ways or products i can use to get rid of them what are the best and effective products to get rid of ants in my kitchen mix a half teaspoon and half teaspoon of baking soda and icing sugar together dry powder then sprinkle the mix on the trail they normally travel it is non poisonous to you the kids the dog but not so for the ants they take it all to the nest and the queen gets some baking soda in her body and explodes no queen no nest anymore for more immediate results i use windex it slows them up doesn't really kill them they are hard for that or you could get an ant trap or you could put out a trap of sorts using a small dish or cat food can with it half full of sugar water in it and a drop of dish soap the ants will find the the sugar water and as they reach down to get some they will fall in the soap is so that the ants will break thru the water and sink to the bottom drowning that way they won't be able to go back to the nest to feed the queen and she will starve ending the nest Chinese New Year Eating Lettuce Kitchen Croquet (food) Cuisine of the Philippines Eating Raoul Kitchener's Army Jumpstart 3rd Grade Apple Jacks Roe Discworld gods Heath bar Fried chicken Japanese cuisine Frankfurt kitchen Oral sex Peanut butter Eating disorder Obesity Fuzzy logic Foodborne illness Date Palm Gareth Sushi Energy economics Crohn's disease Iron Chef Teacher's Pet (Disney) Fable (video game) Restaurant Good Eats Cat Food Alton Brown Binge eating disorder Hell's Kitchen Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener Cadbury Schweppes The BFG Kitchener Rangers Kitchener, Ontario Microwave oven Nerpa Celebrity chef Stoicism Camp Lazlo Dining room Fable: The Lost Chapters Experiment Singapore Changi Airport Mathematician Cookie Monster Negative and non-negative numbers Harry Enfield Vermicompost Pig Kenneth Kitchen House of Cards The Wild Thornberrys Cuisine of Brazil Domus The Brady Bunch Cuisine of Denmark Three 6 Mafia Chicken Alexander Technique Keynsham Jewish cuisine Tupolev Tu-22 University of the West of England Nettle Piccolo Junior Saga Chopsticks Caesar salad The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover Ramadan New Zealand First Snake Cockroach Halaal Vegetarianism Ozzy & Drix Sagitta Kosher foods Take-out Healthy eating Cuisine of Laos Cuisine of Hong Kong T___t Jan Smuts Night of the Long Knives (1981) David Lee Roth Codename: Kids Next Door With You Ontario provincial highway 401 Dodo Bobby Bare Smilax French cuisine
