can chipmunks get caught in mouse traps so i have a lot of veggies in the garden patch and i saw a mouse my mom said i had to trap it which trap should i use or should i leave it alone also which types of wildlife will the baits attract i have chipmunks a rabbit and a raccoon all feral all i want to trap is the mouse please answer if you insist on humane traps can i build my own and how well the thing is is that if you really want to keep your veggies for your own use all of those critters need to be gone from your garden if you want a humane way to do it get three traps one for the mouse very small one for the coon and the rabbit meduim sized to large trap and one for the chipmunk small make sure the grates are small enough for it to not escape rabbits and chipmunks are not easy to catch in them mice and coons are unfortunatly you are looking at spending to on live traps spoiled bologna works the best at catching the mice and coons peanut butter would work too but it can be messy btw the mouse is probably the least offensive critter in the garden to the plants personally i would choose getting a high power pellet gun or a and shooting them no worries other critters will return at some point and time to eat your veggies for you Trapping Shotgun Spidey Super Stories Peanut butter Mousetrap Mouse Fox hunting Cat Shen Gong Wu Tag Unreal Feral cat Garfield Gray Wolf Narnia Feral Rabies Mickey Mouse Chipmunk Kyle Broflovski Taboo food and drink Splash Mountain Fishing Magic Kingdom Hamster Mouse (computing) Island Fox Weekly World News Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Vegetarian cuisine Care-a-lot's Birthday MRE Raccoon One Piece minor characters Battle of the Bulge Peanut Flea Pok__mon Live!
