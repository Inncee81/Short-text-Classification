help my room is burning hot how can i cool it down heya my room is currently degrees fahrenheit even though it s around midnight and i'm pretty much dying the rest of my house is around degrees but even with my bedroom door open and hearing my idiot father's tv while he snores and the window open it doesn't cool down i have one of those evaporative coolers but somehow it actually makes my room feel hotter i guessed that was because it increased the humidity since it uses water to cool the room and bought a dehumidifier to try to counter act the humidity while still getting the cooling this didn't work either my room is a ' x ' heat box during the day and at night i have expensive gas insulated windows with blinds and curtains to keep the heat out i also have a ceiling fan two mini desk fans and a medium table fan plus the aforementioned cooler and dehumidifier please help me cool my room off i think i m starting to boil thank you you have a lot of heat sources in your room evepourative coolers are not effective in small rooms they do cool somewhat but increase the humidity which offsets any cooling dehumidifiers actually cause heat gain raises temperature air out is hotter than air going in the fans are producing heat possible solution turn off the ceiling fan dehumidifier and evapourative cooler only open your bedroom door a crack do not know the type of window but if it slides up to open sash window or opens out at the bottom awning window open it about to inches turn the small desk fans around to blow air out the open window this should draw air into your room from the rest of the house if the small fans are powerful enough to create a slight vacuum in your room an alternative to the two small fans is to purchase a window fan best are the ones with fans in the unit they fit in the opening created by open up the window there are controls on the unit one for each fan you can have both fans blowing the air out or have one blow air out and the other blow air in hope this helps good luck and pleasent dreams Pottery Chinese export porcelain Transformer Wood Cookware and bakeware Glass Porcelain Screw Korean pottery Weight training Mattress Knife Bicycle frame Glaze Strap-on dildo Rope Welding Timpani Diamond Korean tea ceremony Equine conformation Soap bubble Brewery Aluminium Japanese pottery Golden Plates Rococo Upholstery Casting Rise of Nations Piano Clarinet Gas metal arc welding Campfire Tank classification Chopsticks Amateur telescope making Raku Gilding Dental caries Airsoft Hair Antenna (radio) Houseplant Ethernet Cuisine of Denmark Internal ballistics Mithril Reading spark plugs for racing Kitchen Bokken Smoking pipe Geology of the Moon Porcelain crab Seismic retrofit Mineral M16 (rifle) Earthquake MP3 Wind turbine Heavy metal music Pearl USS Tunny (SS-282) Earring Anchor Spark plug Computer and video game genres Plastic Snowboard Guitar Kakiemon Tank GunZ The Duel Toilet humour Japanese cuisine Textile manufacturing Synchrotron Solar sail Teapot Armour Leaf M4 Sherman Reflecting telescope Dim sum Oscilloscope Corrosion Poker jargon Diamond cut Glossary of climbing terms Chinese art Violin Electrical wiring Movie projector Japanese tea ceremony Tap dance Climbing equipment Pizza Guqin Metallica
