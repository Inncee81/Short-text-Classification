how high can a toad jump should i help them my work moved to a new building location months ago last week i noticed there is a piece of pvc coming out of the ground w toads down in there it's about inches wide and deep there is some type of valve in there i just realized they are still in there and started wandering if maybe they fell in and got stuck i sure could use them in my garden at home to help get rid of the bugs they would love it there then again i don't to bother them if they are able to get out would you leave them alone or take them out i would take them out toads would have more fun in your garden than in some yucky pvc pipe anyway RuneScape quests Toad Patrol Blue Man Group Drainage Drill bit Polyvinyl chloride Irrigation Characters of Naruto Aerial (dance move) Frog Shaggy dog story Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
