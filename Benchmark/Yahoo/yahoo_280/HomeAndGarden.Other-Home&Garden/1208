how to kill spiders besides smashing them i live in an old house and i had it sprayed professionally times last year and this year it seems like its worse i hate spiders im going to the store later tonight to get spray and the stuff you lay around the foundation of your house but until then is there anything around the house i can mix together and spray on them to kill them i was spraying our sideing off and they just started coming out everywhere i dont want to touch them ughhhhh also i have had it sprayed professionally by the orkin man and they didnt do a good job that is the only company in my small town steps to non toxic spider control individual spiders can be removed from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up regular vacuuming or sweeping of windows corners of rooms storage areas basements and other seldomly used areas helps remove spiders and their webs vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually do not survive this process indoors a web on which dust has gathered is an old web that is no longer being used by a spider to prevent spiders from coming indoors seal cracks in the foundation and other parts of the structure and gaps around windows and doors good screening not only will keep out many spiders but also will discourage them by keeping out insects that they must have for food indoors keep clutter to a minimum place boxes off the floor and away from walls to help reduce their usefulness as a harborage for spiders sealing the boxes with tape will prevent spiders from taking up residence within clean up clutter in garages sheds basements and other storage areas be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites outdoors eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping the area next to the foundation free of trash leaf litter heavy vegetation and other accumulations of materials trimming plant growth away from the house and other structures will discourage spiders from first taking up residence near the structure and then moving indoors Identity theft Internet fraud Bank fraud Surveillance GSM services Gmail Fraud Advance fee fraud Phishing Credit card Mail fraud British national identity card Spam (electronic) Mail E-mail spam Social Security number (United States) Phreaking Skype HyperText Transfer Protocol Roswell UFO incident IP Multimedia Subsystem Automatic teller machine Voice over IP The Inside Emergency telephone number Identity document United States Postal Service Timeline of hacker history Telephone tapping Spyware ChoicePoint HTTP cookie Data retention Inspector General 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines United Airlines Flight 93 Direct marketing MSN Messenger Public-key cryptography Virgin Mobile Phone sex Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail Poker jargon Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act America Online Credit card fraud Microeconomics Schabir Shaik Trial Octopus card The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Electronic Arts Karl Rove Anonymity Beltway sniper attacks Musical Instrument Digital Interface Telephone numbering plan Social Security (United States) Electronic commerce Password Cross site scripting Opera (web browser) Telephone directory Ocean's Twelve Anonymous remailer Telephone booth Credit score Minitel 7 July 2005 London bombings Hacker (computer security) Credit repair Privacy Social rule Pretty Good Privacy Payphone Florida Central Voter File Call for help Compiler optimization Plame affair timeline Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Mail-order bride Network Switching Subsystem Short message service UK telephone numbering plan Enron Corporation Post Office box Wireless Application Protocol Han twins murder conspiracy Debit card Private branch exchange ZIP Code Contract bridge Aliens of London Patricia Ford
