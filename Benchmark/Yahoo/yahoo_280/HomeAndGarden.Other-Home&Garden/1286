are keys made to be stuck in locks when turned on purpose or is it purely because of chance that every lock iv seen the pins never go in increasing order of how much they need to be raised from back to front thus allowing the key to come out after being turned i meant ur standard pin tumbler locks and i understand the inside and why the key is held in but i was curious cuz i realized it is possible that with certain key shapes it wud not hold it in i started thinking about this cuz i was wondering how many different combinations were possible and didnt know whether or not to discount the ones where the key wud not be held in yes you want the key to be trapped unless in the withdrawal position that way the the lock is fully locked or not depending on it's function if a key could be withdrawn at random points the cylinder could be inadvertently be left unlocked manufacturers and master key programs should always reject key combination with descending cuts and anyway the points on the key would have to be filed down to be level with the cuts to pull the partially turned key Refrigerator Ice cream Freezer Dairy Air conditioning Sento Refrigerator car Food storage Haloalkane Ammonia Refrigerant Refrigeration Bone marrow transplant Insulation Autonomous building Jet engine Basement Puff pastry Cray-1 Floppy disk Negative feedback Freeze drying Major appliance Dehumidifier Fuzzy logic RISC E85 Shelf life Heat Heat engine Helium Organic food Diseases of the honeybee Ozone depletion Urban heat island Food preservation Swamp cooler Spinach Icehouse (building) Room temperature Superconductivity Railroad car CPU design Bong Ozone hole Cryogenics HVAC Freezing Carburetor Ice Milk Gas compressor Propane Amana Colonies Bagel Beatmania IIDX Crane (machine) Genericized trademark Brewery Anchor Heat pump Weighting filter Temperature PID controller Slow cooker Boiling water reactor Butane Carbon dioxide Atmospheric pressure Circuit design Pasteurization Redundant array of independent disks Explosive material Consumer goods in the Soviet Union Warehouse STS-87 Residual-current device Heike Kamerlingh Onnes Knife Helicopter Phase change heat pump Economy of Lithuania Aircraft engine controls Phase (matter) Mobile weapons Supercharger Stirling engine Gas absorption refrigerator Fuel cell Hash table MOSFET Gustavus Franklin Swift Compiler optimization Stock car (rail) Tofu Insulin Quintuplets Compost Cuisine of Denmark
