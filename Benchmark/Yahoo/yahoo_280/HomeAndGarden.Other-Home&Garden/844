smelly well water we have a well and the water that comes out of the faucets in the sinks and showers stinks it smells like sulfur or like rotten eggs is there any way to fix this yeah it smells no matter what the temp of the water brushing teeth with cold water or taking a shower with hot water it all stinks odds are pretty good you have iron in your well water one option that has worked for me has been to install a water softener and use the iron removing salt in it the iron may have also attached itself to the anode rod in your water heater and forms a smelly sulfur like bacteria if you contact the maker of your water heater they send you a replacement that the iron doesn't attach itself to some people have just removed the anode and cut it off and replaced the end like a plug the problem with that is that it shortens the life of your water heater Sulfur Hydrogen sulfide Ozone Sulfuric acid Thermostat Hard water Copper extraction Vacuum tube Fossil fuel power plant Plumbing fixture Bathroom Water (molecule) Halitosis Tofu Tooth Cruising (maritime) Sterling silver Alcohol fuel Plastic Egg (food) Sewage treatment HVAC Autonomous building Domestic water system Iron Refrigerator Steel Japanese toilet Foodborne illness Water Bidet Thermal power station Sento Furnace Aluminium Sauna Corrosion Temperature Customs and etiquette of Japan Textile manufacturing Magnesium Aquarium Marine aquarium Water purification Soil pH Water heater Solar system Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Chlorine Fuel cell Tap (valve) Foot odor Home repair Chevrolet Corvair engine Diseases of the honeybee Brazing Dishwasher Tire Bathing Kitchen Sodium hypochlorite Skunk Rail tracks Phosphorus Cathodic protection Happy Tree Friends Hyperthermia Ester Ammonia Salt B-47 Stratojet Spark plug Hydrogen chloride Sonic the Hedgehog Mineral Shark Suicide methods Atomism Gasoline Garlic Dimmer Coffee Energy development Heat Warrant (American band) Naval mine Acetic acid Rei Ayanami Residual-current device Motor oil Dental caries Casting Flue gas desulfurization Nuclear fallout Soldering Fecal incontinence Titanium Alternative biochemistry Energy
