how sturdy are the screened gazebos they sell at domestications or brylane home i have wanted one for awhile but hesitate because i dont want to spend good money on something that wont make it thru the first bad rainstorm any body have one can i put it up by myself and can it be taken down easily at the end of summer for storage diques re domestications gateway gazebo a nice price on sale of nuts and bolt assembly might need hands will need a short ladder probably only need to remove the cloth top for winter as it will not hold much snow you can assume about years service from the top if you take it in for winter see about getting a replacement top at time of initial purchase as the tops seem to get scarce when you need a new one we made wooden platforms upon which to set each corner of the frame and screwed the frame to the platforms then we stacked each each concrete decorative blocks on the platforms to hold the gazebo in place during strong winds neighbors didn't and the gazebos went flying hexagonal screened gazebo for is a flimsy one and not worth the money unless you view it as a put up take down for weekends only it's not wind worthy re brylane home ft screened gazebo for sale nice price but this one would not be easy to secure against wind you notice that each column is narrow and not much of a base to secrue to a platform perhaps so but from the picture given looks iffy my suggestion is go for the domestications gateway gazebo we purchased ours from walmart years ago it is a different unit but does have the four colums each column forms a degree half box with each side we keep it up all year but tucson doesn't get much snow but did get this last winter and the gazebo fabric held it fine have replaced the top once and had a heck of time finding one to fit we have mounted an outdoor cieling fan in the center and that is nice we don't mess with the screens but do get a lot of use out of the solid curtains to shield from sun and strong breezes Screw Textile manufacturing Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Gross domestic product Wrigley Field Seismic retrofit Microeconomics Brewery Glossary of climbing terms Atari 8-bit family Mattress Tire Jennifer Lopez Volleyball Salt Lake City, Utah Poker jargon Billboard Hot 100 Violin Rail terminology Drill bit Rail tracks Casting Geodesic dome Wrench Ford Thunderbird Yohoho!
