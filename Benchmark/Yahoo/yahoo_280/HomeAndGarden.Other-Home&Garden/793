something wrong with my toilet it makes noises what do i do it makes watering noises all day its not when it gets flushed and it refills it fills up and then later on it keeps like filling up with water and makes constant noise what could this be had this problem at college tough to tell you how to fix it 'cause different toilets have slightly different systems long and short of it is that the mechanism that allows the tank to finish re filling is off this is most often a cylindrical almost syringe type thing usually has text printed on the top of it the floating arm thing is deflected back to 'level' enough when things are working smoothly this triggers the cylindrical thing to stop filling water in short pull the floating arm up just a bit and it ought to catch causing the filling to stop it'll probably get messed up again the next time the toilet is flushed problem there essentially is that the buoyant force from the water isn't quite pushing that arm high enough needs like another quarter inch when the tank re fills so the valve lid in the bottom of the tank never closes fully thereby filling the bowl slowly and over time triggering the tank to re fill at more than a drip where you hear it for a short time as it pumps all said there should be a bolt machine screw of some sort usually with a flat head slot that you can use to make minor adjustments if the mechanism isn't spoiled you can use this to change the height at which the floating arm will close the valve lid if it's broken check that the valve lid isn't getting the chain stuck under it if that's the case just need to adjust the chain attached from the handle to the valve lid so it doesn't prop the lid slightly open you can buy the part in a home improvement store dunno its name or how expensive hope this solves your problem good luck Flush toilet Carburetor Siphon Thermal power station Poker jargon Rebreather Japanese toilet Brewery Internal ballistics Bong Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Hydraulic machinery Textile manufacturing Timpani Newcomen steam engine Urinal Glossary of firefighting equipment Paintball marker Diving regulator Programmable logic controller Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Diving cylinder Tire CPU cache M16 (rifle) Floyd Rose Cruising (maritime) Oscilloscope Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Poppet valve Lawn mower Wave power Steam engine Motorcycle Heckler & Koch G3 PID controller Urinary incontinence Conker's Bad Fur Day Rail terminology Bicycle brake systems M60 machine gun Scuba set Hash table Toilet paper Elevator Irrigation Thermostat Revolver Loudspeaker Automatic transmission 2000 Australian Grand Prix CDC 6600 Mattress Seismic retrofit Sin City Jet engine Pump Snorkel Circuit breaker Car handling Mach kernel STS-61 Two-stroke cycle Slot machine Novelty (locomotive) Bubble Bobble Floppy disk Three Mile Island Mouse (computing) Sailing Tank Dialysis Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Fast bowling Filling station Wind turbine Anchor Indianapolis 500 Intravenous therapy Swimming Machine gun Coriolis effect Windows XP Cheating in Counter-Strike Ammunition Swingout Springfield 1903 rifle Inflation
