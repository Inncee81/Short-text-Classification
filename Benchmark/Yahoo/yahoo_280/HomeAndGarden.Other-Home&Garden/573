is it karma that all these over extended consumers are losing their homes people are defaulting like crazy on mortgages my friend at work said this is because banks lent out to poor and lazy people who didn't deserve loans and credit in the first place lazy or not everyone deserves a place to call home that being said i can tell you of the experience in my community lancaster ca we have a large amount of homes being built right now most of them are these huge ostentatious mansions built on a postage stamp's worth size plot of land such as kb homes d r horton etc they are on the desert in prices ranging from to and aren't worth even half of that last year many of the people moving in to these homes were and are black families from compton who come up here because they want to get away from the urban problems the gang trouble the noise etc they all have good honest reasons for coming up here namely that we are in cleaner air a quieter area and hopefully fewer gang problems not to mention more affordable housing well many of these families did not have the income level to support the mortgages they were looking at but thanks to one or two unscrupulous realtors and lenders one of whom was in our office building and would not take you on as a customer unless you were black and was finally taken away in handcuffs due to illegal lending practices were offering sub prime loans to people who couldn't even qualify for them but were cooking the books in these clients' favor namely poor black and latino families from the inner cities of l a in order to get the commission as well as making themselves look good to the black or latino communities it was a case of race based lending targeted at people who simply could not afford the loan but was given the loan based upon falsified income records from the agent the same lender from our building as a result we now have a huge amount of homes that are being foreclosed on some of the owners have tried the last ditch effort of opening the houses for rent in the hopes that someone else with real money like about per month will bail them out as a renter while others have simply abandoned the homes or been evicted now we have these huge price inflated homes that aren't worth half of what the banks are asking and so these whole neighborhoods of empty homes have become huge drug and gang dens the few people who do still live in their homes in these areas are now regularly assaulted and victimized as they try to drive to or from home by the gang kids who've taken over some of the empty houses i don't know if it's karma or not i certainly feel the lender who was arrested got what she deserved but the poor buyers were just trying for to find a home to call their own i am in a similar situation but i'm handling it differently i have a patch of land up in the mountains that i bought at auction i can't afford a mortgage but i think with a little help from my friends that i can build myself a nice cabin to live in stick by stick as i get the money it won't be fancy but it will be mine free and clear hopefully that'll be my karma Predatory lending Real estate broker Deflation (economics) Bank Government National Mortgage Association Monetary policy Inflation Debt Insurance Urban sprawl Interest Bond Usury Student loan Privatization Real estate bubble Money Credit card MMORPG Economy of the United States Financial markets Capitalism Gross domestic product Economy of Russia Microcredit ACORN E-mail spam Advance fee fraud Donald Trump American individualist anarchism Tax Harlem Short selling Title insurance Bank fraud Islamic banking Bretton Woods system Theory of conduct Urban renewal White flight Wells Fargo Real estate Public policy Education in the United States Central bank Philatelic investment Gold standard Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money supply Poker jargon Public housing Sears Holdings Corporation Hyperinflation Mobile home Capital accumulation Primerica Financial Services Internet fraud Government debt Economics Free trade Debt consolidation History of the United States (1918-1945) History of post-Soviet Russia Suburbs of Johannesburg Babylonian law Social rule Windows XP Economy of Pakistan Prostitution in Germany Mortgage-backed security Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Mutual fund Annual percentage rate Federal National Mortgage Association Tesco Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Estoppel Derivative (finance) Concurrent estate Unconscionability Surplus value IBM PC compatible Mergers and acquisitions Annuity Digital rights management EastEnders CPU cache Final Fantasy XI Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Subsidy
