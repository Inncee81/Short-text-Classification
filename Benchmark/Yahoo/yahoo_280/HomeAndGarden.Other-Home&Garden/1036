need some adives this is kind of long so please bare with me my husband and i and my son are currently living with my family we are a young right now so anyways my questions is about something else beside where my parents live there is a small single wide and its not that big but the people that use to live there left it a mess and so my parents asked aroung and they found this guy that will remolded it for he will change all the floors and walls the windows and doors and the kitchen sink and the bathroom tube and the paint it from the outside and inside okay now there is a single wide for sale and we can put that one there instead of fising up the old house but the thing is that i think its way cheaper to just fix that one becuase the other one is and down payment to move it and pluse finance it will prbably go up to and plus any inspection that it has to go through and the monthly payments of for about years thats just to much for me what should i do so my husband says he is willing to that but i feel that its just way cheaper to fix that we wont have to pay rent and the only thing we have to do is get electricity and move in as soon as its ready and for me that is way easier and faster the sooner the better cause i really want to get out of my parents house but he insists that its better that way any suggestions about this does your husband realize that after the guy remodels the single wide it will be like it's almost new i'm guessing your parents own the single wide so you wouldn't have to pay anything extra for it if the single wides are close to the same size based only on the financial aspect i would say go for remodeling the older one like i said that's based only on the money part since i haven't seen either one maybe you should call a bank and find out how much the financing would be it might help convince your husband to take the other place when you add in the interest you'll be paying a lot more than for the one Mortgage Friends Sento Annuity Knots Landing Jumpstart 3rd Grade Time Out of Mind Freeters Poker jargon 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Bond Gross domestic product Surplus value Student loan Deflation (economics) Gold standard Microeconomics Babylonian law Humphrey Bogart Keynesian economics White House McMansion Mutual fund Jam (TV series) About a Boy Interest Blood on the Tracks Divorce Futurama (TV series - season 4) Chatsworth House Harry Nilsson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Electrophysiology Debt Avenue Q Blonde on Blonde Capital accumulation Euro Schabir Shaik Trial Unreformed House of Commons Theory of conduct Leasing EastEnders Toilet Ashton-Tate Insurance Citigroup The Shining (film) Monetary policy Quake III Arena Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) The Inside Economy of Russia Personal finance National Kidney Foundation Singapore Fancy Crane Solar power Plame affair Money Internet fraud Primerica Financial Services Haibane Renmei The Emancipation of Mimi CPU cache Make money fast Copyleft Milton H.
