how do i remove tadpoles i have at least three puddles in my backyard and there are easily more than tadpoles in each of the puddles how do i remove them edit i don't wanna kill them necessarily but i do want to say i hated their parents they kept me up all night atleast twenty of them outside of my window at night making their noises lol what are the statistics on tadpoles if only survive out of each puddle then that's ok but i can't have frogs jumping around being weird in my back yard i have a huge dog in my back yard and i dont want him coming back in the house with pieces of frog limbs hanging out his mouth i beg you not to kill them as these are baby frogs duh that will live to eat hundreds and hundreds of thousands if not millions and billions of mosquitos and other bothersome insects a couple things will occur either the frogs know what they're doing and the tadpoles will mature in their own good time before the puddles dry up and just jump out of the puddles and leave when they're ready or in their frenzy to mate the adult frogs didn't really know what they were doing and chose puddles that would dry up before the tadpoles were mature enough to leave of their own accord you don't say why you want to move them but if this is imperative get a bucket and a net fill the bucket with the exact same water that is in the puddles not tap water or water that comes out of your hose catch the tadpoles with the net and move them to the nearest swamp or pond stream if you can't find a swamp or pond please please above all show some respect for nature and for the fact that these little guys are just trying to survive just like you or me and do not try to kill them or to just add bleach to their water in the environment the presence of frogs and amphibians shows that the soil and water are in great shape fertile non toxic full of prey lush and green frogs and toads are one of the first species to disappear and to show genetic mutation when the environment becomes too toxic and unable to sustain life so be greatful they are there it is a really really good sign those little guys represent the best solution to the mosquito problem in its infancy they will grow to become mosquito eating machines i also think the sound of their mating calls at night is one of the best sounds in nature it means your land and the land around you is teeming with life and fertility i have a hard time with idiots who would say something so incredibly stupid life hating and disrespectful to say nothing of bloody ignorant as just add bleach to the puddle i look forward to a time when people this ignorant and evil cease to exist on this planet for they are what is killing what was once a paradise Mosquito Nile crocodile Bladderwort Amphibian Spider Toad Gray Wolf Fauna of Australia Ecology Kakapo Abortion debate Tetrapod Malaria Wood Hamster Bullfrog Carnivorous plant DDT Biological pest control Irrigation Flood geology Xenomorph Cat Animal Biodiversity Shrimp farm Ren and Stimpy Menstrual cycle RuneScape quests Decline in frog populations Ant Deluge (mythology) Cheetah Human Snake Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Corroboree frog Dilbert Desert Creatures in Bionicle Tenjiku shogi Shogi Renewable energy Lion Goldfish Unreal Ammonia Animal communication Aerial (dance move) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Mario series enemies Kim Possible Piccolo Junior Saga Angling Dog Effects of global warming Final Fantasy: Unlimited Intelligent design Volleyball Jurassic Park Elephant Androgen insensitivity syndrome Shaggy dog story Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Heartworm Dead Sea Seabird Kain (Legacy of Kain) Organic farming Fishing Fish farming Futurama (TV series - season 5) Rice Koala Rocko's Modern Life Alcohol fuel Tooth enamel Tai shogi Bloody Roar IBM PC compatible Chlorophyta Equine conformation The Fairly OddParents Lake Infantilism Carbon dioxide American Alligator The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Dalek Invasion of Earth
