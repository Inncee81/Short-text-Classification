how do african violets need to be watered they do not like water on their leaves i have always been told to have a saucer under their pot the pot has to have holes in it and water in the saucer the dirt and roots will soak it up from there as far as fertilizer they say to water weakly weekly which means a weak solution of fertilizer and there are specific african violet mixtures every week instead of a big dose of fertilizer every month or so if the fertilizer mix is too strong and it is used too often you will have fertilizer burn and the violet will turn brown and whither if you are fertilizing and that happens the rhyme goes like this the solution to the pollution is dilution flush water through the pot or times the amount that you would normally water with and discard that water when watering like this water from the top of the pot just trying to water under the leaves on to the soil if the fertilizer burn seems really bad you could discard the old potting soil and very very gently rinse the roots dunk roots in a bowl of water briefly and re pot in new dirt this will most likely shock your violet and it may continue to look sickly a while longer but may save it in the long run Houseplant Coffee Poker jargon Tobacco Hippeastrum Draw poker Textile manufacturing Comfrey Ammonia Sewage treatment Bonsai Soil Teapot Irrigation Sugar beet Sulfuric acid Weed control Betting (poker) Soil pH Garden Strawberry Fujian tea ceremony Bread Carnivorous plant Japanese tea ceremony Phosphorus Bong Haggis Fertilizer Jute Snooker Staining (biology) Cannabis cultivation Gram staining Basil Fire fighting Nuclear fallout Dishwashing Phosphate Illegal drug trade Pysanka Gypsy moth Concentration Sodium hypochlorite Community card poker Seabird Poker Laundry detergent Acorn Tofu Lawn Body piercing Halitosis Ultraviolet Alcohol fuel Venus Flytrap Hangi Potassium Texas hold 'em Waste management Pottery Opportunity rover Carburetor Deluge (mythology) Seismic retrofit Melting pot Idli Rebreather PH The Incredibles Town gas Omaha hold 'em Cuisine of Brazil Fire extinguisher Brewery Hydrogen peroxide Yerba mate Ocean thermal energy conversion Uranium Fast bowling Tillandsia The Weakest Link Biodynamic agriculture Cannabis (drug) Environmental concerns with electricity generation Nile Marathon (sport) White phosphorus incendiary Cheating in poker Carbon dioxide Menstrual cup Pansy Derbyshire lead mining history Cyanide Five-card draw Essential oil Earthworm Ethanol
