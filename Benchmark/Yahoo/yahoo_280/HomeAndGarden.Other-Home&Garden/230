people rave about light bulbs that use less electricity like they are so great well i think they suck really of course they use less electricity they only give off about volts worth of light this is just enough that i still have to feel for the walls to not bang into them i might as well be in the dark why do people like these bulbs so much yes good comment about they color they cast it seems to color everything with a blue tone i use them in areas that don't require good bright light i do like the fact that they last so much longer though i have one on my porch that is turned on from dusk to dawn every night and i haven't had to change it in to years when i used standard bulbs i was changing them every three months Lighting Light-emitting diode Fluorescent lamp Headlight Street light Stage lighting Compact fluorescent lamp Bicycle lighting Traffic light Christmas lights Color Liquid crystal display Color temperature Time Out of Mind George Westinghouse Strap-on dildo Diode Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Security lighting Aurora (astronomy) Items in the Metroid series Christmas tree Eye color X10 (industry standard) Mercury-vapor lamp Thomas Edison Collectibles in Bionicle Bus models used in New York City Transit Neon lamp Houseplant Resistor Photometry (optics) Automotive lighting Piano White Human skin color Light pollution Lightning Rave party Morse Code Glass R-Type Three-phase electric power Sega Saturn Dark matter Big Bang Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Railway signal Rave Master Black body Light Battery (electricity) Circuit design Electricity Harp Neutrino Mnemonic Quantum dot Van Morrison Electric light GunBound Daylight saving time Color space DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Volt Polarization Out-of-body experience Rotor machine Electrophysiology Cathode ray tube Wrigley Field Scientology beliefs and practices Haarlem School bus Dark energy The White Stripes DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Camouflage USS Twining (DD-540) Stereoscopy Sally Ann Howes Static Shock Gamut Joseph Swan Switch Jon Secada CIE 1931 color space Electrical element Care Bears Sensation Sento Cube (film) Fan (implement) Major League Baseball television contracts Yu-Gi-Oh!
