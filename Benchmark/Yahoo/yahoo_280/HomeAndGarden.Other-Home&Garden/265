i need to cut back rose bushes best time of year my roses are over ft high need to cut back also would like to make new bushes from cuttings any help from knowledge or a website appreciated best time is when they are dormant in winter however i have done some trimming and transplanting of roses at other times of the year even in the middle of summer and found my roses to be quite hardy and forgiving most roses are grown from cuttings grafted onto a hardy rootstock so cuttings you root at home may grow but will probably not thrive as they won't have the resistance to disease and tolerance to different soils and climates Fruit tree propagation Grafting Apple Phylloxera Citrus Weed control Agriculture Bone marrow transplant Cereal Wars of the Roses Malus Wisteria Oat Gooseberry Apricot Eucalyptus Pasadena, California Olive Organ transplant Alfalfa Stem cell Climate of the Alps Wheat Pruning fruit trees Morello Cherry Comfrey Sugar beet Tobacco Economy of Africa Guns N' Roses Perennial plant Tournament of Roses Parade Bamboo Prosopis cineraria Serviceberry Wood K__ppen climate classification Elis Prefecture Garden Strawberry Apical dominance English longbow Haircut Middle Ages Broom (shrub) Sagebrush Global warming and agriculture Southern United States Vegetative reproduction Tillandsia Black pepper Geography of Bulgaria Compost Carnivorous plant Kudzu Araucaria araucana Bonsai Pachypodium habitats Sorghum Portland, Oregon Cardiothoracic surgery Pereskia Cistaceae Tasmanian Tree Fern Leaf Pubic hair Music history of the United States (1980s to the present) Vegetation Cytomegalovirus Florida Keys Chanakya Potato Arizona Jharkhand Geography of China Silver Maple Alberta Salt Lake City, Utah Grand Teton National Park Sheryl Crow Rabies Stop and Smell the Roses Wandering Jew (plant) Pensacola, Florida Ficus elastica Geography of Turkey Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Desertification A-ha Surtsey Transplant rejection Coast Douglas-fir Skin graft Budding Soil life European Black Pine Longleaf Pine Circumcision Laurel and Hardy Brooklyn Botanic Garden
