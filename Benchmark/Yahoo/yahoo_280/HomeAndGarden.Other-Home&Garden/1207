what happens when someone is using your po box and phone number i thought it strange to sometimes be getting the same woman's bills mail recently a debt company called looking for her as well why am i getting her messages and mail what should i do first check your credit make sure it's only your phone number and po box make sure no credit cards show up that you do not have no lines of credit that are not actually yours this person clearly has your address and phone number that's too close for comfort make sure this is not blossoming into identity theft then put a fraud alert on your credit that will make it so you'll be contacted in the event that anyone tries to open any accounts set up any credit in your name talk with the post office and tell them that you are getting mail to a person who is not known to you tell them you are getting and explain you suspect fraud they should have you complete forms to show what name s are on the mail that is not yours ask them to let you change your po box number free of charge call the phone company and talk with them about the situation consider changing phone numbers and getting an unpublished number that is unlisted not in the phone book and cannot be gotten by calling information in case you discover this is identity theft http www ssa gov oig hotline index htm idtheft
