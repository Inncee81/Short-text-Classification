trapping bugs my brother is doing a project and he has to catch bugs hes caught an ant moth beetle grasshopper mosquito and a horsefly and he need around more where could he look to get some or how to catch some besides looking outside that is any help would be nice get a butterfly net or some sort of light weight jar or box that has a separate lid wait until night and turn on the outside light stand away from the house and wait and low and behold the light area will fill up with bugs you can catch them all buy being quick with the jar and lid or taking a quick sweep with the net and taking it directly to the house side to keep the bug in it until you can put them in a jar another way to catch crawling bugs is to use a pure while cloth like a hankerchief it must be white because for some reason the bugs are attracted to that bright color place it in the garden or in the low cut grass where you know you have seen bugs in the daytime and shine a flash light right onto the cloth sometimes you have to wait quite some time but bugs will crawl onto the cloth another way to catch bugs that like moisture is to wet the mulsh or grass and put a good sized board or rock onto it do that in the evening and in the morning when it is light out quickly turn the rock or board over and you can find rolly poly's and centipedes and eerwicks under the rocks also in the heat of the day you can find japanese beetles all over the sides of light colored houses on the side where the sun is on the house usually between and pm and if you dig in any mulch around a garden or decoration around a house you will find a good amount of just any kind of bug Ant Bee Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Africanized bee Apocrita Chicken Piccolo Junior Saga Rainbow Bee-eater Carpenter bee Honeybee Wasp Conker's Bad Fur Day The Subtle Knife Hornet Tag Bumblebee Beehive (beekeeping) Termite Spider Mario Basic English Volucella pellucens House Sparrow RuneScape quests Hamster Pesticide toxicity to bees The Amber Spyglass Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Hun-Apu Red imported fire ant Timon and Pumbaa Night (book) Static Shock Diseases of the honeybee Insect The Time Machine Sleeping Murder Kain (Legacy of Kain) The Inside Supercedure American Alligator AFI 100 Years series Drill bit Tarantula hawk Housefly Joker (comics) Chalkboard Chalk Animal communication Tokusatsu Tarantula Poker jargon Yellow Xenomorph Eisner Award Jak II Battlefield (Doctor Who) Biological pest control Yellowjacket Russian joke Ninja Scroll Neoptera Second Battle of El Alamein Digger wasp Hymenoptera Flower-fly -phobia Cigarette Smoking Man Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Agatha Christie The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Professional wrestling throws Charles Peace Nest box Transformers: Cybertron Common Wasp Swamp Thing The Legend of Zelda series enemies Cretaceous European Kingfisher Dave Lister German Wasp Drawn Together 10 Things I Hate About You Buckingham Palace Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Avengers Disassembled Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Climbing equipment My Life as a Teenage Robot The Chemical Brothers USS Wasp (CV-18) Kakapo Homer Simpson Pica (disorder) Adam and Eve P-47 Thunderbolt Ecology ChalkZone Fable (video game)
