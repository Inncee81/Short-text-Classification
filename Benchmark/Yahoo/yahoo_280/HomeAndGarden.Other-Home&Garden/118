how do you unlatch the latches keeping the cover on a calspa spa i know this sounds like a really dumb question i got a used spa excellent barely used condition from a garage sale and cannot figure out how to unlatch the plastic latches holding the spa cover down they seem like they should just squeeze and unlatch but they won't i've tried looking for instruction manuals showing how to unlatch the cover but no luck if anyone can tell me how to unhook the latches or can find an operating manual for a balboa fiesta calspa i qould be very appreciative thanks thanks jim there just so happened to be a little black plastic key in the bag of miscellaneous parts the cover latch came off with no problems yay now all i need is an operating manual found online somewhere some latches lock and you need a key to open them great for keeping the kids out the spa you may need to lube them with some soapy water or just cut them off STS-61 M60 machine gun Breastfeeding Owen Hart Bong Knife Manual transmission Golf Floppy disk Glossary of firefighting equipment Elevator Mercury 4 Climbing equipment Aerial refueling Menstrual cup Atari 8-bit family Turkish Airlines Flight 981 M/S Estonia IBook Residual-current device Carburetor Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) Relay STS-62 Revolver Security through obscurity The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Manhunt (video game) Ford Fiesta Strap-on dildo Short selling Diving regulator Apollo Command/Service Module E85 Professional wrestling holds History of the Panama Canal Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Plastic The Contender (television series) Bulk vending American Black Bear Leamington Spa Tick Public-key cryptography M16 (rifle) Xanadu House Monopoly (game) Jeopardy!
