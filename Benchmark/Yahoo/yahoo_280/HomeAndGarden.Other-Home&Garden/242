if a house is painted white will this make it colder if the white paint reflects the sunlight does this also mean it will reflect the cold if one house were painted black and another white would the black one be more energy efficient i fully understand that insullation is the most important way of making a house energy efficient also realise white will keep it cool in summer just interested to know what the implications are no matter how small hadn't considered the radiant effect of this thoughts in summer it would reflect heat making it cooler inside you wouldn't need to use an air conditioning system all the time this is why most houses are white in mediterranean countries in winter it would lose less heat black bodies radiate more heat than white bodies and so you wouldn't have to have the heating on all the time white paint also has a higher albedo factor i e the amount of sun light that it reflects back into space this is how the ice caps contribute to maintaining the temperature of the earth painting a house white is just one of the many things you can do to make it more energy efficient Solar power Albedo Temperature Climate change Autonomous building Sun Solar variation Sunlight Heat Ozone depletion Air conditioning Renewable energy Water Ozone hole Urban heat island Cloud Planetary habitability Spacecraft propulsion Furnace Ice Water vapor Ice age Greenhouse effect Passive solar Thermoregulation Energy development Future energy development Terraforming Lighting Sea ice Vacuum Black body HVAC Stirling engine Spark plug Energy Global climate model Climate of the United Kingdom Stellar evolution Jet engine Color Black hole Peltier-Seebeck effect Deep lake water cooling Solar cell Transformer Global warming Thermodynamics Carbon dioxide Glass Phase (matter) Radiant energy Welding Laser Solar radiation Nuclear weapon design Nuclear power Global dimming Internal combustion engine Little Ice Age Colonization of the Moon Exergy Motor oil Swimming Insulation Warm-blooded Temperature inversion Entropy Big Bang Ionosphere Turbocharger Brewery Season Explosive material Hydrogen economy Timeline of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and random processes Planetary nebula COBE Hyperthermia Atmospheric reentry Lake Timeline of the Universe Ocean thermal energy conversion Hydropower Lightning Space manufacturing Fire Thermal energy Weather lore Pebble bed reactor Mercury (planet) Radioisotope thermoelectric generator
