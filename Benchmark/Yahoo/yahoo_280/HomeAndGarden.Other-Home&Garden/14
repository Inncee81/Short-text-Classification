how can i make wasps go away i live in northern california and i've noticed a lot of wasps or yellowjackets what's the difference hovering over my lawn and around my trees and plants my lawn is cut relatively short and i keep my garbage covered so these things do not seem to be causing the attraction furthermore it seems several other people in my community are having the same problem the wasps seem to be out in full force this year i know most people will say that wasps are docile unless provoked however it is nearly impossible not to provoke something that is on your lawn and so close to your back door also i'm afraid my dogs will get stung and i know that at least one of my dogs is deathly allergic to bee stings what attracts these creatures to my yard what would be unappealing to them how does watering my lawn come into play most importantly how can i make them go away or at least decrease in numbers there isn't a lot that can be done i've noticed that the wasps in my yard seem to be attracted to moisture on the grass the plants they also like hanging around aging wood probably looking for hive material this summer when wasp season hit we bought half a dozen wasp traps and placed them away from the back door and in locations where they seemed to congregate these wasp traps use concentrated apple cider as bait and cost around we noticed our numbers dropping off significantly within weeks wasp traps can be purchased at garden centers and hardware stores Honeybee Africanized bee Wasp Tarantula Beehive (beekeeping) Conker's Bad Fur Day Deforestation Xenomorph Biological pest control USS Wasp (CV-18) Apple Bong Gypsy moth Yellowjacket USS Wasp (CV-7) Allergy Bee Honey Diseases of the honeybee Hamster USS Anderson (DD-411) Carnivorous plant Mattress Unreal WASP Iditarod Plant Swimming Scorpion USS Washington (BB-56) Animal communication ITunes Music Store Paper wasp Hard disk USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Sears Holdings Corporation Japanese tea ceremony Irrigation Solar power Hay fever Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Elis Prefecture Mosquito Wood Computer virus RuneScape quests Insulin Venom (poison) Zerg Trapping Billboard Hot 100 Bee learning and communication Golf Dairy Red imported fire ant Tom Goes to the Mayor Glossary of American football Cider Carbon dioxide Yosemite National Park Fruit tree propagation Bumblebee Carpenter bee USS Trigger (SS-237) Spider Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Desertification Professional wrestling holds Avengers (comics) Animal Crossing Ecco the Dolphin Alcoholic beverage Half-Life Vegetation Weebl and Bob Battle of Leyte Gulf Microeconomics The Caves of Androzani Alberta Happy Tree Friends Moss Lechaina Tidal power Insect Autonomous building Langstroth hive Sento Apocrita Diving suit Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban McMansion Ultimate (sport) Beer Textile manufacturing Floppy disk
