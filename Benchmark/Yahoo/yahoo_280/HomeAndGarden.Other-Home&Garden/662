new construction home completed this week what should i look for my wife and i have to sign off on our new home built by pulte this week is there anything specific we should look for before we sign off i have already noticed when i went in the house myself that some of the kitchen cabinet drawers arent pulling out smooth is this something to have them fix or am i just being picky you will want to open all windows and doors in order to make sure they all open and close smoothly also walk around the entire outside checking the foundation and walls for any cracks or areas that are not level check all of the corners inside the house and everywhere the walls meet the floor and ceiling to make sure they are level and straight you should use a level when you do this in my opinion check all of your moldings around the doorways and baseboards to make sure they are level check around doors and windows to make sure they seal completely with no gaps anywhere you should also check every outlet i could go on and on but i would probably forget something the best thing to do is hire an independent inspector who has nothing to do with pulte homes and have them evaluate everything frequently home building companies the size of pulte and many others build homes fairly quickly and skimp on various things due to their speed and costs it is very wise and well worth the cost for you to get an inspection i realize that many of these companies will bring out an inspector for you but they have personal interests with these companies and will not work for you in order to get the honest information that you need before you sign off on your home you should hire an independent licensed home inspector and follow him her around while doing the inspection they should explain every detail to you so that you know what you are getting in to and if there are any issues they can give you advice about them then pulte homes should be required to repair any problems if there is anything major going on you are not required to settle for the home you will be able to get out of the deal and wouldn't you rather find out about potential problems before you sign off rather than after you're stuck with the home get a home inspection its the wisest choice that you can make about your home before you sign off on it Kitchen Poker jargon Thermal power station Scientology beliefs and practices Door Shaggy dog story Nuclear power Elevator Pretty Good Privacy Plame affair Information Technology Infrastructure Library STS-114 Seismic retrofit Passenger car Doom engine Coming of Age (TNG episode) Mozilla Firefox Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Quality control Xanadu House Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Mach kernel GunZ The Duel The Inside Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq John Hancock Tower Sento Basement Natural Selection (computer game) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Drill bit McMansion Casting G-Man (Half-Life) Downing Street memo The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Nuclear proliferation Fire fighting Corporate governance 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Wood Abbey Black Mesa Research Facility Glossary of firefighting terms The Shining (film) About a Boy Hamster Principal-agent problem Sudoku One Tree Hill (TV series) RuneScape quests The Time Machine Public domain Wood carving Windows XP Jumpstart 3rd Grade Dial M for Murder Bus models used in New York City Transit Advance fee fraud ISO 9000 Heinkel He 112 U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Air-raid shelter Expert system Public-key cryptography Betting (poker) Game programming House of Leaves Columbine High School massacre Ridge Route Combine (Half-Life 2) De Lorean DMC-12 Heinkel He 100 Chatsworth House Gun politics Motion picture rating system Common criticisms of Microsoft The Amber Spyglass The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Buckingham Palace Inflation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Theory of conduct Strategic management Let's Make a Deal Information Services Procurement Library Microeconomics New York Giants
