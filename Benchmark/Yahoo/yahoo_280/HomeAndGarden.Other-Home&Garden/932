need some advice on planting grass seed i'm doing our backyard from scratch the area that i will seed is approximately square feet with rock and other future plant sites located around the yard has tons of weeds since we moved into the house last year and i was waiting for a year to get a lot of the settling out of the way etc what's the best way to attack this i've been constanly mowing the weeds to keep them short and manageable should i rototill and get rid of them that way someone also suggested using roundup or something like that but i have fears that it would affect the seed also i will need to bring in some good top soil how much is standard how many inches then i'm guessing i should just seed it fertilize it press it down and keep it moist any suggestions would be great obviously i'm looking for the best results without having to pull my hair out thanks i agree with bruce j use something that kills weeds but has a short activity life roundup has that then the topsoil then seed one added idea wait until september to seed the reason is the weather will cool down and you'll get more rain you won't have to water as much and the new grass won't fry in the heat the grass seed will still germinate and grow and there will be plenty of time for it to become established before frost and you'll be sure that the weed killer is inactive when you seed use a fertilizer specially made for seed starting it will have no weed killers in it you might want to pick that up now as they'll have all the fall fertilizers out later on i have even seeded in early winter just before the first forecast heavy snow the grass seed sits there over the winter the snow's action pushes it into the earth it comes up first thing in the spring when it's too damp still for me to even consider walking over the lawn to seed very easy Weed control Weed Herbicide Tobacco Lawn Sorghum Rice Severe weather terminology (United States) Hemp Anchor Compost Carnivorous plant Roundup Lawn mower Seed Climate of the United Kingdom Biodynamic agriculture Weather lore Rapeseed 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Desert Yosemite National Park Sugar beet Apple Maize Oat Jute Mulch Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Winter Agriculture Soil Stratification (botany) Fire fighting Desertification Potato Tick Alfalfa Flax Neolithic Revolution Wheat Houseplant Sub-Zero Textile manufacturing Barley Global warming and agriculture Avalanche Tillage Comfrey Flowering plant Green Revolution Acorn San Pedro cactus Flood geology Fruit tree propagation Fast bowling Garden Strawberry Moss Elis Prefecture Percy Schmeiser Gypsy moth Climate of Salt Lake City Opportunity rover Skiing Puberty Bread Sewage treatment Naruto geography Geography of Brazil Pollination Vermicompost Bamboo Water (molecule) Combine harvester Creeping Charlie Zion National Park Effects of global warming John McDouall Stuart 2005 Atlantic hurricane season M16 (rifle) Cannabis (drug) Renewable energy Norman Borlaug Agricultural machinery Botany Wildfire Hamster Chatsworth House Organic food Disaster Wetland The Championships, Wimbledon Cuscuta Pok__mon Abilities
