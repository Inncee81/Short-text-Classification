what makes cold water come out of the tap i'm fairly certain that the hot water that comes out of the tap shower other plumbing is heated through gas but what causes the water to come out cold how is the water cooled before it comes out of the tap wouldn't the temperature of the water lines depend on the season like they'd be hotter in summer and colder in winter how is that maintained at a constant temperature then good question ours comes out warm i mean really warm we don't even have to turn on the hot water for a shower this is because our water lines in the neighborhood are not dug deep enough we live in nc and this is an older neighborhood apparently they are not dug deep because way back when it really never stayed below degrees in this area for a long period of time up north they are dug deeper to prevent pipe bursts it depends on how deep the lines are and how old the neighborhood is newer developments are dug deeper the deeper it is dug the cooler the ground is Climate of the United Kingdom Severe weather terminology (United States) Water Thermoregulation Hydropower Customs and etiquette of Japan Swimming pool Brewery Solar power Ocean thermal energy conversion Welding Water (molecule) Renewable energy Heat Thermostat Deep lake water cooling Air conditioning Spark plug Warm-blooded Domestic water system Tap (valve) Lake Urban heat island Plumbing fixture Hyperthermia Peltier-Seebeck effect Sauna Refrigerator K__ppen climate classification Furnace E85 Hot air balloon Ozone depletion Motor oil Swimming Little Ice Age Geyser Ironing Power station Carburetor Energy development Cruising (maritime) El Ni__o Weather front Astronomy on Mars Ozone hole Passive solar Bong Geography of Japan Soldering HVAC Hiking Convection Sun Climate of India Weather lore Water vapor Miami, Florida Atmospheric circulation Sento Season Fog Basement Volcano Global warming Jet engine Opportunity rover Nuclear reactor Bird migration Eocene Ice Sea ice Climate of Salt Lake City Siphon Pliocene Ice core Nuclear power Climate change Vacuum Anchor Frost Space shuttle main engine Greenhouse effect Wind power Central heating Diesel engine Geography of Bolivia Hot spring Comet 1969 Atlantic hurricane season Albedo Capercaillie Geography of Spain Solar variation Temperature inversion Thermal power station
