bumblebee nest we didn't know we had one in our yard until my husband dumped some dirt in a low spot suddenly we have a bunch of angry bumbles circling around the dirt mound and they don't look happy that's just an assumption since i can't see if they are smiling or frowning we would never have deliberately harmed or blocked their home but how can i tell that to a bee is there anything we can do now or will they dig it out themselves and can we ever use that part of our yard again bumbles make small nests compared to other types of bees i've had them in a hollow next to the driveway in the ground under a shrub and in the middle of the garden where a tree had been removed and a hollow left from the roots being taken out a typical backyard colony might have around fifty individuals without the working bumbles to feed her the queen is most likely dead already just leave it alone the workers who came to the nest's defense with no where to go now will likely die off as well it's sad because bumbles are in short supply in a lot of places but you didn't know they had a nest there so don't feel too bad they only use the next one season in most area of the us with no queens to hatch from that nest this year you may not have to deal with any next year Bumblebee Bee Ant Beehive (beekeeping) Poker jargon Zerg Honeybee Termite Pollinator decline Kakapo Carpenter bee Volleyball Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Red imported fire ant Viva La Bam Rigging Hornet EastEnders Dodge Charger Platypus Honeybee life cycle Gypsy moth McMansion Satchel Paige Super Bowl XVII The Death Gate Cycle K' Diseases of the honeybee Seabird New York Giants Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Thermal power station Theory of conduct Invasion of the Waikato Easement Burial Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling slang Casting Numbat Africanized bee Microeconomics Paper wasp Bamboo Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory The Brady Bunch Queen bee Old growth forest Dead Like Me Chicken Knife Terran (StarCraft) Marilyn Monroe Camp (style) Quicksort Glossary of American football Japanese tea ceremony GunBound The Dukes of Hazzard Air-raid shelter SimAnt Worker bee Wood Pollination management Swarming (honeybee) Textile manufacturing Pittsburgh Steelers Chicago White Sox Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rachel Corrie Orchidaceae Pitaten Apple Grafting Capercaillie Field hockey Brood (honeybee) Armored Core Tick Conker's Bad Fur Day The Smoking Room Biological pest control Spotted Nutcracker National Football League Lore Megachilidae Time Out of Mind Ultimate (sport) The Amber Spyglass Super Bowl IX Carburetor Common Wasp Pollination Tobacco One Tree Hill (TV series) Atlanta Braves Bee learning and communication RuneScape quests Christiansborg Palace Compiler optimization
