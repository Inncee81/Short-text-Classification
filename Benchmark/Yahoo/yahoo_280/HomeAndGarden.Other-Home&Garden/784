is there such a thing as a sheet that zips on the bed my sheet comes off the bed every freaking day just from turning over or the slightest move and it drives me nuts i am wondering if anyone has any idea if they make a sheet that covers the entire matress and zips on so that it can't come off thanks thanks you can get cloth mattress covers they're pretty much a sheet with a zipper you can also try those elastic things that clamp onto the sheet corners they work pretty well you can get a set at wal mart usually in the section with the pillows Mattress Zipper Pillow Sudden infant death syndrome Lathe Bed (furniture) Screw Seismic retrofit Floppy disk Strap-on dildo Bookbinding Plastic Upholstery Microeconomics Blankets (graphic novel) Genericized trademark About a Boy Futon International response to Hurricane Katrina Mars Exploration Rover The Shining (film) Coir Billiards Andes Brewery Ice sheet Casualty lifting Glossary of climbing terms Milton H.
