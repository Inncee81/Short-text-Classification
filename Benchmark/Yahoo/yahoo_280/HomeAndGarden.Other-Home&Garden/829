a skunk in my house we sleep with all the windows in the house open and fans in the windows to cool the house down at night then in the morning we shut the house down to keep out the heat in the day no ac last night we could smell skunk really strong i was hoping a skunk didnt come in the doggie door or my dogs or cats didnt go out the doggie door and get sprayed and then come back in turned out my pets were fine but this morning the smell is strong through the whole house any ideas how to get it out i sprayed febreeze all over the house several times the smell wont go away also any ideas why it would smell so strong in here still can they get under your house and have babies or something would it smell this bad if it sprayed in my back yard and the fans sucked the scent in here are you serious vengence thats crazy so it's possible that skunk wasnt even near my house i should ask my neighbors if their houses stink now too lol a skunk can spray ft m but the smell travels unaided for miles you should check under the home and seal it off close off the doggie door at night and other than that you pretty much just have to give it time to dispurse Skunk Pet skunk Spotted Skunk Snoop Dogg Fire fighting Pep__ Le Pew Dog Sleeping with the Enemy (Simpsons episode) Thermal power station AFI 100 Years series Sulfur Smells Like Teen Spirit Daz Dillinger The Shining (film) Phoebe Buffay's songs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Happy Tree Friends Dean Koontz Joke Sin City Toilet humour Rabies The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear W.I.T.C.H.
