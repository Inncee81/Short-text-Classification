bugs on my house vine we have a large leafy vine growing on our house we just moved here in june and recently it has been overcome by these tiny little flying bugs which seem to pretty much keep to the vine i was out trimming it today because it grows like crazy and you could literally turn over one leaf and see about of them when you shook the vine it looked like it was snowing and sounded like it was raining the are very small and whitish with a bit of a tri daimond design on their back the smaller of them they are all very small are so tiny they just look white i checked out other vine on our garage and there was none on that one they sort of resemble a grasshopper in shape but are not because i looked them up lol anyway what are they and should i leave them alone or try to get rid of them if so how we don't like insecticides or pesticides as they aren't safe for our kids or good for the environment you might try blasting them with the water hose to help get rid of them it might need to be done several times for several days i watch paul james on tv the gardener guy and that is how he kills aphids that gets on his plants Biological pest control Carnivorous plant Naruto jutsu Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vine Insect Aphid Insecticide Humphrey Bogart Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) Treehouse of Horror V Pesticide DDT Codename: Kids Next Door Hamster Organic farming Beetle Mosquito Electrophysiology A Bug's Life Toxicodendron Irrigation Tomato Characters of Naruto Poker jargon RuneScape quests Pollinator decline Piccolo Junior Saga Bonsai Coffee Theory of conduct Hemiptera King Khalid International Airport Snake Sacrifice (computer game) RuneScape cheats Phylloxera Bugs Bunny Quarashi Jumpstart 3rd Grade Disney's California Adventure Pesticide toxicity to bees Wood carving AFI 100 Years series Sin City Shaggy dog story Malaria Spacecraft propulsion American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) The Shining (film) Russian joke Organic food Illegal drug trade Tobacco The Offspring Land mine Richard Rahl Radar Pea Pumpkin Xenomorph Ant Mickey Mouse Dinosaurs (TV series) USS S-32 (SS-137) Team Fortress Classic USS Trigger (SS-237) Paragliding Honeybee Agriculture in Hong Kong A-ha Overpopulation Tiny Toon Adventures Geography of Brazil The Catcher in the Rye Conspiracy (TNG episode) Olive The Amber Spyglass Futari wa Pretty Cure Poison Ivy (comics) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Waylon Jennings Whitewater Cliff Richard Missingno.
