fly problem answer there are a whole bunch of flies in my basement that just came out of nowwhere and no matter how many i kill theres always more where are they coming from and how do i get rid of them thankss the flies must have laid eggs for there to be so many ok i had kind of the same problem before except it was in my backyard you should go to your nearest lowe's or home depot and get a flycatcher the one i got is a bag and it has very little smell but when the flies fly inside they are stuck and they can't get out so then they die this works very well and my fly problem is gone and also this bag can last for years i've had it for about and it's still working fine good luck Tofu Theory of conduct Air-raid shelter Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Brady Bunch Luck 2000 Australian Grand Prix Three Stooges Gaia Online Kakapo Heinkel He 100 Emergency preparedness Mercury Atlas 6 Shit Egg (food) Bubble Bobble Grumpy's Three Wishes Piccolo Junior Saga Flying wing RuneScape locations W.I.T.C.H.
