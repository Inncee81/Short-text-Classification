why are co op boards so strict probably because of the method of owning an apartment in a co op unlike owning a house or a condominium when you buy a co op you aren't buying an apartment per se but buying shares in the building which is owned cooperatively by all the residents you're really part of a corporation the board operates in the same way as the board of directors of any corporation with the powers to make rules regulations as well as direct the daily operations of the business in a co op building this means they have the power to screen prospective buyers of apartments primarily to assure that they have the financial ability to pay over the term of their agreement but also to make sure that the prospective buyers will fit in with the general ambiance and standards of that particular building this can mean to put it crudely keeping out the riff raff which in many co ops in nyc means rock musicians entertainment personalities other kinds of people who the board feels would be unstable residents and sometimes also means excluding people simply based on the prejudices of the other residents of the building the board is also empowered to regulate the lives of the residents to whatever degree is stated in the by laws of the building this can mean rules about pets items that can or cannot be left in common hallways signs or decorations that are visible on the outside of the building etc they also determine rules on sub letting apartments and even how long someone can visit boards are elected by the share owners so how strict they are in any given situation will vary given the current residents of any given building if you're thinking of trying a co op apartment you should have your realtor obtain a copy of the building by laws and restrictive covenants before you start the process of trying to buy Housing cooperative Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Real estate broker Capitalism Dividend Contract Intellectual property United Kingdom corporation tax Stock Life insurance Corporate governance Copyright law of the United Kingdom Apartment building Security (finance) Public domain Wal-Mart Forum moderator Condominium Republic Microeconomics Donald Trump Cooperative Futures contract Patent Concurrent estate Property (ownership right) Political subdivisions of New York State Option Apartment Rupert Murdoch Monopoly (game) Congress of the United States Insurance Irish Houses of Parliament Government of Maryland Theory of conduct Illegal drug trade Article One of the United States Constitution ITV Commodity markets Non-aggression principle Treaty Stock market Supply and demand Tax Mutual fund Capital accumulation Royal Assent Pretty Good Privacy Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Consensus decision-making Trademark Coercion Appeal Leasing Public policy SCO-Linux controversies Gross domestic product Lawyer Citigroup First-sale doctrine Digital rights management Campaign finance reform Restrictive covenant Democracy Separation of church and state Conrail Dormant Commerce Clause Unreformed House of Commons Political divisions of the United States Copyleft Poker jargon Polyamory Media in Hong Kong Mikhail Khodorkovsky Microsoft Gun politics Wealth Israeli settlement Amway Apprenticeship Accountancy Government of France United States House of Representatives Education in Australia Divorce Price discrimination Speaker of the British House of Commons Politics of the United States CBS Marriage Mobile home Salary cap Mixed economy Election
