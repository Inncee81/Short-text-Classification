roommate advice i'm looking for a roommate but i'm not sure how i'll find living with someone i don't know if you have a roommate could you give me some pointers on how to deal with roommates and tell me your roommate experience thanks simple respect and compromise i had a roommate for years during college and we never fought over anything we each had our own rooms that we were responsible for cleaning weekly however we were responsible for our own messes if we shared meals whomever did not cook would take care of the dishes we planned meals and did our shopping together which made it possible to have a communal refrigerator there was no your food and my food we shared equally as for dating and having company we agreed that no one would stay the night we could stay where ever we wanted but sleepover guests made for an uncomfortable situation anyhow hope this helps we are both married with children and live hundreds of miles away yet we are still very close it is possible to have a roommate and get along good luck Friends The Contender (television series) Social rule Customs and etiquette of Japan Japanese tea ceremony Laura Schlessinger Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye Vista Way Kitchen Rule of St Benedict Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Cuisine of Denmark Queen of Wands EastEnders Will & Grace Pitaten Freed-Hardeman University Jon Secada Raw food diet Full House Food The Star Wars Holiday Special Ramen 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Meal Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Breastfeeding Roman eating and drinking The Commons Mister Fantastic Fecal incontinence Rent (musical) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Foodborne illness Kosher foods College Roomies from Hell!!!
