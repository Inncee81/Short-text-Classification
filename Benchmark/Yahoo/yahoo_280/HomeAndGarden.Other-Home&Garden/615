what is happening to my rubber tree what is happening to my rubber tree the leaves are falling of but yet new ones are growing is it beacause it is getting to much water or not enough please let me know asap a rubber plant can lose leaves for a number of reasons i am going to assume your problem is the most common very common one you have probably been losing leaves from the bottom up experienced growers used to say problems with bottom leaves means a problem with bottom roots it could be too much or too little water but is nearly always too little water on the bottom roots this happens because the plant may get water frequently but never gets enough water to soak the bottom roots roots always grow downward so it is not critical what the top of the soil is like but it is very important to get water down to the bottom of the pot the plant should be in a pot that has a hole in the bottom when you water you should give the plant lots of water even leave the pot in water to soak up water for maybe half an hour then drain off all extra water too much water is as bad or worse than too little in a day the limp leaves should stop hanging no more leaves should turn yellow and drop off however any leaves with any yellow in them now will continue to turn yellow and drop off leave the plant until it is quite dry on the top of the soil before you water again rubber plants like bright light but never hot sun when your new leaves are emerging even less light is advisable as this will promote larger leaves rubber plants are very susceptible to changes in environment such as warm to a cool room keep them out of drafts and away from heat sources good luck with your rubber plant Houseplant Bonsai Cannabis cultivation Coffee Hydroponics Carnivorous plant Leaf Bong Poker jargon Hippeastrum Common bean Dairy Desert Garden Strawberry Thermal power station Tobacco Fossil fuel power plant Sugar beet Physiological plant disorders Gypsy moth Textile manufacturing Irrigation Diving suit Vermicompost Apple Water Japanese tea ceremony Carbon dioxide Sorghum Tea Jute Olive Weed control Peach Coconut Pachypodium Plant Eucalyptus Tillandsia Great Lakes Banksia Sulfur Solar power Comanche Wood Christmas tree Water (molecule) Yosemite National Park Fruit tree propagation Brewery Renewable energy Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Ficus elastica Hypothermia Sauna Erosion Alcohol fuel Cheating in poker In-N-Out Burger Begonia Energy development Seismic retrofit Geography of Brazil Kitchen Venus Flytrap Illegal drug trade Quinoa Betting (poker) Carbon dioxide sink Opportunity rover Tofu Light-emitting diode Rubber Charles Goodyear Drainage Comfrey USS Trigger (SS-237) Wheat Orchidaceae Campfire Town gas Auxin Garlic Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Lighting Nuclear power Pea Death Valley National Park Nuclear meltdown Fire Hamster Ocean thermal energy conversion Hydrogen economy Photosynthesis Deforestation
