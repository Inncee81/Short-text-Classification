huge fire ante pile i need to get rid of a massive fire ant pile beside my backdoor i am on a budget and i also have two small children so i want to do it naturally without poisons anything homemade any suggestions there are no 'homemade' fire ant killers if you pour hot salty bleach water on the mound it will simply relocate and you will think you killed the first mound but more ants have moved in the problem is that the queen may be as far as ten feet down in the ground you kill the ones on the surface and the workers simply open a new tunnel to the surface several feet away best to use amdro fire ant killer logic tells me you aren't going to allow your children to get in the fire ant mound anyway so using a chemical that will actually kill the pests is the thing to do hope this helps Dishwasher Menstrual cup Fire extinguisher Washing machine Dishwashing Irrigation Water purification Thermal power station Hydroponics Sodium hypochlorite Pottery E-6 process Car washing techniques Sento Halitosis Cheese Hydrogen peroxide Fire fighting Hard water Vinegar Car wash Riot control agent Ammonia Hydrochloric acid Electrophysiology Dam Fountain Laundry detergent Textile manufacturing Herbicide Manicure Dundas Square Soap Energy development Detergent Fecal incontinence Organic peroxide Autonomous building Rebreather Sugar beet Acid Osmosis Jet engine Flue gas desulfurization Sauna Brewery Nitroglycerin Soil pH Urinary incontinence Japanese toilet Protein sequencing Hydrogen Chromatography Disinfection Cookware and bakeware Oscilloscope Onsen Battery (electricity) Ozone Staining (biology) Toilet paper Casting Hard disk Weed control Flour Gilding Portland cement Newcomen steam engine Wound Champagne (beverage) Drawing Sodium percarbonate Decompression sickness Water (molecule) Lignin Pebble bed reactor Sterling silver Carbon dioxide Two-stroke cycle Reverse osmosis Industrial wastewater treatment Sulfuric acid Hydrogen economy Pepper spray Concentration Methanol Soap bubble Breastfeeding Extreme Programming Contact lens Atmospheric pressure Mattress Phase (matter) Weathering Wood pulp Fossil fuel power plant Turbocharger Siegfried Line Callus Cavitation
