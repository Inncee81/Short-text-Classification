wisconsin bats in attic wisconsin bats in attic help three nights ago when we were sitting on the deck it sounded like there was a squirrel walking on the roof the next night we heard it again and then shortly after we saw a few bats fly by the house last night my husband and i sat on the deck watching were the sound was coming from sure enough after walking along the fasicia out popped a bat that took off total we had six come out our house is an older two story on the back of the house there is a kitchen that was attached that is just the one story we have high peeks on the house the bats are coming out of the fascia by where the second story and the roof of the kitchen meet if we counted six does that mean there is alot more up in the attic most likely i read on the internet about their droppings and bat mold being a problem is that something we will have to have taken care of also up in the attic my husband was thinking about blocking off where they are coming out but is that ok wont they just find another entrance and even if we get rid of them dont we still have to have the attic cleaned up if he goes up in the attic how can we tell how many of them there are or where they are i am so stressing about this we do not have a fortune to spend to get rid of them but yet i do not want any of us getting sick from them either or any of them getting inside the house will they try getting in the house any suggestions from those experienced with bats here in wisconsin i would really appreciate some input on how to handle the situation if we can take care of them ourselves i would like to go that route god bless it will take you about day to get rid of all the bats in your house you will need lots of silicone caulk some expandable foam a roll of duct tape and some bird netting first step find out where the bats are coming and going from go outside at dusk and you will see where they are coming from next during daylight hours seal all the holes in the boxing and facial of your home except where they are entering and exiting next where the bats are entering and exiting you need to drape the bird netting over these holes attach it with staples or tape or both it needs to be secure at the top and on the sides attach it so that it has a little play in the center almost so that you can just reach up into it from the bottom do not tape off the bottom of the bird netting here is what will happen the bats will come out at dusk and encounter the bird netting they have to go out so they will flutter down the net then fly away when they return to go back inside they will try to enter at the same spot they previously did but the net is in the way they cannot find the hole in the bottom of the netting to go back in they will try all night to get back in until dawn it will take several days to get them all out because they don't all come out every night leave the net up for days but inspect it daily to insure that it is secure after the th day in the daytime take the net down and seal the hole unfortunately you will have to live with the smell untill it dries out it will go away through the heat of the summer but almost impossible to remove all i can tell you to do about the smell is to use lots of air fresheners it cost me bucks to see this happen on one of my rental houses i have since succesfully evicted at least bat infested homes so simple a caveman could do it Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Young Ones (TV series) Dishwashing Kitchen Timeline of alternative rock The Shining (film) Codename: Kids Next Door Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Discworld gods Slayers The Fairly OddParents Knots Landing Futurama (TV series - season 5) McMansion Camp Lazlo Glass Dishwasher Kosher foods Blackadder Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Buffay's songs Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Good Morning, Vietnam Kim Possible Married... with Children Cuisine of Denmark Paul Is Dead EastEnders The Adventures of Pete & Pete FoxTrot Recurring South Park characters Friends Customs and etiquette of Japan Late Night with Conan O'Brien Computer virus Autonomous building The Brady Bunch Fight Club Euphemism Venonat Poker jargon Social rule Survivor (novel) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Beavis and Butt-head Movie projector Conker's Bad Fur Day The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Meat Loaf The Legend of Zelda series enemies Washroom The Sims 2 The Amber Spyglass Unreal Palindrome Sin City Hamster MAD Magazine Great Teacher Onizuka Columbo AFI 100 Years series Minor characters in Seinfeld Richard Chase Situation comedy Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Frankfurt kitchen Garfield Wine Bubble Bobble College Roomies from Hell!!!
