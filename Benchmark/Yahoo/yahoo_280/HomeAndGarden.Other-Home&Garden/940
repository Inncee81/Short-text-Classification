crumbling old wall i have a pre war semi detached classic breast chimney house i notice a few of the wall tiles above the bath taps were loosening and decided to gently take them out in the hope to repair them upon taking them out i discover the wall behind it is wet and the cement is crumbling deteriorating and the sand is falling apart the portion of the wall right under the taps are also falling apart where the first layer of tiles were so now i end up with problems one is how to repair the wall portion so that it becomes hard enough to lay tiles second is how to lay back on the first layer of tile where i cant physically put a baton underneath the bath taps bearing in mind there is no room under the bath to get into also the wall below the bath taps is falling apart any advice would be appreciated thanks st the wall behind is wet this is the root of all your problems is it due to plumbing on above floor or is the roof chimney or flashing leaking it sounds like there has been water in there for years you have two options or roads to follow if i may be blunt red green method or holmes on homes if you choose red green just use duct tape to hold your tiles but if you want to do it right it takes it doesn't have to be much if you do the labour yourself is this bathroom on an exterior wall more important is your tub against exterior wall is there tng hardwood floors or plywood sub floor looks like complete reno time lets assume your not made of cash but willing to do a fair portion every paycheck leave the toilet functional but take off all wall panels and find the frame work assuming any leeks in roof have been dealt with and frame work is fine replace old studs if needed order a new tub if needed but remove tub and wall behind it replace old plumbing plastic pex is easy to do yourself lay sub floor as for walls you said there was layers of tiles vc tiles asbestos tiles or vc and ceramic get rid of it if you own the home your better off to replace all wall coverings old drywall covered in glue on tile etc and replace with cement board you are now ready for ceramic tile sorry really technical questions involved with bathrooms now kind of need to see it is there a fan in the bathroom lots of baths or showers condesation creating moisture problem over year year period install fan easiest to vent through roof jack any roofer will install than try to go through old brick but anything is possible one step at a time recomend starting with demo so you can see wat you got Seismic retrofit Casting Roof Kitchen Drill bit Geodesic dome Japanese toilet Dymaxion house Wood Drywall Asbestos Tile Basement Fecal incontinence Pottery Toilet Light-frame construction McMansion Sento Toilet paper Mahjong Ceramics The Brady Bunch Hamster Plastic Bathroom Electrical wiring Poker jargon Home repair Glossary of partner dance terms Home improvement Domestic water system STS-114 Dundas Square St Albans Cathedral Ra (board game) Glossary of climbing terms Aerial (dance move) Atari 8-bit family Timber framing Big Brother (USA TV series) Urinary incontinence Mattress Glossary of firefighting terms Upholstery Furnace Chatsworth House Roof and tunnel hacking Toilet humour Radio controlled airplane Autonomous building Fire fighting Masonry Washroom HVAC Sydney Opera House Nintendo Entertainment System Skateboarding trick Menstrual cup Concrete Genericized trademark Diving Collision detection Equine conformation King Khalid International Airport Mosaic Arlington House Knife Violin Transformer M16 (rifle) Assonet, Massachusetts Wilton House Desert GunZ The Duel Plumbing fixture Glass Queensbridge Construction Diving suit Bridgwater Ethernet Cruising (maritime) Architecture of the California missions Tire Blood (computer game) STS-61 Xanadu House Thermal power station Stucco Japanese tea ceremony Wallpaper group Alhambra Changeroom
