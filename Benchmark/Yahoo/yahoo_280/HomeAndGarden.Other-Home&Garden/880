what's the best thermostat setting i usually turn my ac thermostat up to degrees when i go to work and then turn it back down to ish when i get home is it better cost wise energy efficient to do it this way or does it take more energy to cool back down than if i would leave it around the same temperature all day maintaining a consistent temperature is the only way to save money when you turn the temp down the whole house including the furnishings have to cool down which would have it running longer to get there we set our ac at and leave it there have never had an issue with our billing Thermostat Solar power Temperature Ironing Apollo 13 HVAC Hydrogen economy Autonomous building Heat Refrigerator Deep lake water cooling Thermoregulation Furnace Motor oil Stirling engine Energy development Ocean thermal energy conversion Embedded system Fossil fuel power plant Passive solar Nuclear power Gas absorption refrigerator Spacecraft propulsion Bi-metal Simulated annealing Jet engine Transformer Engine cooling Welding Rocket fuel Carburetor Turbocharger Nuclear thermal rocket Turbojet Wind power Hysteresis Global warming Climate change Pebble bed reactor Axial compressor Brewery Renewable energy Phase change heat pump Power station Air conditioning Conservation of energy Arizona Compact fluorescent lamp Sun Negative feedback Laser Hydropower Thermodynamics Space shuttle main engine Global climate model Solar collector Spark plug Grid energy storage Nuclear power phase-out Urban heat island Hydraulic machinery Internal combustion engine Evaporative cooling Explosive material Straw-bale construction Internal ballistics Heinkel He 100 Ozone depletion Electrical wiring Peltier-Seebeck effect Soldering iron Aircraft engine controls Adiabatic process Diode Incandescent light bulb Green-Kubo relations Heat engine Fire fighting Nuclear weapon design Fuel cell Superconductivity Cold fusion Alcohol fuel Volkswagen Passat Inertial confinement fusion Fluorescent lamp Warm-blooded Battery (electricity) Solar cell Wind turbine Severe weather terminology (United States) Energy Policy Act of 2005 Toyota Prius Ozone hole Energy Rail transport CANDU reactor Jimmy Carter Supercharger
