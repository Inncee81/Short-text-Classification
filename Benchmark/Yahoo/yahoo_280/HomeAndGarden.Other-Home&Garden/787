how do i make a lemon centerpiece was watching a movie recently and the character mentioned making a lemon centerpiece any ideas on how to make this i have made several types here's one idea get a clear large compote or vase tj maxx has a great selection and that is where i got mine put the lemons in the vase making sure that they look attractive from the outside you can also add some lemon leaves or other shiny leaves randomly pack them tightly and then fill the container with water if they are not tightly packed they will float to the top then using the lemons as a base insert a dozen yellow roses or other flowers extending them out and arranging them attractively i have also used limes and hydrangeas which are beautiful wishing you the best if you are having a nice dinner serve something with a lemon flavor or garnish to tie it all together Tea Lemon Leaf Japanese tea ceremony Martini cocktail Scuba set Lime (fruit) Rose Essential oil Soft drink Gatorade Coffee Yerba mate Ice cream Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Laos Brewery Hydrangea Soil pH Lemonade Animal Crossing Cuisine of Denmark Cha chaan teng Fanta Star Trek Customizable Card Game Wood carving Collectibles in Bionicle Tomato Cuisine of Vietnam Rum Liquid crystal Tournament of Roses Parade Laksa Russian cuisine Chicken soup Cuisine of Greece Bong Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of Cambodia Pancake Breakfast Top-bar hive Coriander Barbecue Banksia Rice pudding Oyster Citric acid Naval mine Orchidaceae Flowering plant Ramen Peanut Samovar IA-32 G-Man (Half-Life) Tooth enamel Land mine Missingno.
