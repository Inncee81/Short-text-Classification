moving a gas cooker hi there i am looking to move a gas cooker to a different location in a kitchen but leaving the connection where it is if that makes sense can you get extension pipes thanks if you're only shifting it a short distance like a foot or two on the same wall you can get a longer flexible gas line replace the existing with a longer line don't try to daisy chain them more than that and you'll need to plumb it with additional black pipe it's not hard installing gas line but if you don't make absolutely gas tite joints there's a good chance you'll blow up your house and kill your family so be very certain of your diy abilities before you attempt this also be aware that many municipalities require that all gas line work be done by a licensed plumber if you do attempt to extend the black pipe yourself don't use white teflon tape on the fittings there is a special teflon tape made for gas fittings it's yellow but i strictly use joint compound it's a thick past that comes in a tube kind of looks like toothpaste after completing the extension test the fittings by brushing a soap water mixture a good squeeze of dish soap in a glass of water to all the joints if there's a leak bubbles will form watch for a full minute slow leaks may take a minute to form a bubble basically the process is pull the stove from the wall turn off the supply valve and remove the flex hose determine the routing for the new pipe and the length of each piece your hardware store will cut the pipe to length and thread it have the new pipe fittings joint compound and two large pipe wrenches on hand turn off the gas at the main remove the shut off valve for the stove install the new pipe and fittings being sure to apply joint compound or gas line teflon tape to threads at each fitting reinstall the shutoff valve at the end of the new line and making shure it's off turn the gas main back on apply soap solution to each joint and watch for bubbles if you have any leaks you can try tightening the fitting but most likely you'll need to turn the gas off remove the fitting apply more joint compound Glossary of firefighting equipment Tire Hydraulic machinery Seismic retrofit Bong Spark plug Diving regulator Plastic Drill bit Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Trombone Screw Siphon Carburetor Carbon dioxide Irrigation Rebreather Rail terminology Electrical wiring Wrench Flush toilet Soldering Soap bubble Dialysis Brewery Casting Scuba set Portable stove Domestic water system Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Solar power Genericized trademark Vacuum tube Printed circuit board Knife Cookware and bakeware Textile manufacturing Electrophysiology Professional wrestling holds Diving suit Decompression sickness Diving cylinder Apollo 13 Town gas Naval mine Novelty (locomotive) Explosive material Hand grenade Bubble Bobble Brazing Computer Haloalkane Furnace Two-stroke cycle Gasoline Pipe organ Mouse (computing) Stove Urinary incontinence Oxyacetylene Bicycle frame Tai Chi Chuan Glass William Murdoch Pottery Fire hydrant Breathing gas Uilleann pipes Basement Circuit breaker High-voltage direct current Fluorescent lamp Energy development Combine (Half-Life 2) Stage lighting Glossary of firefighting terms Bread Japanese tea ceremony Universal Serial Bus Space Shuttle external tank Wood fuel Glossary of climbing terms Tap (valve) M60 machine gun Archery Rigging ALGOL 68
