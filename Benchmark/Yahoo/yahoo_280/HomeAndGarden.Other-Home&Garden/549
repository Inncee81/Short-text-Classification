how can i stop mold i have an older home and unfortunatly the basement was flooded it has since had a mold problem which allows spores to get into the a c ventalation system people are going to tell you to use bleach but this is not the way to do it because bleach does not kill mold it's a common misconception but the fact is that the bleach part of a bleach solution cannot penetrate a surface because of the chemical nature of the bleach what does penetrate the surface is the of the solution that is water and water is what the mold wants to grow so by using bleach you are actually giving the mold what it wants which is water true the bleach may kill the mold plant which is above the surface but it probably will not kill the spores and it definitely will not kill the roots of the mold plant that are under the surface bleach is not the thing to use on mold even though almost every answer you will get on here will say to use bleach it is just plain wrong vinegar will kill of all mold types saturate the area with vinegar if you want to get all of the mold use tea tree oil which will kill all mold including toenail fungus if you happen to have that tea tree oil can be diluted with water to about a solution and then sprayed on don't even think about using bleach Water purification Plant Fungus Disinfection Toxic mold Cheese Irrigation Sodium hypochlorite Lichen Water Fire extinguisher Ozone Bacteria Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Dishwasher Sulfuric acid Hydrochloric acid Food preservation Soil pH Strap-on dildo Vinegar Flowering plant Pickling Hydrogen peroxide Desert Spore Water mould Mushroom Organic peroxide Chlorine Air pollution Alkane Ammonia Desertification Soil life Wood Gypsy moth Renewable energy Thermal power station Acid Sewage treatment Plastic Biological pest control Wheat Acetic acid Pollution Ethanol Hydroponics Soil Aromatherapy Water (molecule) Wood pulp Slime mould Apple Honey fungus Essential oil Dead Sea Water resources Biological warfare Citric acid Concentration Tooth enamel Mushroom hunting Chlorophyta Fern Dishwashing Mosquito Mycorrhiza Theory of conduct Magnaporthe grisea Tea Ecology Carbon dioxide Menstrual cup Solvent Mosquito fern Flue gas desulfurization Joker (comics) Perfume Weed control Computational fluid dynamics Halitosis Garden Strawberry Cannabis cultivation Logging Solar power Casting Moss Otitis externa Biology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cookie Hemp Decompression sickness Invisible ink Permaculture Molding (decorative) Sage Eucalyptus Carnivorous plant
