toliet seat question i realize this question is kinda strange i've yet to find an answer that makes enough sense to me in most cases toliet seats in public restrooms are horseshoe shaped and in private home bathrooms are a closed circle why i've heard it has to do with sanitary reasons but if that's the case if the horseshoe shaped seats are more sanitary why wouldn't more home bathrooms have them wow definitely a weird question never pondered it myself public toilet seats have a gap because that area is in the line of fire so to say when used by a man peeing if it's not there it reduces the amount of janitorial work home seats have no gap because it's nicer and there's not too much worry of them getting too dirty since you'd probably take more care in keeping your furniture clean and they're used by less often Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Refrigerator car Kitchen Food storage Zucchini Hamster Indian Air Force Dairy Ada programming language Pacific Fruit Express Durian Passover Seder Kosher foods Coriander Foodborne illness Animal Crossing Fruit Bat Tropicana Products Folland Gnat Contredanse Autonomous building Vinegar ROT13 Breakfast Basil Organic food Refrigeration Juice Train Mango Refrigerator June 2 in baseball Military history of Egypt during World War II Persimmon Lychee Gooseberry Leno LaBianca Hawker-Siddeley Hawk Coconut Snow Scouts Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Freezer Sunnyvale, California Tomato Banana Best Buy Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables Major appliance Community-supported agriculture Very special episode Apricot Japanese tea ceremony Rambutan Ernie Irvan Tofu The Catcher in the Rye Upholstery Leo Frank International League Cuisine of Denmark Norouz Babe Ruth Food Seitan Red Sox Nation F-86 Sabre Tattoo Billboard Hot 100 Emergency preparedness 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands Surtsey Command School Ken Jennings Something Fresh Big Brother UK series 6 Lemonade Ice cream 613 mitzvot Fruit Growers Express $ale of the Century Ebola I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Food irradiation Covent Garden Certified Nursing Assistant Universal Product Code Charles Peace Fasting Playoff Food science Stock car (rail) Danville, California Weebl and Bob Pineapple Ethylene Hygiene Fenway Park Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Air conditioning Tetra Pak
