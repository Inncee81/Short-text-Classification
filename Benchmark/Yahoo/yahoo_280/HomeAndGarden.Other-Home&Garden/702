has anyone purchased a platinum protection home security system it was sold to me by a door to door salesman is this legit i have days to decide if i want to keep the system i'm mildly surprised that no one has questioned the door to door salesman situation you are asking anonymous strangers if the system you bought is legit it really doesn't matter how many yes answers you get or how many repair guys skim over your concern and concentrate on self promotion because you are unsure if the system situation is even legitimate i encourage you to return it within the three days if in fact you can if you are interested in a security system do some research and then purchase the system that best meets your needs no stranger on here can make that assessment as we do not have and should not be given all of your personal information necessary to make an informed recommendation in the end who really knows if the system you bought is legit but what a great scam approach homes you would like to get into ring the bell sell them a security system and well criminal minds would have a field day with this again because you are unsure return it a security system is the last thing that you should have to be skeptical about and god forbid you end up not being able to return it that of course would be an even bigger red flag that it should not be hooked up and that the seller might have been casing your house should you not be able to return it for any reason i recommend you notify the police just so they have the information after all you don't know what else they might know about an ongoing scam please do not be passive in this situation you should always do your homework i e ask regardless of if anything worries you there is never ever ever a time when you would not be justified in getting as much information as you want about a company second if you're actually at the point of being worred about the company you should do a whole heck of a lot more than ask you should find another company period this is not a situation to take chances with you should find a company with which you are confident good luck Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Confidence trick Surveillance Plame affair Microeconomics Shaggy dog story Intellectual property Supply and demand Mutual fund Contract Capitalism Ethics Goodness and value theory Sin City Theodicy Plame affair timeline Scientology beliefs and practices Epistemology RuneScape quests MapleStory Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Advance fee fraud Professional wrestling slang Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Motion picture rating system Infantilism Social rule Digital rights management MMORPG Philosophical skepticism Piccolo Junior Saga Continuation War Short selling Fathers' rights 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sales Copy protection Slander and libel Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban A Course In Miracles Pretty Good Privacy Lie Computer security Prostate cancer Privacy Royal Assent The UN Security Council and the Iraq war Password Mental Health Act 1983 Downing Street memo Roswell UFO incident Iraq disarmament crisis Asian financial crisis Asperger syndrome Scientific method Hyperinflation Real estate broker God Emperor of Dune Abortion debate Equal Protection Clause Technical analysis Alcoholics Anonymous Palace of Westminster FairTax Insider trading Li Ka Shing Tax Expert system The Skeptical Environmentalist Anarchism and society 11001001 (TNG episode) Ontological argument Morality Credit card fraud Financial analyst Classified information Corporate governance Health insurance Philosophy of science Probation officer Citigroup Consensus decision-making Rape Appeal 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji)
