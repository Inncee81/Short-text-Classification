can i feed birds uk i want to get a bird feeder for my uk garden but i'm concerned that the weather will be turning colder soon and at the back of my mind it feels like i shouldn't feed birds near winter for some reason can i feed birds safely or am i going to make them starve in winter once you start feeding it should be on a regular basis then the birds will associate your garden with a food supply this becomes very important during the winter months and they will keep returning to you by attracting them to your garden at this time of the year you are doing yourself a favour they will eat some of the bits you put out then turn their attention to the bugs which will be destroying your plants so you build up a symbiotic relationship they need a higher calorific diet in the winter nuts suet seeds fat peckers make sure they have fresh water summer and winter keep ice clear in the cold weather a bird bath is ideal because they can spruce up their feathers as well Bird migration Seabird Hamster Bird feeder Vegetarianism Acorn Cereal Domesticated turkey Water (molecule) Carnivorous plant Breastfeeding Nutrition Ice cream Biological pest control Vitamin C Bird Bread Peanut Tlingit Water Squirrel Egg (food) Organic food Christmas tree Omega-3 fatty acid Mosquito Hunting Kakapo Winter Hummingbird Sento Albatross Life in the Freezer Gypsy moth Veganism Organic farming Agriculture Ostrich Climate of the United Kingdom Livestock Bird bath Dieting Operation Barbarossa Genetically modified food Atlanta metropolitan area Anorexia nervosa Canary Hedgehog Robert Falcon Scott RuneScape quests El Ni__o Watermelon Symbiosis Alfalfa Chili con carne Ice Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Emu Species K__ppen climate classification Falconry Dairy Birdfeeding Foie gras Diesel engine Ozone depletion Fish farming Domestication Sorghum Renewable energy Guinea pig Airport Venus Flytrap Severe weather terminology (United States) Maize Pok__mon Abilities Antarctic krill Little Ice Age YuYu Hakusho Customs and etiquette of Japan Mealy Parrot Obesity Ozone hole Pine Billboard (advertising) Orca Thermal power station Skiing Brown Bear Gardening Battle of the Bulge Famine Agusan del Sur Milk Garfield
