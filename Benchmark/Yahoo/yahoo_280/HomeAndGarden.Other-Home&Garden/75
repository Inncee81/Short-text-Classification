how to make my basement smell better my girlfriend and i just moved into an apartment the basement is closed off very well and because of this the air is very heavy and smells bad whats an effective strategy to combat this the best way is to air it out preferably by opening a basement window or a bulkhead or exterior door failing that usually basement stink is from something that is bad down there or from humidity if it's something icky down there you have to search it out and get rid of it if it's humidity a dehumidifier will fix that there are sprays and air fresheners but usually if the problem is humidity or something that is sitting down there they only help for a few minutes HVAC Basement Fire fighting Cannabis cultivation Tank Air conditioning Halitosis Dehumidifier The Brady Bunch Stink bomb Autonomous building Air-raid shelter Humidity Xanadu House Columbine High School massacre The Great Stink Relative humidity The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror Natural Selection (computer game) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Snake Teen Girl Squad Fast bowling Common cold Gloom (Pok__mon) Cabrini-Green Imperial Crypt Conker's Bad Fur Day Sauna Window Boston Public White House Sniper Bombing of Hamburg in World War II Stoma Toilet humour Convair B-36 Smells Like Teen Spirit This Is Spinal Tap Rose (Doctor Who) Glossary of firefighting terms Severe weather terminology (United States) The Basement Tapes Swamp cooler Avenue Q Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Computer virus B-47 Stratojet Glossary of firefighting equipment Door Philadelphia Mint Ventilation Houseplant Sluggy Freelance Shotgun Signs Chess terminology Bong Desiccation Passenger car Angel One (TNG episode) Japanese toilet Battlebots The Fairly OddParents Modern naval tactics Kitchen Weather lore Sterilization (microbiology) Blitzkrieg Carbon dioxide Two-stroke cycle The Visitation BMW Z3 Cello GunZ The Duel MOVE Lee Harvey Oswald Hydrogen sulfide Blood Simple USS Wasp (CV-7) Humidifier Douglas DC-8 Hong Kong International Airport Perfume Thermostat Opera (web browser) Phoebe Buffay's songs Sin City The Pentagon The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear Palace of Westminster Philip J.
