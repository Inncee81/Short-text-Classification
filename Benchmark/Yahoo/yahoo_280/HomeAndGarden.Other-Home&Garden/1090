lavender how do i take a cutting i'm totally new to gardening and have never took a cutting in my life we have a beautiful lavender pot at our front door but i wouldn't mind taking a cutting or two to eventually plant in pots ready for next year the only problem is we don't know where or how to take a cutting can anyone help i'm from south of france and usually we don't do cuttings with lavenders except if the plant is big enough the best i think is to take a bit of the root along with their following twigs the most important i guess is the nature of the earth in which you re earth the cutting Lavender Japanese tea ceremony Textile manufacturing Perfume Fruit tree propagation Comfrey Hydroponics Theory of conduct Lavender Line Audrey Hepburn Carnivorous plant Bonsai The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Ron Weasley Essential oil Oh My Goddess!
