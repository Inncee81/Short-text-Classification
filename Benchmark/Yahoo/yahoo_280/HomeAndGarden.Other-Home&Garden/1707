how does my automatic lawn sprinkler valve work i have several stations in my automatic lawn sprinkler system each station has a valve that contains manual shutoff flow control knob solonid anti siphon valve any way my question is this why does water continue to flow even when the manual shutoff is turned off and the flow control is also turned off the guy above me got to it before i did sounds like either a diaprham has just gone out or the solenoid plunger is stuck or there is a rock or something inside the valve not closing it all the way like trying to close a door with your foot in it it will not close all the way a word of advice would be to go ahead and replace the anti siphon valves with regular inline valves anti siphon valves are pretty much junk any type as far as diagnosing the problem now check your timer's programming and make sure that its not sending out power to this zone all of the time this would make the timer bad carefully open the valve up with the water turned off of course and inspect the diaprham if it has any tears or ripps in it get a new diaphram if not then flush the lines out with the valve open to see if any debris is in the line rocks pipe pieces etc and clean it out take out the solenoid and make sure the plunger in it is not sticking if so replace the solenoid if all else fails just simply cut out and replace the entire valve and plumb in a new one properly personally i would use either hunter pgv valves rainbird dvf valves or irritrol series valves all are inline models antisiphon valves tend to fail i work on sprinkler systems full time for per hour of labor for our company hope this can help you out john a Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Donna Summer HyperText Transfer Protocol Bee Insect World Wide Web Entomology Pollination Honey Honeybee Flower Web server Agriculture HTML Uniform Resource Locator Bee Gees Pollinator decline United States Army Corps of Engineers Neo-Geo Ant Southeastern Anatolia Project Representational State Transfer Filename extension Uniform Resource Identifier Animal Crossing Wasp Egg (biology) Apocrita Lefkada Wget Bumblebee Tina Turner Kalavryta Eusociality MVS United States Automobile Club Shelbyville (The Simpsons) Karytaina Lalibela Pterygota File system Cadillac Eldorado Mosquito Animal Port numbers Neoptera Sprint cars Champ Car Bee learning and communication Hummingbird Pupa Lepidoptera 22 Short Films About Springfield Africanized bee Spider Pesticide Domain Name System Squid cache Pollination management Abraham Simpson IBM mainframe Biological pest control Common Unix Printing System Odonata Sexual dimorphism Proxy server Diseases of the honeybee WebDAV Mil Mi-24 SAS System Gaucho (insecticide) Beekeeping Ploidy Cretaceous W.
