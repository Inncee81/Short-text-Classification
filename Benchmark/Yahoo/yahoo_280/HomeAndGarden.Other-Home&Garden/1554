how long can a cutting board be used it looks scratched from day one do all cutting boards look scratched and dirty always i tried plastic now switched to wood but it looks ugly from day one how long is it ok to use them i put the wooden board in dishwasher and then read somewhere that they shouldn't be any tips thanks for your answers i only put it in the dishwasher once i guess it can still recover is it ok to rub cooking oil on it i am sure if i use mineral oil some part of it will get coated on the food that is chopped the acrylic and glass cutting boards are easiest to clean and sanitize wash with soap and bleach the stains glass is tuff on knife edges wood and acrylic will scar but don't sweat it unless you cook on television wood is affected by the heat of the dishwasher gets dry and brittle The Home Depot Gene Hackman Whose Line Is It Anyway?
