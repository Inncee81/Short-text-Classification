when making a bed with printed sheets which way does the printed side of the flat sheet face my husband and i have gone round and round on this for yrs silly i know but if this is one of our biggest disagreements we are in pretty good shape i say the printed side faces down so that when you get in bed you have both printed sides facing your body top and bottom my husband thinks that both the fitted and flat sheets printed sides should face up towards the ceiling so that the wrong side of the top sheet is facing your body can anyone help i agree with those who set it up to 'see' the pattern once it's folded back plus if there was lace or crochet edging on the sheet you'd turn it the same way here's one website that says it's 'our' way too http www tutorials com asp Knitting Textile manufacturing Bookbinding Crochet Mattress View camera Textile manufacturing terminology Professional wrestling throws Drill bit Poker jargon Paper size Equine conformation Wood carving Sailing Pickup truck Dominoes Sundial Lathe Envelope Boat building HyperText Transfer Protocol Stairway Autopsy Canoe Repouss__ and chasing Screw PHP Vinyl roof Professional wrestling attacks Cascading Style Sheets Glossary of partner dance terms Violin Betting (poker) Toilet paper Molding (decorative) Dice Lace-making Ammonite Draw poker Regular polytope Dial M for Murder Skinhead Widescreen Windsurfing Woodworking Blues Postage stamp separation Volleyball Punt (boat) Rigging Door Arado Ar 80 Knife Fan (implement) Table tennis Ajax (programming) Skateboarding trick Plane (tool) Lute Brewery Breath of Fire III Undergarment Inspector Gadget Protein structure Billiards Tatting Rubik's Cube Aerial (dance move) Terminal ballistics Tin can Shaggy dog story Curling Hat Clarinet Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Norway national football team Amateur telescope making Glacier Glass Tire Computer representation of surfaces Contredanse Surfing Ship Sheet metal Flax Shoelaces Wallpaper group Postage stamp World Wide Web Community card poker Dither Calvin and Hobbes Peter Shilton Suplex Piccolo Junior Saga Cookware and bakeware Geology of the British Isles 2000 Australian Grand Prix Strap-on dildo
