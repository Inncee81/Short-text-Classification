what causes large black circles on my tomatoes in my garden the spots are like the tom's laid on the ground but i noticed today that it is even on the above branches it is only located on the bottom of the tomatoes the problem is called blossom end rot ber and is caused by a lack of calcium within the fruit when calcium reaches low levels in the tomato the fruit simply dies back at the bottom leaving the characteristic black or brown spot calcium is present in most soils in adequate amounts the problem is that the plant cannot absorb enough calcium through its roots because of dry soil conditions that's because calcium is taken up by the roots along with water if for some reason water uptake is restricted calcium uptake will stop what can you do about it have your soil tested to make sure you have enough calcium in the soil if you don't add either limestone if the soil's acidity level or ph is below or gypsum if calcium levels are adequate the most important control measure is to maintain optimum soil moisture whenever tomato plants are allowed to experience the slightest bit of water stress you are causing ber to maintain good soil moisture try using a mulch of straw leaves or even grass clippings to prevent evaporation tomatoes need about one inch of water per week as a minimum if you do not get this through rainfall you will need to apply the water as a rough estimate each tomato plant needs approximately gallons of water each week if you use a mulch this amount may be cut in half when watering don't lightly sprinkle the ground apply the water so it enters the ground and moves through the soil to a depth of inches shallow watering only encourages shallow rooting which leaves tomato plants more prone to wilting Soil pH Desert Physiological plant disorders Sugar beet Gypsy moth Hydroponics Insulin Irrigation Carbon dioxide Comfrey Sorghum Coffee Houseplant Rain Fertilizer Drainage Weed control Hamster Wildfire Mattress Seismic retrofit Tofu Portland cement Equine conformation Brewery Pachypodium habitats Hemp Garden Strawberry Tomato Ecology Pachypodium Deforestation Soil salination Bonsai Chernobyl accident Wood Eutrophication Desertification Leaf Compost Alcohol fuel Textile manufacturing Calcium Lawn mower Tobacco Effects of global warming Lake Water E85 Organic gardening Japanese tea ceremony Dairy Soil Rainforest Peach Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Drill bit Wetland Ecohydrology Sewage treatment Water purification Breastfeeding Vitamin C Organic food Jute Anchor Auxin Flowering plant Glossary of wildland fire terms Lawn Amazon River Earthworm Tooth Herbicide Edible salt Apple Water (molecule) Anorexia nervosa Honey fungus Acorn Global warming and agriculture Veganism Protein Xeriscaping Nuclear power Concrete Rice Carbon dioxide sink Bog Hydrochloric acid Weed
