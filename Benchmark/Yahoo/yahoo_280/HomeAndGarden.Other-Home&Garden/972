how to locate and catch the bat in our house i'm staying with friends in cambridge and we found last night at about that a bat had gotten into the house prob through a vent and was flying around this had never happened before we hid in the other room and by about an hour later the bat was nowhere to be found we assumed it was freaked out and hiding somewhere because her husband was banging around looking for it but we couldn't find it we are very worried about the possibility of the bat being rabid as they have a four year old daughter and i've been reading online that most bats to get into your house are rabid as they are disoriented i also read that everyone who's died of rabies in the us has contracted it through bat bites they didn't know they had since they are small and happen when you're asleep i've read on here how to get rid of a bat flying around but what about a bat you can't find i doubt even a specialist would be willing to comb the house and how scared should we be about rabies we cannot call professionals it's too expensive to be afforded right now hi i pulled the following text of the attached link i suggest you call in experts at least this is the key message from the reading i've done as for rabies yes it's a possibility but i think rather remote anyway have your friends seek out a local professional bat control is a unique field it requires specialized training techniques attention to detail and extensive knowledge of bat biology and behavior getting rid of bats requires experience an effective bat removal system ensures that the bat colony will no longer use your home or business as a roosting area urban wildlife control technichians care for the welfare of these beneficial creatures we do not aim to kill any bats a professional merely excludes bats from the premises and make sure they can't get back in while thoroughly cleaning the biohazardous droppings that they leave behind experience counts when working on bat jobs and it takes a skilled eye to get the job done right the first time effective bat control requires a full site inspection and of the structure must be properly sealed including gaps as small as inch wide this can obviously become quite labor intensive in some instances the primary entrance exit holes are the only access points available and basic repairs and an exclusion may be sufficient Rabies Bat Baseball Education in the People's Republic of China Jumpstart 3rd Grade Blood (computer game) Carburetor Out-of-body experience Cricket RuneScape quests Computer virus Unemployment Fast bowling Vampire StarCraft: Uprising Textile manufacturing First aid M16 (rifle) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hard disk Milton H.
