neigbours extension my brothers neigbours have recently built an extension to the front of their house the problem is the bricks are a completely different colour to the rest of the house and its an eyesore from my brother's lounge its all you can see he doesn't want to speak to the man who lives there as he's not a friendly person is there anything he can do legitimately about this without revealing his identity all his other neigbours feel the same but don't want to talk to the man he lives in the uk any help would be appreciated if the extension required planning permission then it is highly likely that the council will have put a condition on the consent requiring that your neighbour submit a sample of the brick to be used prior to the commencement of works however if it is a porch extension then up to a certain size it would not require permission and if that is the case then nothing can be done check with the council start with the enforcement section of the planning department and ask them to investigate don't worry about complaining as the council are required to keep your details confidential if you get stuck and need professional help then get in touch via my web site below Segway HT Wal-Mart Xerox Scottish Power Natural monopoly Pacific Gas and Electric Company Nuclear power phase-out Electricity Supply Board Remington Arms Hydrogen vehicle Economy of Trinidad and Tobago Economy of Egypt Accounting software Filling station Electronic commerce 1973 oil crisis Common carrier Fuel cell Dennis Kucinich United Airlines Tennessee Valley Authority Tire Economy of Brunei K-Line Electricity meter Verizon Communications California electricity crisis Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Tesco Karl Rove Supply and demand Alcoa ISO 9000 General Motors Electro-Motive Division Closed shop Helium Anderson, South Carolina Economy of Venezuela Outlaw Economy of Canada Nuclear Suppliers Group Belinda Stronach Locomotive Monopoly Privatization Dominion Resources Best Buy Studebaker Economy of Qatar Implications of peak oil Falkland Islands Holdings Ferranti-Packard Simmering (Vienna) Quiznos Sub Vendor Managed Inventory Uranium Robert Bosch GmbH Western Electric Shopping cart D__ner kebab Li Ka Shing Honda NVIDIA Enron Corporation Value added tax Marks & Spencer Gunsmith Cats Economy of Ghana Spidey Super Stories Acorn Computers The General Electric Company Procurement Water supply Outsourcing Electricity distribution Nuclear energy policy Costco XERF Out of Gas Corporate governance Carl G.
