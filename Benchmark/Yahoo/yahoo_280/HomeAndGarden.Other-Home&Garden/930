why would my lawn mower's engine rev every seconds followed by a bit of black smoke coming out of the side i don't know if it's an oil issue or it needs a tune up but i'd appreciate any feedback that sounds like it has a clogged air filter and it is running over rich air fuel mixture take off the air filter for a minute and see if the problem goes away if it does clean or replace the filter Carburetor Motor oil Diesel engine Fuel injection Two-stroke cycle E85 Turbocharger Biodiesel Pebble bed reactor Internal combustion engine Chainsaw Steam engine Lawn mower Catalytic converter Laserdisc Gasoline Bong Motorcycle Reading spark plugs for racing Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tank Engine tuning Electrophysiology Gas turbine-electric locomotive Air purifier Electronic filter Diesel Air filter De Havilland DH.88 Control system Vocoder Spark plug Chevrolet Corvair engine Hard disk Big band STS-51-L Electronic amplifier Alcohol fuel Lawn Rocket fuel Continuously variable transmission Fossil fuel power plant Heinkel He 100 Carbon dioxide Air pollution Fuel cell PID controller Gas mask Engine displacement Loudspeaker Convair B-36 Drag racing Automobile Gimli Glider Porsche 911 Four-stroke cycle Audio feedback Turbojet Nitrogen oxide Sound effect Apollo 8 Diesel cycle GM 60-Degree V6 engine Energy development Filtration Dry cleaning Space disaster Tobacco smoking Audiophile Fire fighting Radio controlled car Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Briggs & Stratton Oxygen sensor Soot NTSC B-47 Stratojet Gramophone record Kalman filter Fuel efficiency Space Shuttle program Mitsubishi Zero Agar plate Apollo 6 Town gas Analog-to-digital converter Portable stove Transmission (mechanics) Texaco Explosive material Smoking pipe Scramjet Waste vegetable oil MP3 Mower Mercury Atlas 6 Supercharger 24 Hours of Le Mans Modem Hand grenade
