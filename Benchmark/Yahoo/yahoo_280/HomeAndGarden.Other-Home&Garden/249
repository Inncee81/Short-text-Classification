has anybody used liquid lawn aeration about months ago i laid a new sod yard i tilled the entire yard about inches deep to loosen the soil to give the new sod roots a good start well the yard isn't doing so good even after continued watering i called in a lawn care company and they have treated the lawn with fertilizers and premergers for the weeds growing between the sod they recommend lawn aeration and overseeding this fall which is what i plan to do i have found a few companies that offer a liquid aeration that is supposed to be better that traditional methods such as spike or core aeration has anyone had any experience with this type of aeration aerify and lazyman liquid soil aerator are two of the companies any help would be greatly appreciated years ago we used to like to spend time in our yard and do things ourselves so to us hiring companies would have been out of the question if you like your yard why not spend some time out there buy yourself a garden hose and one of those attachment bottles and get out there and water your lawn once a week with joy dishwashing liquid and water that will give the bugs diarrhea and but a hand sower probably cost you but lasts forever and put some good seed in it and spread it throughout your lawn just before a good rain and then once a month put some miracle gro or scotts product green plant food into your sprayer mixing it with the water from your hose and spray that on your lawn it will grow green and grow like crazy then you need to cut it but not too close to the root maybe you loosened the yard by tilling before you planted but it doesn't sound like you added any compost or vitamins to the soil or lime before you replanted maybe you should have your soil tested to see what it's lacking and then feed it what it's lacking i missed from your paragraph if you said you seeded or if you placed squares of grass or plugs and i didn't see what type of grass you planted there are all types of grass you could have planted fine grass but not drought resistant so be sure you get the scoop on what you need from a plant nursery you will want the kind of grass even if it is a little tougher looking that will be drought resistant since the weather seems to be getting warmer Weed control Houseplant Agriculture Irrigation Earthworm Comfrey Hydroponics Sugar beet Herbicide Sewage treatment Fire fighting Vermicompost Organic farming Opportunity rover Glossary of wildland fire terms Weed Textile manufacturing Soil pH Maize Autonomous building Cannabis cultivation Lawn mower Norman Borlaug Hamster Tobacco Jute Potato Garden Strawberry Alfalfa Sod The Championships, Wimbledon Tillage Composting toilet Coffee Wine Fish farming Gypsy moth Leaf Gardening Nuclear power Peanut Chernobyl accident Root Alcohol fuel Organic food Breastfeeding Moss Sears Holdings Corporation Biodynamic agriculture Zuiderzee Works Waste management Mattress Bonsai Christmas tree Rigging Renewable energy Organic gardening Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Prostate cancer Famine Carnivorous plant Pachypodium Plough Green Revolution Agricultural machinery Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Desertification Illegal drug trade Drainage Percy Schmeiser Rice Fire extinguisher Pok__mon Abilities Soil Brewery Orchidaceae Concrete Ant Fecal incontinence Vitamin C Dishwasher Flowering plant Barley
