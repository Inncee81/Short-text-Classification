how do we get our parents rotting deck condemned i live in georgia and my parents are having trouble making up their mind as far as choosing a deck it is in such bad shape that our mother has already fallen through it once whenever a new hole is created by someone's leg going through our mother finds some random object to cover it so that we don't fall through it has been like this for to years it is at the point that pieces of it are falling off when they get heavy from rain entire boards etc we would like to get it condemned so that our parents will no longer literally risk their lives by stepping out onto it it is rather high off the ground and if someone were to go completely through it might be fatal what is the process we should go through to get it condemned we have tried everything we've tried getting them to sit down and talk about it and make a decision but they always come up with a lame excuse to put it off until later we don't want to saw it off ourselves since we don't have experience in taking down decks it has come to the point that we have to do something drastic to get this taken care of they are putting their own lives at risk yet they don't seem to think it's that big a deal this one is a easy solve you get the number for your local code enforcement agency depending where you live it may be at the city state lv more often then not it falls under the department of housing and development call with a tip stating that your neighbors deck is in a unsafe state and that your worried that the local kids may get hurt on it then tell them you tried to get the neighbors to do something about it and they wouldn't if you have a enforcement division wort a crap they will be out the next day to address the issue Barnes & Noble Venus Flytrap Carnivorous plant Shen Gong Wu Neopets Apple D'ni Ages Publishing Domain Name System Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Internet fraud Website Bladderwort .info Legal research Dairy The Best Page in the Universe Apricot Jon Secada Amazon.com Grafting Highbury Book Battersea Power Station George Washington Carver Tobacco Hashish Discus (fish) Barnes Patricia Ford Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Nicomachean Ethics Eaton's Electronic commerce Nuclear power Lego Search engine Macromedia Flash Canadian National Exhibition Houseplant Livestock WKRP in Cincinnati Bananarama Banana MDAC Cultivar AmigaOS Fareham Gooseberry Flowering plant Dorset Monopoly (game) British small press comics Web traffic Cross site scripting Jury Led Zeppelin Neil Gaiman De revolutionibus orbium coelestium Delta Goodrem Star Trek Customizable Card Game Transformers (toyline) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Live Aid LiveJournal PC Engine Compiler optimization PGA Championship The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation DragonQuest Murdoch University Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Care Bears Roxette Leicester City Centre Letterboxing Uranium Domestic rabbit Ballwin, Missouri Maurice Noble Tallboy bomb Fruit tree propagation Nuclear fuel cycle Color Graphics Adapter Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants Akatsuki (Naruto) GLOCK Dairy farming GameFAQs Hop (plant) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) W.E.B.
