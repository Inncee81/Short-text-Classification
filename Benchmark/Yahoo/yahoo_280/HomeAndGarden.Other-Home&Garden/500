how can i make my bathroom odor free hello my husband and i live in an older apartment and our bathroom doesn't have a vent or any air ventilation whatsoever we have to keep the door closed when not in use our cat unrolls all of the toilet paper lol but then when we open the door the room smells heavily of mildew are there any creative ideas for getting rid of the bad smells i'm a neat freak and am constantly cleaning but it doesn't seem to help neither do air fresheners or plug ins any help would be wonderful thanks if you are cleaning thouroghly with lysol or bleach the mold is likely inside your walls or floor if there was ever a water leak in the past or currently the wood inside your walls may be growing molds some molds can be highly hazardous to your health if you can't get rid of the smell you should address with your landlord asap if landlord doesn't check out and get you an adequate solution then you should report the problem to the health department additionally you can get a portable dehumidifier which should remove any excess moisture in the room and help prevent the growth of molds and mildews and filter other nasty bathroom smells lol Japanese toilet Hamster Toilet Menstrual cup Fecal incontinence HVAC Air pollution Cannabis cultivation Toxic mold Fire fighting Kitchen Ventilation Door Bathroom Dymaxion house Upholstery Cat Toilet humour Ammonia Washroom Ozone Composting toilet Polyethylene terephthalate Toilet paper Water Glossary of firefighting terms Passenger car Hydrogen peroxide Homer Simpson Blood Simple Plumbing fixture The Shining (film) Urinal Sulfur Oxyacetylene Flatulence Xanadu House Biblical scientific foresight Casting Fancy rat Bong 1,4-dichlorobenzene Fume hood Hydrogen sulfide Autonomous building Combine (Half-Life 2) Sodium hypochlorite Buckingham Palace The Inside Hemp RuneScape quests Flush toilet Carbon dioxide The Brady Bunch Euphemism Natural gas Asbestos Water purification Diseases of the honeybee Air conditioning Carnivorous plant Changeroom Bullet World War Three (Doctor Who) Syphon Filter Glossary of firefighting equipment Futurama (TV series - season 2) Genericized trademark Rebreather Basement Tofu Wood Seismic retrofit Sento Conker's Bad Fur Day Firefighter Thermal power station Jumpstart 3rd Grade Traumatic brain injury Tobacco smoking Swamp cooler Compiler optimization Pet skunk Hogwarts Floor Directory Halitosis Foodborne illness Soldering Saw II Three Mile Island Radon Bidet Urinary incontinence Hydrochloric acid Urine
