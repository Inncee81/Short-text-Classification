how to deal with a bad and stupid neighbor what would u do i have a rd floor neighbor in a rental apt complex who empties his ash trays with all cigarette butts down in front of my garage where i usually park my car since other members of family use the garage now its been a few times and i have not confronted him yet but he did it again and last time it was my guest who had to deal with it and confronted him with no success he looks like an ex con white man pretty much a dead beat loser who still lives with room mates what would u do and no stupid jokes or pranks plz management has already proven useless in this matter thnx alot khan said revenge is a dish best served cold think about that a long time if he's a loser with nothing maybe you already won look on the bright side if you take a video of him doing it and show it to the authorities and they give him a ticket you can worry about a convict killing you in your sleep instead of butts if you're real angry do what comes natural to you if posting it here helps so be it Beavis and Butt-head SpongeBob SquarePants Garfield Matt Hardy Married... with Children Sin City Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters South Park EastEnders Philip J.
