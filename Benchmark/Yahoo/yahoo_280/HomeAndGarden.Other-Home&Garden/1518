how do i get my petunias to not die every year my potted petunias die after about weeks i water them and make sure they have the right amount of everything but they just die none of my other plants r dying so why do they always die i live in texas and have had petunias survive for years without dying out we had a few very mild winters when they started looking shabby i cut them back to the newest set of leaves on each stem i did this in the evening after having watered good early in the day it was quite interesting to see how they survived each season although they were pretty shabby looking and had become more of an experiment than anything else when they finally died out for good if your petunias are in pots you might want to move them to a place where they are only getting the early morning sun late afternoon sun will burn them up pretty quick petunias are very easy to grow from seed you might get more and longer enjoyment out of the flowers if you planted the seeds yourself and witnessed the first blooms Satay Ford Crown Victoria Zip drive Barbecue University of S__o Paulo Grilling Hot dog Grill Japanese cuisine Principia Discordia ZIP Code In-N-Out Burger Goatse.cx Tom Prichard Ford Cortina Dodge Charger Bacon Cuisine of Malaysia Dodge Challenger Grilled cheese sandwich S__rv__gur Inverted Jenny Aperture grille Gzip Irish breakfast Kebab Jeep CJ Chipotle Mexican Grill ZIP (file format) Chrysler 300 letter series Arepa Tour de France Buick Century The Land (Disney) Volkswagen Golf Pp-wave spacetime San Marino, California Yellow Pages Mena Suvari Monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave Yellow Toyota Cressida Roe Door MRE Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) MOS Technology 6502 EMD F7 Barsoom series The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) GNU Hurd Lothar von Trotha Wile E.
