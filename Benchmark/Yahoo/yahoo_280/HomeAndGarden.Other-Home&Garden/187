why are there different colour street lights lamps most street light use low pressure sodium and rare earth gases which are a bit like a flourescent light the gases are excited by an electrical charge causeing the gases to burn and consequently illuminate motorway light tend in the main to be high pressure sodium thereby glowing more brightly both types are surpisingly ecologically efficient and have a long life span because the gases warm up gradually unlike a filliment lamp like the type in your house they do not burn out when switched on as quickly because the process is graduall instead of a sudden burst hope this helps Street light Fluorescent lamp Sodium vapor lamp Mercury-vapor lamp Light pollution Lighting Incandescent light bulb Gas lighting Internal ballistics Sodium Laser Nuclear power Spectroscopy Plasma (physics) Welding Light Light-emitting diode Natural gas Electrodeless lamp Kerosene lamp Bicycle lighting Aurora (astronomy) Color Compact fluorescent lamp Coal Xenon Security lighting Vacuum tube Stage lighting High-intensity discharge lamp Headlight Explosive material Gas metal arc welding Neon lamp Turbocharger Diesel engine Ecology Ultraviolet Action potential Helium Hydrogen Fire Petroleum Carbon dioxide Xenon flash lamp Ozone depletion Future energy development Rebreather Internal combustion engine Pebble bed reactor Tire Xenon arc lamp Gas mantle Volcano Traffic light H II region Lightning Electric glow discharge Solar power Solar cell Portable stove Aluminium Ozone hole Circuit breaker Diwali E85 Locomotive Turbojet Electric light Tank STS-62 Supernova Wind power Optical fiber Open cluster Carbon Fan (implement) Arc welding Gas turbine Stirling engine Stellar evolution Diode Long QT syndrome Spacecraft propulsion Steam engine Spark plug Shell (projectile) Transformer Water (molecule) Digital Mercury arc valve History of street lighting in the United States Ocean thermal energy conversion Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Power station
