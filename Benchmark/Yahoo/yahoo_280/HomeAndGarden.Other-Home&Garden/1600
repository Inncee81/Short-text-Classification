is it all right to cut the stalks on hosta plants when the flowers are done you can cut them off at any point and time including when they are flowering just watch out for the bees it will not hurt the plant at all i do this all the time with mine you can cut them off at any level you want to flowers are not really necessary on them as they grow new plants by spreading out their roots if you are wondering about splitting the plants you can also do that at any point and time just be forwarned that the newly split hostas that you are going to plant elsewhere will look absolutely crappy at this time of year after you plant them they will look like they are gonna die they more than likely won't no worries they will look beautiful next year though Outsourcing Breathing gas Hydrogen economy Charles Goodyear Fred A.
