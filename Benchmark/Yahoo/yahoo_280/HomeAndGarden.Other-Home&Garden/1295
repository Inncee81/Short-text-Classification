can i freeze these veggies from my garden i have a garden for the first time in my life it is doing well can i freeze zuccini jalapeno and bannana peppers if so do i have to cut them up is there a certain time frame i should stick to when freezing i wanted the jalapeno's for winter which is about months away for chili i am really new to this so any info would be much appreciated thanks you can freeze all of that stuff and they will be fine for the winter you should cut them into pieces none of them will be crunchy though but kind of watery mushy so you'll probably have to use all of the stuff for cooking not just the jalapenos Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Roof Air conditioning Tennessee Williams Urban heat island Milwaukee, Wisconsin Collecting fossils Hot air balloon Straw-bale construction Volleyball Tin Pan Alley Lightning Climate of the United Kingdom Squash (sport) Kowloon Motor Bus Solar power El Ni__o Sento Real tennis Pacific, Missouri Welding Mercury Atlas 6 Citybus (Hong Kong) Piccolo Junior Saga Sulfuric acid Donna Summer Hot rod Hurricane Wilma Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Pea Tin Shui Wai Tropical cyclone Hyperthermia Xanadu House Severe weather terminology (United States) Cooler Elizabeth Taylor Geography of Japan Solar collector House Tin Tobacco Spark plug Heat Copper Cricket 2008 Summer Olympics Diving suit Sha Tin District Furnace Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station Sydney Fenway Park Motor oil Climate of India Soldering Weather lore Car body style Coffee Bird migration Iranian architecture Emu Urban beach Geography of Africa Geography of Spain Maka-Njem Dartmoor Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Cricket pitch Heat index Torquay United F.C.
