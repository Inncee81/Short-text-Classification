potential home buyers would you rather see white painted kitchen cupboards or poorly refinished and stained here's the deal we plan on selling our house within the next year and our kitchen cupboards are i think a mess they are old s style oak with fake oak laminate panels on the inside we knew something needed to be done so they are completely torn apart and sanded however there appears to be damage steam to the bottom of several upper cupboards and around the dishwasher that i can't sand out i propose that it would be best to slap down some white enamel paint but my husband feels that a potential buyer would prefer wood cupboards even if they are looking rather worse for wear what do you think our countertops are a light grey stone and other comparable homes in our neighborhood go for around the mark i would leave them like they are then the buyer can do what they want with them but if you paint them white the buyer will have a harder time a buyer might want to stain what is already there or they may take them out and get new cabinets that they like everyone has a different taste just try it like they are and see what the people looking at the house say if that is a major thing that you notice everyone talking about maybe it would be better to go ahead and paint them i personally would just leave them like they are because wood cabinets look better than painted ones even if they have a couple trouble spots have a good day Kitchen Door Plastic Wood carving Arcade cabinet McMansion Aliens of London Equine conformation Wood Chatsworth House Mattress Supply and demand Drill bit Woodworking Upholstery Microeconomics Dishwasher Paint EastEnders Ford Cortina Oak Black Orchid (Doctor Who) Pitaten Salad Fingers Kitchener, Ontario Daredevil Harlem American Broadcasting Company Hartford, Connecticut Home repair Bristol Grammar School Ford Motor Company Tire Harrow School RuneScape quests Beatmania IIDX First Battle of the Atlantic Internet fraud Black Staining (biology) Donald Rumsfeld One Tree Hill (TV series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Imperial (automobile) 1957 World Series Illegal drug trade Alhambra Kitsch Dinghy Knife Dishwashing TARDIS Jumpstart 3rd Grade Boston College Seismic retrofit Cello Social rule Tooth Insider trading Sculpture The Adventures of Pete & Pete In-N-Out Burger Australian legislative election, 2004 Glass Transformer Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim StarCraft: Uprising Trapped in the Closet Blenheim Palace Grace Cossington Smith Friends Oakland Athletics Timber framing Real estate broker Diamond Toronto Blue Jays Laser engraving Mess dress Frankfurt kitchen Buckingham Palace In The Groove (game) Something Awful Tudorbethan architecture The Empty Child Wilton House Cabrini-Green Ship Mushroom hunting Los Angeles Clippers House Table saw Bulk vending Wrigley Field Infantilism Boat building Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diamond cut Brett Whiteley
