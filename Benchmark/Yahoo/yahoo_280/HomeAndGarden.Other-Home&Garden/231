why do some countries have volt outlets and others i am an american and i live in morocco where we have volt outlets in america we have besides volts what is the practical difference is it better to supply homes with one over the other okay i have heard of a step down converter i use one here for some things i brought from america it is obviously out in the open and i manually plug it in to the outlet where in the house in america are these transformers or converters is it in the house or in the appliance in the house i grew up in we had only one outlet that was and it was illegal to have the appliances plugged into the same outlet as a lamp can you explain more thanks in the usa there are two lines that feed the meter and enters the fuse box both these lines are energized if a volt meter is used you would be able to measure the voltage potential to ground of volts if you measured the voltage potential from one line and the other line you would read a difference of v large appliances require the volts like dryers welders and some air conditioners earth ground is part of the circuit from the generating station and your home the current travels from the electric company to the lights and then through a line connected to a rod that goes into the ground in the house there are many configurations that an electric grid can be wired and not everyone uses the same standard you are at the mercy of your local electric company regardless which country you are in Alternating current Three-phase electric power Transformer Residual-current device Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Fuse (electrical) Ground and neutral Circuit breaker Volt Electric power transmission Electricity distribution Mains electricity BS 1363 High-voltage direct current High-voltage hazards Electric motor RS-232 Oscilloscope Electricity meter Circuit design X10 (industry standard) Lineman (occupation) Capacitor Electrical wiring National Electrical Code (US) Vacuum tube Diode Spark plug Transistor Battery (electricity) Solar power George Westinghouse Loudspeaker War of Currents Operational amplifier Potentiometer Impedance matching Electricity Distribution board Thermal power station Thermostat Lightning Tesla coil Antenna (radio) Electrical network Decibel Resistor Earthing system Electric power Electrical generator Membrane potential Single-phase electric power Overhead powerline Power line communication Welding power supply Digital circuit Spark gap Gas metal arc welding Electrical resistance Electrical wiring (UK) Universal Serial Bus Relay Carburetor Ring circuit Fluorescent lamp Inductor Lighting Fan (implement) Appliance classes Current (electricity) Enigma machine RLC circuit Maxwell's equations Seismometer Rapid transit Power cord Lightning rod Uninterruptible power supply Power (physics) Gauge theory Linear particle accelerator Jack plug Action potential Ampere Magnet
