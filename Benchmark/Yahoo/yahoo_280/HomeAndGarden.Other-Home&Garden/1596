how can i end once for all with ants invation are years now we're living with these ants they're small brown and millions of them when i find a nest i kill them with anything i have on hand they has ruined my vhs recorder a portable dvd and tons of video cassettes seems that they are decided to end with my film making dream please heeeeelp i dont want to use hazard chemicals if anyone have a good advice to end this problem all suggestions are welcome i've had those ants a few times over the years it always seems no matter how clean you keep your kitchen or elsewhere they still seem to come but i've been able to safely get rid of them for years at a time by doing the following old time remedy get a cheap bottle of boric acid powder a very mild and safe form of ant control you can get at places like home depot and lowes in the pest control section next to the gardening supplies also get a small container of mint jelly from the grocery store i found it at albertsons grocery store mix two tablespoons boric acid powder per ounces of mint apple jelly take a thin piece of cardboard or a doubled over piece of paper and tape it firmly against part of the surface such as a counter directly over the pathway the ants are using and make thin rows of the boric acid jelly solution on it with enough space between the rows for the ants to get between so that as many of the ants have access to the edges of the jelly as possible some will get stuck in the jelly but many will take bits of this stuff back to their nest and feed it to the rest of the colony and queen you may have to replace the paper or cardboard with fresh jelly daily for or days and then they'll be gone for good by the way you may actually see more ants in the first hours after you first put the boric acid jelly out but then it tapers down quickly during the nd day because they begin dying as they take the stuff back to their colony the way the stuff works is that it dehydrates them from the inside out Basement Refrigerator Kitchen Wood fuel Solar power Vacuum tube Insulation Thermal power station Chevrolet Corvair Torpedo Thermostat Furnace Volleyball Autonomous building HVAC Apollo 13 Fireplace Hot air balloon Dundas Square Fan (implement) Water heater Energy Fossil fuel power plant Bus models used in New York City Transit Marine aquarium Biofuel Diesel engine Nuclear weapon design Bi-metal Carbon monoxide Air pollution Japanese toilet Lighting Carbon monoxide poisoning Passive solar Seismic retrofit Fire fighting Solar panel Ventilation Windows 2000 Silicon Cold cathode Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Aquarium Fireplace poker Mars Exploration Rover Swimming pool Town gas Ideal gas Chimney Rathfarnham 1973 oil crisis Polyethylene terephthalate Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April Transistor Printed circuit board Derivation of the partition function Door The Time Machine Explosive material Fire Branch Davidian Debye model Large numbers Toast Chatsworth House Thermodynamic equilibrium Pressure Wilton House Mozilla Firefox Optical fiber Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Templeogue Welding Incandescent light bulb Ammonia Gas core reactor rocket STS-62 Cold fusion Energy development Mazda 323 Oscilloscope Renewable energy Natural gas Wall Street Opportunity rover BMW E23 Radon Rail terminology Breathing gas Smoking ban Animal Crossing Samovar Six Flags Over Texas Process control Scuba set Firefighter Thermocouple
