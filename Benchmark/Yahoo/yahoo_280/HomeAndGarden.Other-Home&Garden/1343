if you do have the siding removed have the contractor give you an estimate on installing house wrap to the exterior under the new siding house wrap when you go out in bad weather you wear a jacket to protect yourself from rain wind and other elements a home should be protected in the same fashion without a protective barrier the home can get wet which can lead to wood rot and mold growth is there a better way to protect a home from these elements using a house wrap during the framing stage of construction will prevent moisture from entering the home this will protect the house from rotting and from developing mold or fungus additionally air infiltration through the framed walls will be blocked the best practice for protecting your home from wind and water while allowing it to breathe is to install a layer of house wrap made of a thin layer of spun bonded polyethylene here's how to do it start at a corner but make sure you have to feet of house wrap to overlap the corner wrap it around the corner and continue nailing or stapling as you move wrap the entire building including door and window openings use button nails or minimum inch staples to fasten the house wrap every to inches along the vertical studs make an inverted y cut or martini glass cut over the window openings fold the flaps in through the opening of the two sides and the sill and fasten them inside many builders do not install a drainage plane at all the builders who do often install building paper a sheet of asphalt impregnated felt paper to protect the house from exterior water penetration unlike house wrap however building paper doesn't effectively reduce air infiltration because it has many seams while house wrap is a continuous sheet with minimal overlaps house wrap produces a breathable weather resistant barrier that will reduce energy costs and prevent wind driven rain from entering the walls of a home windows if you are actually going to have the windows replaced the best way to do this is replace the whole window including the frames have the windows removed to the rough opening many contractors will tell you this is not necessary if the house is quite old the space between the rough oping and the window frame is likely not insulated and sealed properly leaving the existing window frames in will not eliminate drafts properly also it allows you to see if there is may moisture damage to the structure that has to be repaired here is an excerpt from this link http www doityourself com stry retrofit how do i decide between retrofit or new construction windows by bill kevin burnett q what are the disadvantages to retrofit windows as opposed to the advantages of new construction windows i've been shopping for new windows for my home and have found that labor and materials for retrofit windows is about one half the cost of new construction windows i understand that with retrofit windows the old window is removed and the new window is installed into the old window frame which certainly cuts down on labor however is there a quality issue can there be more of a chance of leakage around the window with retrofitted windows retrofit installers swear by their product my contractor said he won't install retrofit windows what's a homeowner to do a retrofit windows are installed into existing window frames new construction windows are secured to the frame of the house by nailing flanges the cost difference is related to removal and repair of existing window trim and siding the major advantage of flanged windows is that they are one integral unit that is easy for the contractor or homeowner to install plumb and square within a framed opening retrofit windows are installed into existing frames and if those frames are not plumb or square there may be problems to install flanged windows the old windows must be completely removed exterior trim and often interior trim will have to be removed exposing the framing so the new windows can be nailed or screwed to it siding will also need to be cut back so that the edge of the framing is exposed if you have a stucco exterior installation will require some stucco to be chipped or cut away then patched after the new windows are installed trim must be reinstalled finally everything must be repainted sounds like a pretty big job doesn't it it is retrofit windows on the other hand use the existing frame as the opening in which to install the new windows no trim removal no stucco or siding to repair a seemingly much simpler and cleaner job it can be so what to do from our perspective it depends on the type of existing windows you have and the exterior trim and siding involved most of our experience has been with the double hung wooden windows that are common in old homes to install retrofits in this type of frame the old sash is removed stops are installed if necessary and the new unit is attached to the old wood frames with shims and screws a little caulking around the joints and you're done this type of installation if done properly will provide an airtight seal if your existing windows are the steel casement windows used in the s or the aluminum windows commonly used in the s ' s and ' s we'd suggest you do some serious digging into the possibility of using retrofits if we were in the market to retrofit these windows we'd undertake major research look at some existing installations and satisfy ourselves with the looks method of installation and quality of these products all this being said we don't think we'd be happy with existing steel or aluminum frames with new window inserts unless we were convinced that the frames were covered and the installation was airtight tip we've always found it better to install flanged windows with screws rather than nails if minor adjustments have to be made to properly fit the window into the opening it's much easier to remove a screw or two rather than pull a nail with a cat's paw use stainless steel or zinc coated screws selecting contractors look up local contractors first work out form the closest to your location if some you trust has had work done similar to yours ask them about the contractor they used if they were completely satisfied with their contractor s ask for their telephone number select at least your are interested do a google yahoo search on each of the contractors you are interested in look for praises check who is writing the praises to see if they have any connection to the contractor scam artists and coffident persons often work in groups google yahoo search the people giving the praise or references when you are satisfied with at least contractors per job have the give you written estimates with details of work to be done terms guarantee s cost of extras how much do they charge if they find something not covered by the contract paymant schedules if necessary and whatever else you can think of to protect yourself if the contractor tries to pressure you into signing the contract immediately with a high deposit more than reject that contractor be careful high pressure can be someone who sounds very convincing but has many reasons why you should sign on the dotted line now it is always good to have another adult with you when a contractor inspects the work to be done if you do not get at least written estimates signed by the contractor not you do not sign yet go back to repeat until you get written estimates signed by the contractor not you do not sign yet read the estimates over with some who has some knowledge of the work that has to be done this may take longer than you thought do not rush into it research resaerch research helps when you are ready choose by being informed good luck Carpenter bee Bee Spider Tarantula Flickr Black widow spider Butterfly
