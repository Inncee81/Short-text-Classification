prices of goods in charity shops it seems to me that some charity shops are overpricing some of the stuff thy have on sale i can buy stuff brand new for less than they are asking on the tag yes i appreciate tht they need to get the best price tht they can but surely by lowering the prices to a more realistic level the shop would turn the goods over faster and therefore make more money for the charity concerned anyone else agree this relates to shops in the uk not sure about anywhere else when charity shpos first started all the good they sold were a bargain but they became to popular and the result is the ridiculous prices they now charge but orginally they started out as small shops run by local volunteers but have no been swallowed up by some form of corperate marketing and most have large exspensive offices paying stupid wage to managers to run the bloody things i cannot be sure but i believe some of the managers are on upwards of per year with all the perks thrown in as well the sooner the shops get back to grass roots the better it will be for all i am all for raising money for charity but let the charity be run by volunteers in some charity shops the money raised for charity is less than the wages paid out this is wrong i for one say get back to the old days Microeconomics Capitalism Supply and demand Anarchism and capitalism Short selling Wal-Mart Surplus value Hyperinflation Tax Retailer Price discrimination $ale of the Century Inflation Monetary policy Labour economics Gold standard Mutual fund The Apprentice 2 Rational expectations Bulk vending Labor-power MMORPG Keynesian economics Economy of Russia Monopoly Theory of the firm Gross domestic product Taxation in the United States Tariff Progressive tax Commodity Economics Contract Labor theory of value Law of value Charity shop Say's law Supply-side economics Trade union Internet fraud RuneScape economy Electronic commerce Credit card PE ratio Newcastle United F.C.
