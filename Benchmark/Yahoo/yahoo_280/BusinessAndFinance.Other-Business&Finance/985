help me my girl and i ok we have been together for months and the first months have been so great i have never felt this good but the last month she has been growing away from me and i asked her if she still loved me and she said that she does just not the same though i am and she is we are in college together and yes the same classes we don't see each other as much she said that she wants to live her own life first and that all of her friends say that she should leave me because of my age i don't know what i did wrong all i wanted to do was make her happy and let her know she is someone special to me but she doesn't even say i love u anymore i don't want to break up but i am so confused right now what should i do we never have had a fight we have always been so in love with each other now it all has changed and i really don't know why that sucks man i really can understand what you're going through i don't mean this to sound mean or anything but consider the situation you're she is you're taking classes with a girl years younger than you you have a year old kid she is years old this girl is still a child herself even if the two of you were the same age and in the same situation i wouldn't be surprised if it didn't work out here's the bad news she is getting ready to break up with you about the only thing you can do to prevent this is to cool off yourself and don't do anything stupid like trying to win her over by being uncharactoristically nice just cool off and do your own thing for a while this plan probably won't work either this plan probably only has a in chance of working but if you do anything else you have a zero chance of it working out so you're starting to realize that very soon you will most probably be single again it's going to suck i'm very sorry dood i really am fortunately months is a short period of time you should be over it in another tops what are you going to do then start looking for girls closer to your age preferably ones who have children themselves i think you'll get along better longer with someone in a similar situation as yourself that's my advice good luck buddy i'm hoping for the best for you Kodocha Avenue Q Jon Secada The Emancipation of Mimi Pitaten Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule The Fairly OddParents Humphrey Bogart Spice Girls Incarnations of Immortality Theory of conduct Pok__mon Live!
