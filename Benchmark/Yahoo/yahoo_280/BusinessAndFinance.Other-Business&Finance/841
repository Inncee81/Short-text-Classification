help please if i cancel my checking account and open one at another bank will it stop hour fitness from withdrawing money from my checking account there was this free program i signed up for and they gave me a year membership without me knowing i just discovered dissapearing from my account monthly and when i called them to find out why they said i signed up for a yr membership which i didn't and i can't cancel it exept i move to an area where they don't have centers so if i cancel my checking account and change banks will they stop withdrawing money from my account ps i don't own a credit card how would this hurt my credit score if i dont even have any credit built up if you did not sign up for a yr membership how did they get your bank account information it sounds like you signed something that gave them your bank account information and possibly your social security number with this information on a contract that binds you to a year membership when you stop paying them because you close the bank account they will start sending you letters saying that you owe them money when you ignore the letters they will forward the bill to a collection agency the agency will report you to the credit reporting agencies trans union equifax experian it will be added to your credit report that you have not paid a bill that you owe even if you do not have a credit card this will hurt your credit score if you do want credit someday either a credit card or a car loan or a mortgage etc the lender will pull a credit report on you and see evidence that you do not pay your bills this means that you will end up paying more for your credit if you mange to get approved ask the fitness company for a copy of the contract that you signed if they have it you're out of luck if they can't produce a copy of a year contract with your signature on it then contact your bank tell them that hour fitness does not have permission to be debiting your account and have them look into it however i don't think your bank would have started the debits if they did not receive something from hour fitness with your signature on it authorizing the debits good luck i hope this helps Credit card Credit score Internet fraud Debit card Bank Bond Student loan Mortgage Bank fraud Identity theft Schabir Shaik Trial Surveillance Cheque Annuity Insurance United States Postal Service Money TransUnion FairTax Credit union Plame affair Credit history Advance fee fraud The Amazing Race Credit card fraud Short selling Personal finance Interest Octopus card Poker jargon Credit rating agency Corporation Electronic money Password Child support Double-entry book-keeping Deflation (economics) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Article One of the United States Constitution Slot machine Social Security (United States) EFTPOS Debt consolidation Security (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Phishing Citigroup United Nations Government debt GSM services Life insurance Derivative (finance) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act National Kidney Foundation Singapore Great Depression E-mail spam Contract Winning Streak Gmail Fred Phelps Automated Clearing House Primerica Financial Services Taxation in the United States Wheel of Fortune Topps Experian Economy of the United States Pretty Good Privacy Smart card Financial services Currency Electronic toll collection Euro Satchel Paige Oil-for-Food Programme Temasek Holdings America Online World Bank Group Automatic teller machine Predatory lending ACORN Monetary policy U.S. public debt Digital signature Sears Holdings Corporation Financial markets Ocean's Twelve Irish Life and Permanent Monopoly (game) Money supply Hyperinflation George W.
