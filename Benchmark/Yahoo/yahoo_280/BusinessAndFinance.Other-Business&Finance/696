ask me any investment or business oriented question and i will answer it whoever is able to stump me will win i will use my knowledge from going to both wharton and harvard business school to answer them i will not use any outside sources such as wikipedia if you do not believe me then i do not care and you will not get points by win i mean you get points for the second guy i would recommed that you first get your spending under control if you need to just stop going to resturants and all that extra crap people usually do instead stay home conserve as much as you can eat smaller portions get more bargains that will save you a lot of money even if you have to sell your land and move into a smaller home but whatver you are more comfortable with depending on the loan perhaps that would be a good idea i remeber as a kid i took out a student loan and i put the money i got into the bank the student loan was around interest but the bank had so i made money if you ever read this businessweek article they talked about how going back to school was sometimes the worst thing people ever did just remeber before you do anything read what it says always get a fixed rate while in massage school get a secondary job which can help pay off get as many jobs as you can handle to pay of this send me an im for more info for the first guy i am sorry but i can not follow your incoherency your statment was a rhetorical question and even if a question i would not be able to answer it as it made no sense third person you are an idiot who has caved into cnbc's trap anything that they say has already happened and will make you no money jim cramer has an agenda i mean have you ever seen his stocks go up for more than one week after he recommends them i mean like i recommend apple in january and cnbc did not touch on it until a couple weeks ago all those books are stupidity i mean i never read any of those books besides the essentials for class and it worked well for me business is never by the book there are always twists and turns and dude it is mergers aquisitions not marketing whatever you just showed your stupidity m a is the most prestigous division of any bank in the world to the fourth person well a cpa is a certified public accountant and the cfa is a chartered financial analyst the cfa has a better career income for their credentials are harder to achieve well i cannot quantitatively because i do not have the keys for that but i will try r x i l x x f xi dx is the parameter risk functions of a estimator x observables x loss function l of course apple can survive in such a way because it causes amazing returns apple will be selling million iphones in one year and plans to be doing so for a while and then go to million by putting alot of money into research a product that everyone wants will be formed but of course with a lot of marketing too what do you mean by what can i say about patent laws could you please clarify so i can make an appropriate response there are credit default swap cross currency swap equity swap foreign exchange swap constant maturity swap yield curve inter bank swaps brokers variance swap interest rate swap total return swap and for the last question every business has risk but i would have to say selling lemonaide on the side of the street i am sorry sir that your idea of challenged is not following the strict guidlines of this website perhaps that is why you find yourself at the same mental capacity as me and feel you can question me you are a useless article in society who questions my intelligence because i would rather write this on this website rather than a forum perhaps you technology degree from devry college gives you the scrotal fortitude to talk this way ok i owe something like thousand dollars most of it is credit card debt some of it is now at because they raised the interest for some unknown reason at least to me my wife won't let me borrow against our land to reduce the interest i have to pay
