why do american auto manufacturers always want to set standards like japanese auto manufacturers just seems americans did so much better before we tried to do this totaly different culture and way of living and the big are slowly sinking when the japanese entered the us auto industry with quality products the american manufacturers could not stand up to them i think it was theory z or something like that where american companies applied japanese methods to working i wrote my sociology paper on this i was the only one to say it just doesn't work one because the japanese have a throw away work force wives are often used in times of greater need and then just not used at other times two japanese have different standards of working the proper japanese man will work all hours to prove that he is a good worker three they try to raise company togetherness with morning exercises and other plans four the japanese only have certain people that are allowed to rise to management the peons remain the peons none of this will work here we're just not going for it the best part of theory z was that japanese managers were rotated so that they knew all aspects of the job that is excellent as opposed to the bureaucratic way americans do business here managers rise to the height of their incompetance the japanese train their managers on all aspects of the job and you are required to perform the big three are sinking because they have allowed union wages to rise so high that they have priced themselves out of making an excellent product i'm all for unions but you have to remember that the job is only worth so much to the employer while i endorse buying only american products i have always bought japanese autos since they stopped rusting so quick and have had excellent cars i was so tired of cars that just had problem after problem want to hear about just how bad that lincoln was or the mpg i was getting and the dealer couldn't fix it i couldn't keep it on the road and found myself standing all alone in various places quite often i bought a nissan truck and would have just bought another but they have lowered their standards and are now competing at an american level so i bought a honda man did they ever lie about the mileage green rating my ss so i may be going american next time maybe that will help Tariff Ford Motor Company Unemployment Inflation Hybrid vehicle Sport utility vehicle Keynesian economics Tire Labour economics Battery electric vehicle Wayne Corporation 24 Hours of Le Mans Fuel efficiency Wal-Mart Honda Dodge Charger Capitalism Minimum wage Labor theory of value Software engineering Drifting (motorsport) Supply and demand Capital accumulation Outsourcing Economics Principal-agent problem Exploitation Microeconomics Auto racing Truck History of the United States (1918-1945) Poker jargon Bretton Woods system Business process reengineering Nissan Gross domestic product Efficiency wages Privatization Insurance Graduate school Toyota Camry Economic history of Japan Mazda Industrial engineering Henry Ford Management Education in the People's Republic of China New Deal Canadian and American economies compared Passenger car American Motors Volleyball Industrial Revolution Rail terminology Headlight Audi Chrysler Corporation Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd Deflation (economics) Welding Toyota Prius Auto insurance Mazda Miata Economy of the United States Sears Holdings Corporation Progressive tax Quality control Mercedes-Benz Call centre Apprenticeship Bicycle Competition Monetary policy Hyundai Motor Company Health insurance Sweatshop ISO 9000 De Lorean DMC-12 Workplace democracy Just In Time Carburetor Electronic commerce Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economic inequality West Side Highway Hard disk Chevrolet Corvette Ford Falcon
