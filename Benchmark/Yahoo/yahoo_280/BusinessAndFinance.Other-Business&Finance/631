am i bound legally by a term sheet sent via email but never signed i was considering doing some freelance web coding work on the side of my full time job the individual who needed the work done had emailed me a term sheet something i did not consider legally binding like a signed contract it listed the due dates amount to be paid and other details he would send it to me and ask me to approve it i did not sign anything well at the start of the project i realized it would be too much work for me to do on top of my full time job and i wrote a very respectful letter saying that i thought it best if i do not do the project while i acknowledge i was wrong and that i should not have spoken with them to begin with can i be sued on the basis of this term sheet given via email nothing in the term sheet says i was legally bound by its contents any help getting everything in writing is always recommended so both parties have a complete understanding and agree with the terms of the contract without it it's simply his word against yours and if problems occur it's very hard to decide who is at fault etc sending it via email is ok as long as it is printed on paper hard copy and signed by both parties without both people signing their signature to it there is no proof that either of you even saw it and anyone could have approved it although it is a legally binding agreement it still remains difficult to enforce in a court of law the reasons being that any true and legal document contract etc should be witnessed and signed by a lawyer or notary to make sure that the terms stated are even allowed in all documents such as yours there should always be a clause allowing for unknown circumstances extra costs delays changes etc and both should initial the clause in other words you both agree to the terms but you both are flexible term sheet is simply describing the requirements they want you to follow they can try to sue you but it would be costly and time consuming and they are not guaranteed to win Contract Notary public Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Treaty Public domain Appeal Article One of the United States Constitution United States Constitution Supreme Court of the United States Kyoto Protocol Public-key cryptography Estoppel Patent Computer virus GNU General Public License Divorce Salary cap Annuity Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Constitution of Ireland Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Legal research SCO-Linux controversies Copyright Standard form contract Insurance XML Same-sex marriage in the United States United States Postal Service Originalism Intellectual property Copyright law of the United Kingdom Medical prescription Arbitration Common criticisms of Microsoft Computer Cryptography Open access Spam (electronic) Leasing E-mail Australian constitutional law Due process Same-sex marriage in Canada Stopping e-mail abuse Mediation Royal Assent Offer and acceptance Trademark Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs OpenDocument Microeconomics Scots law International Criminal Court Freedom of speech Killian documents Legal aspects of transsexualism Life insurance Bush v.
