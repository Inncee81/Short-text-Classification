what should i do i was looking for a job for about months and finally my sister offered me a job with her ive been there for almost a month already but i think i want to quit since my sister is my manager it gets me real frustraded if i make a mistake and she tells me something usually if someone else tells me something i dont get so frustraded i dont know what to do and im making pretty good money but then again its a little stressful should i just tuff it up or quit and if i quit do you think she would be upset you need to seriously think on this if you had the same type of correction from a boss other then your sister how would you react feel the same or different if it's the same then probably not a good environment for you if you would react differently then you need to let go of your sibling rivalry and be a professional like your sister since she's your boss treat her like your boss with the same respect you would give your boss regarding work environment and responsibilities and such sometimes it's hard to leave the family ties outside the office front doors but if the both of you work together you may find you make a good team i wouldn't give up without an open discussion with her but remember she's your boss so give her the respect she deservees good luck EastEnders Pitaten Knots Landing Social rule Kodocha Friends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Alex Ferguson National Kidney Foundation Singapore A Course In Miracles One Tree Hill (TV series) Charmed George Costanza The Critic Unemployment The Shining (film) Fancy Crane Hal Trosky Eddie Guerrero George Steinbrenner Badly Drawn Kitties The Smoking Room Therion (band) Podracing Days of our Lives Carl Barks Boston Public The Ashlee Simpson Show David Beckham The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Everwood Plame affair Extreme Programming Dancing at Lughnasa Tekken characters Pok__mon Live!
