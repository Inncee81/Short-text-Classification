about new bankruptcy rules i understand that new laws are on the books about filing bankruptcy has anyone here tried to file recently and how did it turn out was it to your advantage did it help you wipe the slate clean of your credit problems or was it something you wish you had never done as the person above me stated it is required to attend credit education classed but there is a lot more to the new law as well but the new laws also eliminated the wipe your slate clean option it's all a re payment plan chapter where they garnish a certain amount out of your paycheck and pay all of the creditors that respond to the bankruptcy notice at a certain percentage usually it lasts up to years depending on the amount of debt you have you also have to get approval from the courts to obtain any credit or sell any assets you have it's very restrictive and takes a lot more work on the person who is filing's end the whole idea was to try and get people to be more responsible have to go through classes and actually repay some debt instead of just filing and forgetting about it Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bankruptcy Social Security (United States) Bankruptcy in the United States Bond Government debt Credit card Student loan Credit repair Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Debt Annuity Mortgage Economy of Russia Corporation Taxation in the United States Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code Estoppel Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal Enron Corporation Bretton Woods system United Kingdom corporation tax 401(k) Bank Divorce Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Supply and demand Interest Timeline of the Enron scandal Legal tender Stock Class action Social Security debate (United States) MCI Donald Trump Security (finance) Great Depression Law of value Developing countries' debt Gold standard Islamic banking Capital accumulation Dot-com Credit score Debt bondage Economy of India Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Derivative (finance) Fractional-reserve banking Tax SCO-Linux controversies Personal finance History of post-Soviet Russia Money Credit derivative Government of Maryland Bank fraud Marshall Plan Copyright Delta Air Lines Social rule Tertiary education fees in Australia Unemployment Flat tax Rose Garden Arena Public domain Incorporation (business) Patent Debt levels and flows Expert system Alexander Hamilton Leasing Tort reform Microcredit Publishing Computer virus Nuclear option (filibuster) Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Kyoto Protocol Federal Reserve 3dfx Inheritance tax Heather Wilson FairTax Mutual fund Northwest Airlines History of the United States (1918-1945) Mortgage-backed security Arturo Frondizi Federal Communications Commission Lawyer Unemployment benefit Collateralized debt obligation
