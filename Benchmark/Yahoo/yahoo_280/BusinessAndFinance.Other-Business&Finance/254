how do you motivate a co worker to work faster and more efficiently my boss gave our receptionist a very simple project input the contact info of about or so clients it's been two months now and the work isn't done yet i asked my co worker what's taking her so long to finish it and she gave me this dirty look she said that she's distracted from the phones all the time i'm thinking to myself regardless of how distracted you get all you have to do is type a client's name address phone and e mail it shouldn't take weeks to finish it motivation comes from within so you can't motivate anyone what you can do is provide an environment that encourages people to strive for success however in this case i'm not sure motivation is the issue what i'm reading into your message is perhaps a bit of jealousy you work hard but your friend doesn't and it looks to me like you're attempting to elevate your status from that of a co worker to that of a 'wannabe' supervisor if you need the information your co worker hasn't completed why not offer to help have you ever worked as a receptionist perhaps the expression 'walk a mile in my shoes' may be worth heeding BitTorrent Plame affair E-mail Social rule Extreme Programming Gmail Friends Domain Name System Cross site scripting Surveillance City of Heroes Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Computer CPU cache X Window System E-mail spam Password Graduate school Requirements analysis Instant messaging Principal-agent problem Spam (electronic) Surplus value Enterprise content management Master Control Program BlackBerry Milton H.
