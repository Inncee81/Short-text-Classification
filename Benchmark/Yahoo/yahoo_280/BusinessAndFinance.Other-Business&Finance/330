who is buying metalised fabrics metalized fabric is being used in the new carbon fiber aircraft for lightening protection with a metal aircraft the lightening usually does only minor damage and the lightening continues on its way to the ground something called the faraday effect where the electricity passes round the skin of the aircraft and does not electrocute the passengers carbon fiber has a conduction of some times less then aluminum and a lightening strike on such an aircraft without this protection would range from the interesting to disaster in particular it could cause fuel tanks to explode in flight from a lightening strike and your would be twinned with ground zero if it were made from carbon fiber it isn't but the new boeing is virtually percent carbon fiber in its fuselage and wing construction the metalized fabric is applied to venerable parts of carbon fiber aircraft for lightening protection and combined with the outer gel coat test sections are tested in a special laboratory that makes artificial lightening to test that the system works i hope this answerer your question and you find it useful Welding Lightning Boeing 777 Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Plastic Titanium F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Model aircraft Boeing 747 B-47 Stratojet Fixed-wing aircraft F-15 Eagle Carbon nanotube Aluminium Airbus A380 Cessna T-37 P-47 Thunderbolt Boeing 737 Homebuilt aircraft Explosive material Air safety Radio controlled airplane Carbon fiber Tier One Laser General Dynamics F-111 Solar cell Fire extinguisher Battery (electricity) Sewage treatment Carbon dioxide Boeing 787 Messerschmitt Bf 109 TWA Flight 800 Parachute Vickers Valiant P-51 Mustang Space Shuttle program Douglas DC-8 Bicycle frame Short Sunderland Airbus A320 Radar Jute Mooney M20 Heinkel He 112 Supersonic transport Pan Am Flight 103 Heinkel He 100 Eurofighter Typhoon 9/11 conspiracy theories Airbus Accidents and incidents in aviation Airbus A300 F-16 Fighting Falcon F-104 Starfighter Tank P-61 Black Widow Boeing Asbestos Fuselage A-10 Thunderbolt II Carbon Fighter aircraft Helicopter B-29 Superfortress Boeing 707 Cluster bomb McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Air Canada Aviation history Corrosion Violin Terminal ballistics Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ceramics Arc welding Tire F/A-18E/F Super Hornet Airbus A330 Seismic retrofit Faraday cage Sukhoi Su-15 Convair B-36 Vacuum tube Dassault Mirage III Diode Tesla coil C-5 Galaxy Gas metal arc welding Shroud of Turin Hair coloring Fiberglass Messerschmitt Me 262
