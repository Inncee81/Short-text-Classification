i have an item on ebay that has a bidder but the bid has not met the reserve the bidding on my item ends soon and it looks like the price of the item isnt going to go any higher will my item end and the current bidder pay the last bid as it stands or will they be prompted that they did not meet the reserve and told they did not win the item i am willing to remove the reserve if it means the item will be sold but if i could have my reserve price met i would rather leave it as is the reserve means they can't pay less and win if you remove the reserve now they may never see they won since they didn't bid enough and would have quit looking don't put reserves on if you want to sell for less someone else may bid even at the last few seconds but reserves make some of us not want to bid since we know we can't get a bargain Online auction business model Winner's curse Spades Sit-up Ltd Wal-Mart YUKOS Live 8 Airline Ra (board game) Contract bridge Final Fantasy XI The Smashing Pumpkins Topps Arbitrage Baseball Stars Variable pricing Bowl Championship Series Denis Law Procurement Diablo II: Lord of Destruction EastEnders Skat Shill Commodore International Professional wrestling match types Internet fraud Health insurance Economy of Russia $ale of the Century Taxation in the United States Network effect Malcolm Glazer takeover of Manchester United The Apprentice 2 Paul Hackett 500 (card game) GunBound Docklands Light Railway Bulk vending Bond Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Monopoly (game) Labor theory of value MG Rover Group Gold standard RuneScape economy Mutual fund Euro Federal Reserve GoldenPalace.com Argos (retailer) Monetary policy Jean Schmidt Supply-side economics Loss leader Salary cap Craps Market system Bumiputra Hyperinflation American Football League The Daily Telegraph BC Rail Bretton Woods system Neopets Warren Buffett Advance fee fraud Eircom Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005 Alex Ferguson Day trading Leeds United F.C.
