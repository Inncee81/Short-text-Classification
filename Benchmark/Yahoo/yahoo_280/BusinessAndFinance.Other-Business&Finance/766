i think my bank have been untruthful to delay the bank charges claim i'm making what is my legal position they sent me a letter saying they had not received the itemised list which i sent them i called into my branch who confirmed that they had they then assured me the matter would be dealt with as quickly as possible after another couple of weeks i emailed them and they said an offer letter had been sent out but this was apparently sent before the letter saying they couldn't deal with my claim because they didn't have the itemised list they said they'd send the letter out again but never did and now tell me they can't deal with my case due to the ofd case i think they deliberately stalled my claim by lying to me but it's difficult to prove and i don't know what my legal position is this is a very difficult situation unfortunately you did not follow the correct procedure as the itemised list of charges should of been sent to the banks head office and not to your local branch and should have been sent by recorded delivery so that you could prove they received it its very unlikely in these recent times that they would have made you an offer without you taking court action or taking the case to the financial ombudsman all you could do now is to resend your letter with your list of charges to the banks head office by recorded delivery eliminitating all doubt about whether when they received it this will also lock the date of your claim all claims are currently on hold but doing this will ensure that the matter will be dealt with as quickly as possible when the oft hopefully win the case i m sure it's not your fault that the incorrect procedure was followed unfortunately theres a lot of info out there on the web now that is just plain wrong even on some of the big well known sites this makes it a bit of a minefield for new claimants the biggest way to see if the information is incorrect is if it mentions sending talking to your local branch this is completely wrong as the local branches have no input in settling claims its all done at the banks head office and its a great way for your claim to get lost have a look at my site below which has detailed step by step guides to claiming all information has been tried and tested throughout the entire process so is known to be correct and has helped many people to claim back thousands from a range of banks and building societies the site is free to use Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Appeal Advance fee fraud United States Postal Service Telephone exchange Mediation Legal research Contract Scots law Killian documents E-mail spam Patent Theory of conduct Software testing Internet fraud Enron Corporation SCO-Linux controversies Scientology beliefs and practices Government of France Data retention CPU cache Credit card Financial audit Spice Girls Downing Street memo Consensus decision-making Surveillance Actor model Sponsorship scandal Public-key cryptography Information Technology Infrastructure Library Mumia Abu-Jamal Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Copyright Pretty Good Privacy Scientific method Debugging Compiler optimization Jumpstart 3rd Grade Mail Snooker M16 (rifle) Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Credit repair Philosophical skepticism Judiciary of Hong Kong Dog training Oscilloscope Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints E-mail X Window System Identity theft Annuity National Weather Service Sin City The Standard Speaker of the British House of Commons Chronology of the Ancient Near East Spam Prevention Early Warning System Monty Hall problem Bank fraud Corporate personhood SAS System Divorce SAT Florida Central Voter File Bah__'__ divisions Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) AMD Plame affair timeline Poker jargon Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 President of Ireland European Union Constitution of Ireland Theodicy Politics of Russia Corporate governance Act of Parliament Conspiracy David Blunkett 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Requirements analysis Nuclear option (filibuster) Nuclear weapon Anonymous remailer Israeli West Bank barrier
