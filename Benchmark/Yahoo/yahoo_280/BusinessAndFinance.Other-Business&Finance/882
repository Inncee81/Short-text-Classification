how do i get boss to do his job in the last few months he's left town right before major grant submissions were due now he's avoiding maybe minutes work needed now to prepare for a an evaluation meeting with our major funding source constantly we are begging for extensions and apologizing to other organizations because he can't bring himself to do work on time i've quit going to all but one meeting he schedules because he never shows any suggestions people don't change their behavior to fail without a reason and for your own good you need to find that reason it sounds like he is pulling away from the job that either means he is on his way out or the job is going away either way in his mind he has little reason to care there is a possibility that something in his personal life has pushed him to this point also but i would start with the current business situation you can't force people to do things they are not motivated to do but if you can find the reason for the lack of motivation you can often finds ways around it or help them work through it Social rule Infantilism Hikikomori Social psychology Evil Theory of conduct Health insurance Friends Socrates W.
