what does the federal reserve adding liquidity to the market mean and how does it help see yahoo news article http news yahoo com s nm bs nm usa markets fedops dc also interested in understanding any impacts that it has to other world markets interest rates and inflation an in depth answer will be rather lengthy so i'll just give you the basics when the fed adds liquidity to the system they are really adding more money they do this by buying t bills the federal reserve basically has an infinite account in order to buy these t bills when they buy the t bills the money for the purchase is credited to the bank accounts of the dealers since those banks can loan money based upon the total amount of money deposited with them they then have more available money to loan with more money available to loan this creates downward pressure on interest rates and eases the ability of individuals and businesses to obtain credit the fed has to be careful though they can't just add an infinite amount of money to the economy too much money added and the value of the dollar drops and inflation goes up it is even possible to devalue the dollar completely and have inflation in the hundreds or thousands of percent however a modest amount of monetary increase with a small inflation rate allows the economy to grow while not eroding purchasing power too much they can remove money from the system in much the same way they will simply sell some of the t bills they bought earlier and that in effect removes money from circulation Inflation Deflation (economics) Gold standard Bretton Woods system Money Hyperinflation Pound sterling Asian financial crisis Bank Federal Reserve Bond Interest Supply-side economics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Euro Fiat money Capital accumulation Economy of the United States Monetarism Surplus value Mortgage Central bank Microeconomics Gross domestic product FairTax United States dollar Debt Credit card U.S. public debt Keynesian economics Deficit spending Government debt Fractional-reserve banking Economy of Pakistan Arthur Laffer Privatization Money creation New Deal Gold as an investment Taxation in the United States Foreign exchange market International Monetary Fund Reaganomics Wealth Social Credit Free trade Citigroup Economy of Ghana Mergers and acquisitions Insurance Economics Economy of India Anarchism and capitalism Say's law Money market Tariff Economy of Romania Tax Economy of El Salvador Supply and demand Economic history of the United States Capitalism Economy of Brazil 1973 oil crisis Economy of Chile Marshall Plan Economic relations of Japan MMORPG Exchange rate Canadian and American economies compared Economy of Zimbabwe Primerica Financial Services Security (finance) Hong Kong dollar Economy of Nigeria Corporation Personal finance Student loan Savings and loan association Investment bank Economic history of Spain Banknote Bank fraud Derivative (finance) Currency Predatory lending
