can i call usps to track my order i ordered something from san diego i live hours from san diego i ordered my item like days ago i figured it would've been here by now how long more do i have to wait when i enter my tracking number it says there's no info on my item can i call them i was in a similar situation a few months ago and i can tell you that calling the usps directly is useless they can't give you anymore information than is on the website the only thing they will tell you is to wait a certain period of time and if you still haven't received your package to file a claim you're probably better off contacting the sender and finding out when if the item was actually shipped since a tracking number can be obtained before the item is physically mailed Internet fraud Domain Name System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Mail fraud Data retention Gmail USS Terry (DD-513) Getting Things Done ZIP Code USS Volador (SS-490) FidoNet Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Post office USS Sea Devil (SS-400) E-mail USS Whale (SS-239) USS Wilkes (DD-441) USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Information Mouse (computing) USS William B.
