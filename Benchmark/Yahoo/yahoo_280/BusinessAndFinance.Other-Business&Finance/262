sell food to supermarket i make chocolate darn good chocolate how do i sell it to supermarkets that vary in size from several to hundreds of chain stores please provide link if possible thanks david david i have been in the supermarket business for years the hardest part of getting into any market is supply and demand cost and space when i decide to bring in a new product i usually go to my master price guide and choose the item from that list from which i get from a warehouse profit margins in candy and chocolate are decent but i don't make any profit from something that is overpriced under marketed and those are usually the items that i am looking to replace however if you make a lot of chocolate or even a moderate amount and can sell it to a retailer at above your cost to make it and i can turn around and sell it for the same percentage markup i would consider doing business a few things to try always bring a sample of the product and enough to take care of the people that will be influenced ie the store manager assistant store manager the grocery manager and the like be assertive not aggressive in pursuing space have a plan on how you will market the product most store management personel like free demonstations on friday's or saturday's with your product the best time to approach management is now through september when we have to get all of our holiday items figured out also have a plan in place for how often you will be in the store to merchandise your product and don't expect the store to pay you for that time unless it is figured into the cost of the product and also don't expect a check every week or up front right away the way you get paid is when your product sells or through invoices that are paid monthly good luck and if you have any more questions let me know Supermarket Wal-Mart Retailer Tesco Bulk vending J Sainsbury Microeconomics Electronic commerce Neopets Economics The Apprentice 2 Tax Fry's Electronics Food Unemployment Aldi Monetary policy Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Supply and demand Economy of Russia Inventory Illegal drug trade Economy of the United States Capitalism Mail fraud Law of value RuneScape economy Hyperinflation Loss leader Price discrimination Shopping American individualist anarchism Monopoly Berkshire Hathaway Inflation Anarchism and capitalism Organic food Chocolate Filling station Opportunity cost Wall Street Topps Cost accounting Financial services Ice cream Dollar store Tesco Ireland Ra (board game) Department store Externality Just In Time Value added tax Woodward's Cooperative Commodore International ASDA Bank Oil-for-Food Programme Marketing Neoclassical economics Insurance Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Biodiesel Productive and unproductive labour Enterprise resource planning United Kingdom corporation tax Costco Nuclear power Jewel (supermarket) Keynesian economics Mutual fund Publishing Woolworths Limited Dairy Publicly funded medicine Shoppers Drug Mart Asian supermarket Political economy Eaton's Convenience store Citigroup Vending machine Islamic banking Target Corporation Sam Walton Management information system Economic calculation problem Amway Apple Computer Commodity markets Labor theory of value Advertising Pricing Labor-power Management
