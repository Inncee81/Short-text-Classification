whats the purpose of a rebate im wanting to buy a laptop and the prices are like but after a mail in rebate whats the point in giving them your money if youll end up getting it back either a they hope that you will not send in the rebate and that they will get to keep the money b a manufacturer who makes a rebate offer knows that you will be more likely to buy if a manufacturer just lowers the price charged to the store the store might not lower the price charged to you so you might not save anything the manufacturer cannot control the price charged to you for a laptop or most other things unless you buy it directly from them Laptop Rebate (marketing) IBM PC compatible Video game crash of 1983 Value added tax Price discrimination Commodore 64 Hard disk Best Buy Internet fraud Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Warren Buffett Tax Wal-Mart EMachines Solar power Floppy disk Sales promotion Desert Eagle First-sale doctrine Sears Holdings Corporation Mattress Stock Short selling Shopping Surveillance Commodore International Mutual fund Digital photography Gold as an investment GSM services Monetary policy Hyperinflation Aldi Common Agricultural Policy Bond Bank Bluetooth AMD PE ratio ATI Technologies Student loan Loss leader Mortgage File system Gross domestic product Ford Motor Company E-mail spam Arbitrage CPU design Supply and demand Inventory Computer Wildcat cartridge Illegal drug trade Verizon Wireless Teen Girl Squad Wintel RuneScape economy Modem Commodity Pricing Radeon Apple II family Mail fraud Mac OS X Sun Microsystems Capitalism PlayStation 3 Tariff Wind turbine Deflation (economics) Hewlett-Packard Insurance Airline Gmail Central bank American individualist anarchism PowerBook Dow Jones Industrial Average Camcorder Nintendo 64 ITunes Music Store Privatization TiVo Acorn Computers Musical Instrument Digital Interface Lithium ion battery Philatelic investment IPod Price Cyrix Solar cell USB flash drive Inflation Full stop Stock market Universal Serial Bus
