e bay question on feedback this is something i just don't get so maybe someone can explain it to me i have bought quite a few things off e bay over the last three years and not once have i ever gotten feedback until after i left feedback first why is this i always make sure to pay through paypal within an hour of winning i've been verified through paypal i'm legit why is it so hard for people to give feedback based on promptness of payment i mean as the buyer that is my sole responsibility to pay anyone tia feedback hostage most sellers don't consider a transaction to be complete until the buyer leaves feedback indicating that they are satisfied too many sellers have left positive feedback when they received payment only to later get scammed by the buyer who claimed they didn't receive the item that it arrived damaged or even worse the buyer buys and item pays with paypal using a credit card and receives the item they then file a claim with paypal saying the credit card was stolen when in fact it was obvious they made the purchase with their own card so most sellers do not leave feedback until after they know the item has arrived in good condition and the buyer is happy not exactly the way the system was set up to work but it is what it has become i still leave feedback when i receive payment but the vast majority of sellers do not if i ever get screwed though i will stop that practice Internet fraud Phishing Contract Microeconomics Supply and demand Extreme Programming Economics Real estate broker Credit card Islamic banking Surveillance Electronic commerce Hire purchase Commodity markets Capitalism Price discrimination Liberty Dollar Warranty Topps Anarchist economics Something Awful Gold standard Something Awful Forums Money Futures contract Option Surplus value Mortgage Conveyancing Possession Oakland Athletics Discounts and allowances MapleStory Tax Electronic money Oil-for-Food Programme Ethical consumerism Reputation management Feedback Taxation in the United States Arbitrage IBM PC compatible B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Short selling Credit derivative Bulk vending Minimum wage FairTax Micropayment Anarchism and capitalism Auto insurance Pyramid scheme Technical analysis Call option Dot-com ITunes Music Store Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Subscription business model Mail fraud Gross domestic product Advance fee fraud Health insurance Marketing Dividend The Amazing Race United Kingdom corporation tax Insurance Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Theory of conduct Monetary policy EFTPOS The Wealth of Nations Poker jargon Neopets Annuity Plame affair Hyperinflation E-gold Steam (content delivery) Monopsony Security (finance) Atari ST Derivative (finance) Publicly funded medicine Monopoly Fair market value Mouse (computing) Blackjack Wal-Mart
