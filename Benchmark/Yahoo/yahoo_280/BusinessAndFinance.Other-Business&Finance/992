is it ridiculous to ask management to help with transportation my girlfriend doesn't have a car and the management of her firm hired her over a year ago with knowledge of this well the person she was riding with recently decided out of the blue that she won't be giving her a ride anymore and apparently no one else at her work will give her a ride even those that live very close to us what i'm curious about is if you think it's ridiculous unethical or otherwise pointless for her to ask or expect her managers to assist in her getting to work please if you will answer this question with the assumption that my girlfriend is a valuable employee thank you for your responses we don't live in a large city by the way and public transportation sucks yeah ok let's drop the expect part because that's obviously not their responsibility but as the one guy said it's not unheard of for employers to help under certain situations i don't think that she should expect it but i also don't find it ridiculous unethical or pointless at all for her to ask if she is a valued employee and they knew her situation going in and they realize her situation now they will more than likely be happy to help her out in any way that they can perhaps they can recommend someone in the company for carpooling that she doesn't even know about if she is valuable enough maybe they will even foot the bill for a personal service such as a daily taxi etc i have even worked for a smaller company where management gave certain employees i e only the valued ones in need of course payroll advances to buy a car and then just deducted a small percentage of their subsequent paychecks to make up for it unless they are complete a holes some management types are but most are not i am sure that they will do whatever they can to help her and certainly will not chastise her for it be sure that she goes in somewhat humble with the approach of seeking advice not demanding a solution Ethics Outsourcing Microeconomics Poker jargon Plame affair Avenue Q Meaning of life Expert system Annuity Public transport Social Security (United States) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Taxicab Supply and demand Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wal-Mart Sudoku Labor theory of value Search engine optimization Boeing FairTax Health insurance Shaggy dog story Management Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Friends Keynesian economics New Zealand Police Call centre Stock Tip Monetary policy Gender-neutral language Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Daredevil Economics Taxation in the United States Strategic management Extreme Programming A Course In Miracles Karl Rove Coercion GunBound Advertising 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines FedEx Corporation Life insurance Flat tax Epistemology Clear Channel Communications Theodicy EastEnders Social rule The Apprentice 2 Ambulance Freeters Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Divorce Best Buy Privatization Salary cap Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Philosophy of mathematics Monty Hall problem Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism One Tree Hill (TV series) Milton H.
