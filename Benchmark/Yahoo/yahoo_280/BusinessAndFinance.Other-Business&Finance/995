what are the keys to successful team management i've just been put in charge of a team and feel a bit overwelmed i realy don't want to mess this up it is a very rare opportunity i believe the big challenge is to get them to work as a team many people are individually driven and the team thing is not always easy put the tasks out there and understand what the members different talents are how those talents contribute to getting the task done and how to get them to communicate effectively with each other the most detrimental situations i observed were when there were slackers soooo others ended up carrying a disproportionate portion of the load bosses that fail to correct the slackers cause negative attitudes with the productive employees so analyze your tasks and the talents of your team be on the watch for deadbeats and acknowledge the productive ones Strategic management Theory of conduct Beavis and Butt-head The Apprentice 3 Extreme Programming Rational Unified Process Workplace democracy Transactional analysis Requirements analysis Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Leadership Reliability engineering Newcastle United F.C.
