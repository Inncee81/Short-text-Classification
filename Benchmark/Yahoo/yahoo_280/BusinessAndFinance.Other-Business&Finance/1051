i need to make us quick any ideas on how to make that money besides getting a job or selling stuff on ebay im a teen so something easy there are a lot of different ways to make money as a teen and just because you're a teen doesn't mean you can't get a job either my first job was at arby's when i was years old help out anyway possible and talk to your parents or whoever that you're helping about your goals and show them that you're willing to work towards them couple different ideas get a job if you're young visit your school office and pick up a child labor form and have your parents fill it out you can even get out of school early and earn school credit for having a job it's summer anyways you should have time for a job if you need the cash there's nothing like being young and making an extra a week or so when beforehand you were lucky to get that on christmas wash the car every week for a normal amount of mow the lawn set a normal rate and figure out with your parents how often the lawn needs to be mowed once a week twice the bigger the lawn the more can be bargained with if it's a smaller lawn then chances are you have neighbors that could probably use getting their lawn cut too change the oil and do a weekly pmcs preventative maintenance checks and services make a check list of everything you can think of about the car the headlights the horn the windsheild wipers the radiator the tires the oil the transmission fluid etc read the manual about the car that is in the glove compartment to get more ideas there's probably a checklist already in the back of that manual then go through the car and let your parents know when their windsheild wipers need to be changed out and offer to install them if you don't know what you're doing or need help get your dad to help you there's nothing wrong with that no one said you have to do everything by yourself this isn't only an extra opportunity to make some extra cash it'll get you extra points for when you want to buy your own car which is why i'm guessing you need the grand to begin with and it'll prove that when you do get your own car that you will be responsible and take care of it and your parents will be that much more compelled to help you meet that goal learn a trade like web design if there's anyone in your family that could use a website for their business it costs hardly anything to make one if you're mom's a real estate agent or something like that a website could help earn some extra cash it'll also add some bullets to your resume when it is time to get a job pack everyone's lunch before you go to bed and put them in the fridge this will save your parents some extra money that they'd probably spend on buying themselves and you lunch everyday instead why not give that extra money to you and take a lunch from home if you're any good at computers there's probably a good handful of people that you know that aren't very good at computers spend some time with your grandparents and teach them how to use e mail surf the web and basics like that if they're computer isn't up to snuff clean it up run some adware and antivirus programs and try to fix whatever problems that might exist it's summer time and people have their pools open go around the neighborhood and see if anyone needs their pool clean search the internet and learn up on how test the water how to add chlorine and how to do shock treatments make it a normal schedule like every tuesday and thursday morning at a m go to your neighbors' house and skim it before they're even out of bed let them know that every other week or so that they need to have their pool shocked and charge a normal amount to do that when it's time to close the pools make sure you're available to help them when they are ready to close it these are just a few ideas of what you could do just put some thought towards your goals and brainstorm ideas on how to accomplish them and then execute Microeconomics EastEnders Inflation Insurance Wheel of Fortune Poker jargon Social rule Daylight saving time Extreme Programming Surveillance Education in the People's Republic of China Winning Streak Computer virus Theory of conduct The Apprentice 2 Malcolm in the Middle Windows XP Manual transmission National Football League Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Cruising (maritime) Avenue Q Neopets Wal-Mart Great Teacher Onizuka Betting (poker) Floppy disk Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Debugging Carburetor 2000 Australian Grand Prix Game programming Mutual fund $ale of the Century The Adventures of Pete & Pete Chevrolet Corvair Good Times Grandview, U.S.A.
