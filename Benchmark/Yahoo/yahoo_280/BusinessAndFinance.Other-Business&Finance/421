how do i narrow my search on amazon com with products that are sold by amazon and not another company i shop at amazon com but they have so many different other merchants i can never seem to narrow products down to what amazon sells sometimes i like to purchase items from a single vendor thanks if you look to the left where you can narrow your search by category brand etc one of the options is seller select amazon com and you'll only see what is available through them sometimes you have to narrow your search more specifically i e you won't see it when you just search for television but you will see it if you're looking for televisions in the electronics category Amazon.com Electronic commerce Online shop Jeff Bezos Warranty Bulk vending Trademark Legal research Publishing Insurance Sears Holdings Corporation Security (finance) Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Spyware Commodity Intellectual property Textbook Gramophone record Sinclair Research Ltd Amazon River Credit card Wal-Mart Bestseller Barnes & Noble Octopus card Subscription business model Appliance Enterprise content management Internet fraud Tesco Online marketing Monopoly Powel Crosley Jr. Option Price discrimination Advertising Best Buy Sales Mozilla Firefox Network effect Management information system Product (business) RKO Pictures Auction Mac OS X Pharmaceutical company Contract QVC Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.
