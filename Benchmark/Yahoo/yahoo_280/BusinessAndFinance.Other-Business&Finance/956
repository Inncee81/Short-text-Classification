tuition reimbursement benefit loss and salary negotiation i work in the admin department at a small company in seattle i am coming up to my month review and have heard all praises so far plus i was told that they were seriously considering promoting me likely in an admin tech management position so all is pretty good in terms of my placement here when i was hired my offer letter gave me a starting rate at k plus a k raise at my month the big thing that made me accept this position was the tuition reimbursement program which is also in the offer letter today one of my managers came to me and said that the vp just decided that the tuition reimbursement program should be for employees that have been with the company for a minimum of years my tuition books would be around k per year since i can't really afford to pay for it myself it was a major attraction getting me to come to this company how should i approach this in terms of my upcoming review and the potential negotiations on the promotion since they sound pretty impressed with your work you could mention it in the review and tell your boss how disappointed you are that the program was discontinued since it was a big reason why you took the job in the first place don't threaten to leave let him read between the lines it's not really economical for them to pay per year in education benefits for someone making not much more than that in annual salary they have the legal right to change benefits and actually to change salaries up or down Student loan Affirmative action Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Graduate school Unemployment benefit Insurance Unemployment Tuition Credit card Education in Germany Education in the United States Warren Buffett Food Stamp Program Nurse Economic inequality National Kidney Foundation Singapore Wal-Mart Scholarship Microeconomics Contract University of Michigan Academia Salary cap Life insurance Professor Value added tax Paralegal Estoppel Schabir Shaik Trial Capitalism Trade union Efficiency wages Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Hong Kong Corporate governance Software engineering 401(k) United Kingdom corporation tax Social Security (United States) National Football League Community college Bob Rae Primerica Financial Services Employment Worldwide ERC Health insurance Open access Kyoto Protocol Compensation of employees Software patent debate Workplace democracy Marketing Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Management 2004-05 NHL lockout Minimum wage Advertising Satchel Paige Tennessee General Assembly Spam (electronic) Employment in Hong Kong Plame affair Mutual fund Apprenticeship Poker jargon Sandy Koufax Price discrimination Salary Rick Santorum Apple Computer Oxford English Dictionary Microsoft Tax Northwest Airlines Michael D.
