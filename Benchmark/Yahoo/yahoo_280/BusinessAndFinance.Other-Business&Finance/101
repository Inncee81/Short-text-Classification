what my son should do in a case of corruption in the company he started working as a trainee in a oil company in houston tx and he supposed to be for months in training and after weeks they fired him the persons who did that have a long history of stealing and corruption one of them has been fired from many companies due to frauds his son stole in the company dollars they didn't gave him a warning they need to give him at least in order to fired him but the reality check is that they are my husband worst enemies not open but everyones knows it they fired a secretary who complain of sexual harrassment the other secretary saw him stealing the ez tags that you use to pay tollway and he takes it everyday to his vehicle and put it back to the companies vehicles how it is possible that the people who are in higher positions don't know about all this how you can contact those people in order to stop the corruption and the abuse of power there how the law protect the employees texas don't have unions please help he has college education fully bilingual in the conference with them hie made very clear of the poor management from their part one of them is canadian and buys from canada all the nuts and screws and bolts and in samll amounts due to this the company loses million of dollars because they failed to the clients that the job is not on time for the lack of tools and stuff like that the canadian guy thinks that the united states is a banana republic that we don't do tools and he gets everythinf from his country how can we contact the ceo of this company to pay attention to all that madness it is a bunch of families affected for those men who behave like a mafia and control everything there somebody has to stop them my son is single and he can get another job but the men and women who support the families has been affected terribly please give some advice of how can we make a difference god blees you all his father works there and the secretaries who were involved in the problems talk about it after what happened to my son they call us and said the human resources don't work for the employees benefit and well being nothing happened after that there is really nothing you can do or should do if this company is really being run the way you describe it will run itself into the ground soon enough you go on to describe what you consider corruption and abuse of power which includes an employee stealing toll bridge passes how do you know that this isn't an agreed upon perk for this specific employee one of my employees has a gas card that i have asked him to be discreet about using and you also complain about a canadian manager ordering parts from a canadian company because he doesn't trust american manufacturers this isn't an example of abuse of power this is just how they have decided to run their business you said that your son brought all of their poor management issues up in a conference with them that's probably a major contributing factor in his dismissal adding in the fact that he has talked about sensitive company issues the company loses millions and has unhappy customers due to untimely jobs with his mother is a good example of him not putting the company's interests above his own whether that is a legitimate reason for firing him or not is irrelevant you sound like you want revenge for your son that's understandable but totally inappropriate and is a waste of your energy you tried to make it sound like you are more concerned for the other employees the ones with families to support they too can look out for themselves they can quit and get other jobs or they can move to a state that does allow unions where they can make all the demands they want to forcing their employers run their business the way they think it should be run there are laws to protect employees but i haven't heard you describe a single illegal act aside from the sexually harassed secretary being dismissed and she can hire an attorney sue the company and retire comfortably if this is the case again it's not your problem or responsibility Plame affair Theory of conduct Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Divorce Poker jargon 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Microeconomics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Internet fraud Fathers' rights Unemployment Citigroup Credit card Wal-Mart Shaggy dog story Capitalism Insurance Life insurance Privatization Trade union Appeal Gender-neutral language Rick Santorum Judicial review Tax Social rule Apple Computer Enron Corporation Lawyer Domestic violence Milton H.
