i live in upstate ny where the house prices have been falling for the last yr do u think they will continue to fall my question is should i buy now or wait more yr and save more money i don't want to wait if the prices are expected to go back up again i have read numerous reports that housing prices are expected to continue to decline for the next two years obviously you want the luxuries of buying in a buyer's market but at the same time you want to buy a house when it's most cost efficient my advice to you is what i am practicing myself constantly watch the market and save as much as you can when the decline starts to really slow down or the market starts to heat up find a house you really enjoy Capitalism Economics Arbitrage Inflation Futures contract Publicly funded medicine Supply and demand Price discrimination Stock Mortgage Monetary policy Day trading Technical analysis Microeconomics Privatization Rational pricing Wal-Mart Bond Life insurance Keynesian economics Option Asian financial crisis Health insurance Investment bank Deflation (economics) Mergers and acquisitions CPU design Mutual fund Annuity Monopoly Personal luxury car Internet fraud Economy of Russia Insider trading Real estate broker Gold standard Ford Motor Company Trade FairTax Solar power Gold as an investment Commodity Oil depletion Political economy Enron Corporation Derivative (finance) Monopoly (game) Financial markets Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Sears Holdings Corporation Experience curve effects Call option IBM PC compatible The Apprentice 2 PE ratio Surplus value Black-Scholes Labor theory of value Marketing Trading Places MMORPG Economic relations of Japan Stock market Gross domestic product Anarchism and capitalism Value Implications of peak oil Management information system Sales force management system Michael Milken Bulk vending Monopsony Temasek Holdings Toyota Prius Public good Euro Ethical consumerism Capital asset pricing model Capital accumulation Yield curve Predatory lending Criticisms of socialism $ale of the Century Margin (finance) Topps Labour economics Rational expectations Money supply Sport utility vehicle Penn effect Craps Prices of production The Sun (Hong Kong) Overclocking Put option Tesco Mainframe computer Externality UK Singles Chart Supply-side economics
