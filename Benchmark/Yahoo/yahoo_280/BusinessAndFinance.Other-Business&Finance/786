can i get some advice about business ethics i do free lance work for an internet company and was recently contacted by one of our clients requesting to work with me directly instead of through the company i free lance for working with me directly would save them money and i would make more money from them than i am making now but i would still free lance for the company i am with is this ethical i was contacted completely unsolicited by this client and i'm not under contract in any way with my current company if i take this client away my company loses thousands of dollars every month in fees i don't want to burn my bridges but i don't want to lose this client what should i do i'm new at this self employed thing at least you stopped to consider whether or not you should do this or not i think that was a good choice and i think this is a very legitimate question i agree with most of what i've read but i'd like to add this if you start taking on one client where will it stop what if another one asks you to do some work for them in principle you are breaking rank with your company by going down this road which isn't always a bad thing and could be a good career move in essence that might be the start up of your own one woman company now i don't know if that's what you want and if you don't feel ready to start up your own company i don't think you should but if it is something you'd like to do it's best that you be open and honest about it give it some thought but if you feel like you ought to be loyal to your company that's what you should go with one client isn't worth breaking ties with your employer even though you are freelance unless it's a career move you feel is best for you at this time Theory of conduct Poker jargon Ethics E-mail spam Avenue Q The Amazing Race Economics X Window System Contract bridge Advance fee fraud Goodness and value theory Insurance Knots Landing Plame affair Internet fraud Traumatic incident reduction Bank The Amber Spyglass Outsourcing Freelancer Social rule Friends Milton H.
