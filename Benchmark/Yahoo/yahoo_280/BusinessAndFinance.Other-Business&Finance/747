is paypal a safe way to send money to person i don't know i mean if there is a possibility that he would rob my account know it can seems stupid but i don't know much about it it is the payment method of choice for all transactions on ebay which actually owns paypal as mentioned in responses above your personal data will be encrypted and kept on paypal's server and will not be revealed to the merchant receiving the money just be sure you're not talking to a fake paypal i'm not sure but i believe that there is an option which requires paypal to confirm any payment by email before charging you similar services are being launched by google and amazon but i understand that these are redirect services that involve redirecting the user to google amazon s servers to complete the payment before returning to the original site by comparison paypal offers an integrated solution that allows users to remain on the original ecommerce site i've never tried this but i understand that in addition to merchants with their own websites you can use paypal to pay anyone with an email address or phone number instantly PayPal Internet fraud Phishing Online shop Something Awful E-mail E-mail spam VeriSign Data retention Skype Advance fee fraud Windows XP Whois E-gold Credit card Windows 2000 Spyware United States Postal Service Voice over IP Spam (electronic) Mozilla Firefox Electronic money Denial-of-service attack Western Union Neopets Plame affair MSN Messenger Octopus card Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Public-key cryptography Hotmail EFTPOS Ajax (programming) Pretty Good Privacy Surveillance AppleTalk Customer relationship management Bank fraud Virgin Mobile Database management system Google Internet privacy Facebook (website) Opera (web browser) Annuity Anonymous remailer Global Positioning System Lotus Notes Email authentication BitTorrent Life insurance 4chan Transmission Control Protocol Computer Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Web hosting Bluetooth Credit card fraud Insurance RuneScape cheats Google search Secure Shell Micropayment 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Proxy server HTTP cookie Search engine optimization Webcomic Haunted Apiary Tax Mail fraud Google Maps Redundant array of independent disks MapleStory Internet Relay Chat Google Talk Domain Name System MMORPG Liberty Dollar Microeconomics Web analytics X Window System Novell NetWare BlackBerry Common Unix Printing System Instant messaging Stock
