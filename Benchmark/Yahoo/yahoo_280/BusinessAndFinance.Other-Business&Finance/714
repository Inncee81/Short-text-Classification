i bought lots of items from booker cash carry but i lost my bill sheet so is there any way i can get another bill sheet please help i need that bill to claim back v a t so what can i do to get another bill sheet i used to work at that cash and carry and you are in luck they keep all invoices and file them by date invoices from the past few weeks will be on had so all you need to know is the date you visited and the approximate time you went through the checkout this will help them greatly although their system can tell when you were last logged in it doest mean that was the last time you shopped there these invoices should be kept in the cash office but you should ask the person on reception and they will clarifiy this for you they will then photocopy your receipt for you if it was a few months ago then you should ring them in advance as these invoices are put in a huge box and usually put in a filing room or 'up in the air' put on a pallet and stacked ontop of one of the isles either way you will get a copy of your receipt Mail Financial audit MapleStory Animal Crossing Cash register RFID Mail fraud Security (finance) United States Postal Service Internet fraud Wheel of Fortune Downing Street memo Surveillance Aldi FairTax The Contender (television series) Oplan Bojinka Big Brother UK series 6 Mac OS X Electronic commerce Online shop World Championship Wrestling Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping United Kingdom corporation tax Xerox Automatic teller machine Accounts payable $ale of the Century Credit card Wal-Mart Tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Killian documents Taxation in the United States Best Buy No frills Tom DeLay Medical prescription Secretary Mac OS X v10.4 Point of sale Glacier UK Singles Chart The Amazing Race Computer printer Eric Bischoff Paper size Data retention Money supply Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act SCO-Linux controversies Eddie Guerrero 2001 anthrax attacks World line Peter F.
