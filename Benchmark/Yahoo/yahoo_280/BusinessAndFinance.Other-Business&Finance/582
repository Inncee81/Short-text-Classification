i have art pieces that i'm looking to copywrite does anyone know how to copywrite and if it costs money in response to the guy saying you don't have to do anything i'm guessing then whenever you look at any product and it has tm or c next to it that means nothing as well people just put that up there themselves without legally doing anything that doesn't make sense dude first thing is the word is copyright second they are automatically yours you do not need to do anything end of story if you want to take photos of them with a date on them post them to yourself by recorded mail and keep the envelope closed and sealed until such times as any potential dispute may ensue highly unlikely though any art literature agent that hears of someone running around claiming their works is 'copyrighted' to them will laugh in your face as it is a sure sign you are an amateur pretending to be a professional United States Postal Service Copyleft Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MAME SCO-Linux controversies Copyright Wheel of Fortune Sampling (music) Mail Public domain Plame affair Fan fiction Doomtown 2001 anthrax attacks Time Out of Mind Mixtape The Silence (The Twilight Zone) Friends Insurance Postage stamp Copyright law of the United Kingdom Trademark Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Midnight Run Advance fee fraud Anne Rice Intellectual property Trusted computing Search engine optimization Life insurance Negativland Apple Computer Surveillance Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Shit Copyright infringement of software Theory of conduct Free Republic Fair use Sony Corp. of America v.
