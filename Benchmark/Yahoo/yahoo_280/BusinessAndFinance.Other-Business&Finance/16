i need your help i went to cdi a private college to check out a program i was interested after writing a test the admission representative asked me if i wanted to attend the classes and i said yes then she made an appointment for me to see the financial planner she asked me to bring to register plus my social security social insurance number i told her that i would bring the after i meet with the financial planner that day when i went to my appointment with financial planner i had to go to the admission representative s office first before meeting with financial planner she asked me to sign a contract which i refused and she kind of became mean to me and called me a nervous person and said to me i can t help you as i see you are hesitating i said i need to speak to financial planner and to my parents before i sing anything the tuition is too much and i m not sure what to do it seems like she is pushing me and making decisions for me now i have an appointment again to register on monday but b i register i want to go and sit in that class and see how the instructor is teaching i heard he is kind of old and got an accent how can i tell them i want to sit in that class for only min i really need to find out everything before i take further steps is that the only college that you have around where you live that lady was not supposed to push you to sign anything before you even talk to a financial planner the purpose of talking to a financial planner is to find out whether or not you will be able to afford it she can't say that she can't help you if you don't sign a contract no she can't you can ask the financial planner of why she keeps on insisting you to sign a contract if the planner doesn't help you with that and gives you a run around instead then if you want you can report it to bbb better business bureau if i were you i would look into a different school if they already treat you that bad and you are not even a student yet how worst do you think they will treat you once they get your signature good luck Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Contract Graduate school Affirmative action Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tuition Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Security (finance) Condoleezza Rice Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban GED Little Britain Plame affair Cornell University University of Michigan Schabir Shaik Trial Community emergency response team Supreme Court of the United States Article One of the United States Constitution Avenue Q Student loan Canadian Senate Town meeting Sydney Riot of 1879 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Paul Martin American and British English differences Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Education in Hong Kong Insurance Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education in Romania 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sharon Tate SAT Government of France College admissions Appeal Education in Australia Health insurance U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Independent school (UK) Rosa Parks Grade (education) Operation Market Garden Ocean's Twelve Collision detection Community college Danish Folkeskole Education Life insurance United States Naval Academy Hearsay Columbine High School massacre Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Citigroup The Ashlee Simpson Show Mutual fund University of Bristol Annuity Martin J.
