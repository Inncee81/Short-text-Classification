how to ship a whitetail deer bust taxidermy from colorado to california what is the most efficient method i am not sure of the measurements but it is approximately lbs i am just beginning to collect taxidermy pieces and i have no clue as to how these shipments work i would assume i'd need to place insurance on it and ship it with packaging foam peanuts and fragile labels etc thanks for any help you can provide don't ship fedex they do not offer insurance on ground packages they ask you the value of the package and charge you extra if the value is over but they do not offer insurance google fedex insurance and you'll see a lot of complaints from people who found out the hard way that they don't insure packages if the overall box size is less than girth height you can ship it ups and insure it dhl is cheaper than ups but tend to cause more damage from my experience the only other option is greyhound which is super cheap but they will have to pick up at the greyhound station for a deer i would wrap the antlers with bubble wrap and then wrap the entire thing with foam king size foam mattress pads are great and cheap packing material and then fill any voids in the box with the packing peanuts i wouldn't use just packing peanuts Mattress United States Postal Service United Parcel Service Plastic Strap-on dildo Insurance Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping Upholstery Bed (furniture) Floppy disk Explosive material Brewery Health insurance Butter Bulk vending Computer Internet fraud Sand casting Solar cell Collecting fossils Peanuts Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Polyurethane Radio controlled airplane PlayStation Portable Cardboard Microeconomics Mail Auto insurance Gradius Seismic retrofit Peanut butter Dodge Charger Xbox 360 Loudspeaker Taxicab Tesco Casting Christo and Jeanne-Claude Jute Life insurance Contract STS-114 Peanut PC Engine Soap bubble Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Brassiere Objective-C Light-emitting diode Naval mine Star Trek Customizable Card Game Bread Bubble wrap Polystyrene Bubble Bobble Laptop Bong Nuclear weapon design Unreal Gambling Tobacco smoking Illegal drug trade Wal-Mart Model aircraft Redundant array of independent disks Topps Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Laser engraving Wind power Teller-Ulam design IBM PC compatible Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Cocaine Copyright Unemployment ZIP Code Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mercury Cougar Cable television The Humble Guys Publicly funded medicine Manual transmission Darius (arcade game) Fire extinguisher Deer Twin Peaks Space Shuttle Enterprise Poker jargon Paragliding Mouse (computing) Violin Donovan Kit Kat Nuclear power
