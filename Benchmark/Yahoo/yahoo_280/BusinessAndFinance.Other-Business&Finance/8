is another financial crisis going to hit asia i am a filipina living in the philippines i worry about this subprime lending woes now happening in the u s and its effect on the lives of ordinary filipino citizens i remember eating just milled corn instead of rice and dried fish instead of fresh fish with instant coffee instead of milk for more than a month that was at the height of the asian financial crisis i wish this situation now in the u s will not again cause us to eat the same kind of food for a long period of time nobody knows how this is going to turn out but the united states economy is completely based on debt and the quality of that debt and whether or not it will be paid back is in doubt right now if something bad happens your local economy will certainly feel reverberations it's always a good idea to keep some extra rice and canned foods around anyway maybe you should buy a little extra each day and start to make a small supply in case times get rough for you at least you and your family will be protected in case of the worst but this goes for everyone not just you that said the problems now are probably more like large ripples on a pond rather than a tsunami buy some extra rice anyway Asian financial crisis Deflation (economics) Great Depression Economy of the United States 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Economy of Africa Philippines Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economy of Taiwan Money Filipino American Rice Famine Southeast Asia Cuisine of the Philippines Economy of Pakistan Debt Gold standard Dairy Economy of Brazil Economy of the Philippines Economy of Argentina Cha chaan teng Tofu Hyperinflation Boston and Lowell Railroad Ramen Unemployment Agriculture Globalization Cuisine of Denmark Soup Free trade Economy of Fiji Economic relations of Japan Predatory lending Sushi Curry Korean cuisine Commodity markets Microeconomics Government debt Food storage Inflation RuneScape economy History of the United States (1918-1945) Money supply Fiat money Coffee Economy of Thailand Economy of Mali Economy of Asia Atkins Nutritional Approach Great Depression in the United Kingdom Chinese cuisine Economy of Venezuela Weather lore Economy of Russia Poker jargon Economy of Indonesia Bukidnon Marshall Plan Cuisine of Laos Cuisine of Brazil Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Economy of Haiti Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Filipino people Esp__rito Santo Economics Agusan del Sur German cuisine Economy of Cuba Monetary policy Bengali cuisine Milk Cuisine of Africa Asia Breakfast cereal Fecal incontinence Cheese Vegetarianism Food preservation Privatization Tsunami CPU cache Green Revolution Externality Economy of Macau Futures contract Ayala Corporation Jewish cuisine History of the United States (1980-1988) Nutrition Imperialism in Asia Economy of India Local food
