how much does it cost financially to be a free mason hey that's a great question unfortunately it isn't so easy to answer because since freemasonry has no central governing organization the fee structures vary with constitution to constitution and lodge to lodge i know conspiracy theorists will be appalled to hear that there is no central governing body of freemasonry shooting a hole in all of their world domination theories i can only speak of my state and my lodge here in massachusetts in the u s a my lodge was chartered by paul revere in and is one of the oldest lodges in the us we just recently voted for a dues increase to keep up with the cost of meeting in our facility when i joined the dues were a year this had remained unchanged for about years and shortly thereafter we raised it to and are now in the process of increasing them again to a year that said we meet in one of the most beautiful masonic buildings on prime real estate right in the middle of the city lodges in more rural communities wouldn't even dream of charging so much so right now what a new member of our lodge would pay is this a one time initiation fee of which goes towards educational materials and administration fees then the yearly dues will be a year after that each member contributes per dinner depending on the venue with meetings a year that would be per year add to that any transportation costs or other donations not covered from dues and it could be around a year but i would say that would be a maximum that said this is a figure for my lodge and i am very sure that we are at the high end of the spectrum for us lodges so i would say that chances are if you are talking about a lodge in the us you are talking about a figure considerably less than the ones i have given here if you have any other questions about freemasonry please feel free to contact me Freemasonry Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Students' union Corporation Government of India Solar cell Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Student loan Head of state Poker jargon Ordo Templi Orientis Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Politics of the United States Taxation in the United States United Nations Mutual fund British House of Commons Microeconomics Plame affair U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Parliament of the United Kingdom Silvio Berlusconi Canadian House of Commons 9/11 conspiracy theories Tax Eye of Providence Australian Labor Party Political subdivisions of New York State Barrister Parliament of Canada Labor theory of value United States Postal Service Illuminati Prince Hall Public good Anti-Freemasonry Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Same-sex marriage in Canada Voluntary Student Unionism Town meeting Vladimir Lenin Cable television Constitution of India Canadian and American politics compared Insurance Education in England Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis Government of France Class in the contemporary United States Theory of conduct Unreformed House of Commons Tuition Betting (poker) Economics Appeal Democracy Politics of the United Kingdom Welding Rosicrucian Albert Pike Inflation Publicly funded medicine Social Security (United States) Economy of Belgium Estates-General of 1789 Hillary Rodham Clinton Politics of the People's Republic of China Margaret Thatcher Corporatism Bill Clinton Public education Economy of India Mortgage U.S. presidential election, 2008 SAT Snooker Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Government of Australia Enlargement of the European Union Advance fee fraud Mother Teresa Renormalization Copyleft Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia United States Senate Australian constitutional law Constitution Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji)
