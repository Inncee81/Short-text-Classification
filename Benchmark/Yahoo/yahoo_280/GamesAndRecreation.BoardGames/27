do you prefer checkers or chess has that changed over your lifespan both games are good chess is obviously a more complex game of people who dismiss checkers as boring do so because they don't know the rules almost nobody understands that in checkers capturing is not optional if you can capture a piece you must do so therefore a big part of the strategy of checkers is to force your opponent to capture in such a way that it weakens his position this is why most people who claim that checkers is too boring end up getting their tails whipped by a good checker playing program they set up this elaborate plan and then see it destroyed because the program forces them to make a capture they'd rather not make and their position falls apart they try to make the move they'd planned on making and can't figure out why the program won't let them do it so both chess and checkers are good strategy games chess is a lot more complex but checkers can get a little tricky as well if one actually plays by the rules i've always preferred chess but both games are fun for different reasons Draughts Backgammon Computer chess Chess variant Chess strategy and tactics Chess terminology Chess Reversi Chinese checkers Rules of chess Go (board game) Arimaa Fischer Random Chess Board game Xiangqi Zillions of Games Ruy Lopez Sample chess game Baroque chess Draw (chess) Shogi Check (board game) Martian Chess Endgame Richard's Play By Email Server Advanced Chess Chess problem Cannon shogi Solved board games Antichess Game theory Algebraic chess notation Kasparov versus The World Shatranj Yari shogi French Defence Chess piece Chu shogi Maka dai dai shogi Dai dai shogi Blindfold chess Tai shogi World Chess Championship Poker Game Ko shogi Fairy chess piece Tori shogi Deep Blue Game mechanic Paul Morphy Chu-Han contention Judkins shogi Pawn (chess) Taikyoku shogi Tafl games Wa shogi Hand shogi Bitboard Chess problem terminology Nimzo-Indian Defence Dominoes Computer Go Stalemate Abstract strategy Pin (chess) Prisoner's dilemma Rules of Go Go strategy and tactics Checkmate Janggi The Game of the Amazons Ra (board game) Dai shogi Tenjiku shogi Three-dimensional chess Threefold repetition FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 Whale shogi Punctuation (chess) Slav Defense Hex (board game) Microshogi Heian dai shogi Garry Kasparov Chessboard Risk (game) Minishogi Circe chess Stratego Correspondence chess Poker jargon Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Aron Nimzowitsch Tic-tac-toe The Game of the Century
