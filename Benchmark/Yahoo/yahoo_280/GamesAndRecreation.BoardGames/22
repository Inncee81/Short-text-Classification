defense against e i am about a rated player most of the time i play the caro cahn but playing the main line bf all the way through seems to give white a nice space advantage can anyone tell me information about the nd line instead and then playing ngf after that if this doesn't seem to be that effective could anyone name a new defense i should learn against e the alekhine seems a little risky the french defense has the big drawback of the light squared bishop the sicilian defense leaves a weak pawn on d most of the time although i have started learning the dragon which at first seemed to be the most reckless defense but it seems to work pretty well i just want another defense besides this though thanks i'd take the french or the sicilian over the caro kann all the time the problem is the caro kann does not give white much of an advantage but it is there because of the nature of the opening you usually don't see the wild complications of the sicilian or the sharp play of the french the caro kann is a very solid opening that means the black position has no structural weaknesses white can exploit that is probably why you like that opening most openings aren't like that you have to give white something so you can get counterplay through the complications and the imbalance of the position you're worried about the light squared bishop in the french most people are but it's not hopeless there are several ways for it to escape black attacks on the queens wing and places a knight on c covered by pawns on b and d if this strong knight is taken after dxc the bishop goes to c and has a wonderful long diagonal the bishop gets to d and b and is exchanged off for whites good bishop black breaks the white centre with c and f so the e pawn can advance if not the bishop can get to e and g so you can't sit back and relax you must counterattack the white centre untill you get play the c bishop may not be very active at first but it's a usefull defender of the e pawn i can't say very much about the weak pawn on d in the sicilian because objectively it is weak this is usually rather difficult to exploit the bishop on e usually defends it and you can always play a to prevent a knight going to b you should look at a concrete variation yourself and you'll see the pawn is not what white is after like i said the french and the sicilian are sharp replies if you play very calmly like you might be used to in the caro kann you'll be overwhelmed i don't really play the alekhine defence but i do know it's a quite solid reply it gives white more space but black has a solid position maybe this suits your style better also the normal e is a very solid reply but you'll never know what white plays next edit i was thinking if this really isn't what you were looking for why not try the pirc defence all the black pieces can get out and are developed pretty quickly you can even vary your setup using either d and e or d and c it's not as sharp as the dragon but still there are some pretty wild variations like the austrian attack ok there are no other standard replies for black besides the scandinavian centre counter this gives a similar centre as the caro kann white gets the pawn on d and black has no pawn on the fifth row and puts some pressure on the halfopen d file if you want to try something totally offbeat look online for ideas of eric schiller or joel benjamin good luck Sample chess game Slav Defense Baroque chess Fischer Random Chess Chess Cannon shogi Endgame Yari shogi Alekhine's Defence Pawn (chess) Queen's Gambit Declined Xiangqi Judkins shogi FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 Pirc Defence Dai shogi Caro-Kann Defence Chu shogi Taikyoku shogi King's Gambit Tenjiku shogi Computer chess Tai shogi Bishop (chess) Chess variant Checkmate Queen's Gambit Accepted King's Indian Defence Dai dai shogi Minishogi Immortal game Heian dai shogi Rugby union positions Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Ko shogi Rules of chess Algebraic chess notation Chess problem terminology Maka dai dai shogi Chess problem Semi-Slav Defense Poker jargon The Game of the Century Wa shogi Arimaa Shatranj Philidor Defence Fast bowling Glossary of American football Gambit Queen's Gambit X3D Fritz Petrov's Defence American football strategy Theory of conduct Chess piece Team Fortress Classic Battle of France Pin (chess) Center Counter Defense Helpmate Kyoto shogi Giuoco Piano Capablanca Chess Baseball Football (soccer) positions Danish Gambit Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Eight queens puzzle Fairy chess piece Descriptive chess notation Backgammon Strap-on dildo Castling Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Contract bridge Professional wrestling throws Stalemate Computer virus Chessboard Grimshaw Gameplay of StarCraft
