what are the different opinions of grandmasters on learning chess openings i'm no grandmaster but reading what they have to say suggests to me that they think learning openings is very important in the opening of a game it is very difficult to think ahead like in the middle game or end game because there is still many different possibilities grandmasters learn openings so that they know each one's advantage and use them appropriately and also be able to defend against the opening of the other player by using its disadvantages since they know the openings by heart they dont need to think and they can use the time saved later in the middle game and end game which cannot be learned like the openings the same thing also goes for chess ai artificial intelligence usually the programmers gives the ai an opening database to work with so that it knows how to properly attack and defend in the early game quickly Chess strategy and tactics Computer chess Chess Ruy Lopez Chess opening Endgame Chess terminology Fischer Random Chess Xiangqi Kasparov versus The World World Chess Championship Nimzo-Indian Defence Shogi French Defence Arimaa Paul Morphy Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Anatoly Karpov Sample chess game Garry Kasparov Computer Go Tony Miles Immortal game Viktor Korchnoi Viswanathan Anand Volleyball Advanced Chess Two Knights Defense Mikhail Botvinnik Frank Marshall ELO rating system George Koltanowski Aron Nimzowitsch Mikhail Tal Deep Blue Match of the Century Paul Keres Chess prodigy Backgammon Susan Polgar Alexander Alekhine Magnus Carlsen Reversi Maia Chiburdanidze Board game Internet Chess Club Bobby Fischer American football strategy Contract bridge Reuben Fine Pawn (chess) Chess problem Go (board game) Slav Defense Team Fortress Classic Peter Leko Judit Polgar Artificial neural network Artificial intelligence William Lombardy Draw (chess) Correspondence chess Punctuation (chess) Chess tactic Game theory Unreal King's Indian Defence Tiger Woods Vasily Smyslov Arthur Bisguier Data mining Akiba Rubinstein Mikhail Chigorin Hydra (chess) Emil Sutovsky The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Ksawery Tartakower Joseph Henry Blackburne Chu shogi Chess variant Alexander Kotov Samuel Reshevsky Gambit Cannon shogi Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Rules of chess Queen's Gambit Water polo Larry Evans Propaedeutic value of Esperanto The Game of the Century Esperanto as an international language Svetozar Gligori__ Baroque chess Chess (musical) Gata Kamsky Bishop's Opening Game
