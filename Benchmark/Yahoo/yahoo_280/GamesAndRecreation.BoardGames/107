anyone feel like a retard because they can't checkmate someone and then get picked off systematically ever feel like the dumbest strategist in the world because of this as if you were the king of a nation you'd be the dumbest king because your people would all be dead you failed in conqering the other country and will be known in history as the loser who couldn't checkmate the other king the other king who isn't necessarily that good but just won but you're the one who'll be stigmatized your whole life because history is just so cruel they won't give props to how you fed and clothed the populace nope when it came down to it you lost in that one decisive victory fuuck all to the rest you lost in that one battle boo i am a paranoid monarch play chess a lot more often and you should set smaller goals sort of rather than jsut going for checkmate yes its good to spot a move checkmate sequence but ive gotten to play vs and its much more important to pick of pawns and use even that small of an advantage to force your opponent to lose checkmate is only in the endgame and you shouldnt go for it directly opening your goal should be to develop your pieces scholars mate and fools mate are very bad openings because of this midgame try to take your opponents pieces get yourself into a good position to checkmate endgame this is where you actually start looking for checkmates sometimes its just a piece advantage that allows you to win many times ive eliminated quite a few of my opponents cirtical pieces rook knight bishop while keeping my own thus beating them in that fashion but practice more record your moves and replay your games after you finish even if you won you can even look over famous plays with major grandmasters like gray kasparov or bobby fischer good luck and most important have fun Chess strategy and tactics Checkmate Chess opening Computer chess Kasparov versus The World Shogi Ruy Lopez Sample chess game The Game of the Century Fischer Random Chess Chess variant Chess problem Garry Kasparov Immortal game Rules of chess World Chess Championship FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 Knight (chess) Pawn (chess) Arimaa Anatoly Karpov Chess problem terminology Check (board game) Cannon shogi Judkins shogi Helpmate Yari shogi Shatranj King (chess) Bishop (chess) Chu shogi Viktor Korchnoi Paul Morphy Norway national football team Tai shogi Dai shogi Match of the Century Chess piece point value Algebraic chess notation Punctuation (chess) Minishogi Microshogi Magnus Carlsen Bobby Fischer Caro-Kann Defence Sicilian Defence Antichess Descriptive chess notation Advanced Chess Draw (chess) Rook (chess) Dai dai shogi Deep Blue X3D Fritz King's Gambit Kyoto shogi Vasily Smyslov Two Knights Defense Computer Go ELO rating system Playoff Heian dai shogi Circe chess Viswanathan Anand Smothered mate Pin (chess) Deep Blue - Kasparov, 1997, Game 6 Zillions of Games Backgammon Wa shogi Hand shogi Pittsburgh Steelers Reversi Deep Blue - Kasparov, 1996, Game 1 Slav Defense Tori shogi Go (board game) Endgame study Boris Spassky Svetozar Gligori__ Castling
