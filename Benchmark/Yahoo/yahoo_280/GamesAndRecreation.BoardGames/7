what is the fastest way the checkmate using knights and a king verses a king as has been noted two knights and king can't force checkmate against a lone king oddly enough though in certain positions it is possible for the two knights to force checkmate against king and a single pawn the strategy is to have one of the knights blockade the pawn while the other knight and king gradually force the other king into a corner eventually the king is stalemated in the corner and the knight that has been blockading the pawn rushes to the corner to force checkmate because the pawn is no longer blockaded it will be advancing to its queening square while the second knight moves over to assist checkmate if the pawn queens too soon the strategy fails so it's critical for a knight to blockade the pawn as far away from the queening square as possible this is a complicated subject with an extensive literature Checkmate Chess terminology Endgame Shogi Chess strategy and tactics Chess Baroque chess Rules of chess Chess opening Kasparov versus The World Knight (chess) Stalemate Sample chess game Algebraic chess notation Cannon shogi Nimzo-Indian Defence Pawn (chess) Check (board game) Chess variant Tai shogi Shatranj Fairy chess piece Computer chess Xiangqi King (chess) Yari shogi Helpmate The Game of the Century Heian dai shogi Chess problem Queen (chess) Judkins shogi Wa shogi Ruy Lopez Microshogi Tenjiku shogi French Defence Descriptive chess notation Chu shogi Dai shogi Minishogi Pin (chess) Bishop (chess) Immortal game Rook (chess) Smothered mate Kyoto shogi Chess piece point value Sicilian Defence King's Gambit Taikyoku shogi Dai dai shogi Chess piece Zillions of Games Arimaa Eight queens puzzle Circe chess Maka dai dai shogi Portable Game Notation Lucena position Draw (chess) Fianchetto Ko shogi Hand shogi Castling Slav Defense Paul Morphy Through the Looking-Glass Endgame study Two Knights Defense Deep Blue - Kasparov, 1997, Game 6 Grimshaw FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 Antichess Parcheesi Chessboard Claude Elwood Shannon Janggi Bratislava Castle Solitaire Martian Chess Wars of the Roses The OMAC Project Queen's Gambit Accepted Gambit Fire Emblem Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Final Fantasy IX Computer Go King's Indian Defence Four Knights Game Queen's Gambit Declined Caro-Kann Defence Elizabeth I of England Dog agility Retrograde analysis Naboo
