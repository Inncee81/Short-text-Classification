what is the best brand of hair colour revlon l'oreal garnier clairol henna i want to dye my hair dark brown or reddish auburn but i don't know the best brand i want a brand that won't dry out my hair won't damage my hair and the colour should not fade as fast like in weeks all my friends say to use henna because it's the best brand and it does not dry or damage your hair thank you your friends are wrong henna is the most riskiest and the one that you have no idea what the outcome will be and do not buy a boxed kit of hair color what you need to do to have the best hair color is to buy the tube of color and the developer separate and let me explain why they only work on of the people because think about this what if a red head a blonde a brunette and a black hair person all go into the store to buy that same box of hair color which one of the them is going to have the correct color when finished only one of them why because it matters what color the hair your start with as to how the outcome will end up on the universal hair color chart that all companies go by there are a base colors of hair level is black and level is white hair only of them will get the proper outcome with a boxed hair color because each level needs a different formula to have the correct outcome t h e r e f o r e there is a in shot you might get the right color that is not very good and not the numbers i would want with my own hair how about you i am a colorist stylist from malibu calif and would be very glad to help you get the right color and developer so that you will not have any of the problems you want avoid it sounds like it will be fairly simple only i need the color your hair is now before anything is put on it you most likely have a sally's beauty supply in the town you live in they are in every city practically in the usa there is a new line of professional color made by clairol called premium creme pro line now it depends on the exact color but for an example if you want reddish auburn level hair you should buy tubes of color and mix tube of one with tube of the other buy tube of r and one tube of n mix of r red plus of n light brown stir add ounces of volume developer apply with brush leave on minutes the exact directions are written out on the box of color just as if you had bought a kit so it tells you exactly what to do and you should follow that i have some of the color here so i just looked at the box to give you their directions that is the professional way to color if you want more specific help i will be glad to give it to you as a colorist we used to call boxed hair color kits job security because people would always trash their hair and then come to us to get it fixed after using boxed hair color kits and that is why hair stylists never say anything about them i'm retired from hair and have a hair blog now so i write about hair and am a chemist now tackling the problem of trying to get everyone to stop using the boxed kits is a mission of mine it's a fairly easy method of working around the kits and then more people will not have to go through the heart ache of trashed hair hth email me with any questions if you want Hair color Color Hair coloring Tattoo Red hair L'Or__al Computer Horse CPU cache The Amazing Race Pretty Good Privacy Henna Fischer Random Chess Carburetor Color theory Billiards Frogman My Little Pony Color blindness E85 Photography Cigar White (people) Blond Thermal power station Pottery Theory of conduct Textile manufacturing Guinea pig Barbie Inkjet printer Cascading Style Sheets Marching band Inheritance (computer science) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Light-emitting diode Annuity Software testing Surveillance Leather Drawing W.I.T.C.H.
