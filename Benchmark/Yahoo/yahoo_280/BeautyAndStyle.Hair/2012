need to cut hair layers or no i fried my hair a couple months back used hair dye that basically bleached my brown hair orange and then dyed over it my hair has been abnormally dry for a while now i need to cut it to get it healthy again it's currently a few inches above my armpits and layered when i cut my hair to shoulder length should i keep the layers or not i have thick wavy hair that tends to poof when short i rarely straighten my hair so the layers dont really look that great right now they seem to take away my natural curl im just worried that my hair will poof too much when shorter so your hair a few inches above your armpits thats uh basically your shoulders hun yeah get layers because then you get rid of more burnt hair i guess if you'er going to cut your hair might aswell go abit shorter remember though that they have lots of thign out there that might could give your hair some life until its grown enough to have it ow you really want it Hair Haircut Puberty Coir Leaf Kodocha Equine conformation Hair coloring Pachypodium bicolor Textile manufacturing terminology Blond Katana Kimono Knife Pubic hair Textile manufacturing Hair color The Ashlee Simpson Show Emo fashion Dandruff Havanese Guinea pig Fur Scoliosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mullet (haircut) Leather Depilation Professional wrestling throws Dog Ammolite Wood Finnish Spitz Afro textured hair Pachypodium ambongense Skinhead Dead Sea Bacon Menstrual cup Photographic paper Social role of hair Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scapula Dye Pottery Keeshond Timmy Turner Cross-country skiing Hypertrichosis Acne Carbine Shotgun Menstrual cycle Pachypodium baronii Radiation therapy Death rock fashion Gramophone record Hamster Flood geology Baldness Shirt Brush Password Shampoo Evidence of evolution Mattress Compact disc Beard Maize Skin Swimming Desert Marge Simpson The Rasmus Tarantula Philip J.
