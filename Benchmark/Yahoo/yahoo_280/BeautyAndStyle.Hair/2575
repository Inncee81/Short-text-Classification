cold someone please answer this hair question im getting it done in about weeks or maybe ut that doesnt matter anyways i wanna do something different i decided not to dye my hair more red cuz i have to pay for that but im sick of my bangs and i dont wanna cut it at all im just getting it trimmed cuz i like my hair long and its not even how long i want it yet heres a pic of what i have http s photobucket com albums p xorachel xo action view current jpg its a little longer than what you can see like at the top of my boob but i kinda wanna get like pink mini streaks through my hair what do you think and if you have anything like layers or suggestions the style has to be easily pulled into a ponytail and if you have any ideas could you include any pictures it would be nice but you dont have to please dont say anything about how white i am how i need to get my eyebrows done ik im irish cant tan at all and im getting my eyebrows done when i get my hair done i was kinda sorta also thinking about blue but im more girly than anything so i wanted pink i was choosing between those two colors what color would look better if you think pink wont look good i absolutely love pink hilights i think they look better in blonde hair though but they would look good with your skin tone depending on what color pink you get i would suggest going to a salon to get them done because you usually need to lift bleach the highlights and then deposit the pink tone i really think you would look great with some side swept bangs with your face shape it would add a lot of style without cutting your hair off also if i was coloring it for you i would color your hair back to it's natural color because you have some different tones going on on the ends of your hair the pink wouldn't look the best with all the colors you have at the ends you could get the ends trimmed a little bit and then just get some long layers put back in it to give a little movement to the style and you'd still be able to wear a ponytail by the way i think you're very pretty with the color of your skin and eyes Haircut Hair The Ashlee Simpson Show Dragon Booster Jon Secada Hair coloring The Emancipation of Mimi Skinhead Light-emitting diode Hair color Textile manufacturing Color Kodocha Blonde on Blonde Death rock fashion Cantonese opera The Marshall Mathers LP Baldness Opportunity rover Blood on the Tracks The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Atomic Kitten Blond Skin Pubic hair She Loves You Comanche Madonna (entertainer) Diamond Oakland Athletics Theory of conduct McFly Tattoo Joker (comics) Stereoscopy Drawing Tarantula Cosmetics Depilation My Little Pony Sinfest Upholstery Potato Human skin color Professional wrestling throws Totally Spies!
