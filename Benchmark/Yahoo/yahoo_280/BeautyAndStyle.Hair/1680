should i go blonde my hair is shoulder length very coarse and dark brown with auburn highlights i'm getting older and it's getting harder and harder to keep the gray in check has anyone gone blonde so that the gray blends in better if so how light did you go and how natural did it look on you i've been thinking about doing this for a long time now and have just been working up the nerve any advice would be very much appreciated i didn't think to add that but since i've been coloring my hair since i was i don't really know how much gray i have however when the gray roots start showing there's a lot most likely in range you need a color with lower maintenance having a dark brown base color is a huge contrast to grey hair how grey is your hair percent or more blonde is a great option for grey haired women if you get it highlighted with a really light blonde a darker blonde and a brown it ends up blending very nicely the problem is getting the dark hair color out of your hair first you need to go a a good salon for this they will need to strip your hair to get it light enough to do the lightest blonde that you want make sure to have a good consultation with the stylist you choose and even collect some pictures of examples you like communication is key Hair color Color theory Hair Dragon Booster Drawing Cinematography The Ashlee Simpson Show Blond Pubic hair Color blindness Dog Bock Wood Horse Human skin color Depilation Melanin Laser hair removal Hair coloring Keeshond Bob and George Color Coffee White (people) Classical music era Liquid crystal display Link (Legend of Zelda) Double Dragon Rum Zone system Sunglasses Black (people) Gray Wolf Charlie Brown Captain Scarlet Reservoir Dogs Digital photography Blood on the Tracks Eye color Trigun Opportunity rover Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Physical attractiveness W.I.T.C.H.
