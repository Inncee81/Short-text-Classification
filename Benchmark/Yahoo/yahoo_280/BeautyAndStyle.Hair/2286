i think i burned a chunk of my hair with a flat iron i have a chunk of my hair that i noticed today looks fried i use the straight iron every day because i have thick and coarse hair i wash my hair every other day and let it dry a lot before i blow dry it i do color my hair and have recently but i only do the roots i don't know when i did this but i think it was from the straight iron the chunk of hair is my shortest layer can i repair it without having to cut it until it grow a little more i just cut my hair a little above my shoulders and feel like i have probably used my straight iron a little more than normal i don't leave it on my hair for long but maybe it was a little damp help i have been a hair dresser for years and i would suggest a flat iron with a ceramic blade they are not damaging and a spray you can pick up at any sallys called beyond the zone tuen up the heat obviously you are using your flat iron with out any hair protection before you do this damp hair will not break off when you flat iron it it will sizzle a lot but will not break off this product will allow you to use a flat iron up to degree's and will not hurt your hair there is no way to fix this if it is at your shortest layer than it will blend in if your hair looks fried than you will have to get a redkin product called extreeme fule it will repair any damage you have to your hair it is costly and i think you can only get it at a salon but it does do the trick it is a conditioner that needs to go under heat dryer to be effective and will cure your broken hair it may take applications to fully kick in but it does repair the damage Casting Knife Leaf Textile manufacturing Glass Wok Corrosion Pottery Coffee Haircut Equine conformation Drill bit Fire fighting Fire extinguisher Paint Mercury Atlas 6 Welding Tire Haloalkane Cookware and bakeware Woodworking Items in the Metroid series Friction STS-114 Wood Boat building Diving suit Skin Tofu Upholstery Seismic retrofit Sun InuYasha (character) Bacon Tank Potato Plastic Ham Trichome Shampoo Desert Brewery Scapula Hair coloring Spontaneous human combustion Pubic hair Hot dog Dandruff Baldness Campfire Aluminium Air conditioning Hay Spark plug Psoriasis Stem cell Forge Diode Swimming Preston, Minnesota Violin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Professional wrestling holds Fan (implement) Iron Carbon nanotube Kodocha Chlorophyta 613 mitzvot Aspartame Aerial (dance move) Jute Tarantula Transformer Sub-Zero Dune Lighting Peat Rice Three Stooges Mummy Gilding Kryptonite Masonry Blade Oh My Goddess!
