how can i describe to my colorist exactly what i want and get exactly what i want i moved to a new town and have been to several fancy expensive salons who continue to trash my hair i had no problems at my old salon i figure maybe i have been using the wrong lingo i'm a white gal i have naturally dark dark brown hair and like to wear it a very pale wheat shade not platinim though i tell the colorist this and that i dont want any yellow i use the blue shampoo between colorings and i usually bring in a photo of myself when my hair looked right so why is it these folks look at me like i'm crazy and snd me out on the street with yellow hair it seems pretty common for brunettes to go blond i know it must be hard but dont they teach this in hair school also the lighting in the salons is such that the hair wont look too yellow until i leave the salon so i leave thinking they finally got it right my hair is in really great shape and is very smooth so thats is not the reason for the bad color why is it so hard for an expert to dye dark hair blond if you see someone with a good dye job ask where they got it done that's how i found my hair guy Hair color Diamond Color theory Blond Dragon Booster Hair coloring Hair Blood on the Tracks The Ashlee Simpson Show Leather Color Red hair My Little Pony Blue Pysanka Race of Jesus Diamond enhancement W.I.T.C.H.
