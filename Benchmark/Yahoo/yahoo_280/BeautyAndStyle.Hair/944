do you guys know of any straightening shampoo taht actually works i really would apprecaite it if you guys would help me out on this one please tell me where to buy it and if it actually works because i am tired of using my straightner every day i have naturally curly hair and i absolutely hate it unfortunately the curls are what makes my hair easy to style so there's no chance that i'll try chemically straightening it or the japanese hair straightening method i'm no expert on hair but i try to be an expert on my own hair i use bed head control freak shampoo and conditioner which is primarily used for frizz control and hair straightener bed head doesn't make my curls die but it does relax them and that's what straightening shampoo's generally do but certain shampoos and conditioners work differently on each individual i suggest that you speak to your hairstylist about that one also i have to mention this you don't want to flat iron your hair every day even if it is ceramic although ceramic straighteners are better for you hair they'll still cause split ends yuck i've switched from using a straightener to using a blow dryer personal preference good luck Shampoo Haircut Afro textured hair Hair Aerial (dance move) Dreadlocks Casting Sento Japanese tea ceremony Hair conditioner Equine conformation Dandruff Three Stooges Good Morning, Vietnam Baldness Cosmetology Pottery Aikido Ranma __ characters Curling Urusei Yatsura Hair (musical) Phoebe Buffay's songs Marilyn Monroe Social rule Textile manufacturing The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Guinea pig Theory of conduct Ceramics G-Man (Half-Life) Polyethylene terephthalate Wig (hair) Great Teacher Onizuka Surveillance Rei Ayanami Hair coloring Physical attractiveness Human Yu-Gi-Oh!
