how soon can i dye over bleach i bleached my hair and it turned orange i washed my hair and tried dyeing over the bleach and my scalp started burning horribly and i had to wash it out after it being on for about minutes when is it safe to redye i'd be dyeing over it with a demi permanent medium brown if i were you i would wait hours i know its rough but your poor scalp needs time to recouperate and to build up some scalp oils to protect itself again one word of professional advise a demi permanent will be ok as a starter but will not last long over bleach it is good to do as it acts as a filler and fills in the wide open spaces created by the swelling the bleach causes in the hair use the demi and then wait a few days and find a permanent shade of brown you like not being afraid to go a bit darker because it will fade because of being over the bleach also try to get your color from a beauty supply where you can get your shade of color and developer seperate ask for volume peroxide it deposits more you need and lifts color less you don't need lift it is also gentler you may want to also try a glosser type product such as cellophanes or prisms which will seal in the color making it fade less quickly hope all this helps Hair coloring Upholstery Tattoo Acne Tooth enamel Leather Hair color Hydrogen peroxide Color theory Diamond enhancement Organic peroxide Cleveland Browns Textile manufacturing Anodising Light-emitting diode Blond Welding Dragon Booster Polar Bear Tooth bleaching Hair Joker (comics) Rebreather Horse Bleach (manga) Photography CD-R Shampoo Menstrual cup Paintball Guinea pig Dandruff Psoriasis Michael Jackson Cat coat genetics Baldness treatments Bleach Plastic C-41 process Pysanka Comanche Textile manufacturing terminology Battles of Lexington and Concord Drawing Photographic film Dishwasher Diamond Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Turquoise Laundry detergent Henna Negima Menstrual cycle Human skin color Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Paint Bong Leaf Thermal power station Chlorine Acetone peroxide Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dairy Flour Pubic hair Sugarcane Benzoyl peroxide Coffee Wood pulp Cigar Mohawk hairstyle Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Hand grenade Weight training Water purification Brush Mercury 4 Detroit Tigers New York Jets Carburetor Tzitzit Tarantula L'Or__al Body piercing Haarlem RGB color model Bonus Stage Filling station Laserdisc Ammolite Color Textile Link (Legend of Zelda) Certified Nursing Assistant E-6 process Titanium Earth Tooth
