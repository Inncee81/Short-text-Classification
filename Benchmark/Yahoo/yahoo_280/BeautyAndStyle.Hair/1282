how do i describe to a stylist a hair cut like this i want my hair like jes on rock of love just the cut but not the colors she herself is a cosmetologist and it looks pretty complicated i don't want to just show the stylist pictures are there any hair terms that i should tell her or what i don't want my hair to get jacked up here are some links to jes' hair http www buddytv com articles rock of love profile jes aspx http www vh com shows dyn rock of love series photos jhtml then scroll down until you see rock of love jes thank you sooooo much and what products would i use to style it everyday sooooooooo you want a cut like jes's i wish i could see a picture of you to see if the cut would even look good on you you don't wan the color well the blond in jes hair is what gives it the affect it has she only adds the pink to prevent her from being washed out looking from the blond the pink also brings out the natural looking pink in her skin you don't want to take the picture to a stylist which would be much easier for the stylist cause picture helps us get on the same page as the client some times it is hard to get the two minds eye to see the same page okay so you want professional terms to tell the stylist which i doubt you will understand them but i can help you with them the only probably it will create would put you and your stylist that much further away from each other in that book remember the object here is to get the cut you want and for you and your stylist to be on the same page jes hair is cut on a degree angle in the back the perimeter guideline has established the outer length from there they have cut a graduated cut using a razor and stopping at the occipital bone they have established a guideline in the front with her bangs area starting at about the bridge of her nose possibly the tip then they have done a razor face frame but pulling the hair forward and cuting a straight line from point a which is the hair in the front at the hair line about an inch section establish the lenght there and pulled everything forward from the center of her head which if you draw a line from ear to ear over the top of your head that would be the front hair this hair is cut with shears and then gone back in with a razor on the edges and interior they have also texturized her hair with channel shears which most stylist don't own most have texture shears that cut which will not create the same affect they might tell you it will but it won't they are just bullsh ting you from the crown of jes head they have gone in and created a weight line that elevates at an degree angel and gone to a graduate degree angel most the cut is done with a razor okay now i have given you how that cut is established but still it may or may not look good on you products to maintain it well first are you blowdryer savey the base would use a good root lifter then a blow dry to get it to stand out after it is dry you would spay it with a shaping spray to help place it where you would want the ends to go then use a light texture wax to help piece it out the terms you were looking for would be listed above but good luck with a stylist from any cheap chop shop knowing what is being said again then the both of you are probably in two different books the best suggestion i could give you is take the picture picture don't upset stylist they help us and go to a up scale salon and pay the price however your first question should be would this style look good on me if you are told no it wouldn't then one of two things just happen either the stylist doesn't know how to cut the style or she is telling you the truth if you think it is the first of the two reason seek another opinion hope i have given you the anwsers you are looking for and i hope you take my advice Knife Drawing Textile manufacturing Drill bit Haircut Equine conformation Wood Diving Dog Violin Humphrey Bogart Skateboarding trick The Ashlee Simpson Show Professional wrestling throws Guinea pig Shaving Aerial (dance move) Theory of conduct The Inside Hair Diamond Reservoir Dogs Jon Secada Professional wrestling holds Snooker Kodocha Dreadlocks RuneScape quests Dragon Booster Pitaten Plame affair Strap-on dildo Paul Is Dead Marilyn Monroe Time Out of Mind Social rule Milton H.
