any hair style ideas i have meduim length brown hair that goes a couple inches below my shoulders it is usually wavy but somtimes i straighten it most of the time i put it up in a pony tail or a messy bun but i need some new ideas i have the exact same hair type and same dilema heres what i do try half up and half down my cousin katie does this alot but you need to have pretty healthy looking hair underneath just make a ponytail bun with the top half of your hair and leave the rest down a variation on the half up half down idea take the hair on your hair line to about an inch in off your forehead and gather it into a ponytail its like taking bangs and putting them as the half up part try curling your hair with this style i saw it on the tv show smallville it was one of the doctor's hair styles and it was very femine and yet strong on her she had brown hair medium length frenchbraids are awesome my mom has to do mine but when she does they look killer try pigtails with french braids cause i think a french braided poinytail can look strange this is a great'do for sports and active stuff here is one i made up that can look pretty neat tie off two low ponytails then put more hair ties on hte pony tail about or more to make it look almost like a rope it looks really neat when your hair ties coordinate with your outfit try making a updo fresh with a unique set of bangs that dont be to be cut part your hair where you want your bangs to start take a one inch section from forehead in and tie off to use as your bangs later take the rest of your hair and put it in a bun or ponytail high up on the back of your head now untie the bandgs and secure them behind your ears with a clip i use this style for when i go to work i cashier at a food store experiment with headbands use them with updos and when you leave your hair down they come in all sizes and colors and patterns coordinate or mix and match look on your favorite tv show and look at the girl's hairdos try to copy them but with your own twist like crimped bangs or a bun instead of a ponytail also look at them for tips on cutting your hair next time try side ponytail high or low either slighty pushed over or dramatically moved to the side of your head tie a ribbon in a bow ontop of hte elastic you can get them at walmart real cheap and they look super cute try straightening your bangs if you dont have any use the ones i mentioned farther up and curling sqruching the rest of your hair scrunching is a technique where if your hair is naturaly curly or wavy you put gel all over wet hair and scrunch it with your hands it looks really neat and very fashionable try this when you wear your hair down and when it is straight take the hair in the center of your head at your forehead and clip it an inch or two back from your hair line it pulls the hair out of your face and creats a unique geometric shape with your face this is simple and great for school cause it keeps the hair out of your face try moving around your part i always used to have it dead on center but then my modeling agency said i should try a side part i was skeptical at first so i just moved it over an inch then i tryed two inches and then three i love it so much i've even parted my hair right at the top of my ear yes i needed some hair spray with that one but it looked so refined and elegant when you part it atleast inches off center try a low bun it looks super regal and intellegent in the movie evita madonna played eva peron and she did her hair with the side part and low bun my mother says i look just like her when i do my hair like that i think this should get you off to a good start remember to look on the television and in magazines for ideas and to experiment be creative i typed this myself and these all came from my own style so i hope you like them Ponytail Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Violin Horse Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Physical attractiveness Hair Barbie Comanche Strap-on dildo Dreadlocks Drill bit Dog Professional wrestling slang Textile manufacturing Bread Swingout Guinea pig Dragon Booster Volleyball My Little Pony Cantonese opera Cleveland Browns Shotgun Suplex Textile manufacturing terminology Vegeta Double bass Internal ballistics Glossary of climbing terms Little Britain Professional wrestling attacks Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Floppy disk Bass guitar Totally Spies!
