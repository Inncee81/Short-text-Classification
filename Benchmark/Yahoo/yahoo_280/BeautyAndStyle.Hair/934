a question for guys what do you think is hotter blonde burnette or red heads me and y boyfriend are in a disaggreement im burnette im pretty but he thinks red heads are hot honestly i think many factors are to consider here such as your skin color your face etc blonde somehow seems to catch my eye quicker but this may be different from one guy to another so really its more a question of your personal taste and what suits you better you might wanna try all of them just to see which one you like better if you haven't done so already its nice to try new things we never know what we may end up liking best of luck and looks ciao The Ashlee Simpson Show Joke 2000 Australian Grand Prix Totally Spies!
