can anyone give me advice on how to put in clip in hair extensions ok i bought bags of clip in hair extensions a few days ago from sally's beauty supply and i can't seem to get them just right my hair is pretty thick and is cut right above my shoulders and it seems like when i put the extensions in you can still tell where my real hair falls i'm wondering if i should dye my hair the exact color of the extensions b c after purchasing them i noticed that my real hair color is slightly lighter than the extensions any advice please should i dye just my hair or the extensions too and any advice on clipping them in thanks i would say to put the bulk of them around the nape area and the lower back of your head also put a row or on the sides of your head it will also really depend on how you're styling your hair as far as where to place even if the extensions are slightly darker you're natural hair will still be ontop so it will look like hi low lites and add depth to you're hair which will look nice to clip them in i'd say to tease your hair right at the root and clip as close to the roots as possible Kimono Pubic hair Physical attractiveness The Inside Hair color Mattress Equine conformation Japanese tea ceremony The Ashlee Simpson Show Textile manufacturing Professional wrestling throws Diamond Wood Leather Professional wrestling holds Totally Spies!
