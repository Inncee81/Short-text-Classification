i had my legs waxed at studio hair in birmingham al and they jipped me what could i have done i went to get my legs waxed on the phone they quoted me the girl took hr and mins to wax my legs the wax kept balling up and she had to do the same places over and over i have been waxed before and she blamed it on my fine blonde hair though no one else has ever had that problem so my legs are still so hairy but i am all too glad to leave ie pain so when i pay they say it is and the was per leg i have called several salons in the area that give the price for both legs and they laugh when i tell them a salon actually quoted me for one leg i told the lady at the counter that i thought it was and she gave me a discount for the confusion after getting attitude w me i left paying with still hairy legs that were raw and had wax bunched up on them the girl said that must be my lotion even though i had none on i was pissed then and i get pissed now every time i touch my hairy legs what could should i have done legally could they have made me pay i have only had my legs waxed times for very special occasions and the other times it was in cali and nyc where it was much cheaper but i was getting married and i really wanted my legs to be super smooth for my honeymoon so i didn't have to shave i usually do use a razor and just shave i personally wouldn't have paid i go to a very high end spa and they don't even charge that much and every place i know of quotes for both legs because really unless your leg is in a cast why would you only wax one leg you pay for services rendered and if you aren't legitimately satisfied with the service you have a right to not pay what are they going to say don't come back obviously you arent going backif they did such a hack job as for the wax balling up she obviously wasn't experienced or she would've known what to do i've never had that happen to me and they usually wipe me down with something to make sure nothing is on my skin that could affect the wax sounds to me more like she didn't know what she was doing or the wax wasn't heated properly or both with you fine blond hair the waxing should've been a breeze not an hour and a half horrible service provided horrible customer service i definitely would speak to manager if it wasn't that long ago and spread the word that the place is not the best to go to Pubic hair Hair Time Out of Mind Ron and Fez Blonde on Blonde Kodocha Waxing Beard Joke Casting Leg shaving The Ashlee Simpson Show Piccolo Junior Saga Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Blood on the Tracks Shaving Eric Bischoff Pitaten 2004 Republican National Convention Little Britain Characters in the Smurfs Major League Baseball television contracts Manicure Social rule ITunes Music Store Tennis Plame affair Phonograph cylinder Roswell UFO incident Knots Landing Stone Cold Steve Austin One Piece minor characters Laser hair removal Three Stooges Russian joke Wal-Mart The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Futurama (TV series - season 5) Milton H.
