correcting red hair dye hi i dyed my hair dark reddish brown with garnier nutrisse boxed dye over my dark brown semi permenant colored hair my real hair is dark brown but i wanted to intensefy it anyway my roots came out red and the rest of my hair stayed brown with red tones today i went out and purchased ion brilliance dye in medium ash brown and darkest brown i bought the medium ash brown thinking i would correct the red but i think i made a mistake in mixing it with a developer instead of to just deposit now my roots are even redder and the rest of my hair is a dark dark brown with tons of red tones which i hate i really want to try and atleast fix my roots take out the red without having to go to my hair stylist do you guys think it'd be a good idea to try and dye a dark ash brown over it to correct the red i was thinking of just doing the same darkest brown dye but i think it would just stick with the red tones since most brown dyes do that help i wanna add that i hadn't dyed my hair in a year and a half up until last month semi permenant dye i had done even after these two dyes my hair looks exactly the same it did before i dyed it soft shiny and bouncy no damage my hair has always been pretty strong considering all the stuff i use to do to it back then try bleaching your hair and then dying it after Blond Hair coloring The Ashlee Simpson Show Hair Staining (biology) Joker (comics) Color theory Double Dragon The Rasmus Phoebe Buffay's songs Paul Is Dead Time Out of Mind Technicolor Opportunity rover Yohoho!
