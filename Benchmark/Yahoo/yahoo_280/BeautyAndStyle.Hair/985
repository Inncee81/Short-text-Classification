any recommended hair straighteners i have a lot of thick hard to manage wavy hair with a cheap straightener that i got from walmart it usually took me like hours to straighten and it still looked big but a hair stylist once used the paul mitchell flat iron on me along with the super skinny serum and it only took minutes to get my hair sleek and straight so i was planning on getting that one but i did some research and found a lot of mixed reviews i've also heard a lot about the chi but would it really work with my hair i have a chi and i have wavvy thick hair before i had a walmart straightner and i would do my hair before school and by nd hour i would have those like wavy kinks and it sucked but then i bought a chi and i will never go back its amazing everyone says they are expensive and i agree they are a bit pricy but its a good investment don't you feel way better when your hair looks good anyways they sell them at bed bath beyond weird i know and you can go onto their website and sign up for their mailing list and get a off coupon and they are oringnally like so they are about a with the coupon they also except linens n things coupons and if you don't a bed bath and beyond near you you could try their website not sure how much s h is though hope this helps Wal-Mart Haircut Mattress Charles Ponzi Tai Chi Chuan Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Bond Sub-Zero Social rule Grunge music Cleveland Browns Sears Holdings Corporation Oil-for-Food Programme Meat Loaf Avenue Q Textile manufacturing Good Morning, Vietnam Ron and Fez Diving Skinny Puppy The Kinks Hair (musical) Textile manufacturing terminology A Day in the Life Guinea pig Green Day EastEnders Floppy disk Theory of conduct Let It Be...
