how would i explain this to a stylist hi all i've had the same hairstyle for years now lots of blonde highlights with a medium brown on the underside with side bangs i'm really wanting a change i'd love to go all blonde and get rid of the brown underside but here's my real dilema i'd like to get bangs which are short enough to wear straight down but also long enough that can be worn to the side when i feel like having them out of my face here's a picture http tinypic com view php pic oq ia they look long enough to be put to put to the side right i'm just a little nervous because i've had complete disasters with getting bangs before they always seem to go extremely short on me my usual hair stylist is my mother's best friend but her daughter just passed away from breast cancer so i don't want to bother her right now with my petty hair problems i'm used to her knowing exactly what i want how should i explain this thanks just go to her and say that you love what she's always done for your hair which is why you came to her when you wanted something different explain your cut the way you explained above and print out the picture of hilary duff and bring it with you good luck Haircut The Ashlee Simpson Show Hilary Duff Marilyn Monroe Hair EastEnders Pitaten Megan Griffin Charlie Brown W.I.T.C.H.
