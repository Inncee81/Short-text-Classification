has anyone had laser hair removal was it effective what was the procedure like what part of the body did you get it done on how old were you when you got it thanks d i got it done about a year ago in my late s and it took several months to complete all the cycles i got the bikini area and underarm area done really happy for the most part any regrowth is much finer and minimal the procedure was weird the laser also has this thing blasting ice cold air to cool off your skin i think the cold air was worse than the laser itself i did not take any painkillers or use the lidocaine numbing cream but you can request a prescription for it at most places you would have to pay extra for the cream but by the time the pain got too intense they were done making that pass with the laser and moved to the next area don't do it if you're very modest you have to strip down cause they put this clear gel on you and it gets messy Analgesic Acne Laser hair removal Laser Waxing Shaving Scar Carbon dioxide Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Laser applications Ice cream Dialysis Pubic hair Baldness treatments Local anesthesia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wart Brazilian waxing Climate of the United Kingdom Cystoscopy Endometriosis Malignant melanoma Vitiligo Cocaine Puberty Explosive material Thermoregulation Gelatin Anesthesia Blushing Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Volleyball Epidural Intersex surgery Welding Dairy Diving suit Tattoo Sento Diabetic retinopathy Fecal incontinence Scarification Prostate cancer Manicure Neuropathy Directed-energy weapon Cancer Ozone depletion Piccolo Junior Saga Herpes simplex virus Undergarment M16 (rifle) Aerial (dance move) Radiation therapy Lighting Sunburn Osteoarthritis Sampling (music) Ozone hole Stomach cancer Hiking Doxepin Human Childbirth Dental caries Air conditioning Bob and George Air traffic controller Ice age Refractive surgery Power Rangers: SPD Hair Eczema Eye surgery Methamphetamine Geology of the Grand Canyon area Shampoo The Ashlee Simpson Show Dermatology Transformer Chocolate Diesel engine Tefillin Nitroglycerin The Amber Spyglass 1969 Atlantic hurricane season Traumatic incident reduction Cat Photorefractive keratectomy Gramophone record Weather lore Breast cancer Medicine Mouth ulcer Pain
