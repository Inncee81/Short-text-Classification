side bangs i really want side bangs and i was just wondering how hard they are to cut thanks i would definitely get them for the first time i would go to a hair stylist or someone with hair cutting experience and give them a picture of how you want them since they do vary while they are cutting them pay attention so you can do it on your own since hair growth in your bangs will be much more evident than with the rest of your hair they will require a trim more frequently i trim mine on my own every few weeks while my hair is wet i comb the section of bangs down in front of my eyes and put the hair between two fingers just above where i intend to cut my bangs make sure to leave them a little bit longer than you want your bangs because they will be shorter once they are swept to the side you can either cut them straight across or at a slight angle depending on how severe you want the angle to be once they are swept to the side even if you cut them straight across they will be angled once on the side of your head Haircut Drill bit Hair Equine conformation Bookbinding Professional wrestling throws Drawing Archery Textile manufacturing Internal ballistics Table saw Microphone Chu-Han contention Cello Fast bowling Batting (cricket) Volleyball Salute Aerial (dance move) Harmonica Prostate cancer Black hole Swept wing Leaf Strap-on dildo Michelson-Morley experiment Depilation Snooker Violin Glossary of American football Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Naval mine Radiation therapy Stairway Baldness Double bass Breaststroke Shaving Autopsy Swingout Professional wrestling holds Knife Big Bang Gesture Dreadlocks Stereoscopy Helicopter Bladderwort Chopsticks Wood Parallax Scapula Puberty Beard Gramophone record Breastfeeding Car handling Kitesurfing Cross-country skiing Cephalic disorder Milton H.
