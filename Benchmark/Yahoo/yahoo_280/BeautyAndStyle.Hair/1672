what is the difference between a chi straightener and a ceramic straightener i don't want to waste so much money on a chi and im only going to straighten my hair a few times a month but i dont want my hair to be damaged that much what do i do huge in the most loving way i can say it like the old saying goes' you get what you pay for do you want to spend alot of money and time for fried hair and split ends why do think all of your salons and top professionals use them and not the cheap ones if the cheap ones work don't you think they would buy them and keep the extra profits the chi is made not to over heat and burn your hair and you get the fabulous look over and over again trust me on this one honey don't wast your time or your money on the cheap one you will pay more in the long run with the cheap one and your hair will pay for it in the long run as well but hey at least you had the courage to ask before you made a mistake hope you look glamours when your done Billboard Hot 100 Mutual fund Professional wrestling slang Poker jargon The Beatles PE ratio Estoppel Nuclear power Gross domestic product Meat Loaf Price discrimination Superman III Short selling Futurama (TV series - season 5) Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Haircut Plastic Energy development Dairy Hair James J.
