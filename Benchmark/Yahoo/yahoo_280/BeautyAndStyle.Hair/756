for the past days ive been trying to dye my hair light light blonde however everytime i do a test strand they dont change colors right now my hair is a med golden blonde days ago i bought ion brillance hair dye and i did a test strand like normal the strand didnt change colors thinking the dye was old or cheap i went back to sallys tonight and got a hair stylist to refer me to miss clariol i bought different shades because i wasnt sure on the shade im doing test strands on both right now but neither are changing colors and its been mins what gives and yes i am using developer ok first off the avatar is from like months ago and you arent giving me serious answers i need a scentific answer duh i got this from sallys with a salon stylist giving me professional help i have been dying my hair forever and never had any problems before soo i really dont understand the developer you bought may only be a vol vol only deposits color it does not lift you will need a to vol both will lift but will lift even more it is the strongest you can also use bleach but i would get one that can go on the scalp for safety with bleach you would have to make sure you allow it to process through all the colors until you reach the blond you want if you take it out to soon you will have orange you would take just a small strand and wet it to see what color stage your hair is at if not done apply more bleach on that strand and give it a few more min be careful not to over process either you will have to get on some professional products for color treated hair if you do just color use the higher developer and do the same with a strand of hair after it has processed the amount to time it says it should be done be careful again not to over process for color apply inch from scalp then apply color to that hair about half way in processing or maybe the last to min it will take faster then the rest of your hair if you find that all your hair but the inch you just applyed color to is done just spray your hair with water to get the color out as best you can but don't touch the hair you processed after until done then rinse your hair for a long time until all color is out Hair coloring Hair color Textile manufacturing Puberty Leather Sun Sea level rise Upholstery Blond Comanche Dandruff Psoriasis Technicolor Tooth enamel Opportunity rover Menstrual cup Thermal power station Dishwasher Guinea pig Drawing Welding Cancer Shader Photographic film C-41 process Color theory Education in the United States Turquoise Professional wrestling throws Digital photography Chlorine Pubic hair Billiards Photography Jon Secada Titan (moon) Theory of conduct Technetium Dolly Parton Drag racing Tattoo Drug test Dye Internal ballistics The Rasmus Snooker Diamond enhancement Growth hormone treatment Organic peroxide Action potential Horse Head louse Phoebe Buffay's songs Fluorescent lamp Link (Legend of Zelda) Pottery Mesothelioma Spacecraft propulsion Agarose gel electrophoresis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Wood Marilyn Monroe E-6 process Pamela Anderson Carbon dioxide Medical prescription Prostate cancer Color blindness Water purification Light-emitting diode Certified Nursing Assistant RuneScape quests Paint Dairy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diabetic retinopathy Ammolite Casting Halitosis Space Shuttle program Dreadlocks L'Or__al Human skin color Tag Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog Black hole Neurofeedback Hydrochloric acid Electrolysis Software engineering
