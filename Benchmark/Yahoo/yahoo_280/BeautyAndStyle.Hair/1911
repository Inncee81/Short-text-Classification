i just washed my hair after leaving it a week i managed to get by a week without washing it because my friends are mostly on holiday and i hadnt really been leaving the house so i didnt see the point is it a good or bad thing to leave hair as long as possible without washing or should one wash it like every other day and why thanks in the earlier times they did it once a week but they'd brush all the oils through it every night hense the strokes at bedtime legends it will be fine you may find it a bit oily for the next day or two i like to let mine go two days once a month or so on a weekend to get the natural oils to flow but that's about it it really depends on your hair doesn't it if it's coarse and wavy you can probably get away with every other day if it's finer and straight it will get flat and icky looking and need daily washing Brush Textile manufacturing Drawing Social rule Knife Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina Casting Sharpening stone Carding Haircut Keeshond Nuclear fallout Eddie Guerrero Certified Nursing Assistant Diesel engine Capercaillie Cashmere wool Equine conformation Fasting Sex Pistols Animal Crossing Phoebe Buffay's songs Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drill bit Dreadlocks International League Leaf 613 mitzvot Francis Bacon (painter) Acne Meat Loaf Stroke Week Korban Wolfrider Dandruff Canonical hours Hair Drug test Customs and etiquette of Japan Textile manufacturing terminology Town gas Passover Christmas USS Wallace L.
