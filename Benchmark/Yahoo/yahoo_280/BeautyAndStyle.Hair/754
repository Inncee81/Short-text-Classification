my niece years old has never cut her hair and her dad doesn't want her to help okay i know i already asked this but i would like more answers please she wanted me to ask this for your opinions she is and she's cut her bangs to about the bottom of her face ttheyre prety longg and her hair is down to her elbows from lack of never cutting it her dad has the say in the house and he has never bothered to cut it because long hair is pretty but she thinks that she should get just a trim i was called a few minutes ago and she told me what just happened she had her mom go into the living room they are all watching a movei and she told him to please pause for a sec then her mom asked her dad if it would be alright for my niece to get a trim this is what he said fine go ahead trim your hair but let me get a picture of your pretty long hair before you cut it all off so i can have something to remember the old lisa by you are gonna be like everyone else and now she is crying and doesn't even think cutting her hair is a good idea anymore i want to help her because she thought it was a good idea but she feels like her dad won't love her if she gets her hair cut he doesn't want it cut and definitely makes it seem like he won't love her if she trims it i don't know and her dad isn't a drunk or anything she really loves him and wants to make him happy but he has always been paranoid in this subject so help and tips needed she also wants it trimmed only a little for a good impression she hasnt seen her friends in a while and shes going into middle school trimming ur hair is healthy and no matter what a dad would always love you but her dad is kinda harsh i guess but she should tell her dad that you know sumtimes if you hav ur hair really long and its in the summer it'll get really hot sigh there is absolutly nothing wrong with cutting her hair and if he thinks shes gonna be like everyone else then does it mean that ur dad doesnt cut his hair either i personally think that he is not being reasonable i suggest that she and her mom goes shopping and get a trim like bout inch i doubt her dad would know the difference hope this helps Shaggy dog story Grandview, U.S.A.
