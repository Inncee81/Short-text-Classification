who here likes or even knows who flash gordon is what did you think about the new show on sci fi i think most people even under have at least heard of flash gordon i saw the 's version and while it was really campy it was fun i saw the sci fi channel one last night and was really wanting it to be great and it was really boring so slow and convoluted i really liked the actor in smallville and he was such a dud in this one in the 's version the guy was very likable almost like a big kid and fun i expected the one from this movie to go into a lecture any moment not a fun charactor at all it would have been cool if he were a little more like the johnny storm charactor in fantastic movies but not quite as childish anyway i doubt ill watch it again Superman III Mystery Science Theater 3000 Fantastic Four Camp Lazlo Flash (comics) Batman (TV series) Smallville (TV series) Flash Gordon The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sesame Street The Beach Boys Frank Herbert The Fairly OddParents Science fiction Sci Fi Channel (United States) Macromedia Flash Where's Wally?
