best tea i ever had what is it once about years ago i had a tea it was light brown in color like regular tea and it was in a japanese or chinese restaurant this tea was the best it was very smooth and mellow nothing like the tea we can all make at home someone help me it was wonderful i think it may have been japanese as i have been to several chinese restaurants since and have never had it agian i would appreciate any thoughts and ideas i have tried almost every tea in the universe you can get from wal mart but i think this was a special tea made from just the leaves mostly likely jasmine tea you can find it at a speciality tea shop teavana elephant tea or try your local asian grocery jasmine tea is very mellow and smooth very comforting i always compare it to being in a spa drinking jasmine tea relaxes you completely drinking jasmine tea is like getting a spiritual massage it's so soothing to drink it's almost addictive ps i dont think walmart will have jasmine tea my next guess would be hibiscus tea but i think you are talking about jasmine tea just try it you will remember Tea Mid-levels Japanese tea ceremony Green tea Herbal tea Chinatown Chinese tea culture Wal-Mart Wan Chai Dim sum Teapot Caffeine Southeast Asia Jasmine White tea Coffee Rooibos Hong Kong-style milk tea Korean tea ceremony Cha chaan teng Massage Hong Kong tea culture Asian supermarket Breakfast Coffeehouse Tea (meal) Chinatown, Las Vegas Love Hina main characters Soup Soft drink Pu-erh tea Singlish Jazz Orange Pekoe Descendants of Darkness Cuisine of the Philippines Sage Sen no Rikyu Bodhidharma McDonald's Aladdin (1992 film) Bubble tea Korean cuisine Matcha Japanese language Chinese tea Chinese cuisine Oolong Cuisine of Singapore Taiwan Black tea Sento Japanese cuisine Conveyor belt sushi History of tea in China Fujian Tea Classics Hibiscus The Apprentice 2 Birch Cuisine of Denmark Insomnia Chinatown, Los Angeles, California Assam tea Victoria Peak Japanese honorifics Meditation Sauna Yerba mate Breastfeeding Rum Fecal incontinence Manila Bento Cuisine Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Customs and etiquette of Japan Starbucks Yum cha Epcot University of British Columbia Republic of China Camellia sinensis National emblem Cliff Richard Vancouver Birmingham Child sexuality French cuisine Cannabis (drug) Super Mario Bros. 3 Cordelia Chase Yellow Hotel Peruvian cuisine In-N-Out Burger Hong Kong Tea tree oil Chengdu Beijing
