does any body knows how to make harina de maiz criolla cuban recipe i use to eat this when i was in cuba but i forgot how to make it it was a typical dish in the rural area ussually served with 'huevos fritos' the most i can remember is to mix the harina de maiz with water and a little bit of oil and let it cook until it gets thick also i have to continualy stir it i'm trying to get the right measurements so it will not be too runny or to thick also any others ingredients that i might be missing the harina you're talking about is the quickest and most basic all i know is you get it to the consistency you like while it's heating in the pot it shouldn't be too thin not watery or too thick remember that once it cools down in the pot or on your plate it will thicken and harden my parents make harina but their version is called tamal en cazuela it has garlic and onions for seasoning tomato sauce pork masas de puerco in it good luck and i hope your harina comes out delish Tamale Cantonese cuisine Peruvian cuisine Korean cuisine Tofu Curry Chili con carne D__ner kebab Ramen Cuisine of Brazil Pasta Cajun cuisine Barbecue Cuisine of Denmark Gumbo Soup Hamburger Cuisine of Singapore Pancake Breakfast Cuisine of Malaysia Hot dog Flour Potato chips Mayonnaise Cornmeal Hot pot Dumpling Cuisine of Laos Bengali cuisine Ketchup Cuisine of the Southern United States French fries Roman eating and drinking Cookware and bakeware Sauce Cincinnati chili Soul food Cuisine of Africa Bread Dim sum Cuisine of Greece Sushi German cuisine Fish and chips Nabemono Soba Cuisine of Vietnam Chicken soup Recipe Cuisine of Argentina Jewish cuisine Risotto Mexican cuisine Idli Pea soup Roux American Chinese cuisine Starch Italian cuisine Cuisine of Turkey Paella Cuisine of Cambodia Japanese tea ceremony B__chamel sauce Cuisine of Canada Chowder Burrito Kebab Rum Soy sauce Brewery Garlic Huevos rancheros Dosa Cholent Tortilla Chicago-style pizza Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Pottery Kraft Dinner Salsa (sauce) Potato pancakes Catalan cuisine Salad Chile pepper Paint Minestrone Halva Tuxtla Guti__rrez Irish cuisine Feijoada
