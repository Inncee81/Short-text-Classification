which among the asian cooking is more healthy and which is more likely to be unhealthy why i am choosing between asian restaurants ie chinese filipino vietnamese thai and indian it's hard to say because it really depends on what ingredients are used to cook these dishes you could go in one restaurant and order a healthy looking vegetable dish but the oil could be from lard which isn't the best choice to use when cooking although it enhances flavors on the other hand you can order a completely greasy dish which is cooked with olive oil and it'll be much more healthier than the one cooked with lard to point out a certain cuisine and categorize it as being healthier than the other would be unfair to say and also unfair to give it an overall genralization just by basing it on some unhealthy dishes that someone has seen if someone already pre established their preference of cuisine just based on the few dishes that are unhealthy even before experiencing it then they're going to be missing out on a lot of great dishes the best advice to give to you is to visit these restaurants try these food out and make it your own judgement call on what you feel is healthy or not French cuisine Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Laos Soup Cuisine of Malaysia Curry Korean cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Japanese cuisine Tofu Cuisine of Africa American Chinese cuisine Cantonese cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of the Philippines Ramen Fish and chips Cuisine of Thailand Pizza Recipe Canadian Chinese cuisine Breakfast Chili con carne Sauce Peruvian cuisine Kashrut Bengali cuisine Hamburger Fast food German cuisine Chinatown Taiwanese cuisine Soul food Cajun cuisine Cuisine French fries Salad British cuisine Restaurant Cuisine of Singapore Coriander Mexican cuisine Cuisine of Vietnam Hot pot Cuisine of the Southern United States Stir frying Glutinous rice Polish cuisine Gumbo Cooking Rice Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Ethiopia Cuisine of Finland Chiuchow cuisine Jewish cuisine Chile pepper Pancake Bread Veganism Dumpling Iron Chef America Barbecue Mayonnaise Szechuan cuisine Cuisine of Cambodia Caribbean Chinese cuisine Risotto Steaming Saimin Hamster Sushi Ginger Cuisine of Greece Pasta Hakka cuisine Cheese Yum cha McDonald's Miso Chopsticks Food Common bean Atkins Nutritional Approach Idli Biscuit Little Saigon
