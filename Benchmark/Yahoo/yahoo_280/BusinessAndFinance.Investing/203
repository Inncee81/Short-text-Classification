what makes an individual stock worth it's price i understand the law of supply and demand so that when more people want to buy the price goes up and vice versa but what makes people want to buy for example i think company a has a good idea for a product why do i buy their stock just in hopes other people will want it in the future and be willing to pay more for it do dividends make a company more enticing to buy do all companies give dividends is there a ratio between the stocks a company has and its earnings is this the p e ratio how do i interpret the p e ratio what are its units something is still missing serge mentioned 'discounted cash flows' which i will look into is it just about owning sexy stocks so i can say i own shares of xxx to my friends is there a direct link between profits and share price is there one additional scenario company a is consistently profitable offers consistent dividends company b has high expected profits and is looking for growth is my only criteria for investment what i think the demand for stock will be in the future am i just betting on what other people will want in the future this is confusing oh wait will companies eventually buy back the stock issue are you betting on the price the company will be willing to pay to buy back the stock hmmm you are correct about the supply and demand issue investors will demand the shares of a company when they evaluate the company and decide what they think it will accomplish in the future theoretically the current price of the stock is the discounted value of its future cash flows however no one knows what the future will bring investors look at what the company owns what it is earning by employing its resources what the prospects are for the earnings to grow the company's position in its industry and many other factors that determine how much they ar willing to pay for a share all companies do not pay dividends whether dividends make a stock more enticing really depends on the investor investors who are interested in dividend income will look for stocks that have a good history of stable dividend payments investors who prefer capital gains will look for companies that are plowing their earnings back into operations in order to grow take advantage of new technology and develop new products the price earnings ratio is a measure of how expensive a stock is a stock that is earning per share has a p e ratio of another stock earning per share has a p e ratio of the second stock is more expensive i e you have to pay twice as much for a dollar of earnings why is the p e ratio of the second stock so much higher probably because investors perceive the first stock will continue earning per share but they think the second stock may earn per share next year per share the year after and per share the year after that they are willing to pay more for the prospect of rapidly growing earnings Insurance Inflation Arbitrage Capital accumulation Warren Buffett Capitalism Annuity Derivative (finance) Short selling Income statement Economy of India Technical analysis Income trust Gold standard Rational pricing Debt United Kingdom corporation tax Equity investment Economy of Russia Cost of capital Deflation (economics) Mergers and acquisitions Surplus value Taxation in the United States Tax Gold as an investment Corporation Microsoft Margin (finance) Temasek Holdings The South Sea Company Investment bank FairTax Life insurance Supply and demand Dot-com Real estate economics Stock market Sears Holdings Corporation Bank Yield curve Financial markets Law of value Finance Capital asset pricing model Berkshire Hathaway Flat tax Bretton Woods system Gross domestic product Modern portfolio theory Privatization Money Airline Citigroup Conglomerate (company) Black-Scholes Islamic banking Futures contract Day trading Supply-side economics Economy of the United States Monetary policy Labor theory of value Hedge fund Economic relations of Japan Philatelic investment Economics Individual Savings Account NASDAQ Economy of Pakistan Enron Corporation Intellectual property Economic rent Social Security debate (United States) Economy of Venezuela Progressive tax Exchange-traded fund Manitoba Hydro Efficiency wages Security (finance) Labour economics Ford Motor Company Free trade Economic inequality Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Organic composition of capital
