how do cd's work i am interested in buying a cd certificate of deposite from wamu but first i have some questions how do they work and how do you caculate the earnings im looking for a term long cd so ill have something to look forward in the early future a certificate of deposit is just a loan except this time you are loaning the bank money when you buy a cd you are telling the bank here is x dollars of mine that you can have for y months in y months i want it back and you have to pay me z interest in other words you are like a bank and you are loaning someone else money for a fee a month cd should give you an interest rate of above apy because there are savings accounts that give you at least that much and don't prevent you from taking out the funds as someone else suggested go to www bankrate com and click on the certificate of deposit tabs and you can quickly buy a cd how do you calculate the earnings lets say you buy a year cd at value lets say the apy is to find out the amount you get back in years take the apy divide by then add because it is for years you take to the fifth power which is the same thing as and you get about then the final step you multiply that number by the amount you bought the cd for which was so so if you buy a cd for in years the bank will give you back cds are protected by the federal government so if in the crazy event the bank goes out of business you'll still get your money guaranteed good luck Bond Money supply Money Mortgage Bank Annuity Monetary policy Student loan Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Credit card Interest Islamic banking Certificate of deposit Mutual fund Insurance Deflation (economics) Savings and loan association Hyperinflation Fractional-reserve banking Capital accumulation Finance Security (finance) Derivative (finance) Gold as an investment Credit union Citigroup Wheel of Fortune PE ratio Gold standard Federal Reserve Inflation Corporation Personal finance Savings and Loan crisis Short selling Money market Economy of Russia Unemployment benefit Gross domestic product Yield curve Capitalism Financial markets Bank fraud Fiat money U.S. public debt Internet fraud Debt Anarchism and capitalism Margin (finance) Federal National Mortgage Association Investment bank Usury Advance fee fraud Bretton Woods system Primerica Financial Services Futures contract Enron Corporation 401(k) Government National Mortgage Association Marshall Plan Charles Ponzi Social Credit Economy of the United States Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) History of the United States (1918-1945) Stock Keynesian economics Tax Government debt Financial services Small business National Kidney Foundation Singapore Toronto-Dominion Bank Liberty Dollar Mensal__o scandal Surplus value Poker jargon Dividend RuneScape cheats United Kingdom corporation tax America Online U.S. one hundred-dollar bill Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Ocean's Twelve U.S. ten-dollar bill Predatory lending Trust (Law) USA Gmail Cheque
