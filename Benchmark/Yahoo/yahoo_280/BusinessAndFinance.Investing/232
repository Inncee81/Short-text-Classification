should i set up my tax lien investment group as an llc or corporation i have about people in my group that want to invest in tax liens we don't want to draw any salaries because our startup capital is quite low however we want the liability protection what makes better sense to form an llc or corporation either way we would file s corp status both entity types provide liability protection a corporation for which you file an s corp election has the advantage that its pretty easy to find off the shelf corporation docs that you can use and the body of law on corporations is well established if you have foreign investors or you want any type of complicated voting or economic structure lets say that you want some people to have economic but not voting rights or that some class of people get extra money because they also manage the company an llc is better because while an s corp is only allowed one class of stock you can create multiple classes of llc membership interests with different rights preferences and privileges you might think can't corporations create difference classes of shares with different rights preference and privileges the answer is yes but you can't create a corporation with multiple class types and make an s corp election not permitted under irs rules also an llc allows you to forego having annual meetings etc but you do need to put more work in drafting an llc agreement up front llc agreements are less off the shelf if you use an off the shelf llc agreement you are risking a lot more than using off the shelf articles of incorporation just as one more clarification for a corporation to get pass through tax treatment you make an s corp election for an llc you don't you make a check the box election to be treated as a partnership llcs are pass through tax entities but s corp is a term reserved for corporation who make such an election and llcs are not corporations search using www yahoo com search Limited liability company Mutual fund United Kingdom corporation tax Stock Flat tax Income trust Free trade Capitalism Cooperative Incorporation (business) Microsoft Security (finance) Mortgage Article One of the United States Constitution Lloyd's of London Corporate finance Finance Corporate governance Bank Politics of the United States Annuity Bretton Woods system FairTax Life insurance Trust (Law) USA Congress of the United States Berkshire Hathaway Democracy Civil rights Politics of Russia Bond Economy of India Government of France Hedge fund Microcredit 401(k) Mergers and acquisitions Royal Dutch Shell Google Pretty Good Privacy Civil union Warren Buffett Ethernet Citigroup Dividend Government debt British House of Commons Financial services Australian constitutional law Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Tax protester Corporate personhood Copyright Individual Savings Account Offshore company Intellectual property Contract Capital accumulation USA PATRIOT Act Investment bank Trademark Tom DeLay European Union Airline Federal Reserve Debt United States Army Eliot Spitzer New Deal Separation of church and state Constitution of India Unlawful combatant Arturo Frondizi Globalization Expert system Economy of South Africa Commonwealth of Nations Income tax Immigration to the United States Internet Relay Chat Venture capital Class action United States House of Representatives Software patent debate Municipal bond Conrail
