do you think the stock market will rebound soon just curious on what you think the stock market will do in the next couple months i have some cash in stocks that i'd like to use to fund a house purchase in the fall and its taken a beating these past couple weeks should i take the loss and cash out or just wait it out it already has rebounded and it will do so again and again if you can sell at a profit consider doing so but if the price has dropped to the point where you will be taking a loss you need to look at where your money is what company if it's a mortgage or financial company i would probably get out but if it's a good sound company then ride it out as far as your house purchase goes if you can wait you should probably do so as house prices are dropping Bond Mutual fund Enron Corporation Insurance Federal National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) PE ratio Derivative (finance) Mortgage Great Depression Internet fraud Financial markets Arbitrage Finance Citigroup Warren Buffett Security (finance) Stock market Bank Margin (finance) Wal-Mart Video game crash of 1983 Keynesian economics Hyperinflation Asian financial crisis Islamic banking Futures contract Hedge fund Put option Predatory lending NASDAQ Tax Technical analysis Tesco Temasek Holdings Sears Holdings Corporation Life insurance Day trading Dot-com Corporate finance Monopoly Monopoly (game) Sinclair Research Ltd Call option Debt Foreign exchange market Money supply Economy of Russia Closed-end fund Microeconomics Personal finance Hedge (finance) Bank of America FairTax United Kingdom corporation tax Monetary policy Gold standard Los Angeles Clippers RKO Pictures Treasury security Mad Money Conglomerate (company) Electronic money The South Sea Company Dividend Modern portfolio theory Investment bank Takeover Ford Motor Company Economics Corporation Bank fraud American Motors Economy of Chile Wells Fargo Employee stock option Economy of Romania Financial services Mortgage-backed security Inflation Income trust Mikhail Khodorkovsky Arthur Laffer Electronic commerce Speculation Option Initial public offering Wall Street Crash of 1929 Real estate economics Taxation in the United States Stock broker Health insurance Corporate raid King Ranch Amtrak Commodity
