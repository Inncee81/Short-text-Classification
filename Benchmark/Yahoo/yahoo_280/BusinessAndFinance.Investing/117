can i transfer or rollover my k before i leave the company i would like to rollover my k into an ira but i am not leaving the company is this allowed legally yes the irs allows you to rollover k money into a traditional ira at any time however most employers will not allow this usually you will have to quit retire be fired or become disabled to do this i do not recommend the latter two companies often times have exclusive contracts with the fund companies in their plan and do not want money of current employees going out the door to someone else also it becomes a major hassle for employers to rollover money every time an employee wants to move a little money to an ira most k plans are not heavily staffed and this would place an undue burden on them it's great when your employer does allow rollovers at any time however most will not allow rollovers until you sever employment often times it is the restrictions of the company plans that cause the problems not the irs wow i actually defended the irs so the lesson here is first check with your employer's plan before you spend time thinking about a rollover don't count those chickens before they're hatched Individual Retirement Account Taxation in the United States Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Variable universal life insurance Social Security debate (United States) Unemployment Health insurance Flat tax Tax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Health savings account Roth IRA Retirement plan School bus Money supply FairTax Asian financial crisis Apprenticeship Insurance Social Security (United States) H-1B visa Mutual fund Enron Corporation TIAA-CREF Publicly funded medicine Life insurance Microeconomics Wal-Mart Marshall Plan National Kidney Foundation Singapore Bretton Woods system Privatization Business continuity planning Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Airbag Security (finance) Risk management Ford Explorer Self-employment Coalition Provisional Authority Video game developer Contract Keynesian economics Public domain Economy of Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Africa Florida Lottery Tom DeLay Civil rights Leeds United F.C.
