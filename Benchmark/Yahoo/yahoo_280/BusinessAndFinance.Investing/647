several retirement accounts or one i'm thinking about opening some retirements accounts and contribute very modestly what would be better to have a and a roth ira and contribute a little to both or just one of these and contribute more i'm talking here about the regular conservative accounts not the aggressive investing and i plan on leaving it there until i retire and then take out the whole thing this is a difficult question to give a good answer to as you are aware contributions to roth ira accounts are after tax contributions contributions to accounts are before tax contribuitions but that is just the beginning of the complexity when you withdraw the money from the it is taxed at the full tax rate when you withdraw money from a roth ira account it is not taxed at all and of course neither is taxed while the funds remain in the account one advantage of a roth ira maybe is that you are in full control the offers all kinds of investment options but perhaps not ones that you would wish there is perhaps a disadvantage to the roth ira option that is that almost all of the mutual funds and brokerage accounts where you can establish one have a minimum that is fairly substantial perhaps there is no minimum with the just put in what you wish now one thing that you need to be aware of is that if the is provided by a non profit tax exempt organization i believe that it might be subject to seizure by creditors of the organization government sponsors plans are not if your current tax rate is not great it may be to your advantage to use the roth ira you may think this is far fetched but it is possible that your retirement funds could grow into a very large amount and when you finally have to begin taking distributions you may have to take a fairly large sum more than annually on which you will have to pay taxes if it is not a roth ira account let us assume that you are year old and will work until you are and that your account will earn annually about average for equity based accounts based on history and that you contribute annually when you are you will have in your account earning annually think about that for a moment 401(k) Annuity Life insurance Roth IRA Social Security (United States) Variable universal life insurance Mutual fund Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Individual Retirement Account Social Security debate (United States) FairTax Tax Retirement plan Taxation in the United States Bond Flat tax Student loan United Kingdom corporation tax Pension Microeconomics Hedge fund Gross domestic product Surplus value Economy of India Security (finance) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Bretton Woods system Capital accumulation Trust (Law) USA National Kidney Foundation Singapore Warren Buffett Citigroup Income trust Anarchism and capitalism Economy of Russia Minimum wage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Keynesian economics Bank Stock Ponzi scheme Divorce Investment bank Registered Retirement Savings Plan Cost of capital Gold as an investment Corporate finance Economic inequality Productive and unproductive labour Publicly funded medicine Airline Health savings account Debt Mortgage Tax haven Deflation (economics) Fractional-reserve banking Salary cap Charles Haughey Primerica Financial Services Microcredit Supply-side economics Margin (finance) Money supply National Insurance Wells Fargo Inflation Credit card Capitalism Derivative (finance) Education in the People's Republic of China Goldman Sachs Personal finance Economy of Norway Toronto-Dominion Bank Guaranteed minimum income Wheel of Fortune Dividend Copyleft Unemployment No Child Left Behind Act United States Postal Service 529 plan Taxation in the Republic of Ireland PE ratio Economy of Pakistan Finance Economy of the United States Unemployment benefit Public policy Economy of South Africa
