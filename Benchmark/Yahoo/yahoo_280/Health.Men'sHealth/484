i may have a problem with my foreskin when a man with a foreskin is erect is he meant to be able to pull the foreskin all the way back to reveal the whole head of the penis i am only able to pull my foreskin back halfway it simply wont go back any further without hurting because of the bit of skin that connects the foreskin to the head i am not looking for any stupid answers i just want to know if this is normal thanks in advance it sounds like you might have a tight frenulum link the bit of connective tissue that tethers the foreskin to the glans penis head a tight frenulum is often treated in much the same way as phimosis a condition where the foreskin opening is too tight narrow the first thing you should try are stretching exercises link towards the bottom for the frenulum certain prescription creams may work as well link in any case a tight frenulum is a rather minor issue that is usually easily resolved circumcision for such a condition is overkill and you should ignore any comments opinions suggesting that circumcision is the first best option because it might actually be the worst Penis Foreskin Foreskin restoration Frenulum Circumcision Erection Masturbation Balanitis xerotica obliterans Gliding action Ridged band Intersex surgery Balanitis Body modification Glans penis Smegma Plastic surgery Vulva Penile cancer Female genital cutting Erectile dysfunction Oral sex Human penis size Penis enlargement Prince Albert piercing Circumcision in the Bible Strap-on dildo Sexual fetishism Subincision Androgen insensitivity syndrome Genital modification and mutilation Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus Clitoris Prostate cancer Orgasm Breastfeeding Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Human sexuality Massage Skin Urinary incontinence David Reimer Circumcision advocacy First aid Stomach cancer Sexual arousal Obstetrics Plame affair Modem Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Penis removal Horse tack Psoriasis Equine conformation Gay slang Erogenous zone Body piercing AIDS Sexual intercourse Nudity Cryptorchidism Social rule Contract Corpus cavernosum Canon (fiction) Chancroid Radiation therapy Textile manufacturing Man Poker jargon Carpal tunnel syndrome Holy Prepuce Professional wrestling holds Wound Sharia Anchor Acne Sex assignment History of intersex surgery Cascading Style Sheets Premature ejaculation Gospel of Thomas Fecal incontinence Cervical cancer Spina bifida Battle of the Bulge Swingout Pre-ejaculate Stopping power Genital integrity Kyle Broflovski Cephalic disorder Sleep apnea
