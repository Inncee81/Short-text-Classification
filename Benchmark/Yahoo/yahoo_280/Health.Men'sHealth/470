erection troubles hello i have masturbated for several years recently i had my first sexual encounter with my girlfriend and we had some troubles i am by no means small just under seven inches but had some trouble with slipping out this is when i noticed that i do not get completely hard when i masturbate or have sex this doesn't pose a problem when i masturbate since i can still get adequate stimulation i don't believe the cause of my dysfunction is physical but i can't figure out why this is happening i feel embarrassed and alone in my situation and i cannot get a doctor because i am a minor and my parents would be a little upset to learn around my sexual activities any helpful answers will be greatly appreciated thanks for the kind answers so far yes we are using condoms you guys have made me feel better and given me some good info i hope to see some more answers hey bro i had the same problem the first few times i had sex my first problem was that i wasn't mentally ready for it i thought i was but when the time came i kinda got scared to be honest with you i was a really good straight a kinda kid the only way i could actually have sex was if we did foreplay and oral before its like learning how to walk before you can run also try not to think too hard about it or you may start stressing yourself just take it easy and if you need to tell your girlfriend to help you do it better to be honest than to look like a fool be safe and don't rush nobody knocks it out of the park their very first time good luck Human sexual behavior Condom Sexual intercourse Anal sex Child sexuality Oral sex Strap-on dildo Transactional analysis Richard Feynman Humphrey Bogart Premature ejaculation Masturbation Cybersex Proper Condom Use Penis Narcissism Sexual abstinence The Ashlee Simpson Show Mutual masturbation Child pornography Kyle Broflovski Child sexual abuse Friends Children of God Sexual orientation Anorgasmia Orgasm Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Scientology beliefs and practices One Tree Hill (TV series) Zoophilia Can't Hardly Wait Sex and the City Urinary incontinence Ex-gay Phone sex Boston Public Human sexuality Birth control 2000 Australian Grand Prix George Costanza Erectile dysfunction Pitaten Sex education Rape Pornography The nature of God in Western theology Recurring South Park characters Homophobia Autism Shaggy dog story Circumcision Herpes simplex virus Anorexia nervosa Breastfeeding Sexual dysfunction Charles Goodyear Stuttering Rain Man Bondage (BDSM) Milton H.
