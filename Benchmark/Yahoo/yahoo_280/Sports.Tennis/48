why does roger feder stay at points in rankings roger has stayed at points while nadal and others keep on gaining points answers plz the reason behind your query lies in how the ranking system works the system is a month rollling system each player has to defend the number of points in the current weak which he won the correspoding week in the previous year if the player gets number of points equal to what he she earned the same week previous year then no change to his points he neither gains nor loses anything but if the player gets number of points less than what he she earned the same week previous year then he loses the difference of points and if the player gets number of points more than what he she earned the same week previous year then and only then he gains some points eg if marion bartoli reached rd round of wimbledon and last year and this year she reached the final she obviously pocketed a large number of points apart from some really hard core money so you understand my friend roger has not won more points in any week this year than he won last year however he last year lost to andy murray in cinncinati masters so we must see an increase in his number of points if he crosses the round he reached last year at the same venue and same week especially when the possibilities of andy playing that event this year are very thin i hope i helped you clarify your doubt you talk about other players they have obviously gained more number of points in at least some weeks this year than last year Roger Federer Andre Agassi Rafael Nadal Association of Tennis Professionals Pete Sampras The Championships, Wimbledon Andy Roddick Andrew Murray (tennis player) Bj__rn Borg Poker jargon Wheel of Fortune ELO rating system Tennis Open Era Steffi Graf Gustavo Kuerten Family Feud Lleyton Hewitt Tim Henman Serena Williams Go ranks and ratings Martina Hingis Ra (board game) Boris Becker Alex Ferguson Martina Navratilova Crystal Palace F.C.
