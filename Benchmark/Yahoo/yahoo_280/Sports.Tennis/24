head racquets i was thinking about buyinog a liquidmetal prestige and i was wondering if anyone here has played with one i was interested in the in head size and i'm a player who is currently using head liquidmetal with luxilon big banger string strung at i'm a high school player i haven t played with the liquidmetal so i can t comment on its playability but if you are using big banger string you obviously must hit the ball hard probably with a lot of spin the liquidmetal prestige is a pretty heavy racquet so you might not be able to generate as much racquet head speed i have several liquidmetal prestige midplus racquets on the shelf as reminders of my days this racquet is ideal for a baseliner with a big swing who can generate their own power what i love most about the racquet is the solid feel on ball contact there is little vibration on impact now a days i play with an oversize lightweight racquet so if you are interested i will let my liquidmetal prestige midplus racquets go for a decent price hope this helps robert Badminton Squash (sport) Tennis Real tennis Table tennis Racquetball Racquets (sport) Seishun Academy Middle School Serve (tennis) Billiards Fast bowling Double bass Volleyball Equine conformation Grip (tennis) Roger Federer Golf club (equipment) Baseball Stars Golf Pete Sampras Batting (cricket) Cricket ball Eight ball Bass guitar Andre Agassi Snooker Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cricket Bill Tilden Softball Baseball Fielding (cricket) Satchel Paige Pinball 2000 Australian Grand Prix A-ha Forehand Tris Speaker Field hockey Bowling strategy (cricket) Paintball Ravi Shastri Four square American handball String instrument English cricket team Tetherball Time Out of Mind Wind turbine Plastic New York Giants Textile manufacturing Saxophone Clarinet Viola David Bowie Collision Seventh Sea (collectible card game) RuneScape weapons Piano Gaelic handball I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Sonic Advance 3 Unreal History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Bullet Hard disk Marching band Helicopter Violin Types of bowlers in cricket Mario Kart 64 Vacuum Laws of cricket Stick__ Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
