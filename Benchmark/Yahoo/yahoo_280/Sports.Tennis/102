can someone explain how tennis is played i enjoy watching it but do not understand how points are awarded some basic rules stuff like that here is how a tennis match goes from start to finish toss a coin and pick heads or tails the winner of the toss decides who will serve first the loser decides which side of the court each player will start on first in a tennis match you must win or more points to win a game depending on how many points the other player has won either or games to win a set depending on how many games the other player has won and you must win out of the sets played to win a match if you win the first two sets there is no need to play a third you have already won the match each game both players start at love which means points in tennis st point is called nd point is called rd point is called th point wins the game so if the server wins the first point the score is love but if the receiver wins it it's called love the server's score is always anounced first so if the server wins the first two points and the receiver wins the next point the score is called you must win a game by at least two points so if both players have reached or duece you must continue playing the game until one player wins two consecutive points when the score is deuce if the server wins the next point the score is then called ad in or advantage servers name if the server looses the duece point then the score is called ad out or advantage receivers name if the score is ad in and the server wins the next point he has won the game if he looses that point the score goes back to deuce theoretically a deuce game can go on forever until one player wins two consecutive points the server starts the game by serving into the deuce court right hand side of the court diagonally trying to get the ball in the opposite service box you get two tries if the serve goes in the box the point is started but if it doesn't then it's called a fault and you get a second chance if the server faults twice double fault they loose the point on the next point the server then moves to the other side and serves from the ad court or left side of the court play continues like that rotating sides after every point if the ball touches the net on the serve but lands correctly in the service box it's called a let serve and it's basically a do over you can have as many lets as you need because you are not penalized for a let ball however if the ball touches the net on a serve but lands outside the service box it's a fault at any other point in the game if the ball touches the net it's still considered to be in play if you toss the ball before a serve but catch it in your hand or let it drop to the ground it's not a fault and you are not penalized however if you make any attempt to hit the ball before serving even if you miss it will count as a fault if it doesn't go in the service box each set the first player to win games wins the set as long as you win by two games for example if the game score is on your serve and you win the next game you have won the set however if the score is and you win the next game you have not won the set yet the opponent still has one more game to stay in it because you must win the set by at least two games if both players have reached then you have to play a tiebreak to determine who wins the set players must rotate ends after every odd game has been played ie rotate ends after the st game the rd game the th game etc tiebreaks if player a served in the last game then player b will serve the first point in the tiebreak the next two points are served by player a then player b serves the next two and so on basically the server changes after every odd point after ever points are played both players will rotate ends in order to win a tiebreak you must be the first player to win points again winning by two if the score reaches in the tiebreak you keep playing until someone wins two consecutive points the winner of the tiebreak wins the set match most matches are played in a best of sets in grandslam tournaments the men play best of sets but those matches can go on for or hours or more most people play best of both players must shake hands at the net this is an unofficial sportsmanship rule in tennis challenge system a new development in the sport over the last year and a half has been the hawkeye challenge system in tournaments played on hardcourts each player has two challenges per set in which they can challenge a line call in or out example if player hits a ball that is called out but he she saw it as good they can challenge the call and a computer enhanced video replay is show on the bigscreen if player was correct the call is overturned and they will either replay the point if player was close enough to the ball to be able to return it or player will automatically win the point if player had no possible way of returning it if a player wins a challenge they keep their two challenges but if they loose the challenge they automatically loose the point and they have one of their challenges taken away terminology rally period of time when the ball is in play ace when a player serves a good
