roger federer really the best ever i read lots of answers on this subject a few really goods too but still i don't see why numbers and statistics could make someone the best ever for example nobody mentioned agassi one of the best players that ever was with a fantastic career so is federer considered the best ever only because he keep breaking tennis records or because he play the best tennis ever was this are really my favorite question why because give me the opportunity to say what i really think federer the best ever no no no statistically maybe he'll going to break other tennis records number of grand slams won weeks as number one etc but he'll never going to win roland garros and even if his challengers for the 'best ever' title don't have all the slams in their record he still need that title as for his game nothing to say he is a complete player he knows every tennis shots but his main weapon is his mental strength break that and federer is gone to justify that he can't win roland garros 'cause nadal is not scared at all of mighty federer on clay and the wimbledon final after contesting the ball that nadal challenged and won ugly reaction coming from that always calm and modest federer at the and you mentioned here agassi yes i agree with you he was a great player one of the best but no one thinks of him because he don't have so many wins as federer does and that's the thing that make a player great numbers or so seams to think lots of people these days Rafael Nadal Roger Federer Association of Tennis Professionals Tennis Pete Sampras Andy Roddick Bj__rn Borg Marat Safin Justine Henin-Hardenne French Open Grand Slam (tennis) Virginia Ruano Pascual Steffi Graf Andrew Murray (tennis player) Mark Philippoussis Lleyton Hewitt Tennis Open Era Monica Seles Lindsay Davenport Ai Sugiyama Table tennis Chris Evert Serena Williams Elena Dementieva Martina Navratilova Billie Jean King Thomas Muster Tennis Masters Cup Jim Courier Sports timeline Kim Clijsters Tennis strategy Boris Becker Jimmy Connors Michael Chang James Blake Ivan Lendl Goran Ivani__evi__ Mats Wilander Women's Tennis Association Igor Andreev 2005 US Open Rod Laver Jennifer Capriati Pete Sampras Tennis Yevgeny Kafelnikov Stefan Edberg Don Budge Nikolay Davydenko Roy Emerson John Newcombe Michael Stich ELO rating system Jana Novotn__ Ivan Ljubi__i__ Forehand Badminton Tiger Woods Mary Pierce Arantxa S__nchez Vicario Pam Shriver Kimiko Date Lottie Dod Fernando Gonz__lez John Lloyd (tennis player) Jarkko Nieminen Marcelo R__os Guillermo Coria Richard Gasquet Roland Garros Juan Carlos Ferrero Home run Bill Tilden Sergi Bruguera Fred Perry Agust__n Calleri Maria Sharapova Venus Williams Dream Job (Season 2) Grand Slam title Rugby union Sania Mirza Patrick Rafter June 2005 in sports Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005
