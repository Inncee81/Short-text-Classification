whose grand slam career would you rather have sampras' or agassi's i would lean towards agassi's a career grand slam on different surfaces pretty stellar sampras was a total pro and never lost his focus people can continue to use stats to validate careers but for my money andre agassi is the most talented man in the history of the court now that doesn't mean that he always showed to the dedication of a sampras or federer but i think he was the best tennis player especially if you factor in his height kind of short if he could have had another mph on his serves he would have had more grand slam titles over all i enjoyed watching the game of agassi much more than sampras not only did agassi win all the slams at least once he won a gold olympic medal i miss him he was the only player that i made a point to watch i can't take anything away from pistol pete but i would have rather lived through agassi's eyes Marat Safin Pete Sampras Roger Federer Yevgeny Kafelnikov Manicure Andre Agassi Goran Ivani__evi__ Lleyton Hewitt Harmonica Gustavo Kuerten Pedicure Nail (anatomy) Timpani Textile manufacturing Tennis Sock Charles O.
