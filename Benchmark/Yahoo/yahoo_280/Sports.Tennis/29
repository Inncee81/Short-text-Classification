i've been playing tennis since i was and now im thirteen and i just started squash i used to be really good at tennis but when i played squash i couldnt even hit the tennisball anymore how do i hit the damn ball i need squash to get into an ivy league and i love to play tennis my question is when someone does a high topspin and the ball goes to my forehand and goes as high as my head how do i hit the ball i cant do an overhead because its not high enough to do that and my other question is if the ball comes straight to my face in the middle of the court do i hit forehand or backhand imc for the high topspin to the forehand move forward and hit on the rise this will rush your opponent and put him on the defensive don't wait for the ball to come to you this will only put you in a defensive position putting up a weak shot for you opponent to put away you could drop to your knees and attempt to hit an overhead done this in the past as to success and one broken racquet looks good if you pull it off but not high tennis and would not recommend you do it a ball to the body depends which way you feel more comfortable returning it i tried to go forehand most times and either put up a high deep lob forcing the opponent back or a quasi drop shot landing just over the net depends if he or she is approaching the net or still on the baseline nine years of playing tennis and you lost all that skill by playing squash how long have you been playing squash i feel sorry for you you should be playing what you really have a passion for as for playing squash to get into an ivy league university i suspect they play tennis at harvard yale cornell last time i checked and quite well Volleyball Table tennis Tennis shots Seishun Academy Middle School Badminton Pete Sampras Professional wrestling attacks Squash (sport) Racquetball Grip (tennis) Serve (tennis) Glossary of American football Equine conformation Forehand Four square American football Water polo Fast bowling Steffi Graf Squash tennis Softball Batting (cricket) Snooker Professional wrestling holds Real tennis Aerial (dance move) Andre Agassi Beer Pong New York Giants Bill Tilden Rugby league Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Monica Seles Poker jargon Paintball Rugby union Suplex Cleveland Browns Roger Federer Canadian football Disc golf Ice hockey Basketball Sport Tennis strategy American football strategy Super Bowl XXVII Swingout Yale University American handball Gustavo Kuerten Bj__rn Borg San Francisco 49ers Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pete Sampras Tennis Comparison of Canadian and American football Tenshinhan Billiards Racquets (sport) Piledriver (professional wrestling) GunBound New York Knicks Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Cincinnati Bengals Knots Landing Ivy League New England Patriots George Jay Gould II Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Fielding (cricket) Paul Levesque Baseball statistics Breaststroke Football (soccer) positions Ivan Lendl Super Bowl XXV Golf Super Bowl XIV Diving Fancy Crane Rugby union positions Field hockey Norway national football team Mixed martial arts Lacrosse Jimmy Connors Eight ball Ravi Shastri Powerbomb Super Bowl XIX Sydney Riot of 1879 Super Bowl IX
