what is the correct grip for a two hander on both wings my little sister uses both hands because she is too weak for one hand on the forehand side should the left hand be on top or the right hand i agree with the idea of having her dominant hand on the bottom of the handle if she is very little she'll eventually grow and acquire the needed strength for a one handed forehand if she prefers playing with both hands then just let her experiment until she feels comfortable i am a right handed player and play a two handed backhand with a semiwestern grip on my left hand and a continental on my right hand but hitting this way on my forehand side sounds just like overkill i guess the best grip may be an eastern on both hands but the access to putting spin on the ball may diminish greatly because the stringbed will meet the ball almost squarely unless she cocks her wrists depending on whether she swings by her left or right side my best bet let her experiment what's comfortable for her good luck on the quest Tennis Grip (tennis) Fast bowling Tennis shots Equine conformation Forehand Serve (tennis) Table tennis Disc golf Professional wrestling attacks Baseball Volleyball Golf Seishun Academy Middle School Aerial (dance move) Contredanse Pete Sampras Steffi Graf Badminton Batting (cricket) Poker jargon Professional wrestling throws Cricket Swingout History of Test cricket (to 1883) Rugby union positions Cello Beer Pong Professional wrestling holds Billiards Golf club (equipment) Snooker Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles English cricket team Three card monte Softball Laws of cricket Squash (sport) Items in the Metroid series Craps Betting (poker) Revolver History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Punt (boat) Bill Tilden Football (soccer) Textile manufacturing Fielding (cricket) Cheating in poker Cricket ball Strap-on dildo Anchor Car handling Baseball Stars Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Left-handed Dog agility Weight training Helicopter Tris Speaker Brian Close Tenshinhan Violin Double bass 2005 English cricket season Lightsaber Mattress Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Babe Ruth Croquet Lightsaber combat Football (soccer) positions Card game Glossary of American football History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Heckler & Koch G3 West Indian cricket team Spin bowling EastEnders Heckler & Koch MP5 Rugby union Wheel of Fortune Bowls Circle (dance move) Water polo Basketball The Ashes Fable (video game) Diving Field hockey Mouse (computing) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Knife Curveball Floppy disk Baccarat French Defence M16 (rifle)
