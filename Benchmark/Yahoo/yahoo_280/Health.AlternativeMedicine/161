how would you help a teenager break marijuana addiction there's not a true addiction to marijuana psychological slight physical minimum the addiction to marijuana is more a personality addiction in my opinion it's a social thing in the teen years and a proven anti depressant so it provides the teen with more than a few excellent reasons to use it unfortunately the conern is that they will succumb to overuse of the drug reliance upon the drug or in some other way mess up their life so in a sense it's a drug that can be benificial to a teenager and highly dangerous at the same time to stop your teen from using marijuana requires the process of finding out why your teen truly enjoys marijuana addiction is a term way too early for teenage marijuana use even if the teen is using it regularly at that stage of life especially marijuana use has a purpose as mentioned above if the child smokes it socially as mainly a get together type of thing you won't likely be able to easily remove the habit if it is something deeper such as use as an anti depressant or as a means to make things fun there might be some underlying issues that can be worked on which might allieviate or remove the problem any quick tricks or hard treatments might stop the drug use for a short time but it will only perpetuate the reasons for the drug use i am of the strong opinion that understanding of the teen is more important that immediate removal if you met an adult with a problem with drinking or drugs and you simply said you're grounded would he quit so how can we expect our young adults to completely adhere to advice simply because we know it is sound if you don't understand the teen you will never fully get the teen to understand you you can hammer your position upon him her all you desire and they will still be confident that they know something you don't so in short if you want to beat a child's addiction as it was called you have to learn why the child even has the addiction Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Motivation Addiction Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Alcoholics Anonymous Drug abuse Tobacco smoking Drug addiction Arguments for and against drug prohibition Cannabis (drug) Alcoholism Abortion debate Controlled Substances Act Adolescence Cocaine Transsexuality Illegal drug trade Sexual addiction Drug test Asperger syndrome Prohibition (drugs) Infantilism Human sexual behavior Goodness and value theory One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Procrastination Prostate cancer The Beach Boys Second language acquisition Traumatic brain injury Anxiety Consensual crime Science Teenage suicide Medical cannabis Medicine Drug policy of the Netherlands Autism Expert system Sexual orientation Clinical depression Suicide Religion Psychology Legal issues of cannabis Dragon Booster Neuro-linguistic programming David Hume Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nicomachean Ethics Existence of God Causality Domestic violence Transactional analysis Annuity Sigmund Freud Cannabis cultivation Bradley Nowell Motion picture rating system Psychosis Ethics Theory of conduct National Institute on Drug Abuse Happiness Narcotic Only Fools and Horses Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aquemini Methamphetamine Scientology beliefs and practices Narcolepsy Iggy Pop Stomach cancer Elvis Presley Divorce Social psychology Intelligent design Reiki Self-harm Psoriasis Kurt Cobain Breastfeeding The Sims 2 Contract Traumatic incident reduction Daredevil Surveillance Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sly & the Family Stone Teenage pregnancy Psychology of religion Bipolar disorder Cancer Narcissism
