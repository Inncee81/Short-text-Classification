is it true that wd will help if you have arthritis i read that in a magazine and just have a hard time believing it does anybody have experience with this some think it's only the coolness of the spray some may be experiencing a soothing feeling similar to that created by actual topical pain relief products a look at the wd msds material safety data sheet shows that the product contains petroleum distillates skin contact may cause drying of skin and or irritation according to the wd msds it is advised to wash with soap and water if you have contact with your skin i have heard of this remedy for arthritis however i have do not have any experience with it my question would go beyond the 'supposed relief' why would anyone want to put wd purposefully on their skin it is a petroleum product the skin is the largest organ of the body and as such will absorb that which is placed on it the liver will eventually have to try to detoxify this foreign substance from the body with as much stress as we put on our liver through lifestyle and enviornmental pollutants do we really want to add things such as this to our overloaded system the best and most natural relief from arthritis has been acheived by hydrating the system drinking tap filtered or bottled water will not hydrate the body sufficiently to detox and cleanse the body these waters are all acidic healthy waters such as propel are even more acidic than soda it takes ten glasses or more of alkaline water to balance the ph of one glass of soda the body is constantly trying to detox itself of acid waste acid waste is as a result of the foods we eat stressful lifestyles and environmental pollutants no dis ease can live in an alkaline state that is why it is important to alkalize the body one glass of alkaline water will hydrate the body better than gallons of any other water you can consume many people report a reversal of diabetes arthritis heart disease and even weight loss alkaline water can be purchased through a health food store though through time it will get to be quite expensive and the oxidative reduction potential its ability to reduce free radicals in the body is usually not up to par if it exists at all i purchased my alkaline antioxident water device through www ionways com devore through research i found that all alkaline water units are not alike this is the best on the market today and is half the price of some there are archived conference calls featuring dr robert young researcher and author of the ph miracle book series on www ionwaystv com the beginning of the calls are people introducing them selves so bring it up and grab yourself a cup of tea until you get past this part the rest is good information i believe you will find useful hope this helps you can contact me if you have further questions at drdhdv yahoo coml Psoriasis Hydrogen peroxide Folic acid Nutrition Alcohol fuel Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coffee Sulfuric acid Tocopherol Water Hypoglycemia Future energy development Osteoarthritis Biodiesel Insulin Dairy Breastfeeding Portland cement Material safety data sheet Dieting Haloalkane Veganism Acetic acid Carbon dioxide Aspartame Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milk Hydrogen economy Chronic fatigue syndrome Aloe Ozone depletion Cocaine Tea Diabetes mellitus Vitamin C Cancer Nuclear power Vegetarianism Autonomous building Uranium Hydrogen sulfide Urinary incontinence Gout Economy of the People's Republic of China Ozone hole Ammonia Hydrogen chloride Cannabis (drug) Aluminium Water (molecule) Energy development Thimerosal Acne Fecal incontinence Beryllium Motor oil Menstrual cup Explosive material Alkane Stomach cancer Sugar Paget's disease of bone Tattoo Illegal drug trade Tooth enamel Titanium Battery (electricity) Caffeine Soft drink Raw food diet Sewage treatment Methamphetamine Glass Eczema Organic food Brewery Senescence Essential oil Fuel cell Herpes simplex virus Growth hormone treatment Fish farming Organic farming Tobacco smoking Fancy rat Ecology Hard water Soil pH Coal
