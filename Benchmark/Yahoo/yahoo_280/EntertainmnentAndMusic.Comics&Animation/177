any more new inuyasha episodes im really tired of hearing all these rumors that there will be new episodes or there wont be or there making movies i just want to know so the whole thing can be cleared up for everyone the anime stopped at there has been talk of viz media finishing it once the manga ends but the manga is still going strong and it's nothing official as for movies who knows none of the movies are even part of the true inuyasha just fun stupid little side stories if they make more movies it'll be the same just pointless adventures InuYasha Manga One Piece Sesshomaru Trigun Yu-Gi-Oh!
