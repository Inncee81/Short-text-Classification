is naruto manga or episodes better how different are they which would you prefer naruto manga vs episodes the manga goes through the story faster and the attacks are more real as in with blood as for the episodes the fighting scenes and conversations are longer but still really good it really depends on you if you don't like to wait then go for the manga for me i watch both of them i look at the manga for the story and i watch the episodes for the fighting scenes there's really not much differences in the story Naruto (manga) Trigun Hatake Kakashi Hyuga Hinata One Piece Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 2 Naruto jutsu Dragon Ball Rock Lee Manga Anime Naruto geography Characters of Naruto Gaara Uzumaki Naruto Naruto kekkei genkai Yu-Gi-Oh!
