how much stock must you own in a co to have a say in what the company does i was having a conversation with a friend and we were curious as to what powers does a common joe schmo share holder have in regards to a company he owns stock in how much stock must he own take an estimate before he has a say or influence in what direction the company takes it totally depends it depends on the companies specific legal structure it's operational clauses and finally how it's chartered within the state or states in which it does business is incorporated in what i think you're referring to is a smaller company more than likely in which case you're only as powerful as the percentage of the total company stock that you own meaning if you own i own and there are other people that separately split the remaining you are in control from a stock holder standpoint because no one person or organized group owns more than you having that said just because you have possession of the controlling stock in a company does not mean that what you say goes you definitely have a say and would be very involved but buying stock in a company does not employ the purchaser as a company employee moreover beware of that very diversified that those other people own separately it could come to pass that they don't like your influence on the company and subsequently band together as a group rally their control in the company and oust you from power as the controlling share holder they would have a lot of paperwork to go through first because they would all have to re title their stock in the name of the organized group before the group could do anything as the controlling share holder but you would know well in advance too that there is a distention amongst the stock holders the company is notified and in some cases must approve re titling of stock in which case you technically could have time to prepare yourself for a take over situation lastly a lot of very small mom and pop corporations are truly only owned and controlled by mom and pop in this case they are not a publicly traded company so they don't have stock you can even buy if you wanted to they are not posted on the nyse new york stock exchange and for all intents and purposes are only incorporated for mom and pop's taxable advantages in these cases usually pop owns and mom owns or vice versa so there is a controlling advantage from a share holder perspective hope this help Stock United Kingdom corporation tax Mutual fund Security (finance) Tax Sears Holdings Corporation Annuity Citigroup Stock market PE ratio Royal Dutch Shell Juris Doctor Capitalism Capital accumulation Wal-Mart 401(k) Dividend Intellectual property Bank of China (Hong Kong) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus New York Stock Exchange Time Warner Income trust Publicly funded medicine Microsoft Corporate governance Stock exchange Thai royal and noble titles Microeconomics Corporate finance Halliburton Wall Street Day trading Warren Buffett Trademark Arbitrage Plame affair Atari Option Housing cooperative Taxation in the United States United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company Tesco Short selling Treaty Economy of Iceland Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited HSBC Immigration to the United States Rupert Murdoch Article One of the United States Constitution Bumiputra Contract Cooperative Royal Assent Trade union Leasing Insider trading AMD Best Buy Viacom Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Surplus product Copyright law of the United Kingdom Poker jargon International law Mergers and acquisitions Dot-com British East India Company Sega Surplus value Trade BT Group plc News Corporation FairTax Economy of India Due process Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Conrail SCO-Linux controversies Flat tax The South Sea Company Unreformed House of Commons Municipal bond Economy of Kuwait
