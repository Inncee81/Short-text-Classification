is it unethical for drugs companies to charge high prices for their drugs in a way that's kind of the wrong question a corporation exists for the sole purpose of making money corporate ethics are like everything else in the corporate view based on maximizing profits in other words 'corporate ethics' is sort of an oxymoron i'm not anti capitalism i realize the profit motive is good for a lot of things but maximizing profits should not be the ultimate goal for example president clinton proposed a program whereby the fed govt would pay to vaccinate all children the idea was that the govt would buy all the vaccines from existing drug companies and make them available to everyone at no charge under the plan the drug companies would make a fair profit of course and clinton was able to show that this was a cost effective plan that vaccinating every kid would save more than it cost because kids wouldn't get sick and have to be cared for at public expense but the plan was killed by who by the drug companies why because they realized they could make more money selling the vaccines only to parents who could afford them in other words they could make more money vaccinating of american kids at the market price than vaccinating at the govt price even though the govt plan would have made them a profit and remember these drugs were developed with public money they don't actually even belong to the drug companies now of course this means that a certain number of kids would get the diseases and would cost all of us a lot of money so we are stuck paying for the care of thousands of sick kids not to mention the trauma suffered by the kids themselves and their families just so that the drug companies can maximize profits it's not really a question of 'ethics' is it it's a question of how we can best maximize the availability of drugs and health care the corporate goals of the drug companies represent a wrong priority drug company profits should be only the means to an end the end being drugs being available to people instead they are the end in itself Ethics Microeconomics Capitalism Corporation Externality Privatization Publicly funded medicine Food and Drug Administration Health insurance Ethical consumerism Anarchism and capitalism Wal-Mart Supply and demand Theory of conduct Economics Capital accumulation Public policy Arguments for and against drug prohibition Insurance Illegal drug trade Monopoly Mutual fund Tax Inflation Life insurance Business ethics Labor theory of value United Kingdom corporation tax American individualist anarchism Arthur Laffer FairTax Stock Theodicy Criticisms of socialism Health care in the United States Pharmaceutical company Vaccine U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Price discrimination Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Management Enron Corporation Deflation (economics) Flat tax Law of value Intellectual property Economy of the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton Gross domestic product Political economy Outsourcing Surplus value Liberalism Libertarianism Corporate social responsibility Commodity Strategic management HIV vaccine Bond Precautionary principle Utilitarianism Nicomachean Ethics Medicare (Canada) Incentive Mergers and acquisitions Arbitrage Public good Medicine MMORPG Software patent debate Economy of Russia Hyperinflation Ownership MMR vaccine Growth hormone treatment Criticism of libertarianism Debt US health reform under Clinton Free trade Scientology beliefs and practices Education reform CPU design Poker jargon Monetary policy Extreme Programming Eugenics Coercion Surveillance Supply-side economics Homeopathy
