how do you get your company to go scent free it seems that there are several employees including managers who seem to think more is better when it comes to colognes perfumes you really can't force this you could ask hr or management to send a memo reminding people that some are more sensitive to scent than others and to go easy on it i doubt you could eliminate it i used to work with a lady who claimed that the slightest scent gave her migraines she wanted everyone in the office to switch to unscented soap shampoo lotion laundry detergent etc we told her that was absolutely unreasonable we would watch it on the perfume levels but we were not all switching to unscented ivory soap for her convenience the offending parties at your workplace may not realize they are wearing so much perfume or they may have body odor issues related to a health problem that they are trying to mask so tread carefully here if you are comfortable approaching these individuals you could say something like i really like your perfume but i'm very sensitive to strong scents would you mind wearing a little less of it keep it polite and confidential you aren't going to win the fight to go completely scent free but a reduction in scent levels might be achievable if this would be uncomfortable for you get hr involved to handle this a guy i used to work with several years ago was a manager of a big retail store he had a teenager working for him who had not yet learned about deodorant she did not realize she had a body odor problem or that the rest of the staff was grossed out by it the manager finally had to pull her aside for a candid conversation about hygiene she was a little embarrassed but glad that he had pointed out the problem while this is a little different from drenching yourself in perfume it illustrates that scent is a personal issue and must be handled delicately and tactfully Perfume Multiple chemical sensitivity Surveillance Scientology beliefs and practices Sento Breastfeeding Plame affair Japanese toilet Procter & Gamble Fecal incontinence Dog Odor Strategic management Shampoo Sanitary towel Wood carving Milton H.
