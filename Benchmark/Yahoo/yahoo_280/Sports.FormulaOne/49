alonso and lewis rumors what to believe well there are soooooo many rumors going on lewis swearing at ron mclaren denies that lewis said alonso isn't talking to him lewis thens says what the media is saying aren't true and now him and alonso are talking and planning to meet up during the week hoilday alonso said he isn't talking to lewis and that he has kept his half of the team away from lewis and not to talk to him thats what a friend told me from brazil so i don't know what is happening and i know don't believe everything you see or hear and i don't but there's so much going on i agree dave p f is so much like politics every rumour is denied and countered with a second rumour i cannot help but think the teams even send out rumours to hide the actual truth right now i think every rumour about alonso and hamilton has a grain of truth to it hamilton may have sworn at dennis but it may not have been the f sharps presumed by the media or he may have spewed a string of f words bad enough to burn ears mclaren denies it because they can we're not going to get the full audio of that it is possible given the race result that alonso was frustrated and left the venue as fast as he could and maybe didn't make his for all we know typical gesture of saying see you next time lewis it could be that simple and it is being construed by the media as not talking the planned meet up could be that they are contractually bound to appear at some promotional event and thus will encounter each other there or for all we know they're having a video game fest it is hard to tell teams are often polarized around a driver each driver has his own crew and surely whether intentional or not each crew member develops an affinity for their driver they should of course because it is their job to ensure everything is ace i think that's one of the big attractions to racing so much intrigue at least in the professional ranks sometimes too the rumours are just fun to look at and wonder who the heck came up with that rp Kimi R__ikk__nen Team McLaren Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Paul Is Dead Giancarlo Fisichella Sex Pistols 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Fernando Alonso 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Plame affair Formula One Theory of conduct Ron and Fez Oakland Athletics The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Ayrton Senna Ron Dennis 2005 Formula One season 24 Hours of Le Mans Lostprophets History of Formula One Kylie Minogue Pitaten Juan Pablo Montoya Shaggy dog story Hip hop rivalries Poker jargon Guns N' Roses Jenson Button Spice Girls Garth Brooks Renault F1 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 The Death Gate Cycle Major League Baseball television contracts Apple Computer 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix Windows Vista Delta Goodrem 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Emerson Fittipaldi Janet Jackson Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Windows XP Bruce McLaren Mika H__kkinen RuneScape quests World Championship Wrestling Red Dwarf Tobacco advertising U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Contract 2005 French Grand Prix Big Brother (USA TV series) Jacky Ickx Plame affair timeline 2006 Formula One season Future of Formula One Oasis (band) Sydney Riot of 1879 Detroit Tigers The Jim Rome Show 2004 San Marino Grand Prix Roswell UFO incident Invader Zim Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind John McEnroe The Amazing Race Pok__mon Live!
