how do you break in your butt so that you can ride a bike for more than minutes without pain short of actually riding longer and more frequently to get your body used to it i'd suggest the following if you're experiencing pain after just five minutes you may want to look into a very different bike seat or look into some biking pants or both each week i ride a road bicycle over miles miles of which are done in one sitting as it were i wear proper bike shorts with chamois padding in the butt and crotch area and i have a standard race bike seat which is thinner in height than that of a mountain bike hybrid or cruiser it's also possible that your seat is too low relative to your bike size handlebar height and your physical dimensions the result would be that you are putting far too much pressure on the nerves in your groin butt area and therefore causing discomfort for simplicity and ease's sake try one or all of the ideas i listed above otherwise i'd suggest going to a proper bike shop and have them fit you on your bike hope this helps Bicycle Recumbent bicycle Bicycle frame Mountain bike Motorcycle Bicycle brake systems Mountain biking Triathlon Cycling Crash test dummy Tour de France Bicycle helmet Undergarment Traumatic brain injury Cyclo-cross Racing bicycle Jackass: The Movie Bicycle lighting Equine conformation Lance Armstrong Professional wrestling holds Track cycling Utility cycling Strap-on dildo Urinary incontinence Mattress Single-speed bicycle Hubert Opperman Mixed martial arts British Columbia Myocardial infarction Jan Ullrich Climbing specialist (cycling) Bike trials riding Tide Crested Butte, Colorado Tire Bike lane debate Rockers Welding Pain Chamois Road bicycle racing Whistler-Blackcomb Eddy Merckx Chopper (motorcycle) Derailleur gears Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
