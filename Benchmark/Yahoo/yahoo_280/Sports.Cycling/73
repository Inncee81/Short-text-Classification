pricing a used mountain bike i want to sell two giant boulder se frame and frame original purchase price was bike however forks were upgraded to manitou black and rock shox sid respectively new panaracer tires and new hubs on both i was thinking of selling for bike or for the pair does this sound fair or is this too high bah yes sorry about the details i wasn't thinking both bikes are models purchased brand new in june of both forks are models purchased brand new in or around october both bikes probably have between and miles ea combo of road and single track each are in good shape with of course scratches due to frequent riding forks are in great shape each bike weighs about lbs there are specialized bg grips on each other than what has been mentioned nothing fantastic in the way of components just standard factory issue for this model of bike the rs sid is a dual air i am willing to take offers on either one or both the forks yes actually the forks cost more than the entire bikes we thought that upgrading the forks was the best bet in the short term the original forks weighed over lbs each so we just trashed them not thinking that we would ever sell the sid weighs about lbs and the mani black is i believe lbs both very good equipment and well cared for please email me if interested in either i will email pics it is a little high i think unfortunately most people don't really care about the upgrades when buying a used bike ultimately when you tell them about the great upgrades they still point to the remaining parts of a bike i would probably start at and take each Motorcycle Bicycle frame Cycling Bicycle Mountain biking Recumbent bicycle Supply and demand Porsche 911 Mazda Miata Honda CX series Bicycle lighting Schwinn Bicycle Company Bicycle brake systems Advertising Laptop Dodge Charger Laserdisc American Motors Triathlon Chevrolet Camaro Chevrolet Corvair IBook Harley-Davidson Sunbeam Car Company Motocross Volkswagen Golf De Lorean DMC-12 Microeconomics Microwave oven BMW Trail Chopper (motorcycle) Ford Mustang Anchor Mitsubishi 3000GT Lance Armstrong Scale model Apple Macintosh Advance Wars: Dual Strike Mountain bike racing Pound Rockers Commodore International Inflation Honda Digital photography Hey Arnold!
