long distance riding while carrying a lot of gear on long ride my heart rate monitor show usualy to beats per minute depend on hills my cadence is about and i noticed that i did feel one moment little short of breath no head wind and no hill gear temperature c behind me km one moment also i start sweating so badly had blure vision and finaly i had to stop and take the rest it happened to me for first time i did continue riding after about hour of rest and symptoms disapear from that moment i feel just fine what went wrong has anybody this experience one moment in the saddle i did feel that i will have blackout it sounds like dehydration the temperature was not too hot and you had not riden too far so it seems a bit strange in your discussion you do not mention drinking any liquids how much had you had to drink up until then as far as being out of breath i do not know how old you are or what your maximum hr is but for me is about my anaerobic threshold so as i start going above that i start getting winded i have also had similar symptoms light headedness in the spring on the first warm c day i attribute that to acclimation to the weather after riding in cold temperatures another thing that comes to mind is hypoglycemia low blood sugar when had you last eaten and what did you have to eat that can make you light headed it is very hard to diagnose without more information but any or all of those things could have contributed i suggest that you make sure you drink plenty of fluids and if you are doing a long ride take something for energy energy drinks and or energy bars of gels on an average temperature day i finish off a normal sized water bottle in miles and as it gets warmer i will come closer to two bottles i suspect you are from europe so i am hoping that the water bottles are similar is capacity i hope that helps some safe cycling Hypoglycemia Hyperthermia Diabetes mellitus First aid Water Decompression sickness Dehydration Marathon (sport) Equine conformation Renewable energy Carbon dioxide Thermoregulation Avalanche Energy development Thermal power station Phase (matter) Bicycle Hypothermia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sun Recumbent bicycle Diabetic coma Coffee Rebreather Scuba set Intravenous therapy Drowning Chronic fatigue syndrome Stroke Time Out of Mind Myocardial infarction Explosive material Sauna Hiking Prostate cancer Fertility awareness 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Solar variation Guinea pig Common cold Alcoholic beverage Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Furnace Botulism Solar power Swimming Climate of the United Kingdom Urban heat island Heat Social rule National Weather Service Pneumonia Insulin Hydrogen sulfide Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Triathlon Brewery Severe weather terminology (United States) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shock Water (molecule) Entropy Nutrition Stomach cancer Siphon Pebble bed reactor El Ni__o Incandescent light bulb Milk Anchor Sleep Fire fighting Angina Plastic Chocolate Wine Motorcycle Traumatic brain injury Tide Speed of light Diving suit Steam engine Glycogen storage disease type I Captain Thunderbolt Cat Gout Panic attack Spinning (cycling) Anxiety Effects of global warming
