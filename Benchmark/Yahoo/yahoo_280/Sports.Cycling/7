what are the best kind of tires i should buy for my bike i only bike within my city i dont bike on dirt trails confirm your correct tire size check the label on the side of the tire it's probably something like x c or x the first number is the diameter the second the width indicator go to a large bike shop and ask to see their city tires or commuter or slicks in that size for an urban setting with lots of potholes and bad pavement i'd go with some tread but you don't need knobbies i do recommend getting the heavy duty flat prevention models for a typical suburban situation you can go with lighter skinnier tires that will feel faster and hold higher pressure to roll better the bike shop dude should be happy to explain the options if they don't have a good selection either try another shop or ask to see some catalogs so they can order for you good luck scott Tire Mountain bike Motorcycle Bicycle Mountain biking Car handling All-terrain vehicle Bicycle lighting Equine conformation Bicycle brake systems Schwinn Bicycle Company Racing bicycle BMX Bike lane debate Rail terminology Gramophone record Handloading Fast bowling Sport utility vehicle Cycling Suburb Mattress Motocross Stairway Theory of conduct Transportation of Los Angeles Poker jargon Movie projector Binoculars Canadian Tire Bicycle wheel Anchor Drifting (motorsport) Urban sprawl Transmission Control Protocol Chopper (motorcycle) Prostate cancer E85 Manual transmission Public transport Cyclo-cross Table saw Light rail Trail Redundant array of independent disks Expert system CPU cache Turbocharger Passenger car Normal distribution Utility cycling Betting (poker) Bicycle frame Triathlon Violin Wood Dog agility Recumbent bicycle Airport Street Ford Explorer Curb extension Drill bit Upholstery M16 (rifle) Road Segregated cycle facilities Singlish Rolling-element bearing Terminal ballistics Floppy disk 2000 Australian Grand Prix Drag racing Microeconomics 2-stroke power valve system Tri-Stat dX Bicycle touring Horse Vehicular cycling Bus models used in New York City Transit Scientology beliefs and practices Single-speed bicycle Bulk vending Speed limit Typewriter Roman road Water polo Oscilloscope Stopping power Road Rash Eaton's Chevrolet Corvair Compact disc Penny-farthing Hat Kart racing Oklahoma City, Oklahoma United States Postal Service Electrophysiology Craps
