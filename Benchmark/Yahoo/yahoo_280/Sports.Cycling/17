does anyone know a really good mountain bike i can get for about im conidering the mongoose xr but its a little too expensive at all the previous posters are right however i too had a tough time shelling out or more on something i wasn't sure i was going to really get into i spent on a full suspension mt bike from k mart about years ago it didn't have any good components on it other than the sram twist grip shifters which still aren't that great i have taken good care of this bike cleaning it after most rides cleaning the chain regularly and it hasn't let me down even once last year i found i was riding on the road a lot more than off and started researching road bikes as a father of kids under the age of i found it difficult to part with or more on a new entry level ride i happened to stumble across someone selling an older trek they guy gave a really good deal on it and now i'm riding that about of the time i still have the cheap k mart mt bike and ride it when taking the kids out for a ride around the neighborhood my recommendation is if you like the mongoose buy it but don't mistake it for a serious mt bike you will be disappointed go ahead and take it off road if you want but don't try any big jumps or drops i would suggest not getting a full suspension one like i did it's way too inefficient for light trail and road riding go for one with a front suspension with a hardtail you will have better efficiency when riding on the road and up hills have fun and be safe Mountain bike Bicycle Bicycle frame Shifter (bicycle part) Racing bicycle Lance Armstrong Recumbent bicycle Bicycle lighting Wal-Mart Segregated cycle facilities Vehicular cycling Car handling Equine conformation Cycling Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man RuneScape quests Diving CPU cache Volkswagen Golf Drifting (motorsport) Whistler-Blackcomb Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show M16 (rifle) All-terrain vehicle Sport utility vehicle Microeconomics Automobile Paragliding Bike lane debate Skateboarding trick Bicycle helmet Single-speed bicycle Milton H.
