why do bmxs have only one gear and weigh so much can i put more cogs on it please bmx bikes have one gear because they are intended for short duration efforts or stunt riding in these cases a system of gears doesn't help and in most cases it's just something else to break the reason for the weight is that they have to be tough to handle the abuse of jumping and crashing a lightweight frame and wheels will fold or beak under this type of stress you often find bmx stunt wheels with spokes retrofitting a derailleur system on a single speed bike isn't impossible but probably isn't worth the time money and hassle you would need a new rear wheel with a mutli cog freewheel or freehub and cassette a bolt on derailleur hanger a rear derailleur cableing a shifter mechanism the time and experience to put it all together and make it work your better off buying a geared bike at least then when you break it by trying bmx stunts you can get replacement parts Bicycle Derailleur gears Bicycle brake systems Fixed-gear bicycle Motorcycle Bicycle frame Hub gear BMX Single-speed bicycle Shifter (bicycle part) Racing bicycle Recumbent bicycle Honda CX series Shimano Total Integration Shimano Motocross Gear Cycling Unicycle Jackass: The Movie Manual transmission Evel Knievel Bicycle wheel Bicycle helmet Stunt Chevrolet Corvair Porsche 911 Poker jargon Rear wheel drive Cyclo-cross Car handling Tank Four wheel drive Bicycle lighting Mazda Miata Lawn mower Cessna T-37 BMX racing Automobile Locomotive Radio controlled airplane Elevator M16 (rifle) VHS Dodge Neon Equine conformation Citro__n 2CV Honda Prelude Axle Heinkel He 100 Rail terminology Cog railway Kart racing M60 machine gun Heinkel He 112 Novelty (locomotive) Land Rover (Series/Defender) Mount Washington Cog Railway Lance Armstrong Freewheel Glossary of partner dance terms Transfer case Track bicycle Hybrid vehicle Tandem bicycle Roller chain Emergency brake Wind turbine Knife Parachute Drag racing Mat Hoffman Toyota MR2 Dodge Charger Krag-J__rgensen Anchor Passenger car Messerschmitt Bf 109 Wheel of Fortune Touring bicycle Steering Front wheel drive Acura Integra (North America) Ford Mustang Penny-farthing Bubble Bobble Chopper (motorcycle) View camera Airbag Honda S2000 Phonograph Land Rover Discovery Tire Mouse (computing)
