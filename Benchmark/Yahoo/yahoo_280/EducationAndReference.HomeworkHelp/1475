obtain a sample space in the random experiment of rolling a die then tossing a coin once i really don't know how to answer like this one in probability which is in statistics i really hate probability coz its soo confusing and its soo random the sample space would be as follows heads heads heads heads heads heads tails tails tails tails tails tails there are possible combinations that you can get if you toss a coin and then roll a die you will either get heads or tails when you toss the coin and will get a number from one to six when you roll the die notice that two heads and tails times six number of possible die outcomes equals twelve i hope this helps i just finished a math class and we had this exact question in our book Probability Maximum likelihood Checking if a coin is fair Gambler's fallacy Random variable Martingale Temperature Coin flipping Genetic drift Fischer Random Chess Randomness Likelihood principle Entropy Sampling (statistics) Dice Principle of indifference Uncertainty principle Craps Stochastic process Probability theory Probability distribution Bayes' theorem Trip distribution Bayesian inference Estimator Monty Hall problem Normal distribution Information entropy Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics) Coin Likelihood-ratio test Expected value Bayesian probability Random walk Many-worlds interpretation Mathematics Quantum logic Bell's theorem Poisson distribution Almost surely St. Petersburg paradox Margin of error Negative binomial distribution Likelihood function IP (complexity) Pearson's chi-square test Hardware random number generator Quantitative marketing research Specified complexity Central limit theorem Lebesgue integration Failure rate Factor analysis Poisson process Determinism Zero-knowledge proof Dither Kurtosis Random number generator Identical particles Markov chain Probability density function Probabilistically checkable proof EPR paradox Exponential distribution Rasch model Doomsday argument Prior probability Dynamical system Census Quantum mechanics Statistical randomness Statistics Copenhagen interpretation Quantum indeterminacy Confidence interval Pittsburgh Steelers Paradox Physics Randomized algorithm Genetic algorithm Principle of maximum entropy Fisher information Complexity classes P and NP Measurement in quantum mechanics Median Interactive proof system MathCounts Inverse gambler's fallacy Binomial distribution Unified neutral theory of biodiversity Mean B-47 Stratojet Standard deviation Infinite monkey theorem PP (complexity) The Long Tail Orders of magnitude (numbers)
