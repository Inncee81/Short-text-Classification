list the primary smyptoms of refractive errors refractive errors myopia hyperopia astigmatism and presbyopia the cornea is the transparent tissue that covers the front of the eye read about the eye it provides a physical barrier that protects the eye it is also the part of the eye that helps focus light to create an image on the retina the retina is the paper thin tissue at the back of the eye that starts the translation of light into vision if the shape of the cornea isn't right the image on the retina will be distorted since refraction is the bending and focusing of light imperfections in the focusing power of the eye are called refractive errors the food and drug administration fda and the american academy of ophthalmology aao say there are four primary types of refractive errors myopia in myopia or nearsightedness people have more difficulty seeing distant objects as clearly as near objects aao says that in myopia the problem is that the eye is too long and images focus in front of the retina instead of on the retina aao says myopia is usually inherited and is often discovered in children under age often during routine eye exams read about eye exams between the ages of and there is usually little change hyperopia persons with hyperopia or farsightedness have more difficulty seeing near objects as clearly as distant objects a hyperopic eye is too short for images to focus on the retina so close up objects are blurry astigmatism astigmatism is a distortion of the image on the retina caused by irregularities in the cornea or lens of the eye combinations of myopia and astigmatism or hyperopia and astigmatism are common according to fda presbyopia this is the one most people notice as they get older when we're young the lens of the eye is soft and flexible but as we age it becomes more rigid this makes it more difficult to read at close range aao says you can have presbyopia in combination with myopia hyperopia or astigmatism Refractive surgery Bates Method Cornea Presbyopia Keratoconus Eyepiece LASIK Photorefractive keratectomy Amblyopia Autostereogram Iris (anatomy) Intraocular lens Diabetic retinopathy Philosophy of perception Nuclear explosion Stereoscopy Laser Light Welding Speed of light Macular degeneration Refraction RGB color model View camera Marfan syndrome Color Retinal detachment Visual system Gas metal arc welding Compound eye Pupil Eye surgery Eye examination X-ray Perspective projection distortion History of telescopes Binocular rivalry Ultraviolet Glass Ray tracing Albinism Optical fiber Floater Food and Drug Administration Stomach cancer Prostate cancer General relativity Tests of general relativity Microscopy Parallax Trilobite Retina Optometry Eye movements Microscope Drawing Sunglasses Dyslexia Refractive index Optical telescope Sun Binoculars Mirror Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cornea transplant Faster-than-light Light pollution Spatial disorientation Equine conformation Rendering (computer graphics) Leaf IMAX Red-eye effect Sensation Diamond cut Cancer Nuclear weapon design Rainbow Tuatara
