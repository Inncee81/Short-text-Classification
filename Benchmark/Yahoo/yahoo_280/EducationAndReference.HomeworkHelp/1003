homework help give points and find the equation of the line find the slope and graph i got with a slope of but i want to know if it is right please help this is a linear equation formula y mx b y is the y value in the coordinate x y m is the slope x is the x value in the coordinate x y b is the y intercept when you see one of the given point has a as x you immediately know that point is the y intercept y intercept is when x then find the slope using the formula y y divided by x x now plug in the numbers divided by you'll get the slope which is or the equation is y x to graph begin from either given coordinates and go up unit go right units Trigonometric function Linear equation Polynomial Projective transformation Complex number Geographic coordinate system Ordinary differential equation Quadratic equation Cissoid of Diocles Calculus Parabola Exponential function Conic section Circle Duality (projective geometry) Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Determinant Incidence (geometry) Legendre transformation Elliptic curve Vector (spatial) M__bius transformation Force Electrical resistance Function (mathematics) Trajectory Supply and demand Numerical analysis Cournot competition Gaussian elimination Curve fitting Tangent Dynamical system Linear Special relativity Coordinate system Quartic equation Discrete Fourier transform Roman surface Modern portfolio theory Gradient Minkowski diagram Joseph Louis Lagrange Line at infinity Elementary algebra Ellipse Coordinates (mathematics) Leonhard Euler Yield curve Astrodynamics Multiple integral Algebraic geometry Trigonometric identity Production theory basics Homogeneous coordinates Maxwell's equations Two-body problem Invertible matrix Newton's method Bessel function Quaternion Julia set Tangent half-angle formula Mathematics Mathematics of general relativity Combinatorial species IP (complexity) Line (mathematics) Quantum harmonic oscillator Kinematics Manifold Orthogonal matrix Secret sharing 3-sphere Green's function Harmonic oscillator Laplace operator Dividing a circle into areas SRGB color space Angle Hyperbolic function Cubic equation Square root Spline interpolation Hyperbola Self-adjoint operator Coordinate rotation Covariance and contravariance Data clustering Exogenous growth model Matrix (mathematics) Arthur Cayley Proper time RLC circuit Velocity Black-Scholes Timeline of mathematics
