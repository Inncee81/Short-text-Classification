the accused repeatedly urged him to do so stating that he had already sold filters and he needed to sell only one more in order to win a prize p besides which the filter he offered was worth p pereira agreed to purchase it as he only had p on hand the defendant said he was willing to accept that sum as the first installment the offended party then made out check no against the bank of the philippine islands for p and when about to write gervasio santiago's name on it the latter asked him to put in the word cash instead the defendant in turn made out receipt marked exhibit a promising to return that same day in order to deliver the filter the offended party in turn said he would complete the payment when he returned a few hours later the defendant returned to the offended party's
