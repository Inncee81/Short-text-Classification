what is matter and its properties i've never tried to define matter it's a bit tricky all physical materials are made of matter all solids gasses liquids i suppose everything that's not space time or energy is matter some properties of matter are temperature mass color reflectivity density hardness tensile strength elasticity electrical conductivity thermal conductivity just to name a few Temperature Phase (matter) Heat Carbon nanotube Helium Plasma (physics) Vacuum Glass Tensile strength Superconductivity Condensed matter physics Phase transition Hydrogen Stress (physics) Sun Ceramics Tungsten Plastic Titanium Spacecraft propulsion Beryllium Aluminium Electrical conduction Sodium Uranium Rocket fuel Steel Equation of state Energy Engine cooling Huygens probe Fire Diamond Emergence Liquid crystal STS-87 Physics Solar power Neutron Phonon Polymer Thermal conductivity Viscosity Mass spectrometry Materials science Chemistry Planetary nebula Pottery Plutonium Boron Big Bang Sulfur Solid-state physics Material properties of diamond Welding Phase diagram Chlorine Entropy Silver Zirconium Powder metallurgy Nuclear power Black hole Solar wind Caesium Heat equation Screw Kinetic theory Hydrogen economy Thermodynamics Electrical resistance Iron Young's modulus Polarization Synthetic diamond Hysteresis Sensor Fire extinguisher Greenhouse effect James Clerk Maxwell Permittivity Silicon Nuclear reactor Renewable energy Spectroscopy Corona discharge Electronic band structure Exotic matter Band gap Special relativity Metallic hydrogen Photon Diamond simulant
