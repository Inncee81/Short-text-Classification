plz help how does planes fly ok i am learning about forces in science and i need to find out what forces there are what forces course planes to fly and etc basically how dose a plane fly also can anyone plz tell me what does engines do to make a plane to fly engines provide speed required to achieve lift lift is the principal where the air moving over the wings is faster than the wind below the wings this allows the plane to lift into the air flight is only possible due to the shape of the wings the bottom of the wing is flat while the top of the wing is arched this allows the wind speed to differ over the wing surface a wing that doesn't have this profile will only allow a glide which is not considered by aviation as true flight Gliding Fixed-wing aircraft Aircraft Radio controlled airplane Glider Helicopter Lift (force) Paragliding Wright brothers Martin-Marietta X-24 First flying machine Aviation history Stall (flight) Flight controls Supermarine Spitfire Model aircraft Horten Ho 229 Messerschmitt Bf 109 Douglas DC-8 Bird flight Hang gliding Autogyro F-104 Starfighter Hot air balloon Mooney M20 Heinkel He 112 Lockheed U-2 Scramjet Wing P-51 Mustang Douglas Skyrocket Blown flap F-16 Fighting Falcon Avro Arrow Lift-to-drag ratio Propeller General Dynamics F-111 Boeing X-43 Northrop YB-35 Timeline of aviation - 19th century Aircraft carrier Airport Kitesurfing Edwards Air Force Base Flying wing Fighter aircraft P-61 Black Widow Boeing 737 B-25 Mitchell Waverider Blohm & Voss BV 155 Santos-Dumont 14-bis Convair B-36 B-24 Liberator Boeing 747 B-52 Stratofortress Parachuting F-35 Joint Strike Fighter P-47 Thunderbolt Mitsubishi Zero Messerschmitt Me 262 Royal Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress Concorde Planing (sailing) Sukhoi Su-27 Breguet 19 Fast bowling Space Shuttle program Equine conformation Performance envelope Professional wrestling throws Saturn V Hawker-Siddeley Hawk Ilyushin Il-10 Breaststroke Dassault Mirage IV Lift-induced drag Eastern Air Lines Arado Ar 80 Paper plane A-10 Thunderbolt II F/A-18 Hornet B-47 Stratojet Clyde Pangborn American Airlines Flight 191 Drill bit Critical mach Flight Unlimited II Atmospheric reentry Flight Red Arrows Tier One General aviation Planform United States Air Force Royal Flying Corps
