chemistry hello i really need help with the question that i have to answer for my summer ap chem hw if you please help me with it i will greatly appreciate it summarize the evidence ussed by j j thompson to argue that cathode rays consist of negatively charge particles a negatively charged particle is cause to move between two electriacally charged plates a why does the path of the charged particle bend b as the charge on the plates is increase would you expect the bedning to increase decrease or stay the same c as the mass of the particle is increase while the speed of the particles remains the same would you expect the bending to increase decrease or stay the same d an unknown particle is sent through the apparatus its path is deflected in the opposite direction form the the negatively charged particle and it is deflected by a smalled magnitude what can you conclude about this unknown particle thank you in advance jj thompson did this through the plum pudding model where he discovered the presence of those negatively charged particles called electrons however rutherford's gold foil expierement proved to be acurate look at this http en wikipedia org wiki plum pudding model hope that was a help Atom Gold foil experiment Alpha particle Physics Quantum mechanics Rutherford scattering Particle accelerator Electron Subatomic particle Oscilloscope Gravity Cathode ray tube Diode Speed of light General relativity Atomic nucleus Neutron Mass spectrometry Vacuum tube Corrosion Universal Century Technology Supernova Photoelectric effect Ionizing radiation ATLAS experiment Welding Black hole Exotic matter Plasma (physics) Spin (physics) Light Directed-energy weapon Antiparticle Cyclotron Current (electricity) Capillary electrophoresis Elementary particle Proton Newton's laws of motion Timeline of quantum mechanics, molecular physics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics Galileo spacecraft Vacuum Neutrino Electric charge Temperature Scientific method Coriolis effect History of physics Cosmic Era technology Flux Gamma ray Double layer Classical mechanics Quantum chromodynamics Ozone depletion Lift (force) Luminiferous aether Cathode J.J.
