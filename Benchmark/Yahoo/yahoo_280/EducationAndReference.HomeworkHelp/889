does anyone else besides me do their own homework just curious i've got a two year old son go to school full time and i have a full time job i still get my homework done by myself what i really get annoyed at though is when someone has a genuine question for help that gets completly ignored go figure well maybe it's not that that someone's genuine question for help is getting completely ignored you mean on ya here in the homework help category well i can only speak for myself but there are questions that i skip over not because i am purposefully ignoring the person but because i just don't know the answer i read the chemistry and physics questions all the time but that is not my area of expertise and so in answering and attempting to answer the questions my answer may actually steer the asker of the question in the wrong direction rather than help them solve the problem and it has happened a couple of times so now rather than give wrong advice or misled guidance as much as i would like to help i normally would skip on to some other questions that i do know that i can answer with greater certainty and accuracy so while it may seem like people like me who do contribute a lot are ignoring a seemingly genuine question in need of a respectful response not answering is better than my posting an answer that just says i don't know just to get points for offering not very helpful help sometimes those genuine questions asked require the right answerer to be at the right time and place and maybe just maybe the right answerers with the know it aren't online at the same time as the genuine asker thanks for asking your genuine question although you weren't asking for help it still deserved a respectful answer Theory of conduct Plame affair A Course In Miracles Internet troll Asperger syndrome Downing Street memo You Don't Know Jack Expert system Extreme Programming Social rule Shaggy dog story GED Transactional analysis The Apprentice 2 Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate Philosophical skepticism Little Britain Singlish Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Quizbowl Philosophy of science Plame affair timeline The Princeton Review Free will 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Education in the People's Republic of China Discordianism Unidentified flying object Supernatural Goodness and value theory Media bias in the United States Scientology beliefs and practices Meaning of life Altruism Zhao Yun Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Deconstruction Adjoint functors Religion Whose Line Is It Anyway?
