find thw domain and range of the following is it a functon or not f the domain is always the x values in this case the range is the y values this is a function the definition of function is that for every x there is one and only one y you can have values in the range repeated but not in the domain for each value in the domain the x's there is only one y Function (mathematics) Hash function Probability density function Trigonometric function Derivative Continuous function Numerical analysis Tensor Stochastic process Z-transform Relational model Bijection, injection and surjection Optimization (mathematics) Complex number Dither Expert system Limit-preserving function (order theory) Continuous function (topology) Polymorphism (computer science) Database normalization Recursion Self-adjoint operator Quantification Trademark Associative array Compiler optimization Absolute value Factorial Dynamic programming RLC circuit Multiple integral Linear transformation Gamma function Hypoglycemia Coercion Identical particles Domain theory Riemann zeta function Art Prices of production Ordinary differential equation Relational algebra Standard deviation Complex analysis Artificial neural network UTF-8 Lebesgue integration Completeness (order theory) Structural domain Signal (information theory) Series (mathematics) Median Programming language Random variable Model (abstract) Formal power series Information Services Procurement Library Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Trigonometric identity Ackermann function Analog-to-digital converter Integral Propositional calculus Space-filling curve Equation solving Punycode Protein structure Circuit design Vector (spatial) Audiophile Black box testing Particle in a box Simulated annealing Riemann integral Circumscription Tetration Large numbers Improper integral Symmetry Convolution C syntax Branch and bound 3-sphere Limit of a function Generic programming Derivation of the partition function Abstraction (computer science) Kalman filter Functional programming Landau notation Expected value Measurement in quantum mechanics Quantitative marketing research Sea level rise Pattern matching Arrow's impossibility theorem Ethernet
