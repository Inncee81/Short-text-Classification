fifteen more than four times a number is more than five times the number use n for the number i dont understand this what so ever break it down fifteen more than four times a number n six more than five times a number n set each part of the equation equal to the other and solve n n let's swap both sides just to make things easier n n combine like terms subtract n and from both sides n n n n always check your work plug n back into the original equation checks good luck in your studies mitch Complex number Elementary algebra Dimensional analysis Polynomial Mathematics Quartic equation Combinatorial species Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Matrix (mathematics) Conic section Recurrence relation Quicksort Trigonometric function Cissoid of Diocles Quadratic equation Chemical equation Group (mathematics) Nonlinearity Dynamical system Negative and non-negative numbers Irrational number Projective transformation Harmonic oscillator Exponentiation Ordinary differential equation Catalan number Enigma machine Gee Gaussian elimination Vector (spatial) Vedic mathematics Marian Rejewski Gross domestic product Collision detection Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Yield curve Bombe Basis (linear algebra) Planetary orbit Ruler-and-compass construction Brainfuck Money supply Debugging Astrodynamics Heat equation Square root Microeconomics IP (complexity) Equation solving Napier's bones Einstein's field equation Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Redundant array of independent disks G__del's incompleteness theorem Fundamental theorem of calculus Path integral formulation Reduction (complexity) Fischer Random Chess Fibonacci number Random walk Computational complexity theory Slide rule Logic Particle in a box Basel problem State space (controls) Riemann zeta function Two's complement Figurate number Discrete Fourier transform Temperature L4 microkernel family Cubic equation Siphon Storyteller System Separation of variables Thermodynamics Partial differential equation Green's function Atomic Kitten Arbitrary constant of integration Betting (poker) Trigonometric identity Vulgar fraction Quaternion Method of complements Trajectory Quantum computer Hartree-Fock Tri-Stat dX GURPS Naive set theory Schr__dinger equation History of mathematics Maxwell's equations Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Linear combination Operational amplifier Galois theory
