help with an essay i have to write an essay for an internship i attended this summer it has to be pages double spaced about what i learned well i am up to pages and i am stumped any advice on stuff i could add just to get the pages thanks everyone i agree with santa lol the only real way to increase the essay now is to go back over the information you have written typed and find a way to further elaborate a certain number of pages or words in an essay it just one way teachers find out how creative and descriptive you can actually be take a close look at what you have done so far you're sure to find several areas to expand on maybe instead of just talking about you and your immediate experiences in this internship you can add opinion about how you would feel if the position was actually full time you can also look back a consider talking in detail about what you experienced watching others who either did the same job as yours or were in some sort of support role to your position maybe even add your opinion about what you liked disliked or would even change about the position you held good luck Intern Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sydney Riot of 1879 Plame affair B3ta Alan Watts Scientology beliefs and practices Francis Crick E.
