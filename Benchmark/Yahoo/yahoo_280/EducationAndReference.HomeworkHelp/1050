few questions regarding to kill a mockingbird these are some questions i got stuck on in my summer assignment study guide for my english class chapter how does atticus hope to prevent jen and scout from catching the disease of most people in maycomb chapter contrast the two groups of men atticus faces chapter what does maycomb's turnout for the trial imply about human nature chapter what does atticus attempt to establish through heck tate's testimony chapter what does atticus attempt to establish through bob ewells testimony chapter what does mayella's testimony add to the case chapter what startling revelation is made about tom chapter why is it significant that dill should be the one to get sick in the courtroom chapter what is atticus actually condemning in his closing remarks to the jury what is the target of atticus' final plea chapter discuss scout's comment about the mockiingbirds in relation to boo i'll only answer a few sorry i don't know how to answer he established that bob ewell did not call for a doctor although his daughter mayella was badly hurt this suggests that bob ewell might have inflicted the injuries himself after he saw what mayella did to tom and was too afraid to call a doctor at that moment he also showed that bob ewell was a left hander implying that he might have hit mayella that she had no friends and what the ewell's background was like and she let slip that bob ewell got angry when he was drunk you'll have to read her reactions and atticus's questions for yourself tom's left hand is useless but mayella's injuries are mostly on the right side of her face this implies that a left hander hit her how could tom do that if he could not use his left hand also tom said that mayella was the one who kissed him on his cheek tom did not do anything to harm mayella he also said that he felt 'sorry' for mayella blacks aren't supposed to feel sorry for whites he is actually condemning the jury sort of i dunno how to explain he said that in a courtroom the jury is made up of many different 'classes' of people and they're all equal once they form a jury he wants to persuade the jury to bring justice and not be prejudiced this is a simple question heck tate did not want to tell the town that is was boo who saved the kids because he would be brought into the limelight and he definitely would not like that so scout said that to drag boo into the limelight would sort of be like shooting a mockingbird these are the best explanations i can think of now To Kill a Mockingbird Plame affair Sharon Tate YuYu Hakusho Jury trial W.
