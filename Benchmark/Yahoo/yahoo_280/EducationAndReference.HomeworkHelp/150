help me please with geometry the length of a rectanguler playing field is ft less than twice its width if the perimeter of the playing field is ft find the length of and width of the field can you show your work it really helps if you draw it out let's say a is length b is width and p is perimeter given information a b p equation p a b find the width p a b equation p b b substituting variables b b distributive property b combining like terms b add to both sides b ft divide both sides by b now we got the width let's find the length a b equation a substuting variables a order of operations mulitplying a ft order of operations subtracting so therefore the width is ft and the length is ft long i hope that helps most people say that the width is the longest but really it's the length that is longer Elementary algebra Ordinary differential equation Vector (spatial) Trigonometric function Ruler-and-compass construction Normal distribution Projective transformation Complex number Gaussian elimination Cissoid of Diocles Quartic equation Dimensional analysis Quadratic equation Conic section Stairway Trigonometric identity Polynomial Statistical mechanics Temperature Fourth dimension Einstein-Cartan theory Geometry Heat equation Function (mathematics) Combinatorial species Nondimensionalization Fundamental theorem of calculus Boolean algebra Quantum mechanics Movie projector Triangle Linear differential equation Topology Square root Path integral formulation Formal power series Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Laws of cricket Diophantine equation Mathematics Covariance and contravariance Boolean logic Dash Special relativity Joseph Louis Lagrange Circle Football (soccer) Computus Prime number Mathematics of general relativity Aberration in optical systems Pi Maxwell's equations Antenna (radio) Uncertainty principle Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Random walk G__del's incompleteness theorem Group theory Gravitational radiation Inequality Areas of mathematics Particle in a box Polygon Nonlinearity Eight queens puzzle Gr__bner basis Quaternion Unicode Mathematical model Astrodynamics Series and parallel circuits Flag of Denmark Production theory basics Galois theory Supply and demand Area (geometry) Photoelectric effect Slide rule Geographic information system Algebraic geometry Continued fraction Computational chemistry General relativity Circuit design Harmonic oscillator Parameter Contract bridge Linear regression Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Cinematography Heim theory Boy's surface Axiom Archery Derivative Exterior algebra Philosophy of space and time Economics
