how would you write the following text as an algebraic expression times the difference of q squared and r plus times the sum of q and r i know the question may sound stupid but i'm a bit confused all answers are appreciated though q r q r the after the q is a power so make sure it is superscript Exponentiation Elementary arithmetic Calculus Boolean algebra Matrix (mathematics) Combinatorics Dirac equation Einstein notation Clifford algebra International Phonetic Alphabet Covariance and contravariance Pi Umlaut Function (mathematics) Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Joseph Louis Lagrange Binary numeral system Decibel Computer numbering formats Pascal's triangle Lie algebra Formal power series Crossword Multiplication P-adic number Number theory Lebesgue integration Algebra over a field Modal logic Series (mathematics) Exterior algebra Tai shogi Galois theory Algebraic chess notation Regular expression Hilbert space Relational algebra Chern class TI-89 series Supermatrix Algebraic geometry Operator Complex number Multiplication algorithm Elementary algebra Convergence of Fourier series Gauss___Markov theorem Aberration in optical systems Polynomial Adjoint functors Chinese language Prime number Irony Newton's identities The nature of God in Western theology Negative binomial distribution Finite field arithmetic Exponential function Natural deduction Logo programming language Digital-to-analog converter Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Matrix subtraction Computer algebra system Atheism Steenrod algebra Napier's bones Discrete Fourier transform Bayesian inference Match Game Completeness (order theory) Determinant Many-worlds interpretation Vector (spatial) Killian documents APL programming language Partial fraction Social rule Group (mathematics) Shulkhan Arukh Theta function Module (mathematics) Normal distribution CPU cache GED Quadratic form Modular exponentiation Coding theory Combinatorial species Characteristic polynomial BASIC programming language Quantum logic Derivative Diacritic Stochastic process Basis (linear algebra) Category theory Boolean logic Filioque clause Goldbach's conjecture
