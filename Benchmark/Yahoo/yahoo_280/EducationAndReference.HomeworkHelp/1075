math question this is important the solution of a system of linear equations is the coordinate pair that matches the pair of the the two lines that matches the point of intersection of the two lines if that's the right answer it seems the question is very awkwardly worded Algebraic geometry Ordinary differential equation Dynamical system Homogeneous coordinates Geographic coordinate system Complex number Duality (projective geometry) Academic Games Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Mathematics Incidence (geometry) Stochastic process Covariance and contravariance Linear Line at infinity Trigonometric function 3-sphere Orders of magnitude (numbers) Naive set theory Manifold Collision detection Ellipse Conic section Orthogonal matrix Optimization (mathematics) Transmission line Slope Numerical analysis Philosophy of space and time Hamiltonian mechanics Linear equation Perspective (graphical) Cissoid of Diocles Vedic mathematics Parabola Partial differential equation Mathematics of general relativity Crossword Elementary algebra Dirac equation Geometry Aberration in optical systems Linear system of divisors Roman surface Simplex algorithm Diophantine equation Quadratic equation Coordinate system Special relativity Line (mathematics) Polynomial interpolation Topological space Curve Chern class Linear differential equation Gaussian elimination CIE 1931 color space SAT Algebra System of linear equations Determinant Nonlinearity Calculus Sudoku Geodesy Prime number Maxwell's equations Fibonacci number Harmonic oscillator Wave packet Cubic equation Trajectory Quizbowl Dice Sticky bead argument Exponentiation Tensor Longitude Bullseye (British game show) General relativity Spacetime Coordinates (mathematics) Adjoint functors Ruler-and-compass construction General equilibrium Hypergeometric differential equation Polynomial Spherical harmonics Schwarzschild coordinates Octonion 2 (number) Ruy Lopez Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Sturm-Liouville theory Many-worlds interpretation Order theory Geographic information system Quantum mechanics
