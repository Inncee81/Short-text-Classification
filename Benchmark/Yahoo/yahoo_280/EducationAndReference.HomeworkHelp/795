geometry help please okay well i'm doing geometry review packet and i am stuck on this problem can anyone give me the formula and answer it'd be so great find the area of an isosceles triangle with perimeter an isosceles triangle has two equal sides so the area could be anywhere from to approximetly square units in the first case two sides would be and the base for the maximum all three sides would be making it an equalaterial triangle the area of a triangle is s s a s b s c where s a b c or the one half the permiter since sides are equal that reduces to s s a s b where s a b since the permiter is than s therefore the area can be simplied to a b now since a b b a substitution into the above equation gives a a a a a a again the maximum is a with an area of sq units Triangle Pythagorean theorem Lattice (group) Trigonometric function Geometry Pi Archimedes Polygon Circle Quadrilateral Area (geometry) Trigonometric identity Collision detection Haversine formula Quadratic equation Spherical trigonometry Josip Plemelj Pascal's triangle Antenna (radio) Desargues' theorem Square root of 2 Combinatorics Finite element method Irrational number Parallel postulate Inflation Affine geometry Galois theory Kepler's laws of planetary motion GED Complex number Euclidean geometry Elementary algebra DVD Cissoid of Diocles Hipparchus (astronomer) Quartic equation Heron's formula Calculus Joseph Louis Lagrange Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Function (mathematics) Parallax Slide rule Softball Conic section Tessellation Congruence (geometry) Catalan number Symmetry combinations Analytic geometry Dundas Square Algebraic geometry Ellipse Trigonometry Golden ratio Trajectory Binomial coefficient Angle Betting (poker) Energy Explosive material Diophantine equation Aberration in optical systems Tangram Ordinary differential equation Gravity Failure rate Polynomial Series and parallel circuits Vector (spatial) Professional wrestling match types Adjoint functors Similarity (mathematics) Trilateration Parabola Matroid Derivative John Wallis Newton's identities Probability Astrodynamics Maxwell's equations Two-body problem Euclid's Elements Ruler-and-compass construction Polyamory L__vy C curve Projective transformation Platonic solid Circumcircle Metric space Heat equation HSV color space Slope Doomsday argument Naive set theory
