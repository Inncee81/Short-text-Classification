really weird hard integration calculus problem integrate the following indefinite integral sin x cos x hint sin cos let y x dy dx giving sin y cos y dx then do the integration and substitute back in sin y cosy cos y cos y cosy cosy cos y cos y now you can expand the cube into many terms of cos ny where n has values of to the integeral of cos nx dx ncos n x sinx n n integeral cos n xdx the problem can be solved but you will have dozens of terms and intergrals that is not reasonable it would take all day if not days if you feel you must solve the problem i would do by numerical intergration use your original equation x from to pi with dx pi put it on a spread sheet an sum all calculations not exact but close enough to give you place accuracy Trigonometric function Trigonometric identity Ordinary differential equation Basel problem Multiple integral Pi Bessel function Natural logarithm Trajectory Kepler's laws of planetary motion Theta function TI-89 series Formal power series Cissoid of Diocles Newton's method Integral Arbitrary constant of integration Ruler-and-compass construction Integration by parts Radius of convergence Debye model Timeline of mathematics Joseph Louis Lagrange Sturm-Liouville theory Boundary value problem Mathematics Haversine formula Heat equation Coordinates (mathematics) Cubic equation Taylor series Astrodynamics Derivative Quaternion 3D projection Green's function Pendulum Regression analysis Projective transformation Particle in a box Generating trigonometric tables RLC circuit Coordinate rotation Logarithm Fourier series Lagrangian mechanics Leonhard Euler Optimization (mathematics) Calculus Planck's law of black body radiation Mathematics of general relativity Golden ratio Polynomial Antiderivative On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Ellipse Euclidean plane isometry Lambda calculus Frequency mixer Elliptic integral Curvilinear coordinates Nuclear magnetic resonance Basis (linear algebra) Vector field Prosthaphaeresis Grover's algorithm Absolute value Phase-locked loop Schwarzschild coordinates Dihedral group Exponentiation Great-circle distance Riemann integral Laplace transform Josip Plemelj Riemann zeta function Linear differential equation Exponential function Large numbers Spherical harmonics Gamma function L'H__pital's rule Fine-structure constant Nondimensionalization Additive synthesis Gibbs phenomenon Archimedes Orthogonal matrix Tangent half-angle formula Polylogarithm Function (mathematics)
