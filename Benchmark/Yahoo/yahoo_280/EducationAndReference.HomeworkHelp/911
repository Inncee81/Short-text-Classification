emergency algebra two help please i need to understand this u u u u p q p q all divided by p q this is really long please if you can help me x xy y x xy y x xy y x xy y x y x y if you have any questions please ask them i'll try to stay on to answer them also just fyi is an exponent thanks ok this is lengthy but the basic thing you need to understand is factoring and also what it means to divide when you divide by a number it is the same as multiplying by the inverse for example dividing by is the same as multiplying by u u u u u u u u u u u u p q p q all divided by p q p q p q p q p q p q p q p q p q p q p q p q p q p q p q p q p q p q i hope that's a start for you to attempt the third one Elementary algebra Exponentiation Logarithm Computer numbering formats Quadratic sieve Polynomial GED Prime number P-adic number Binary numeral system Vulgar fraction Vedic mathematics Elementary arithmetic Complex number Division (mathematics) Discrete Fourier transform Algebraic geometry Multiplication algorithm ___1 (number) Dimensional analysis Contract bridge Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Gravity Ideal class group George Peacock Trigonometric function Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Vector (spatial) Lebesgue integration Galois theory Philosophy of science Divisor Tensor Exponential function Function (mathematics) Pascal's triangle Bayes' theorem Clifford algebra Napier's bones Philosophy Boolean algebra Matrix multiplication Extreme Programming RSA Gaussian elimination Biology Multiplication Division by zero M__bius transformation Manifold Circuit design Discrete cosine transform Orthogonal matrix Intelligent design Hill cipher Rigging Formal power series Mathematics Mental calculation Fermat's last theorem Adjoint functors Combinatorial species Multiplicative inverse Slide rule Continuous Fourier transform Polynomial long division The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything Elliptic curve Fast Fourier transform Maya calendar Grand Theft Auto (game) Meaning of life Where Mathematics Comes From Proofs of Fermat's little theorem Names of large numbers Age of the universe Fundamental theorem of arithmetic Trigonometric identity Hyperreal number Exponentiation by squaring Curve Quaternion Newton's method Runs created Monoid Renormalization Determinant Bayesian inference Philosophy of mathematics Species Partial fraction Associative algebra Logic Field (mathematics) Ruffini's rule Time signature Units of measurement Strategic management Matrix (mathematics)
