of mice and men opinion of mice and men is a very short novel do you think that anything have been gained by including more scenes from the time before or after the events of the story if you think so what could have been added and for what purpose if not explain why not thank you for your op inion no the novel is fine all you need to know about each character's past is already in the novel for example we know that lenny had gotten in trouble before we know that george is one who looked out for him and we know that everyone on that workfarm had a good reason for wanting to leave curly's wife was bored candy was lonely and brooks was basically ostracized the people in the story had enough of their past revealed in the book to fully understand every event in the novel adding more history or an epilogue would not have given the climactic moments any additional depth the two major events in the novel the death of curly's wife and lenny's death would still have happened at the same time and for the same reasons Memento (film) Bob and George Humphrey Bogart Taxi Driver Mickey Mouse Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Three Stooges Of Mice and Men FLCL Scientology beliefs and practices Supergirl Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Aida (musical) Law & Order Retcon Scenes from a Memory Lenny Bruce Shaggy dog story The Great Mouse Detective Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Nova (novel) Legacy of Kain M*A*S*H (TV series) The Catcher in the Rye Screenwriting Mouse (computing) Ostracism CBS Carl Barks Digimon Mythology The Lovely Bones Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Time Machine Ewoks: The Battle for Endor Wyatt Earp The Matrix Ghostwriter (television series) Alfred Hitchcock Life insurance Star Trek: The Motion Picture Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Garfield Sin City Doctor (Doctor Who) Paranoia Agent Canon (fiction) Kodocha Storytelling Free will Supernatural Treehouse of Horror XI Predestination paradox The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Charles Dickens Glen Jacobs The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Vladimir Peter Tytla Sgt.
