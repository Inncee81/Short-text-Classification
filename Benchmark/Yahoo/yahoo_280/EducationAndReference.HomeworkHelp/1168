how does critical thinking affect you as a reader and writer gosh i could teach a whole class on this this is a complicated question and i'll try to give you a good concise answer depending on what type of critical reading you are doing you gain a new lens with which to view the text for example if i were going to read a poem with a marxist critical view i would look at the text for examples of class divides stratification and the influence of wealth or power if i were to read the same poem with the critical lens of gender studies i would look for allusions to gender typical gender roles and stereotypes or references to inanimate objects being referred to as masculine or feminine looking at texts critically can help you understand what the author originally meant in the work but also what is implied in the work but not directly stated critical thinking helps you understand the text in many different ways and learn to think about things from many different perspectives critical thinking in writing plays a similar role there are so many things that you can say in a text without directly stating them an understand of different types of literary criticism can help you make sure you mean what you say but also what you imply for example if you were writing a love poem an understanding of basic imagery might be important understanding that feminine imagery is typically moon references being fair being white etc male imagery is typically the opposite ruddy bright dark sun like imagery understanding basic terminology or tenants of many different types of literary criticisms can help you use allusion and language in a way that others will understand and that will give your writing deeper meaning you must first know the rules in order to break them i hope this helps God and gender Deconstruction Gender Philosophy of language Literary theory Postmodernism Feminism A Course In Miracles Grammatical gender Hermeneutics English grammar Gender identity Sexual orientation Second language acquisition Literature German grammar Writing system Ojibwe language Gender role Hangul Social psychology Theory of conduct Philosophy Labor theory of value Bulgarian language Extreme Programming Object-oriented programming Hierarchy Economics German language Catalan grammar Hell Sex Martin Heidegger Capitalism New Testament Political correctness GED Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Cross-dressing Arabic literature Political economy Sociology Carl Jung Chinese language Vietnamese language Varieties of Arabic Philo God XML Tamil language Mathematics Goddess Hebrew language Aesthetic Realism Riism Esperanto vocabulary Urdu Plato Psychology Marshall McLuhan Sociocultural evolution Fictional character Esperanto as an international language Gospel of John Fundamentalism Eli Siegel Art Meaning of life Anarcho-primitivism Culture Republic Physical attractiveness Chinese character Economic inequality Metaphor Poetry Libertarian socialism Translation Gary Snyder Magic (paranormal) Goodness and value theory Microeconomics Homosexuality and transgender Portuguese language Predestination
