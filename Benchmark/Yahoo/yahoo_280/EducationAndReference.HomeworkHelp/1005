math problem could someone please help me with this problem thanks i really suck at math eight cards and three boxes of candy cost nine cards and four boxes of candy cost how much do two boxes of candy cost steps would be appreciated thanks variables cards c boxes of candy b two equations cards boxes cards boxes using variables the two equations above becomes c b c b solve for b by eliminating the c variable multiply equation by multiply equation by c b c b subtract equation from equation thus eliminating c b divide both sides by b thus one box of candy however we're solving for two boxes of candy so multiply x therefore two boxes of candy costs Elementary algebra Gaussian elimination Ordinary differential equation Vedic mathematics Quartic equation Dimensional analysis Planetary orbit History of computing hardware Mathematics Complex number Trigonometric identity Numerical analysis Operational amplifier Separation of variables Microeconomics Cissoid of Diocles Quadratic equation COBOL Two-body problem Linear differential equation Sturm-Liouville theory Matrix (mathematics) Recurrence relation Lagrange multipliers Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Polynomial Inequality Numerical ordinary differential equations Atanasoff Berry Computer Particle in a box TI-89 series Partial differential equation Exponentiation Conic section Heat equation CPU design Einstein-Cartan theory Napier's bones Square root Dice Trigonometric function Contract bridge MIPS architecture Newton's method Nondimensionalization Slide rule Welfare economics Joseph Louis Lagrange Mode choice LU decomposition Roman arithmetic Equation solving Computer Dirac equation Calculus Linear algebra XSL attack Land use forecasting Cholesky decomposition Fast Fourier transform Mental calculation Examples of differential equations Two's complement Density functional theory Compiler optimization Richard Feynman Trip distribution Orthogonal matrix Mathematical model Units of measurement SAT Ruler-and-compass construction Collision detection Astrodynamics Basel problem Prime number Synthesizer Quantum mechanics 1729 (number) General relativity Computational fluid dynamics Projective transformation Force Fibonacci number Tsiolkovsky rocket equation Navier-Stokes equations Economics Resistor Lambert's W function Algebraic geometry Newton's identities Sim__on Denis Poisson Single Transferable Vote Karnaugh map Quintic equation APL programming language Keynesian economics Distribution (mathematics)
