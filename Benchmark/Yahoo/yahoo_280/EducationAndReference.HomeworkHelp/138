explain why it appears that the professor made a mistake in computing the standard deviation a professor administers a point quiz to a class of students the professor calculates a mean of for the quiz with a standard deviation of although the mean is a reasonable value you should realize that the standard deviation is not explain why it appears that the professor made a mistake in computing the standard deviation i need help with my homework please thank you because std dev sqrt n e x i mean std dev n e x i mean e x i mean e x i mean e x i mean e x i mean so now you need differences squared that will add up to a grand total of so let's take the worst scattered case scenario score of that will give you the greatest difference from right and we'll take of those differences sounds like i'm ordering at mcdonald's lol so and you need a total of and that was just assuming that all the scores were which wouldn't give you a average i know because i'm just trying to illustrate a point here but when you have a large standard deviation that means that your scores are scattered and not clustered around the mean but i was assuming the worst case of scores and all the differences squared don't even come close to the standard deviation squared times that i needed so with just a few 's and then those close to meaning smaller differences well we just can't expect those to add up any closer than what we found with scores of if anything our total will be less than what we figured using scores of less than the that we found and so farther from the that we need might help to read the link i'm including then you'll see what i'm talking about http en wikipedia org wiki standard deviation well i hope that this helps and makes sense to you Standard deviation Normal distribution Grade (education) C plus plus SAT Margin of error Intelligence quotient Variance Pi Regression toward the mean Mean Modern portfolio theory Doomsday argument Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) General relativity Theory of conduct Hardy-Weinberg principle Z-test Serial number Quizbowl Linear regression Gravity Test (student assessment) TI-89 series Uniform Resource Locator Path integral formulation Decibel ELO rating system Labor theory of value Chinese language Big Bang Jumpstart 3rd Grade Hangul Crossword GED Central limit theorem Race and intelligence Student's t-distribution Wiki Quicksort Minesweeper (computer game) Asperger syndrome Aberration in optical systems Norwegian language Root mean square Intelligent design Redundant array of independent disks Joseph Louis Lagrange Computer Transformation problem SAML File Allocation Table Kepler's laws of planetary motion Bowl Championship Series Chess terminology Square root Real number Planetary habitability Education in the United States Diving Education in Romania Sex and intelligence Consensus Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Galactic Civilizations Software engineering Kapil Dev Dynamic random access memory Voting system Go ranks and ratings Vector (spatial) Special relativity Error String theory Uncertainty principle VHSIC hardware description language Condon Committee Supersymmetry Item response theory Finnish language Archimedes Escape velocity Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Python programming language Value at risk Gifted Operational amplifier Large numbers Random walk Computus Napier's bones Logo programming language Plame affair Standard Model Whose Line Is It Anyway?
