math problem needs help give ya points problems find the surface area of rectangle prism with lengh of a cm weidth cm and height cm over cm over cm cm over cm find the surface area of a cylinder with a radius of m a heigh of m use for pi or pie whatever it is m m over m m m find the volume of a pyramid with a length of m a width of m annd a heidth of a m m m m m surface area of rectangular prism cm surface are of the cylinder m volume of pyramid m i used your information of length width radius etc but i wasn't sure what the over cm over cm cm over cm was for but hope this is what you're looking for Area (geometry) Point groups in three dimensions Archimedes Geodesy Aberration in optical systems Sphere Multiple integral Fortran Map projection Pi Solid geometry Geodesic dome Fourth dimension Computer representation of surfaces Curvature Great Pyramid of Giza Geometry Lebesgue integration Manifold Pyramid Roller hockey Polyhedron Integral Triangle Clementine mission Circle Langmuir probe Escape velocity Black hole Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Oceanic trench Egyptian pyramids Helium Brush Spark plug Buckminster Fuller Amateur telescope making Flag of the People's Republic of China Literate programming Bounding volume Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Cissoid of Diocles ATLAS experiment Ruler-and-compass construction Computer animation Wassily Kandinsky Palatine bone Humerus Football (soccer) field Space elevator Aquifer test Pythagorean theorem Coriolis effect Diamond cut Drill bit Wallpaper group Tide Hilbert's third problem Collision detection Johnson solid 3D Studio Max Planetary orbit Cube Air traffic control Parallax Buoyancy compensator Monochromator Beretta 92F/FS Eyeglass prescription Henri Lebesgue Reuleaux triangle Sun Hard disk Ferrari 360 Cerebral cortex Rotational symmetry Moscow and Rhind Mathematical Papyri Hipparchus (astronomer) Trail blazing Wi-Fi Lens (optics) Snowboard Dispersion (optics) D-brane Vector graphics Turbo-Hydramatic 10000 (number) World line Schwarzschild metric M__bius strip Rebreather Computational fluid dynamics Car handling Explosive material Unimog Pyramids of Mars P-61 Black Widow Balikpapan Phonograph cylinder
