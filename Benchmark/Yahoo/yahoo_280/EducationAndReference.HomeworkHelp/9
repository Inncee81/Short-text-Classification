problems that i need help on please find the distance between and using the distance formula simplify square root square root well the distance formula is the square root x x squared y y squared in this case you would do square root squared squared simplified this would be square root squared squared this would equal the square root of number http img imageshack us img mathproblemhelpcm jpg i couldn't do this one without some paper and pencil i hope this helps but be sure to check your answers because i'm not sure if these are completley correct Standard deviation Quartic equation Complex number Mental calculation Collision detection Slide rule Quadratic equation Square root Elementary algebra Quantum computer Polynomial Sudoku Trilateration Gravity Catalan number On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Pythagorean theorem Calculus Joseph Louis Lagrange Galois theory Determinant Irrational number Series (mathematics) Newton's method Matrix (mathematics) G__del's incompleteness theorem Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Interpolation Basel problem Napier's bones Glossary of graph theory Age of the universe Domain Name System Combinatorics Shogi Quantification Convergence of Fourier series Boolean satisfiability problem Waring's problem Belief revision Cubic equation Distance Fairy chess piece Kepler's laws of planetary motion Quadratic sieve Pi Transformation problem HTML Ruler-and-compass construction Aberration in optical systems Rabin cryptosystem Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Electric field Invertible matrix Triangle GED Haversine formula Ruffini's rule Transmission Control Protocol Parallax Goldbach's conjecture Geometry Bayesian inference Wallpaper group Two-body problem Ellipse Halting problem Euclidean distance Magic square Kasparov versus The World Control flow Prime number Pencil Square root of 2 Escape velocity Trigonometric identity Minesweeper (computer game) Quintic equation Imaginary unit NP (complexity) Taikyoku shogi RLC circuit Archimedes Battleship (game) Polyomino Function (mathematics) Maka dai dai shogi Normal distribution Timeline of mathematics Exponential function Random walk Eight queens puzzle Root mean square XHTML Parabola Fibonacci number Miller-Rabin primality test Real number Chinese character Lens (optics)
