what's a goood idea for a boardgame related to math specifically to integers i have this project for math and i kept brainstorming and brainstorming but i canot find a good idea for a boardgame related to integers i'm in first year high school and this project is due on friday or thursday if you live in america monopoly each throw of the dice give you integers ranging from to the number of positions you move you also collect an integer when you pass go and you pay for property in integers there may be a number of board games where you throw dice to determine an integer number of moves Dice Fischer Random Chess Mathematics Board game Monopoly (game) Integer Memoir '44 Surreal number Craps Central processing unit Prime number Atomic orbital Computer numbering formats On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Natural number Pi Order theory Wargaming Solarquest Hero System Riemann zeta function Continued fraction JavaScript Carmichael number Logarithm Set Fibonacci number Dominoes Yu-Gi-Oh!
