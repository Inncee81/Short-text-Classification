math hw help can you please explain how to get the answer thanks x y x y p s how is g f x simplify it s very easy we can solve this tricky question by assuming x as another variable such as p and y as another variable too such as q hence we get p x and q y so we can change the question p q p q you can solve this question easily multiplying by the first equation p q so it change to p q you can solve this with elimination to get p and q don t forget to convert p x so x p and q y to y q the real answer was x and y about g f x this is a real classic problem for me many student confused with the parenttheis you can assume f x as x for the g example if you have function f x x and you have determined the value of x then you have f x f so every character in the bracket is multiplied by then added by in other word g f x are function which are the independent variables usually just x in simple function are depending on the value of f x i really hope this can help you feel free to contact me if you have any difficulty in any subject of math physic and chemistry you can contact me by email cheers Mathematics Ordinary differential equation Microeconomics Dynamical system Derivative Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace SAT Quartic equation Mathematical model Richard Feynman Normal distribution G__del's incompleteness theorem Path integral formulation Polynomial Quantum computer Particle in a box Numerical analysis Quantum mechanics On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Physics Determinism Visual Basic Scientific method Variable Elementary algebra Collision detection Mnemonic Model (economics) Trigonometric function Gravity Complex number Exponentiation Abstraction (computer science) Interpretation of quantum mechanics Compiler optimization Stochastic process Heat equation Linear regression Halting problem Hydrogeology Joseph Louis Lagrange The Princeton Review Economics Complexity classes P and NP Formal power series Many-worlds interpretation Nondimensionalization Large numbers Welfare economics Expert system Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Navier-Stokes equations Bayes' theorem Dimensional analysis Vedic mathematics Multiple integral State space (controls) Calculus Computer numbering formats Occam's Razor Bohm interpretation Density functional theory Prime number Password Sudoku Computational chemistry BASIC programming language UBASIC Luminiferous aether Transformation problem IP (complexity) M__bius transformation Series (mathematics) Experiment C programming language Consciousness General relativity Modified Newtonian dynamics Philosophy of space and time Force Renormalization group Action (physics) Perl Quantification Operational amplifier Projective transformation Software engineering Land use forecasting Lagrange multipliers Hamiltonian mechanics Partial differential equation Random walk Prices of production MaxEnt thermodynamics Simplified Chinese character Extreme Programming Riemann zeta function
