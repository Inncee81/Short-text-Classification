ethical question ethical forces behind police corruption are they the same as those involved in police abuses of force i'm not sure what this question is asking and i don't know how to answer it please help the question is asking if the ethical motivations for cops being twisted are the same ones as cops abusing their power so roughly is a cop's motivation the same when he takes a bribe as when he beats a black man to a pulp with his buddies in la i would say not necessarily as it's impossible to know why a police officer would abuse their power perhaps they don't realize they are abusing it perhaps they know they are but don't care maybe they are racist maybe they are conformists since their buddies do it taking bribes on the other hand is always for personal gain and in some cases done not to stick out everyone else is on the take so you can't be trusted if you are the exception good luck Theodicy Ethics Theory of conduct Police Reservoir Dogs Serial killer Sin City Nicomachean Ethics True Crime: Streets of LA Coercion Altruism Clancy Wiggum Manhunt (video game) Torture Law & Order The Untouchables Joke Schapelle Corby Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Internet troll Domestic violence Lie Cult Daryl Gates Bribery Ethical consumerism South Park Mumia Abu-Jamal United States House of Representatives Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stopping power Nick Berg conspiracy theories Child pornography The Shield Socrates Punk ideology Abortion debate Goodness and value theory War on Terrorism Militsiya Friedrich Schleiermacher Reno 911! 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Summa Theologiae Utilitarianism Article One of the United States Constitution Sunni Islam Conflict of interest Child sexual abuse Social rule Plame affair Externality Merit Good Morning, Vietnam Political privacy Leviathan (book) Drug abuse Knots Landing Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Boston Public Business ethics Thomas Hill Green Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Epistemology Agent handling Schabir Shaik Trial Pulp Fiction Cultural relativism Racism Reparative therapy Philosophy of business Cruelty to animals Peter Singer Microeconomics Abortion Meta-ethics Objectivist philosophy Animal Liberation Front Guantanamo Bay 2005 trial of Michael Jackson EastEnders Science Human rights in the United States Customs and etiquette of Japan Cindy Sheehan The Demolished Man Non-aggression principle Status of religious freedom in France Rick Santorum Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Alignment (role-playing games) Incarnations of Immortality Hiberno-English Suicide Spanking Friendship Match fixing Philosophical skepticism Journalism ethics and standards Eugenics
