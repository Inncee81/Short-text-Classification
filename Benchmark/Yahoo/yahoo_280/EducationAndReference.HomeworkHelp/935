can anyone please help me with some algebra problems i have a test tomorrow and i just wanted to understand these problems more so if you can work them out for me thanx solve x squared solve xsquared x what are the x intercepts of the equation xsquared the squared thingies are like the the second power i wrote it out in paint if you dont understand anything e mail me good luck in your exam http img imageshack us img untitledht ey jpg Exponentiation Ruler-and-compass construction Elementary algebra Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Quartic equation Prime number Algebraic geometry Extreme Programming Dirac equation Supersymmetry Linear algebra Joseph Louis Lagrange Mathematics Engineering Exact solutions in general relativity Galois theory Matrix (mathematics) Newton's method The Princeton Review Bayesian inference Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Linear equation P-adic number Quadratic equation Numerical analysis Algebra Square root Finite element method Pedro Nunes Ordinary differential equation Planetary orbit Normal mode International Mathematical Olympiad Timeline of mathematics Gottfried Leibniz Exponential function Evariste Galois Quadratic sieve Curve Hydrogeology Pi Recurrence relation Proxy server Combinatorics Distribution (mathematics) Perturbation theory Internet protocol suite Cubic equation Polynomial SAT Milan Einstein's field equation Cholesky decomposition Basel problem Hamiltonian mechanics Quintic equation Complex number Gravity Arthur Cayley Aberration in optical systems String theory Process calculi Computer chess Least squares Chess Path integral formulation William Rowan Hamilton History of mathematics Fermat's last theorem Uniform Resource Identifier Pascal's triangle Karma Inverse problem GED Physics Geometry Newton's identities Mathematical physics Massachusetts Institute of Technology Root-finding algorithm Uses of trigonometry Real number Apollonius of Perga Group theory Clay Mathematics Institute Computational fluid dynamics Singlish Dynamic programming Hilbert space 400 (number) Coming of Age (TNG episode) Moscow and Rhind Mathematical Papyri Deformation theory Actor model Logic Henri Poincar__ Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Archimedes Derivative Welfare economics
