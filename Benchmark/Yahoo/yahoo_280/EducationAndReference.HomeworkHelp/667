i need math hw help in rst m t and m r if th is drawn perpendicular to rs find a m s b m hts thank you the answers above are wrong for part a angle s is indeed degrees because the sum of the angles in a triangle is degrees t s r s s but for part b to find the angle hts you have to first get the angle sht sht is degrees because you drew the line perpendicular to rs so angles sht and rht are both degrees now the sum of angles in the triangle hts is degrees again the three angles in the triangle are tsh sht and hts the angle tsh is degrees from part a tsh sht hts hts hts so hts is degrees not as the others answered good luck Triangle Polygon Circle Angle Trigonometric function Wallpaper group Trigonometry Trigonometric identity Parabola Parallel postulate Euclidean plane isometry Euclid's Elements Complex number Hyperbolic geometry Archimedes Symmetry Pythagorean theorem Ruler-and-compass construction Ellipse Pascal's triangle Pi Euclidean geometry Josip Plemelj Prosthaphaeresis Cissoid of Diocles 120 (number) Spherical trigonometry Circumcircle Polarization Dot product B__zier curve Parallax 3D projection Bulgarian language Rational trigonometry Technical drawing Vector (spatial) Point groups in three dimensions Geometry Non-Euclidean geometry Euclidean group Descriptive geometry Orthographic projection Orthogonality Constructible polygon Root system Similarity (mathematics) Knife Billiards Conic section Sundial Snooker Haversine formula Perspective (graphical) Semiregular polyhedra Symmetry combinations Grover's algorithm Pentagram Local hidden variable theory Bloodstain pattern analysis Rotation Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry) Tetrahedron Cross product Logo programming language Affine transformation L__vy C curve F-16 Fighting Falcon Microphone Cauchy-Schwarz inequality Phasor (physics) Sailing Precession Neck Slide rule Congruence (geometry) Ontological argument FSN (Fox Sports Net) Blaise Pascal Mandible Curve fitting Altitude Torque Hipparchus (astronomer) Professional wrestling holds De Casteljau's algorithm Spline (mathematics) Quaternions and spatial rotation Fallacy CIE 1931 color space Slope Rotational symmetry 60 (number) Elementary arithmetic GED Declination Binomial coefficient Regular polytope Aberration in optical systems Glossary of graph theory
