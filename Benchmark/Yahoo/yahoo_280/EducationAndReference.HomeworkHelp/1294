i am doing the pythagoream formula and quad formula and a x b x c x can you help me solve this sure a b c x x x x x x x x subtract x x x use the quadratic formula a b c so answer sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt answer sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt so the answers are and Quartic equation Quadratic equation Square root Pendulum Cubic equation Trigonometric identity Standard deviation Combinatorics Trigonometric function RLC circuit Discrete Fourier transform TI-89 series Catalan number Complex number TeX Airy function Grover's algorithm Cissoid of Diocles Vedic mathematics Modern portfolio theory Conic section Elementary algebra Random variable Black-Scholes Imaginary unit Student's t-distribution Pi Four fours Three-phase L'H__pital's rule Particle in a box Linear differential equation Golden ratio Triangle Heat equation Continuous Fourier transform Trajectory Two-body problem Julia set Laplace transform Debye model Methods of contour integration Galois theory Parabola Bessel function Quantum harmonic oscillator Augustus De Morgan Ruler-and-compass construction IP (complexity) Phonon Coordinates (mathematics) Bell's theorem Ruffini's rule Green's function Absolute magnitude Quadratic sieve Spherical harmonics M__bius transformation Dirac equation Recurrence relation Hyperbolic function Generating function Simplex IBM 1130 Multiple integral Mathematics Euler's formula Analytic geometry Arthur Cayley Kalman filter Proper time MathML Astrodynamics Vector (spatial) Space-time block code Measurement in quantum mechanics Stirling's approximation Continued fraction Figurate number Root of unity Quantum indeterminacy Quintic equation Self-adjoint operator Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Estimation theory Ellipse Exponential function Random walk Absolute value Quantum tunneling Trilateration Greatest common divisor Clebsch-Gordan coefficients Heron's formula Fibonacci number Gamma function Length of an arc Irrational number Frame fields in general relativity Speed of light
