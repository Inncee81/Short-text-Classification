i have a feeling i'm getting scammed on an ebay auction what do you think i won a bag online i really wish i didn't now the winning bidder suppsedly did not pay up so she offered me a second chance offer in her auction she said that payment had to be received in days or negative feedback would be received and the first winner did not pay up but til this day she still hasn't let them neg feedback the seller said she sent it out on july st via priority mail it's the th and i still haven't received it i paid for her to insure the package and she did i called her out on if she actually sent the package and so she sent me a picture of the receipts she got at the post office the thing is she shipped from hawaii from i guess what was a contract station the receipt is stamped w the official post office stamp but the receipt was printed off one of those cheap registers that you can buy at walmart no post office address printed on it etc in the spot where the postman would write the postage amount on the insurance label she wrote it i have a feeling that she either works at that post office or knows a friend who does i want my money back i paid through paypal and it was she insists that i wait it out so she can file a claim w the post office after days but what good will that do me it is she who has to file the claim and is she who will collect the money from the claim correct i really regret buying from her she had great feedback and has been a member of ebay since i looked at her feedback and she sells a lot of authentic designer stuff but i noticed that my purchase was the biggest sale she's gotten i had a run in with a man whom i won a palm pilot and he sent me an empty box w delivery confirmation paypal said they couldn't do anything about it since he had proof that i received the package but i contacted the attorney general's office filed a police report and filed reported him to the post master for mail fraud do you think i'm in the process of getting scammed again you need to report her to paypal we had a similar situation happen with a college book i went off and told them if i didn't get my money back i would report them to paypal as fraudulent charge this will definately cause her to lose her rights to sell on ebay b c she will not be able to use paypal go crazy on her that's a lot of money to brush off call paypal paypal will investigate Internet fraud PayPal Advance fee fraud Mail Postage stamp Auction Phishing Neopets Confidence trick Microeconomics Postage stamps and postal history of the United States E-mail spam Wal-Mart Plame affair Liberty Dollar Stamp collecting 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Live 8 Security (finance) Lottery Mortgage Insurance Bulk vending Mensal__o scandal MapleStory Killian documents Charles Ponzi Post office Credit card Dot-com Spam (electronic) Something Awful Forums Tom DeLay Monopoly (game) Copyright Contract Credit card fraud Philatelic investment Spyware Taxation in the United States Poker jargon Trademark Short selling Tax ROM image Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Royal Mail Knots Landing Ocean's Twelve Roswell UFO incident Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Topps Make money fast Annuity $ale of the Century Oil-for-Food Programme Record label Google SCO-Linux controversies Skype Gross domestic product Automatic teller machine 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Publishing Public domain Extreme Programming Nine Inch Nails Craps MMORPG Electronic money Illegal drug trade Babylonian law Theory of conduct Steganography Online auction business model Gambling Best Buy Copyleft Florida Central Voter File E-gold Patent application Matrix scheme Enron Corporation 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Wheel of Fortune Karl Rove
