punishing credit card debtor what would be a good punishment for a credit card debtor who just does not care excluding those that cannot avoid it and those that are trying if it were up to you debtors prison maybe since they have no intention of paying the fact is that if they continue to do it i e file for bankruptcy every years then the judge sees the pattern or sees that maybe the person has credit cards and all are topped off then he may charge them with fraud then they do get jail time in addition a couple of years ago the law was changed and now at least until before the new orleans floods and other floods and fires in other parts of the country and people laden with medical bills people can apply for chapter but if the judge feels they should make payments and pay the creditor which the new law demands that they pay back most of what they owe then the judge will change their chapter to a chapter and have them hire an attorney to help them set up that payment plan Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bankruptcy Bankruptcy in the United States Debt Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Estoppel Tom DeLay Islamic banking Article One of the United States Constitution Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code United Kingdom corporation tax Appeal Babylonian law Credit score Child support Internet fraud Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Taxation in the United States Bond Insurance Plame affair Credit card fraud Concurrent estate Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Deflation (economics) Divorce Bank Mortgage Money Merit Tort Power of appointment Tax Corporation Life imprisonment MCI Schabir Shaik Trial Government debt Auto insurance Lawyer Cheque Surveillance Kent Hovind 613 mitzvot Legal tender Timeline of the Enron scandal Donald Trump Northwest Airlines Privacy Usury Medical malpractice Legal fiction Fractional-reserve banking Unlawful combatant Bretton Woods system Social Security (United States) Minimum wage Marriage Enron Corporation Jack Abramoff Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Jury Government of Maryland Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 9 Interest History of the United States (1918-1945) U.S. public debt Inflation Credit repair Debt bondage 2005 trial of Michael Jackson International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement United States v.
