how do i know i won't get denied again i just got denied a nebraska furniture mart card due to lack of credit obviously i got a ding for that on my credit score now if i am suppose to apply for a credit card to establish some credit and get denied there is another ding against me how do i know i won't get denied one from say my banks credit card also is there a minimum i have to spend on my credit card each month i agree with my good buddy spifiman to an extent orchard bank's a good place if you're needing to apply for credit they also offer secured credit cards which i'll get into here in a sec but first stay away from capital one and first premier sorry to type in all caps but it's important capital one doesn't report their accounts correctly to the credit bureaus they report whatever your balance is as your credit limit which makes it look like you're always maxing out your card which looks bad for your credit first premier has a lot of upfront fees that are applied before you even get the card let' say that you have a credit limit there could very well be over a in fees that drop the available credit down before you even get to use it so stay away from those cards depending on who you bank with there's a chance that they may offered a secured credit card now i had mentioned this earlier in my answer but you can think of a secured credit card as building credit with a savings account because that's basically how it works a deposit is placed upfront usually tied to a savings account which is used as collateral to get a credit the same amount of the deposit you use it like a regular credit card make small purchases that can be paid off on time every month usually anywhere from months depending on the card either the card converts to a regular card or a better card is offered altogether also you get your deposit back or the savings account isn't used as collateral anymore secured cards are the easiest cards to get approved for i went ahead and posted links to some banks that offer secured credit cards there may be a chance that you bank with one of them i hope this answer helps good luck Credit card Bank Debit card Mortgage Money Poker jargon Mutual fund Octopus card Bond Betting (poker) Short selling Neopets Taxation in the United States Money supply Internet fraud Surveillance Security (finance) Bank fraud Gold standard Citigroup Blackjack Economy of Russia EFTPOS Identity theft Sears Holdings Corporation Annuity Insurance Automatic teller machine Certificate of deposit Capitalism Advance fee fraud The Joker's Wild Wheel of Fortune Inflation Life insurance Craps Microeconomics Plame affair Gambling Gross domestic product Baccarat Interest Hedge fund Minimum wage Social rule Deflation (economics) Bank of America Personal finance Credit score Article One of the United States Constitution New Deal Wachovia Cheque Credit card fraud Schabir Shaik Trial E-ZPass International League Debt Microcredit Ra (board game) Law of value Monty Hall problem Monetary policy FairTax United States Postal Service Arbitrage Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Economy of India The Amazing Race Theory of conduct Mainframe computer Star Trek Customizable Card Game Jeopardy!
