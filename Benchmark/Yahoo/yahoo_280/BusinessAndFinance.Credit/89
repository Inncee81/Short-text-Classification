collection agency question i am i have never had anything negative on my credit i pay off my credit card every month the only thing on there are student loans however i moved out of an apartment recently and they charged me for breaking my lease i stopped at the office and tried to give them a check they wouldn't take it even though i have never bounced a check so i went and got it in cash from my bank and went back to the office to pay it they wouldn't take my cash either now weeks later i got a letter in the mail from a collection agency what can i do to avoid a black spot on my credit if i pay directly through the credit agency will it stay on my record forever i tried to pay the apartment management and they wouldn't take it i never said they were intelligent they wouldn't take my check or my cash i don't know why if i pay it through the agency will it disappear from my record i would call the collections agency and tell them you will pay them today if they do not report this to your credit report if they refuse to leave it off then request a debt validation do everything you can to make their life compleatly miserable next time someone refuses to take your payment ask for something in writing stating they refuse to take the payment you need to protect yourself in regards to future creditors take the suggestions in this link for settleing with a collections agency http www creditinfocenter com rebuild Credit card Bond Debt Student loan Insurance United States Postal Service Credit score Cheque Citigroup Surveillance Social Security (United States) Internet fraud Deflation (economics) Schabir Shaik Trial Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Tax resistance Child support Annuity Derivative (finance) Money Plame affair Mortgage Mail Islamic banking Credit history Personal finance Enron Corporation Advance fee fraud Plame affair timeline Identity theft Interest Finance Primerica Financial Services Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Karl Rove Public transport Credit risk Credit repair The Amazing Race Collateralized debt obligation Life insurance Phishing Charles Ponzi Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Legal tender Domain Name System Municipal bond Article One of the United States Constitution Predatory lending Ocean's Twelve Financial audit Poker jargon Evan Mecham EFTPOS Xerox Monetary policy Luas Money creation Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina British national identity card Payday loan Leasehold estate Money supply FairTax Satchel Paige Economy of Russia Economy of the United States HyperText Transfer Protocol Pension Toll road 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social Credit Credit derivative E-mail spam James Hanratty Billboard Hot 100 Independent agencies of the United States government Accounting methods Bretton Woods system Debt levels and flows SCO-Linux controversies Fiat money Reparations for slavery Make money fast Estoppel Taxation in the United States Lend-Lease Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Electronic money Minimum wage
