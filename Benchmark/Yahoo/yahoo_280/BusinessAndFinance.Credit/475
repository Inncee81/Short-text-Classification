should i cancel my capital one credit card because it doesnt report your credit limit before you say no because canceling a credit card shortens your credit history and lowers your score listen to this i have a capital one credit card no other credit cards or loans or anything it is all that is on my report it was my first card ever so it has a dollar limit and interest rate ive had it almost a year with this alone and nothing else on my report i now have a i talked to an advisor at my credit union and he told me i need to get rid of my capital one since they dont report your credit limit to the agencies it negatively affects your credit he said my score should be around but since the dont report the credit limit it is lower i was approved for a credit union credit card at no fees so should i go ahead and keep the capital one and have the longer history or get the card that actually reports my limits has lower rates and dump the capital one or should i get both then use the capital one every so often the reason it is important for them to report the limit is because if there isnt one reported even if i only owe dollars the report can guess that i have a limit when i only have a limit this is how it works against me if non reporting is your only reason then do not cancel capital one has recently seen the light and is changing their policy from washington post aug capital one financial based in mclean va says it will now report all cardholders' credit limits to the three national credit bureaus a capital one spokeswoman tatiana stead told me recently that the company made the decision to report credit limits because like any policy that our customers may have concerns about we constantly re evaluate our practices the change already under way is expected to be completed by the end of this year she added other reasons not to cancel is the aging helps and though it is relatively small it does help your credit utilization which is a significant portion of your fico score Credit score Credit card Student loan Bank Insurance Monetary policy Taxation in the United States Citigroup United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Russia Mortgage Life insurance Bond Credit rating agency Wal-Mart Debt Predatory lending Euro Money Microeconomics Government debt Bretton Woods system Inflation Economy of Pakistan Minimum wage Kyoto Protocol Mergers and acquisitions Plame affair Bank of China (Hong Kong) Financial services Annuity FairTax Microcredit Social Security (United States) Corporate finance Gold standard Octopus card Deflation (economics) Target Corporation Economy of the United States Primerica Financial Services Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capital accumulation Food and Drug Administration Interest Credit history Trade union Credit card fraud Privatization Poker jargon American Express Investment bank Cable television Short selling Extreme Programming Anarchist economics Fox News Education in the People's Republic of China Credit union Normal distribution Mutual fund Debt consolidation Corporate governance Security (finance) Wachovia Economy of Chile Free trade America Online Sears Holdings Corporation Education in the United States Marshall Plan Enron Corporation Cooperative Reliability engineering Internet fraud Hyperinflation Auto insurance Derivative (finance) George W.
