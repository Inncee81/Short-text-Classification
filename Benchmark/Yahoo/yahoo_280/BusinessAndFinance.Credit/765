bad credit want to earn credit with current credit card i have bad credit i finally got a credit card and can start earning my credit i've been told two seperate stories regarding paying for my credit cards payments to earn those credits i was told the if i make monthly payments and not pay my balance although i have to pay to stupid finance charges that's a way to earn credit so i was told to do that for months to a year and my credit will improve the second one i was told was that i have to pay my cc bills in full every month in order to get better credit ratings and also to avoid finance charges so which one is correct make monthly payments have a balance and pay finance charges or pay my cc bills in full every month and not get charged on interests you should make regular purchases that is one you will normally pay cash for on your credit card then at the end of the month pay it in full and on time to avoid the interest charges what happens is that the credit card company will report your high balance for the month so if you charge they will report your balance of if you pay it off and then charge the next month your balance is reported as there is no way creditors will know if you made a payment of or paid the balance and charged another one important factor is your utilization so for the best help you should not be using more than of your limit at any one time that is if you have a credit limit of you don't want to use more than in any one month Credit card Credit score Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Insurance PE ratio Mortgage Annuity Personal finance Interest Islamic banking Primerica Financial Services Mutual fund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deflation (economics) Taxation in the United States Life insurance 401(k) Corporate finance Cheque FairTax Citigroup Enron Corporation Food Stamp Program Internet fraud Economy of Russia Collateralized debt obligation Credit derivative Health insurance Schabir Shaik Trial Virgin Mobile Refinancing Octopus card Dividend Bretton Woods system Bank fraud Gold standard Treasury security Money Municipal bond Betting (poker) Tom DeLay Accounting methods Financial audit Security (finance) Pension Surveillance Wal-Mart Monetary policy Ponzi scheme Oyster card Wachovia Gross domestic product Government debt MetroCard Copyleft Short selling Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit history Microeconomics Debt consolidation American Express The Amazing Race Economy of Pakistan Legal tender Predatory lending Futures contract Economy of India Arbitrage Credit repair Actuarial notation Publicly funded medicine Mortgage-backed security Government National Mortgage Association Financial services Auto insurance Amway Federal National Mortgage Association Tax Derivative (finance) Timeline of the Enron scandal Electronic money Stock Micropayment Payday loan London Congestion Charge Debit card Certificate of deposit National Insurance Hire purchase History of the United States (1918-1945) Hyperinflation Campaign finance reform
