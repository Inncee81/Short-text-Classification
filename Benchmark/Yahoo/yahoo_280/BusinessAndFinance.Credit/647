how does cash call com work here's one guy's story we like everyone else fell on hard times and came across cash call when i called them the first thing i asked them was what is the interest rate was before i decided to proceed any further i was told 'it all depended on the loan amount' after i was told that i would be approved for a loan i again asked what the interest rate would be if i accepeted the loan and again the answer was avoided i told them i did not was to continue with the loan until i had something in writing to prove what the interest rate would be i was told that they would send me an email and it would have all the information i needed little did i know it was a confirmation email with out the interest rate listed and when i entered the information that they were requesting i was stuck with the loan what i thought i was doing was putting this information in so that i would be able to find out what the interest rate was because this email took me to their web site so instead of finding out what the interset rate was i was in reality 'computer signing' a contract with cash call in june cash call automatically made a debit from my account that i was not aware of and caused my checking account to go in excess of to the negative screwing me and my checking account which was closed by the bank now since cash call has not gotten the july payment they have called my home up to times a day all different phone numbers to i have spoked to someone almost every day i asked for a deferment on the loan until i get back to work because i have no income at this point they told me if i sent them right now they would defer the payment until the first of the next month hmmm doesn't sound like much of a deferment to me i also had someone tell me 'well how are you buying food for your baby' when i told them that the little money i did have was going to feed my two children because that was my highest priority at this point they told me that my payment to cash call should be my highest priority and if i could afford to have a phone and get food for my kids then i had money to pay them the money they wanted i told them they would get their money as soon as i went back to work and i wanted a payment book because i was no longer going to let them debit my account i would only do business by mail i still have not gotten a mailing address from them or payment book or statement of any type and a whole bunch more people with personal experience http www ripoffreport com searchresults asp q all q q q q q searchtype submit search q cash call borrowing money is a bad idea if you can at all avoid it freeze the last frame of this ad http www youtube com watch v rayo geui and read the fine print they tell you a loan will cost you payments of x Credit card Annuity Life insurance Internet fraud Insurance Bank United States Postal Service Mortgage Bond E-mail spam Advance fee fraud Student loan Schabir Shaik Trial Surveillance Gmail Deflation (economics) Bank fraud Plame affair Monetary policy Mutual fund Debt EFTPOS Money supply Islamic banking United Kingdom corporation tax Timeline of the Enron scandal Finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security (United States) FairTax Inflation Security (finance) Interest Microeconomics Gold standard Octopus card 401(k) Spam (electronic) Identity theft Personal finance Phishing Web crawler Corporate finance Domain Name System Derivative (finance) Debit card Short selling Variable universal life insurance EastEnders Mensal__o scandal Flat tax Ajax (programming) Predatory lending Financial audit Password Primerica Financial Services Stopping e-mail abuse Mergers and acquisitions SCO-Linux controversies E-mail Cheque Money creation HyperText Transfer Protocol Savings and loan association Automatic teller machine Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Taxation in the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Margin (finance) Cross site scripting Citigroup The Amazing Race World Wide Web Euro GSM services Economy of Russia RuneScape cheats CPU cache Data retention Charles Ponzi Enron Corporation Live 8 Bretton Woods system Mail fraud Gross domestic product Credit card fraud Postage stamp Double-entry book-keeping Neopets Usury Digital photography Unemployment benefit
