if you consolidate all your debt of your credit cards does this terminate the credit cards i'm not in massive debt but i lost my job and i don't plan on using credit much so i just want it all paid so i don't have to worry about the balances but i don't want to lose my credit cards be wary of one thing some credit card issuers will actually decrease your credit limit or close the account for no activity although this usually only happens after long periods of inactivity with no balance i have seen cases of card holders having their credit limits decreased if they remain unused for over months with a balance if the card issuer closes the account it's not derogatory on your credit report meaning you will show a good clean history on the account which won't in itself drive down your credit scores but your scores will still go down because of having one less open trade line a good rule of thumb is to make sure you make at least one minor purchase every months and then pay the bill in full once you get your cards down to balance many people think that their credit card accounts can never be cancelled unless they request it as long as they have paid their bills on time and used the card resposibly this is not true however a card issuing bank has the right to cancel choose not to renew or decrease your credit limit based on any number of seemingly arbitrary reasons of which lack of activity too many other accounts or income doesn't justify credit line are just a few they're in business to make money and people holding no fee credit cards for years without making purchases on them don't provide any income for the issuing bank Credit card Bond Security (finance) Debit card Mutual fund Gold standard Deflation (economics) United Kingdom corporation tax Legal tender FairTax Surveillance Money Short selling Personal finance Hyperinflation Mortgage Credit score Debt Student loan Octopus card Bank fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Credit card fraud Internet fraud Financial services Double-entry book-keeping Poker jargon Betting (poker) EFTPOS Trademark Microeconomics HSBC Money supply Identity theft Ra (board game) Article One of the United States Constitution Economy of Russia Interest Annuity Bretton Woods system Monetary policy Capitalism Automatic teller machine Identity document Futures contract The Amazing Race Government debt H-1B visa Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Visa (document) Fiat money Citigroup Baccarat Great Depression Indian nationality law Gross domestic product MMORPG Euro Auto insurance Arbitrage Primerica Financial Services Driver's license Insurance Theodicy Certificate of deposit Government National Mortgage Association Capital accumulation Estoppel Inflation Fractional-reserve banking Law of value Mergers and acquisitions Loyalty program Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Life insurance Arthur Laffer Virgin Mobile SmartRider Financial audit Athenian democracy Tax Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Minimum wage Stored-value card Debt levels and flows History of the United States (1918-1945) Monopoly (game) Bank of America Copyleft Credit repair Corporation Blackjack Pai gow poker
