part credit card question i have a cap one card with a balance i plan on have that paid off by this december i also have an apr card i was wondering if i could pay my cap one card with my card and avoid the apr but i don't want do a balance transfer i wanted to do it this way to avoid the bt fee is it possible next question i need a few school supplies books dorm materials i was wondering to use another card knowing i would have it too paid off by december about my books i get a stipiend spelling i was thinking of buying the books ahead of time and using the stipiend spelling to pay it off whent the bill comes in does this should like a good idea i also have to pay for tution that loans and federal aid didn't cover with my cc i will have all this paid off my december or january the latest i'm positive of it so what do you think most cards will no longer waive balance transfer fees the usual minimum is which is a waste of money on a balance since your apr will eventually switch and you will have to transfer again credit cards are bad news all the way around and you could catch yourself in a very bad place years ago cards offerred deals with no balance transfer fees that is no longer the case introductory aprs could also go the way of the dinosaur leaving you with high rates struggling to pay the interest each month debt is a bad thing to have get a checking account and learn to go without when you hit zero starting a career upon leaving college without debt will allow you to save money and invest instead of starting real life digging yourself out of a hole you might have every intention of paying everything off by december but life happens a simple thing like a car breaking down or having to purchase something essential and expensive can immediately kill your plans credit cards can ruin lives they are useful tools for emergencies online purchases and building good credit for the future but they are dependent upon a certain future and the one thing about the future is that it is never certain good luck Credit card Bank Money Insurance Poker jargon Mortgage Internet fraud Personal finance Deflation (economics) Predatory lending Mutual fund Debt Citigroup Microeconomics Betting (poker) Blackjack Capital accumulation Law of value Annuity Education in the United States Money supply Short selling Interest Bond Finance Hyperinflation Social Security (United States) Monetary policy Derivative (finance) Refinancing Life insurance Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Government debt Bretton Woods system Primerica Financial Services Economy of the United States CPU cache Marshall Plan The Amazing Race Bank fraud Neopets Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Variable universal life insurance Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Economy of Russia Financial services Extreme Programming Supply and demand Keynesian economics Corporate finance FairTax EastEnders Gross domestic product Plame affair Health insurance Food Stamp Program Security (finance) Supply-side economics Tax Charles Ponzi Great Depression Economy of Pakistan Enron Corporation Arbitrage Surveillance Taxation in the United States Graduate school Debit card Confidence trick Economics New Deal Futures contract Donald Trump Advance fee fraud Tariff Micropayment Octopus card Cheque Animal Crossing Gold standard Deficit spending America Online Commodity markets Schabir Shaik Trial Tire Social Credit Leasing
