can i transfer my high interest credit card balance to my husband's low interest one if so is there a fee for doing so is it advisable to do so thanks in advance for those who take the time to reply yes you can transfer your balance to your husbands card provided his card has sufficient credit limit there will be a transfer fee which typically is of the transfer amount compare the transfer fee to the interest rate difference if the fee is less than a couple months difference it would make sense you should stop charging on your higher interest rate card until you get hubby's card paid off then only charge what you can afford to pay off at the end of the month Credit card Student loan Mortgage Bank Insurance Public transport Education in the United States Mutual fund Redundant array of independent disks Taxation in the United States Internet fraud Interest Life insurance Octopus card Debit card Betting (poker) Refinancing United States Postal Service Poker jargon Citigroup Universal Serial Bus Filling station Monetary policy Explosive material Primerica Financial Services Inflation Graduate school MMORPG Slot machine Virgin Mobile Stud poker United Kingdom corporation tax Debt consolidation Tuition Credit card fraud Economy of Russia Corporation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wal-Mart Welding Tax Secure Digital card EFTPOS Automatic teller machine Top-up fees Labor theory of value Gross domestic product Bond Social Security debate (United States) Baccarat E-ZPass Education in Germany H-1B visa Advance fee fraud Skype Trust (Law) USA Short selling Microeconomics GSM services Annuity Collateralized debt obligation Digital photography Individual Savings Account Vanity press Diode Debt Islamic banking No Child Left Behind Act ATI Technologies Micropayment Spacecraft propulsion Toll road Credit score 401(k) Futures contract Arbitrage Blackjack Corporate finance Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Intellectual property Education in the People's Republic of China Credit derivative Payday loan Flat tax Draw poker Bretton Woods system Overclocking Alcohol fuel Tertiary education fees in Australia Education in Portugal Food Stamp Program Copyright Divorce National Insurance Central processing unit Price discrimination
