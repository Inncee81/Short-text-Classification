what do you think about subprime crisis i saw this coming quite a few years ago there were too many lenders making up too many exotic loan programs where people with not so good credit could lie about their income and get loans with teaser rates rather than qualifing these people first with year fixed and figuring out exactly how much home is affordable many loan officers did not bother to inform their client of the possible ramifications of these exotic loan programs such as the pay option arms where you are given a choice of three monthly payment options month to month many people chose the lower payment which caused negative amortization each month they used that option and now they have a home that is worth less than the pricipal balance of their mortgage now the introductory periods are ending and they have to pay principal and interest on fluctuating rates and are finding they cannot afford the payment and slowly but surely default and wind up being foreclosed on there are many new housing tracts here in california where to percent of the homes are in foreclosure and the few homes that are not the values have gone way down and these people who are making their mortgage payments on time everytime are ending up in the same boat with a home that is less in value with a principal balance higher that what the home is worth it's a dominoe effect basically and it appears to me that the subprime crisis little by little is spilling over into the prime area Mortgage Government National Mortgage Association Bond Student loan Deflation (economics) Predatory lending Collateralized mortgage obligation Credit card Savings and loan association Debt 401(k) Annuity Bank Economy of Russia Microeconomics Debt consolidation Annual percentage rate Great Depression Federal National Mortgage Association Insurance Consumer finance Personal finance Islamic banking ACORN Money Credit score Bretton Woods system Urban sprawl Real estate bubble FairTax Taxation in the United States Interest rate Municipal bond Economy of Pakistan Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Payday loan Gold standard Real estate broker History of the United States (1918-1945) Primerica Financial Services Microcredit Subsidy Capital accumulation Savings and Loan crisis Refinancing Foreclosure Inflation United Kingdom corporation tax Short selling Monetary policy Islamic economics Government debt Unemployment benefit Donald Trump Futures contract Security (finance) Collateralized debt obligation Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Economy of the United States History of post-Soviet Russia Hyperinflation Finance Unemployment Citigroup Education in the United States Social Security (United States) Option style Flat tax Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Asian financial crisis Economy of Argentina Title insurance Central processing unit Central bank Tennessee State Constitution U.S. public debt Usury Social Security debate (United States) Economic relations of Japan Treasury security Gross domestic product Schabir Shaik Trial Federal Reserve Credit history Lawyer Business cycle International Monetary Fund Yield curve Food Stamp Program Variable universal life insurance Argentine Currency Board Concurrent estate
