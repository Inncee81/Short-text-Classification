getting a car loan with bad credit when i was i got a couple credit cards and payed them good for a year then my job went shaky and i was out and no way to pay them back im now with a credit score of around since then i have gotten a very good job and wanting to get a new car im thinking of getting a car thats around k dollars would it be possible with my credit how big of a down payment do you think i would need i have a decent car i can trade in now or sell maybe for around k and can probably come up with around k to go with that for a downpayment would that be a pretty good downpayment on a loan amount that much i also plan to pay off those credit cards which wasnt that much most of it now is just finance charges will that help my score a lot or will it still be pretty low if those negative things are on there even if i payed them off two suggestions try to get the car now if you put k down on on k that's about which is some thing it will be hard to finance of the loan at that credit rating you have to remember that is won't cost a flat k and you may not get full blue book for the current car you have you will not get good value by trade in so try to sell it on your own i know you said you might have k but work w numbers that you know you can meet and anything above that will be to your benefit better that than the other way around be prepared for a high high interest rate of although the car industry is hurting there might be some good deals out there since your loan will be secured w the car as collateral wait more months it might sound like forever but if you are diligent and focused you will definitely have a higher credit score you shouldn't pay all the credit cards off completely leave at least a small balance i e used credit on one of them if they are all at zero balance it detract from your credit score sounds silly but that's how it works with a higher score you will have a lower interest rate remember that a car is not an investment they depreciate you want to avoid being upside down in a loan that is paying more for a car than it's worth due to a high interest rate so be sure to get a car with a payment you can afford being cute or cool looking good is fun but having a repo on your credit not worth it good luck Credit card Bond Mortgage Student loan Microeconomics Economy of Russia Inflation Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Interest Bank Unemployment Mutual fund Bretton Woods system Monetary policy Predatory lending Citigroup Collateralized debt obligation Free trade Capital accumulation Debt Keynesian economics Derivative (finance) Supply and demand Short selling FairTax Great Depression Islamic banking Donald Trump Real estate bubble Minimum wage Economy of India Security (finance) Bank fraud Life insurance History of the United States (1918-1945) Money Ra (board game) Credit score Flat tax 401(k) Social Security (United States) Government National Mortgage Association Poker jargon Primerica Financial Services Personal finance Arthur Laffer Financial services Gross domestic product Microcredit Subsidy Stock Tariff Economy of Pakistan Economy of El Salvador Asian financial crisis Internet fraud Wal-Mart Economy of the United States Taxation in the United States Hyperinflation PE ratio Government debt Mortgage-backed security Debt consolidation Progressive tax Ponzi scheme Dividend Kyoto Protocol Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Social Security debate (United States) Surplus value Corporate finance Mergers and acquisitions Economy of Chile Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Price discrimination EastEnders Extreme Programming Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule Pension Economy of the Philippines $ale of the Century Commodity markets Blackjack ELO rating system Depreciation
