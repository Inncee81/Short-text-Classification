help please if i cancel my checking account and open one at another bank will it stop hour fitness from withdrawing money from my checking account there was this free program i signed up for and they gave me a year membership without me knowing i just discovered dissapearing from my account monthly and when i called them to find out why they said i signed up for a yr membership which i didn't and i can't cancel it exept i move to an area where they don't have centers so if i cancel my checking account and change banks will they stop withdrawing money from my account ps i don't own any credit card will this hurt my credit history if i don't won a credit card they will likely send you to a collection agency when you do not pay your bill this will hurt your credit it is a big black mark if you signed a contract for a year membership and you're over then you have signed a legally binding contract you'll have to pay if you did not sign a contract if they do not have a contract with your signature on it then you can contact your bank and say that they are taking an unauthorized debit from your account however from what you've said it sounds like you may have signed a year contract without realizing it i would try talking to the health club and asking them to cancel your account also ask for a copy of the agreement that you signed if you really didn't understand what you were doing maybe they will let you out you could also try reporting them to the better business bureau bbb in your area about deceptive sales tactics but in the end if you signed a year contract you signed a three year contract just let this be a lesson in the future to read anything you sign very carefully i hope this helps Annuity Credit card Debit card Plame affair Internet fraud United States Postal Service Satchel Paige Poker jargon Octopus card Cheque Bank fraud Money Identity theft EFTPOS Credit card fraud Bank Surveillance Schabir Shaik Trial Slot machine Life insurance Ocean's Twelve Trademark Advance fee fraud The Amazing Race United Nations Citigroup Insurance Wheel of Fortune Estoppel Article One of the United States Constitution International League Karl Rove FairTax Credit union Child support Euro National Football League Electronic money Major League Baseball television contracts Automatic teller machine Loyalty program Bond Mensal__o scandal Legal tender Monetary policy Double-entry book-keeping Filling station Personal finance Deflation (economics) Timeline of hacker history Social Security (United States) The Emancipation of Mimi Derivative (finance) Spyware Notary public Babe Ruth Electronic toll collection Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Enron Corporation Corporation 1994 baseball strike Business ethics Fred Phelps Contract bridge Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks StarCraft: Uprising MMORPG Wal-Mart Oasis (band) Topps Evan Mecham Betting (poker) Brian Jones (musician) Debt U.S. two-dollar bill Sydney Riot of 1879 LiveJournal History of baseball in the United States World Bank Group Mortgage Better Business Bureau Credit repair GNU General Public License Modelling agency Student loan TLC Pretty Good Privacy Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry Punisher Salary cap
