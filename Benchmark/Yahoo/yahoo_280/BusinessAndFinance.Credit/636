about credit cards and using not using them them i started out with a student visa card too easy to get maxed it out when i needed it and paid it back over a period of a few months the credit card company made money that's for sure since i took a year off school the company changed my plan and it's due to expire i haven't used it in a long time i like the security and convienence of having a credit card for those just incase situations but i live and work overseas making it not so easy and don't claim an income should i go to the trouble of using my card in order to continue being able to have the card when i move back or do credit card companies usually just renew cards even if you don't use it more than once or twice a year and have like no claimable income i know they want me to have that option of maxing it out cause that makes them money assuming that you can pay the card online which makes payment much easier oversees i'd use it a couple of times and make sure that you pay it off at the end of the month so you don't have interest charges as long as it doesn't have an annual fee keeping a credit card open and in good standing will help you in the long run just make sure the credit card company knows your current address if they try to send you a replacement card and they can't deliver it to you then they will cancel the account if you have them send it to your parent's place make sure they call to activate the new card if the credit company sends you a new card and you don't activate it they will eventually cancel the account i've had both of those happen to me with accounts i moved and didn't tell the credit card company and they canceld my card and i got a card that i didn't activate and they canceled my account i hope this helps Credit card Student loan United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Octopus card EFTPOS Debit card Credit card fraud Virgin Mobile Surveillance Insurance Short selling Bond H-1B visa Annuity Visa (document) Personal finance United States Postal Service Driver's license Advance fee fraud America Online Bank The Amazing Race Gross domestic product Scrip Citigroup Social Security (United States) Taxation in the United States Credit score Data retention Mail Topps Identity theft Craps Poker jargon Phishing Donald Trump Television licence Bank fraud Smart card Interest Betting (poker) MasterCard Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Blackjack Debt Public-key cryptography Auto insurance Mail fraud Freeters National Insurance Immigration to the United States American Express Playoff Money Cheating in poker Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Economy of Russia Wal-Mart Electronic money Flat tax FairTax 401(k) Gold standard Baccarat Mortgage Child support Cheque MetroCard GSM services Corporation Euro George W.
