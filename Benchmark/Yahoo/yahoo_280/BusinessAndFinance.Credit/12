for ppl that know something about credit is a good score for a year old im new to this whole financial thing and im lookin to buy my first house when i turn all my bills are perfect without a later payment ever also i have saved so far would it be a good idea to put it in a high yield savings account since im only gonna be saving for another years is actually good for a year old since most twenty year old doesn't have credit however you might want to check with all three credit reporting agency since if your score is from transunion they have a different scale on reporting credit than that of equifax and experian on transunion the highest score is equifax and experian the highest are so if you have a with transunion you probably have somewhere in the with the other two i myself have score with experian and equifax and i have with transunion see how the difference is if you want to have a high yield savings it is better for you to put it in an roth ira or something that is geared toward education because this will let you have savings later without a hefty tax incurred on you investments TransUnion Debt consolidation Credit score Experian Bond FairTax Fair Isaac Corporation Credit rating agency Gross domestic product Mutual fund Capital accumulation 401(k) Variable universal life insurance Social Security (United States) Insurance Annuity Mortgage Arthur Laffer Debt Life insurance Microeconomics Capitalism Credit card Supply-side economics Deflation (economics) Grade (education) Microcredit Keynesian economics Social Security debate (United States) Surplus value Personal finance Mergers and acquisitions Primerica Financial Services Economy of India United Kingdom corporation tax Bank High-yield debt Derivative (finance) Gold standard Government debt Money History of the United States (1918-1945) Measures of national income and output Economy of the United States Treasury security Credit history Taxation in the United States Normal distribution Security (finance) Student loan Municipal bond Internet fraud Anarchism and capitalism Retirement plan Money supply Individual Retirement Account Bretton Woods system Bill Bradley Finance SAT Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Free trade Economy of Russia Bank fraud Price discrimination Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Certificate of deposit Ponzi scheme Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Food Stamp Program Saving (economics) Economy of Pakistan Savings and loan association Warren Buffett Dividend Fianna F__il Citigroup Identity theft PE ratio Social Credit Reaganomics Inflation Automated Clearing House Lloyd's of London Self Portrait Publicly funded medicine Michael Milken Economy of Chile Corporation Short selling Credit union Health savings account Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Income trust Yield curve Supply and demand Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Credit derivative
