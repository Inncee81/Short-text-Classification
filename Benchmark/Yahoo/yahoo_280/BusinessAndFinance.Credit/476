can i use my debit card as credit when there's a positive balance in my bank account but not enough to cover what i need to get in other words will it be approved by the credit card reader i know i can't push debit because that's automatically posted as long as there's a positive balance and then i can put the money in later or will it deny me i need groceries and it's a few days before payday sometimes these things happen i have no credit cards by the way i know they're evil yes i know i'm running the risk of getting charged in an overdraft fee but when your kid needs food it's worth it right i just want to know if since there is a positive balance it will go through or should i just write a check if it goes through your bank will charge you an overdraft fee this all depends if they allow it or not most of the times they do in what they say is a convenience to the customer and while it is a convenience it is also a big money maker for them if you do this be sure to do it in one purchase and not multiple because every transaction that occurs while you are overdrawn will incurr the overdraft fee so it would be better to do transaction for than transactions for each btw it is not true that when you do credit it is never posted right away it depends on the merchant you are shopping at and how they process the payments some do it offline or in batch mode and they don't get posted for a day but most are real time especially your major chain stores Credit card Bank Automatic teller machine Octopus card Money Internet fraud Electronic money Loyalty program Mutual fund Surveillance Cheque Predatory lending Insurance Bank fraud Electronic commerce Short selling SmartRider Automated Clearing House Interac Smart card Monetary policy Oyster card MetroCard Double-entry book-keeping Microeconomics Mergers and acquisitions Mortgage Filling station Password Tesco Micropayment Online shop Financial services Schabir Shaik Trial Sears Holdings Corporation Chip and PIN Islamic banking United States Postal Service Advance fee fraud Capital accumulation Citigroup Supermarket Personal finance E-ZPass Payday loan Money supply Gold standard RFID Electronic toll collection Betting (poker) Aldi Legal tender Blackjack Wal-Mart MapleStory Wachovia Economy of Chile Annuity Credit score Stored-value card London Underground Neopets Accountancy Usury Economy of India Derivative (finance) Poker jargon Corporate finance Debt ACID Tax Scrip EMV Euro Student loan Mainframe computer E-mail spam Auto insurance Windows XP Bank of China (Hong Kong) Slot machine Deflation (economics) Interest Extreme Programming Microcredit Life insurance Certificate of deposit Surplus value Screenplay Payroll American Express Steam (content delivery) Intellectual property Wall Street
