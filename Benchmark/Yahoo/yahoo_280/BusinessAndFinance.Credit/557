building credit i am a year old student and i want to start building some credit history i was talking to a friend that is about the same age as me and in the same kinda situation as me and he said he applied to store credit cards examples being best buy circuit city old navy etc is this a good way to start building credit he said that since you can only use the credit card at that particular store you are less apt to go off on a spending craze and it makes it easier to keep track of is this true what kinda benefits and flaws does this method have for a young student like myself thanks for any and all help there are advantages of building credit with department stores but there are some disadvantages while you can only spend with that particular store it's only one piece of the credit building puzzle there's types of accounts that build credit revolving and installment credit cards and line of credit are revolving accounts while car notes furniture loans personal signature loans appliance loans boat and motorcycle and mortgages are all installment loans an example of a good mixture of credit accounts would be revolving major credit cards and one department store credit card and installment account if you have a student loan then you already have that covered since you're in college my suggestion would be to apply for a student card and use it for dire emergencies now let me define emergency just because you're broke that doesn't quite constitute an emergency a legit example would be that you need a book for a class asap and you don't have the cash to get it other than that it should be used once a month no more than month so that the activity can report on your credit an unused card doesn't do any good to build credit you don't want to overuse the card especially since you're in school a rule of thumb is that at any given time the balance should be at of your available credit for example if you have a limit then you should spend no more than but since you're in school it should be even less like this way you can build credit and by the time you graduate you can have credit established to help you make it out on your own a lot easier getting a department store card helps but it won't help you if you're in a jam so to recap getting a department store card can help build credit but not as much as a major credit card visa mastercard american express discover having different types of credit revolving and installment accounts is a good way to build credit proper use of credit cards is extremely light every month to show activity and only in dire emergencies student cards are easier to get approved for i hope that this answer helps good luck p s oh by the way i posted links to a few student credit card websites for you to check out Credit card Student loan Bank Credit score Debit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Amazing Race Poker jargon Octopus card Betting (poker) Citigroup RFID $ale of the Century Bank fraud Internet fraud Identity theft Consensus decision-making Money Life insurance Password Extreme Programming FairTax Smart card Sears Holdings Corporation Schabir Shaik Trial Digital rights management Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Computer Interest Driver's license United Kingdom corporation tax Personal finance Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Capitalism Annuity Money supply Craps Identity document Predatory lending Wheel of Fortune Copy protection Theory of conduct Social rule Neopets Deflation (economics) Gross domestic product Star Trek Customizable Card Game Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Primerica Financial Services Bank of China (Hong Kong) Marshall Plan MasterCard Debt consolidation Windows 2000 Great Depression Mortgage Bond Immigration to the United States MTR Best Buy Electronic money Microeconomics Cheating in Counter-Strike Slot machine Expert system Shit Auto insurance Cross site scripting College admissions Finance Automatic teller machine Insurance Redundant array of independent disks Graduate school Plurality electoral system Bulk vending Ra (board game) Department store Grade (education) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act President (game) Economy of the United States H-1B visa Bank of America Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Prolog Monetary policy Double-entry book-keeping MetroCard Monopoly (game) Light-emitting diode United States Postal Service Equine conformation
