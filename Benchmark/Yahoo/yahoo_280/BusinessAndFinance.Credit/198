what is the best way to deal with existing credit cards for newlyweds my wife and i are wondering how we should deal with each of our individual credit accounts for ease of financial management we would like to reduce consolidate credit lines however we understand closing credit lines could adversely impact our credit ratings we don't want to do anything to reduce our individual ratings both of us have credit ratings in the low just another detail my wife and i only use one card each but have a several others our cards are paid off monthly so there is no revolving debt unfortunately you can't have it both ways you can't consolidate close some accounts and not have it affect your credit score but the good news is that it won't affect your score enough to matter with scores in the 's i assume you mean fico scores and not vantagescores your scores would have to drop over points before it would mean anything when applying for credit and closing a couple of accounts won't cause that large of a drop unless they have large credit lines and you choose to keep a card with a small credit line that being said there's no real benefit to closing any cards if you use them a couple times a year it's likely they will keep your accounts active if you don't they may eventually be closed without you taking any action don't forget that if you have cards in good standing that you don't use you can attract some good offers from the issuers to entice you to use them and you can use that to your benefit just last month i got a letter from citibank offering me bonus thank you points if i would charge on a card i don't use before the end of august those points are worth about so i'm going to do it free money right it's your decision but i would recommend keeping all your cards open if you choose to cancel some it's best to keep the cards with the largest credit lines open you have high credit scores and i don't know why you would want to change what you have done that got you there in the first place chances are those open accounts with no usage helped keep your utilization low which is good for your score Credit card Credit score Microeconomics Contract bridge Bond Blackjack Money FairTax Personal finance Annuity Citigroup United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Hyperinflation Prisoner's dilemma Insurance Mortgage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Primerica Financial Services Financial services Bank Unemployment Hearts (game) Monetary policy Corporate finance Betting (poker) Mutual fund Euro Life insurance Slot machine Draw poker Economy of Russia Supply and demand Deflation (economics) Schabir Shaik Trial Sydney Riot of 1879 Wheel of Fortune Arbitrage Internet fraud Capitalism Tax Education in the People's Republic of China Economics Password Extreme Programming Baccarat Taxation in the United States Sheepshead Gold standard Surveillance Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Enron Corporation Craps Wal-Mart $ale of the Century Corporate governance Ra (board game) Divorce Keynesian economics Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Labour economics Economic inequality Jeopardy!
