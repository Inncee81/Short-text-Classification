collection account on credit report that was paid but still reporting derogatory can i file a lawsuit i am currently reviewing my credit reports for accuracy there was a collection account that was paid off in i did not and still do not recall what this collection account was for i filed a dispute with the experian credit bureau experian said that the account was valid the collection says midland after i disputed this account with experian midland marked the account as being derogatory in april of and said the account was ok as of may this is hurting my credit report because it looks like the collection account is current also i sent a letter to midland requesting all the pertinent information for this account midland has failed to comply with my request how much time should i give them to respond i have a letter from midland stating that the account was paid off in so there is no way that it can be derogatory in april and then good in may i only paid the collection because i confused it with a different account can i file a lawsuit against them okay start with the creditor if you don't have it already request a receipt or letter stating that the balance is zero make sure that the receipt or letter references the account number that's listed on your credit report once you have that or if you already do send a copy of the receipt as well as a copy of your credit report to any bureau that is reporting the account inaccurately after you send it to the bureaus they have days to investiage the matter if they find that you are correct then they need to update the account as paid instead of in collection if they do not update it as such they will send you a letter and let you know why it's accurate after they investigate by law they must send you an updated copy of your credit report you don't have to request one i hope that helps oh an no need to file a law suit it will probably cost you waaaay more money than what the collection was for in the first place Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Credit repair Plame affair Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 GNU General Public License SCO-Linux controversies TransUnion Tax protester 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Social Security (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Contract Tom DeLay Experian Probation officer United Kingdom corporation tax E-mail spam Killian documents Slander and libel Taxation in the United States Financial audit Downing Street memo Credit score Kazaa Annuity United States Postal Service National Kidney Foundation Singapore Wal-Mart Medical malpractice Gmail Timeline of the Enron scandal Judicial review Appeal Mortgage Deflation (economics) Child support Patent application George W.
