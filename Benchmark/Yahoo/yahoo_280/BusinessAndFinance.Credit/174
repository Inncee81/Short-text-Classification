for every collection i pay off how many points does my credit score go up and how long does it take thanks everyone wow crappy answers again hnm what the heck you talking about this is the same idiotic mindmuck that dave ramsey sells you copy that from his site the answer if you do it wrong it will actually hurt your score by paying off collection debts pull up a chair and let me explain for starters once you have paid off a collection debt all the creditor is required to do is show paid on your credit report but all notations about late fees charge off's and collections will still be there it will still be listed as a negative item on your credit report and it will still hurt your score now the worse part debts that are placed on your credit report hurt you bad but as time goes by their effect does down after years most creditors do not pay that much interest they are more worried about seeing recent negative activity on your report so lets say you pay off the collector and he now shows your debt as paid but you still have all those bad marks what has happened is this entry turns your listing into recent activity and turns your old forgotten debt into a new one killing your score what you have to do is get an agreement with the creditor in writing to delete the entry once you have paid it once removed it will immediately improve your credit score creditors are going to tell you they can't do it or that it's illegal trust me i've researched this and i have helped many people do this there is no law preventing a creditor from deleting their own item from your credit report there is nothing in the credit bureau's user agreement preventing it i've read it not there the only reason they would refuse is because they want to continue to punish you for your past debt problems why on earth would you want to pay a debt and still have it hurt your credit that's silly so insist that they either delete the item or don't pay them a dime Deflation (economics) Credit repair Theory of conduct Credit card Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Debt Windows XP Plame affair Neopets Estoppel Bond Islamic banking Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Taxation in the United States GNU General Public License Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Credit score Social Security (United States) Socrates Trust (Law) USA Surveillance Tennessee State Constitution Utilitarianism Intellectual property Legal tender Annuity Usury Developing countries' debt Tom DeLay Spyware Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Student loan United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Bankruptcy in the United States Corporate governance CPU cache MMORPG Article One of the United States Constitution Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Marcus Licinius Crassus Babe Ruth Copyleft Contract London Congestion Charge Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Babylonian law The Star Wars Holiday Special Scientology beliefs and practices Short selling Microeconomics Gold standard Money Los Angeles Kings Insurance History of the Jews in England Trusted computing Copyright Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Inflation Unemployment Bank Magna Carta Social rule Arguments for and against drug prohibition Public domain Intelligence quotient Live 8 New York Knicks Avenue Q Dave Ramsey SCO-Linux controversies Mergers and acquisitions Optimization (computer science) Schabir Shaik Trial Public-key cryptography Rape Ludwig Wittgenstein Ra (board game) Famine Enron Corporation Animal Crossing Guns N' Roses Interest Citigroup
