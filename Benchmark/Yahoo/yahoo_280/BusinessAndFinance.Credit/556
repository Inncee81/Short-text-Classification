interest rate question i suck at numbers which is one reason i am in debt over my head i am trying to make a budget to pay my bills off quicker than simply paying the minimum monthly payments how can i figure out what next month's total bill will be when i pay more than the minimum payment for example if the total balance with interest already added in is now and the interest rate is and the minimum payment is and i pay this month what will be the new total balance next month please tell me how to work this out so i can do it with all my bills and figure out how quickly i can get things paid off and paid down thanks in advance that's what i'm trying to figure out but i need to know how to calculate the interest rate each month after i make the payment so i can sit down and do a yearly budget plan this is a rough estimate but it should be close some credit cards calculate interest slightly differently and it can vary depending upon when you pay your bill assuming you make no purchases on the card balance balance annual rate months per year your payment new balance or for your first month ending balance the google spreadsheet linked below will let you play with different interest rates and payment amounts change any of the number to the right and the spreadsheet will autocalculate with new monthly balances interest payments etc keep in mind it's only an estimate your actual bill will vary a little bit because the credit card companies calculate interest to the day and may calculate it a little differently however it will be close right now lookin like a little over years unless you can increase your payment or negotiate a lower rate adam Credit card Annuity Social Security (United States) Mortgage Interest Personal finance FairTax Microeconomics Economy of Russia United Kingdom corporation tax Student loan Food Stamp Program Bretton Woods system Insurance Credit score Mutual fund Unemployment Pension Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Explosive material U.S. public debt 401(k) Taxation in the United States Tax Octopus card Monetary policy Inflation Government debt Refinancing Corporate finance Keynesian economics Futures contract Deflation (economics) Auto insurance Salary cap Primerica Financial Services Social Security debate (United States) Economy of India National Insurance Bank Minimum wage Publicly funded medicine Municipal bond Financial audit Capitalism Capital accumulation Blackjack Dividend History of the United States (1918-1945) PE ratio Credit derivative Compensation of employees Actuarial notation Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Estoppel Ponzi scheme Finance Economic inequality Surplus value Arbitrage Unemployment benefit Debt consolidation Trade union Reaganomics Cost of capital Cheque Common Agricultural Policy Arthur Laffer Internet fraud Economy of Pakistan Treasury security Deficit spending Hyperinflation Health insurance Dog agility Oyster card Supply and demand Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Article One of the United States Constitution ELO rating system Gold standard Weimar Republic Redundant array of independent disks Mortgage-backed security Athenian democracy Collateralized debt obligation
