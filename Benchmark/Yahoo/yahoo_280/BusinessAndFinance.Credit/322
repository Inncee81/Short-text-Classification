where can i complain about wells fargo if you wanna hear the story read on its boring if you have an answer you know what to do first i made a deposit for and then i made a payment last night the payment was for a moneygram there it says payment will be processed in days it even shows both the deposit and the payment are pending this account had before the deposit then it showed pending and available which is fine but now my account is i figured that was temporary until the dep and the payment went through i called and it turns out its not temporary i got pissed bastards hung up on me i called back more pissed but polite a second time told em what happened eventually i asked to speak to a superior and they left me on hold for min bank closes before i get off work order first the deposit then the payment on my account activity it shows the same order still both pending its a checking account i hardly use for certain transactions i think the balance is like that because only the first posts right away if your deposit was pending it was not posted to your account you should not have initiated the payment until the deposit was actually posted to your account your negative balance is undoubtedly due to a bounced check fee Bank Internet fraud Credit card Octopus card Mutual fund Schabir Shaik Trial Mortgage Money supply Balance of payments Bank fraud Bank of America Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gold standard Bretton Woods system Cheque Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation EFTPOS PayPal Money creation Automated Clearing House Debit card Payroll Euro James Hanratty 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Wells Fargo Advance fee fraud Bond Monetary policy Certificate of deposit Credit score Financial services Leasing Riggs Bank John Major President of Germany Money Mikhail Khodorkovsky Citigroup Islamic banking Surveillance Student loan Tom DeLay Mensal__o scandal Medium of exchange United States Postal Service Joseph Smith, Jr. Money laundering Guantanamo Bay Air America Radio Sin City Economy of India Economy of Russia Automatic teller machine Economy of the Philippines Tax Savings and loan association Money order Watergate scandal Sea level rise Security (finance) SCO-Linux controversies Betting (poker) Futures contract Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Derivative (finance) Bank of China (Hong Kong) Finance Social Security debate (United States) Financial audit Open access Margin (finance) Katelyn Faber New Deal Charles Graner Charles Ponzi Israeli West Bank barrier Mergers and acquisitions Halliburton Roswell UFO incident International Criminal Court The Ashlee Simpson Show Reserve requirements Unemployment benefit The Time Machine Copyleft 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Thermal power station United States Constitution Parliament of Malaysia Kill Bill Credit card fraud Economy of Argentina Electronic money E-mail spam Publishing Euphemism
