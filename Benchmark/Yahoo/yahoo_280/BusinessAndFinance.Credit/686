if a car lender i have been paying for years decides to check my credit shouldnt be soft not hard i have been paying for a car for years recently my phone was turned off and i was due for a payment and i hadnt call the lender i was about days late well recently i pulled my equifax report and i see where the lender pulled my credit according to the report all of the inquiries on the report are hard which would include that one shouldnt it be a soft who decides do i dispute it any lender can make a hard inquiry if it has permissible purpose in your case your car lender had permissible purpose a because you still have an open ongoing contract with him b if you'd read the fine print it probably gives the lender the right to pull your credit report as long as you owe money on the loan for collection purposes or such if you are late usually it is not a hard inquiry when a lender double checks on a consumer report but in your case it is the lender's choice i would not try to dispute it but i'd write the lender a nice letter stating that due to good past business and hopefully future business you'd hope it is not going to happen again and maybe they can correct what already happen and keep in mind they do not have too Mortgage Deflation (economics) Short selling Bank Bond Monetary policy Insurance Credit history Student loan Debt Interest Annual percentage rate Finance Government National Mortgage Association Corporation Predatory lending Real estate broker Inflation Government debt Great Depression United States Postal Service Credit card Annuity Schabir Shaik Trial Tennessee State Constitution Business cycle United Kingdom corporation tax Identity theft Money Social Credit Payday loan Plame affair Economy of the United States Usury FairTax Temasek Holdings Futures contract Financial markets TransUnion Lender of last resort Debt consolidation Security (finance) CPU cache Subsidy Bulgarian language Life insurance Citigroup Islamic economics Gold standard Interest rate Contract Economy of Pakistan London Congestion Charge Microeconomics Surveillance Spanish verbs Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Privatization GNU General Public License Article One of the United States Constitution Wheel of Fortune Repurchase agreement Derivative (finance) Consumer finance Rational pricing Title insurance Copyleft Taxation in the United States Free will 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Probation officer Donald Trump Oil-for-Food Programme Scottish clan The Amazing Race Hyperinflation Credit risk Cheque Child support Economy of the Philippines Air India Flight 182 Blackjack Islamic banking Apple Computer ALGOL 68 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 2005 United States Grand Prix Trademark Satchel Paige 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Social Security (United States) Fiat money Downing Street memo Credit repair
