for someone just starting to build their credit would you take a pre approved loan offer and just put the money in a cd and just make the payments for a year then pay it off or what about take it out pay on it for months then pay it off what should i do you could build your credit the way you described but here was what i did i started by getting a credit card right after i finished high school i hardly used the card maybe once or twice a year and paid the balance in full each time no interest no late fees i also picked up a couple of store cards while i was in college after four years of school and accepting a job i had built enough of a history to be approved for an auto loan for a brand new car with no co signer eight months after that i bought a house again no co signer credit cards are good for building credit because they are reported monthly to credit agencies as being in good condition even if there is no balance as long as they are not late and you made at least the minimum payment my first credit card is still open and shows in good condition though i have not used that particular card for about years that plays a big part in your credit score also you want more credit available to you than you use this shows that you can responsibly manage your credit good luck Credit card Student loan Bank Mortgage Credit score Great Depression Personal finance Credit history Betting (poker) Internet fraud Insurance Citigroup Baccarat Interest Debt Primerica Financial Services Education in Germany Mutual fund Money Bretton Woods system Refinancing National Football League Islamic banking Wal-Mart Electronic commerce Education in the United States Deflation (economics) Octopus card United Kingdom corporation tax Social Security (United States) Government National Mortgage Association Predatory lending Schabir Shaik Trial Monetary policy Life insurance KCR Short selling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sears Holdings Corporation Filling station Donald Trump Credit card fraud $ale of the Century MetroCard The Amazing Race Leasing Oyster card Municipal bond Education in the People's Republic of China Financial services Contract bridge Gold standard Smart card Auto insurance Health insurance Wheel of Fortune London Congestion Charge Social Credit Blackjack HSBC Arbitrage Annual percentage rate Money supply Micropayment Food Stamp Program Bank of China (Hong Kong) Anarchist economics Economy of Russia Collateralized debt obligation Pittsburgh Steelers Annuity EFTPOS Hyperinflation Leeds United F.C.
