yesterday my putter was running fine today it is slow slow slow any ideas how to pick it back up i have norton and it says everything is fine but i mean real slow help it sounds like you have stuff slowing down your computer first do everything that the people above me told you then go to start then control panel then if its not already there click on switch to catagory view then click on maintenance and performance there you'll see probably three different letters click on the c drive and at the bottom of that window click on defragment it' probably take awhile but just let the computer do what it do dont touch it it'll let you know when its done after this is complete download ccleaner and after the download click on the cleanup feature in ccleaner this should be a relatively short time then reboot and see if your computer is any faster it should be hope this helps good luck Microsoft Outlook Microsoft Office E-mail Outlook Express Computer virus Melissa worm Stopping e-mail abuse Ajax (programming) Gmail Hotmail Mozilla Thunderbird Microsoft Exchange Server Unicode and e-mail ICalendar Domain Name System AOL Instant Messenger National Weather Service Google Desktop Sender Policy Framework Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Pretty Good Privacy Internet Message Access Protocol Wile E.
