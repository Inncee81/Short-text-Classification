in access should i store a calculated value in a table if it's used in more than one query form or report is there an easy way to store the calculation logic somewhere so that i don't screw it up in the various places that it's used kinda new to access you might have figured that out by this question here's more detail on what i'm doing i have multiple queries that use the same table and i can think of at least one calculation that must be replicated in each of the queries i've heard you should never stored calculated data but it seems like that might be best since the same calc has to be used over and over again don't want to fat finger it or screw up the code plus if the calc changes i don't want to have to change every single query that it's in maybe i need more than one query to feed my screens reports like maybe i should do a query just for derived data maybe i just answered my own question i dont exactly get your question but all calculations are done in the 'design' screen of the table when your doing a query you need not enter the calculation value again coz tis based on what you entered in the table you get the result in query hope this tutorial link would be useful http www bcschools net staff accesshelp htm Expert system Domain Name System Microsoft Access OLAP SQL CPU cache Object-SQL mapping Microsoft Jet Database Engine Digital circuit Database management system Active Directory MySQL Computer Web crawler OpenOffice.org Forth programming language Ajax (programming) Hash table HTTP cookie Uniform Resource Locator XML Palm OS MDAC Calculator Geographic information system NTFS CPU design Prolog X86 assembly language System/34 TI-89 series Data processing Internet protocol suite Motorola 68000 Computer numbering formats RISC Oracle database Password Perl Temporal database Windows 2000 Logarithm On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences File Allocation Table Netfilter/iptables Google search Abstraction (computer science) Object database Emacs Internet Group Management Protocol Global Positioning System WebObjects Microprogram Resource Description Framework Burroughs B5000 C plus plus Binary numeral system Bloom filter Copy protection Microsoft Excel PostScript BASIC programming language HTML Hexadecimal Python programming language PlayStation 3 MUMPS PostgreSQL Compact disc GNU General Public License Visual Basic Btrieve Virtual memory Control character Technology in the Stargate universe IP Multimedia Subsystem Database normalization RS-232 Class (computer science) Linked list IDMS ARM architecture Addressing mode Database design Flat file database Lotus Notes Astrophysics Data System Opera (web browser) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Francis Crick HyperText Transfer Protocol
