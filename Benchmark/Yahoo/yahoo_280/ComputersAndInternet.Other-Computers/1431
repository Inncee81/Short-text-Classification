replacing my mouse for photoshop i have been doing alot of experimenting with photoshop and the one thing that i have had the most trouble with on any project is when it comes time to draw something freehand with the mouse someone once told me that there is something available that is similar to using a pen on a flat surface that would give me more control in drawing more precisely and i was wondering if anyone could tell me what this product is called so that i could order it and try it out also would i have to disconnect my mouse each time i wanted to use this or is there a way that i could use both and simply switch back and forth as needed wacom tablet they're amazing i have a wacom intruos tablet it comes with a pen and a mouse but it plugs into the usb drive so you can use the pen and your regular mouse without having to unplug either mine was but it was so worth it they take some getting used to but once you get the hang of it you have so much freedom for computer art d i loves my tablet cuddles it Computer virus Spyware Anti-virus software Windows XP Filename extension Trojan horse (computing) Malware AOL Instant Messenger Stopping e-mail abuse MSN Messenger Computer security Gmail Kazaa Rootkit Common Unix Printing System Internet Explorer Microsoft Windows Wget Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Skype HTTP cookie E-mail spam Warez Ebook Representational State Transfer Website Opera (web browser) Trusted computing Mydoom HTML element BitTorrent Common criticisms of Microsoft Portable Document Format OS/2 Emacs Melissa worm Norton AntiVirus Wiki Adware Hotmail Apache HTTP Server Microsoft AntiSpyware Web browser Jabber Linux MAME Internet File sharing Spybot - Search & Destroy Windows Vista Internet Relay Chat Macromedia Flash Peer-to-peer Miranda IM File Transfer Protocol Cross site scripting Spam (electronic) Blue screen of death Java programming language Instant messaging Freeware Trillian (instant messenger) Streaming media World Wide Web Web crawler Batting average USB flash drive HyperCard Free software E-mail ITunes Konqueror Lotus Notes File format Secure Shell EDonkey network Google Desktop ZX Spectrum Gnutella Bluetooth Pretty Good Privacy Stardock Unicode OpenDocument Browser wars Charles Ives Python programming language Mac OS X v10.4 Host file MS-DOS XHTML IPod Web server
