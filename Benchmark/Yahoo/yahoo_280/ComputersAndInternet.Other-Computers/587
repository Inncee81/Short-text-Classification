apple store physical retailer question i guess that's how it's worded please help i'm converting apple macbook after years of terrible microsoft i do have a question though it's kinda stupid but it's better to be safe then sorry if you get my drift like the physical store locations not online store do they sell macs at an apple store location like on the spot or do you have to have a personal appointment to order one and all that fancy stuff i hope you understand my question thanks i wasn't sure where this went so i guess here thanks for responding so far i don't really want the works just a few things here and there that's about it i know what you mean the store physical is a better place to shop but if you want an option that is not the standard you need to place an order online the nice boys and girls at the apple store will gladly help you do an online order they are not on commission i've bought on impulse several macs at the store but i wish i bought them online with the options i really needed oh well live and learn update my advice is still the same shop at the store then buy online either at the store or from home i've never been crazy about buying on the phone Video codec Warez Video CD Super Video CD H.264/MPEG-4 AVC QuickTime World Wide Web Streaming media Digital rights management DivX Disk image PlayStation Portable HyperText Transfer Protocol Windows XP ATI Technologies Apple Computer Karaoke Digital video recorder Common Unix Printing System AVI Web crawler HTML Media Player Classic Web server Moving Picture Experts Group Commodore 64 BitTorrent ITunes Internet pornography Uniform Resource Locator Wiki CD recorder Blu-ray Disc Enterprise content management Windows Vista CD-ROM Sampling frequency Radeon Representational State Transfer Gmail Sony Computer Entertainment X86 assembly language Ajax (programming) Mac OS X v10.4 XML PlayStation 3 Compact disc Winamp Sega Dreamcast CPU design Website Analog-to-digital converter Wget Wireless Application Protocol Character encodings in HTML Computer CPU cache Forth programming language AmigaOS DVD player Nintendo Revolution Copy protection RGB color model Theora Digital camera DV Hello world program Ebook Web browser XviD File format JavaServer Pages Unicode and HTML MPEG-2 Camcorder ASCII art PHP SAS System 64-bit DIVX Mozilla Firefox MPlayer Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Xbox Microsoft Operation Site Down Windows Mobile Telecine MPEG-4 Linked list Unicode
