whats a good way to backup photos i am starting to accumulate a lot of photos of my spiders scorpions and other bugs i was wondering if burning them to a cd is good and i also have a mb flash drive to use if necessary you could buy one of those external hard drive things its just like a flash drive i guess except they can fit like gb which is excellent if you want to store lots of high quality pics also note that cd's might get scratched or become unuseable due to heat etc and not work after a period of time USB flash drive BIOS Password Beatmania IIDX Floppy disk Energy development Bicycle lighting IPod Flash memory Digital photography Hard disk Creatures in Bionicle Booting Video game music Venom (comics) Shen Gong Wu Modchip Pebble bed reactor Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Patricia Ford IBM PC compatible PIC microcontroller File Allocation Table Computer virus The Sims 2 Jet engine Teen Girl Squad Password cracking PlayStation 2 RuneScape economy Explosive material Redundant array of independent disks Copy protection Rome: Total War Year of the Spider Embedded system Rammstein Extreme Programming Diamond Treehouse of Horror V Internal ballistics Bulk vending DVD Philatelic investment Diablo II: Lord of Destruction LiveCD MP3 MiniDisc Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Microcontroller Atari ST File system Piccolo Junior Saga Amstrad CPC Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Search engine optimization Opportunity rover Material properties of diamond RuneScape locations MRAM Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Beryllium Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Heinkel He 100 Steam engine Spacecraft propulsion GamePark Capital accumulation Stirling engine Space shuttle main engine Neopets Backup Apollo 15 Digital rights management CompactFlash Compact disc Looney Tunes: Back In Action Diesel engine Solar power Data remanence Year 2000 problem Spider Apple Newton Solid state disk Severe weather terminology (United States) Enterprise content management Steam (content delivery) RuneScape quests Recipe AmigaOS The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Partition (computing) Western Digital Thermal power station Turbocharger Data recovery Knoppix Sword making John Stewart (comics) Atari 8-bit family
