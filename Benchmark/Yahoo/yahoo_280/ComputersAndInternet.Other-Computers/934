why does my computer do this when i connect to the internet i get a window that says main module has encountered a problem and needs to close then i click okay and it all goes away then i can open my isp program again and get on the internet with no problem but the next time i try to get on the internet it does it again does anybody know if this is an indication of a major problem what type of firewall programs do you have on your computer do you have more than one what is the latest one that you have downloaded or installed are they all up to date first start with last thing that you install downloaded if there is one it is most likely causing the error if not then i would assume the one that you have needs upgrades because it is not reconiging something when you are opening it up the first time then once you restart it it does it without whatever is holding it back and then you are find until the internet connection is lost or you close internet explorer try upgrades and removing problems and see if it works Trojan horse (computing) Anti-virus software Cmd.exe Computer virus COM file Ebook Filename extension Windows 2000 MegaMan Battle Network Metadata Rootkit Malware File format Macromedia Flash C Sharp Portable Document Format Spyware Magic number (programming) Dynamic-Link Library Digital photography Compiler AmigaOS High Level Assembly ILOVEYOU OS/2 Linked list Stopping e-mail abuse Blue screen of death COMMAND.COM DIGITAL Command Language Pipeline (Unix) Google Desktop Data recovery Btrieve Windows API Pneumonia Windows 3.x MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Dialer Computer file Hello world program ALGOL 68 Perl Disk image Virus classification Geographic information system Gmail National Oceanographic Data Center Translation memory Macro Header file Icon programming language Gene therapy MediaMax CD-3 Double-click (computing) Batch file Computer security HyperCard Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Serialization WYSIWYG WavPack River Exe Icon (computing) Screenshot Intrusion-detection system PaX Portable Executable Unicode Computer forensics Windows 1.0 Cascading Style Sheets Object file Ghost (software) Microsoft Paint Password P__li Copyleft MinGW Screensaver Chess opening REBOL Commodore DOS Game Maker System 6 OpenDocument Musical Instrument Digital Interface Influenza Klik Tagged Image File Format Macintosh Finder Trusted computing Binary and text files E-mail spam Chess strategy and tactics Web traffic Logo programming language Resource fork Microsoft Word
