why have my old time radio files become read only i'm in a fix i downloaded some old time radio files and used the windows media player to burn them as an mp cd that was easy enough and i have been listening to them then yesterday i put the mp cd back into my computer so i could make a back up disk of the cd but i have found that the files in the cd i put back into the computer have become read only i tried to uncheck the read only box but i was denied access worse still when i tried to burn a back up cd from the original otr files that were still on my computer it didn't work there was a message saying that the burning process had been completed successfully but when i put the disks into my mp cd player the disk just skipped forward one track at a time without playing what on earth has happened ps i hate windows i use xp and have windows media player any files copied from cd will likely be read only that's by design you can copy them to your hard drive the change them to read write but you should have no need to do so unless you're editing them Windows XP ITunes Backup Floppy disk IBM PC compatible IPod Computer virus Windows 2000 File Allocation Table Virtual memory Cache DVD Copy protection Digital rights management AmigaOS Commodore 64 Linux Architecture of Windows 2000 System 7 (Macintosh) Digital photography Steam (content delivery) Windows Vista Computer storage Redundant array of independent disks Online music store Apple II family Old-time radio USB flash drive System/36 Macintosh Finder Disk storage QuickTime Computer forensics System/34 Microsoft Windows MP3 Debugging DOS NeXT History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Sound recording ZX Spectrum NTFS Gramophone record MiniDisc Early IBM disk storage Diablo II: Lord of Destruction MAME Macromedia Flash Disk cloning Computer file Disk formatting Flash memory Multitrack recording Atari ST MDAC Apple Macintosh Library (computer science) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Hard disk Windows 3.x Novell NetWare Pretty Good Privacy Atari 8-bit family Streaming media Partition (computing) Xbox Windows Me BASIC programming language Karaoke Btrieve Master Control Program Windows 95 Common Unix Printing System Computer Apple Computer Windows Server 2003 WordStar Malware Mixtape Mach kernel Sony Amiga Disk image Plan 9 (operating system) USB mass storage device class Google CP/M Spring operating system Patch (computing) Creative Zen
