i have two hard drives sata i what to install windows xp on one and windows vista on the other joe k is doing it the wrong way for how u can go into your bios and select the st drive as the nd boot device and ur disk drive as the st instal windows vista on one hard drive but make a partition with gb for windows and applets then make the rest of the drive a partition for data go into the bios and select the nd drive as boot device and ur disk drive as boot device same as step on the other drive but for xp to boot from vista or xp select the drive that has the correct os and set it as the st boot device doing it this way will make it so that vista and xp are separated and dont interfere like they can if they are on the same drive also dont touch the partition with xp from vista and the vista one from xp use the non windows partition for data that needs to go between oses like documents make sure to install progams one each drive from that drives os so apps for xp get installed on the xp drive and dont run apps from xp while in vista that might couse corrupt data and the program most likely wont run correctly Windows Vista Windows XP Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible Windows Server 2003 Random access memory Blue screen of death Apple Macintosh History of Microsoft Windows Memory (computers) FreeDOS RAM disk Nintendo GameCube Windows 2000 Virtual memory Acorn Electron Atari ST Library (computer science) Commodore 128 Windows 3.x Personal computer TRS-80 IPAQ Mac OS X X Window System Apple II family Sequent Computer Systems Graphics processing unit RISC USB flash drive Macintosh Finder Browser wars Flash memory History of the graphical user interface Computer forensics X86 CPU cache Booting F-16 Fighting Falcon Dynamic random access memory The Sims 2 Upper Memory Area PlayStation Portable Windows XP Media Center Edition IMac Acorn Archimedes DirectX Windows Blackcomb Windows 1.0 Sound Blaster MSX OpenGL PowerBook PC Engine Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Sinclair ZX81 Google Desktop PlayStation 3 Kernel (computer science) Super Bowl XIV Next-Generation Secure Computing Base AmigaOS 64-bit Front side bus MIPS architecture Windows Presentation Foundation Atari 8-bit family ZX Spectrum Commodore 64 IBM PC IPod Non-volatile memory MS-DOS Fritz-chip Vaporware Bank switching Mouse (computing) BBC Micro Amstrad CPC Emulator Datamax UV-1 Original Amiga chipset PlayStation 2 Apple Newton Los Angeles Clippers Power Mac G5 Radeon Apollo Guidance Computer DR-DOS Sega Dreamcast TRS-80 Color Computer Xbox 360 PowerPC DVD-RAM System 7 (Macintosh) Macromedia Flash MIPS Magnum DDR2 SDRAM Emacs WordStar
