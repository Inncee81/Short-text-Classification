cable dsl broadband ok so i read up a little on each of these but i'm still a little confused apparantly cable and dsl are types of broadband internet but then if a company is offering broadband how do you know if it is cable or dsl i am looking to get a internet service for my new place and only have a lap top basically i am trying to figure out which type and which company would be the best i was also wondering if anyone knew anything about the internet 'card' that you simply but in your laptop and works anywhere i think it was with verizon thanks for all your help in terms of speed dsl and cable are pretty much the same cable will be slightly faster but not worth the extra price so cable is good if you get a good tv cable combo deal with it cable companies are also monopolized in regions as well so you might not have too much of a variety to choose from dsl has different speeds available but one thing which no one realizes is that for dsl you need a base ground telephone line people nowadays keep just cellphones and they cancel the ground lines which means that they can't get a dsl connection so if you only keep a cell phone you can't get dsl nowadays there are a lot of packages cheap ones too with decent speeds are available att is like the best one if it is offered in your region usually you can call it in go to the cable dsl provider's website or visit your local fry's best buy circuit city because they often have some promotion thing and you get the modem for free as opposed to buying it renting it seperately you just go to a store and tell them you want internet service they can punch in your zipcode and show you everything that is available in your area and then check the companies' websites because there maybe some online promotion only which is much better if not then go back to the store and sign now if you are going to use this dsl cable at your home only with your laptop with a wired connection you are good if you want to use the wireless connection so that you can use the internet connection anywhere in the home without plugging it in you are going to need a wireless router as well which will pick up your internet and then send out the signal so that you laptop will pick it up otherwise you will have to plug in the cable to use the internet if you want those all time connected wireless internet access cards verizon makes them you will have to pay for the card and something like a month only for the internet connection this is definitely not worth it i wouldn't get it if i were you the quality signal strength and speed are not worth it yet and besides just anywhere you go there is free internet available in almost all of the public places such as libraries colleges and universities feel free to contact me if you have any more questions Internet service provider Voice over IP Verizon Wireless Telephone Universal Serial Bus Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Wireless LAN Internet Integrated Services Digital Network Eircom Power line communication Wi-Fi Telegraphy Asynchronous Transfer Mode Router IP Multimedia Subsystem Bluetooth Telephone exchange AT&T WiMAX Ethernet Internet fraud Laptop Cable modem HomePNA Tesco Etisalat Computer Verizon Communications Surveillance Nintendo DS IEEE 802.11 Computer bus Public Switched Telephone Network Nintendo GameCube IPod Frame relay Password Private branch exchange Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Telstra 9-1-1 Telephone numbering plan Jack plug Telkom Alcatel IiNet Dialer IBM PC compatible Commodore 64 Mobile phone NTL PlayStation 2 Skype Yahoo!
