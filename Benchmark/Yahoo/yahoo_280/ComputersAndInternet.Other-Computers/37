can i install a game onto a gb usb drive and play it from that stick on other computers or do i have to install it on that stick while it's plugged in to the computer i plan on playing it at no its not possible coz everygame that you install needs registry entries to be entered in your computer also the vital d engine of the game needs to make ini files and conf files so that it can interact with the d graphics on your computer all this happens when you install any game on any computer when you transfer the installed game folder on a usb drive to a different pc the d game engine doesnt have the registry entries to interact with the d graphics of the other computer also various game components do not have subsequent conf files configured according to the other pc the only way you can carry installed games on your usb drive is if its a flash game USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus Windows 2000 File system Windows registry IPod PlayStation 3 PlayStation Portable Btrieve Windows XP Computer PlayStation 2 Secure Digital card Knoppix Linux Memory Stick Flash memory Mandriva Linux History of Microsoft Windows Object Desktop USB mass storage device class Hard disk IPod shuffle Nintendo Revolution File Allocation Table Modchip Mouse (computing) Macromedia Flash Memory card Commodore 64 Apple Macintosh Xbox 360 FreeDOS Laptop Digital audio player Booting Windows Vista IBM PC compatible Apple Computer PHP Digital photography Copy protection Windows Me Computer and video games Bluetooth Plug-and-play Architecture of Windows 2000 Dongle Partition (computing) FireWire Computer software MSN Messenger ITunes Nintendo 64 DVD Amiga Blue screen of death Doom 3 AirPort MDAC AmigaOS Computer and video game genres IMac Digital camera CompactFlash Atari 8-bit family Computer science Emacs Musical Instrument Digital Interface NTLDR Computer forensics OpenGL Game development Windows Installer IBook QuickTime Personal computer History of the graphical user interface Mac OS X Web page Configuration file Commodore International Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic BIOS ReactOS Embedded system Interactive fiction Mozilla Firefox Nintendo GameCube Floppy disk Read-only memory History of computer and video games Creative Nomad Digital Equipment Corporation Windows Explorer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer-aided design
