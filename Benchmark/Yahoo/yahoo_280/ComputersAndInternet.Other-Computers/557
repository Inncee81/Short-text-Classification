what would be a good way to protect private files on public pc yes i have my own account of course this is on vista home edition but my dad is the admin so he can look at all documents any time bleh i know this because i signed into the admin account it's not password protected and there were all my files available to view right now i just change the extension to dll or something so they can't be opened but this is annoying since i work with them pretty often i tried to deny permission to the admin under security for the folder that the files are in but this made it so that i couldn't open the folder either i guess the admin is allowed to view anything no matter what any suggestions hopefully ones that don't require spending because i haven't got any lol the files are just a bunch of plain text files you cannot hide anything from the admin account but you can put passwords your documents there are plenty of free password programs and i'm sure you can find one on download com the other thing you could is use some sort of removable drive like an external hard drive a usb stick and even a cd r w as long as you use the cd in the same computer i hope some of these suggestions help and good luck Windows 2000 Novell NetWare Object Desktop Gmail Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol LiveJournal Windows XP Windows Installer Password Common Unix Printing System Stardock Spyware MSN Internet Relay Chat Dialog box Btrieve Mozilla Firefox Novell, Inc.
