motherboard question i have a dell diminsion and i want to change the motherboard so that it has a pci express port what do i need to buy and is there anything i can keep from my old motherboard the diminsion is all original with no new parts i dont want to spend that much money but i do want a motherboard with a pci express port any links would be nice thanks woops i ment i want to buy a motherboard and i want to know what to buy along with it to make it compatible with my computer in your situation if you want to change the motherboard to add a pci express card slot you will most likely need to buy a new case to put the new motherboard in name brand computers are proprietary and a new motherboard may not fit into the dell case take a look at what processor and the type of memory ram your dell computer now uses and buy a motherboard that matches these parts just install the processor and the ram memory from the dell computer onto the new motherboard and install the motherboard into the new case then move everything else from the dell hard drives dvd drives etc to the new case before you start this whole process you need to back up all the data you want to keep that is currently on your hard drive you need to do this because you will have do a fresh install of the windows operating system whether it's xp or vista you will most likely have to buy a copy of the windows os that you want to use because the windows os disk s that came with your dell computer may not let you do a fresh install a fresh install of windows in necessary because of the new motherboard the guts of the computer the new settings and drivers need to be installed fresh in the windows os also video cards that use the pci express slot are power hungry you will need to have a power supply that delivers enough power at least a minimum of watts check the box for the video card it should say what the minimum requirements are for a power supply new computer case to new motherboard to new power supply to windows os to IBM PC compatible Computer bus PC motherboard IBM PC Apple II family Commodore 64 Sound Blaster Windows XP Atari ST Apple IIGS Windows 2000 Computer hardware Redundant array of independent disks Peripheral Component Interconnect ATI Technologies Apple Macintosh Power Macintosh G3 Overclocking Linux Windows Vista GeForce 6 Series ZX Spectrum Accelerated Graphics Port PlayStation 2 USB flash drive Atari 8-bit family TRS-80 Color Computer PlayStation 3 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis 64-bit Graphics processing unit Laptop Hard disk Xbox MicroATX Microprocessor Windows 3.x Amstrad CPC Mac OS X IMac RISC Timeline of computing 1990-forward PC card Industry Standard Architecture Modchip Expansion card Computer case PowerPC MSX PCI Express History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Knoppix Floppy disk History of operating systems Booting CPU cache Commodore PET Patch (computing) Motherboard RS-232 Digital photography NVIDIA Nintendo GameCube Virtual memory Random access memory 3dfx A600 Mac OS Northbridge (computing) Nintendo Revolution Sega Dreamcast IBook PC Engine System/36 Front side bus ATX File Allocation Table Opteron Copy protection Dynamic random access memory System/34 AMD Wintel Fritz-chip NX bit Embedded system
