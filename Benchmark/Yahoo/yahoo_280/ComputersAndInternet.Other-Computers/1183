how do i make my computer work again okay computer geniuses everywhere i have a question for you a couple of days ago when i was innocently checking my emails on my computer the screen turned black all of a sudden and started restarting over and over again on its own so i shut my computer off and planned on restarting it later so maybe it'll work properly then but when i did try restarting it later it wouldn't turn on anymore now my computer is just dead does any of you know what's wrong with it or how i can fix it although i do have access to other computers i'd really like to have my own one working again i would appreciate it sooo much if someone can help me it sounds like your power supply burnt out you can buy a new power supply at a store like fry's electronics or compusa i would recommend at least watt power supply to make sure it will meet your needs you should be able to get a decent one for it is very easy to install yourself open up your computer case unplug all the power wires from the exsisting power supply from your disk drives motherboard fans etc and remove the old power supply put the new power supply in and just reconnect all the same things that you unplugged the other one from Adobe Photoshop Drawing Drill bit Stereoscopy GIMP Traditional animation PNG Windows Vista Wireless Application Protocol Color Goatse.cx HTTP cookie Photographic film Digital photography Canal lock Casting Screenshot Cathode ray tube ImageMagick Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March JPEG Resident Evil (video game) Opportunity rover Oasis (band) Fire fighting Paleoclimatology Digital image editing St. Peter's Basilica President of the United States Hot air balloon Super Nintendo Entertainment System Technicolor Graphics Piano Carpenters Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Common Unix Printing System Solar cell JPEG 2000 Google Maps Butterfly Super Mario World Bong Wyoming Printed circuit board Refrigerator car Vehicle registration plate Image file formats Cloud Diode Lemmings (computer game) Transformer Photoshopping Lichen IPod Final Fantasy (video game) Ra (board game) Application-specific integrated circuit Amateur telescope making Proxy server MSN Messenger Journey (band) Photography Sulfur Hawaii Wario's Woods Emotions (Mariah Carey song) Resident Evil Code: Veronica Nintendo GameCube Wallpaper group Graphic design Anonymous P2P Nuclear fuel cycle Lunar eclipse Tux Paint Pottery XML California The Strokes PlayStation 3 Mary Cassatt Nintendo Revolution Sega Dreamcast PlayStation Portable Helen Frankenthaler Airbrush Boyz II Men Glass Macromedia Fireworks Crop circle Amman Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Final Fantasy IV Jon Secada HyperCard ASCII art Spirit rover IPhoto Deep Impact (space mission) Coffee
