can you have the same first part of an email with two different service providers eg if you're called j smith and your email is jsmith hotmail com and you decide to get an email address with say aol then could you have the email address jsmith aol com or is it the case that once a certain form is used on one provider it's no longer available on another provider even though the final part of the address is different btw i'm not talking about transferring your email from one address to the other but rather having both email addresses you can use it as many times as you wish as long as it is with diff service providers so as long as you can find service providers that haven't already had the name being taken you will be fine for eg i have my name on my gmail and also on my yahoo and also on hotmail the diff service provides don't corelate with each other so it is only on their servers that you can't have the same name as then it wouldn't know who it is really meant for NVIDIA GeForce 6 Series GeForce 256 GeForce FX Radeon X Series GeForce 4 ATI Technologies GeForce 3 GeForce 2 PlayStation 3 GeForce 7 Series GeForce Xbox DDR2 SDRAM Xbox 360 World of Warcraft PlayStation 2 PowerPC 3dfx Voodoo 5 DDR SDRAM Central processing unit Pentium 4 Overclocking Graphics card Nintendo GameCube HyperTransport CPU cache Super Nintendo Entertainment System NForce2 IMac Xeon Counter-Strike World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade PCI Express Graphics processing unit Dynamic random access memory Microprocessor Universal Serial Bus Athlon 64 Doom 3 Pentium D AMD Atari 8-bit family Windows Vista Itanium 2 Front side bus Apple Macintosh 64-bit Rambus Pentium III Nintendo Revolution MIPS architecture NForce PA-RISC family PlayStation Portable Clock rate MOS Technology VIC-II ZX Spectrum Timeline of computing 1990-forward Data General Nova IBM PC Celeron ARM architecture VIA C3 Sinclair ZX81 Binary prefix Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Pentium M PowerPC G4 PC Engine Commodore 64 VIA Technologies Bandwidth Digital Visual Interface Commodore 128 Motorola 68000 Bluetooth Vertex and pixel shaders Atari ST Athlon IBM POWER Mac OS X CPU design PC card Apple IIGS Zilog Z80 Nintendo DS INMOS Transputer Random access memory HyperText Transfer Protocol Cell (microprocessor) Windows XP Media Center Edition Pentium
