windows xp if you buy windows xp can you load it on more than one computer and also does anyone have windows vista do you like it do you recommend it thanks for the input you have to buy a multi license of xp if you want to install it on multiple computers a multi license version will cost more than a regular single license copy as for vista i used it for a while when the beta was first released and i know a few people who use it right now vista has issues supporting some hardware and it can be hard to find drivers for things however these issues will improve as vista gets older and microsoft puts out more updates if you are planning on buying an operating system right now and your computer can support vista it may be more cost effective to get it now and wait out the bugs rather than buying xp at about then buying vista later i hope this helps Windows XP Microsoft Windows Windows 2000 History of Microsoft Windows Windows Server 2003 IBM PC compatible AmigaOS OpenGL Apple Macintosh Microsoft X Window System MS-DOS DirectX Blue screen of death Linux IPod History of the graphical user interface Internet Explorer NTFS Timeline of computing 1990-forward FreeDOS Windows 3.x Architecture of Windows 2000 WebObjects Wine (software) MIPS architecture ReactOS Mozilla Firefox Computer virus CPU cache DragonFly BSD Portable Document Format Fritz-chip Universal Serial Bus Vorbis Virtual memory Booting Windows Me Novell NetWare NeXT Browser wars Amiga OS/2 Information Technology Infrastructure Library C plus plus WindowBlinds Perl Atari 8-bit family System 7 (Macintosh) Copy protection ATI Technologies OpenOffice.org OpenBSD Radeon File system Emacs DOS BIOS RISC OS PostScript MDAC File Allocation Table Thread (computer science) Kernel (computer science) Windows 95 Opera (web browser) MAME Mouse (computing) Redundant array of independent disks Plan 9 (operating system) Berkeley Software Distribution Xbox Free software Software bug TeX NX bit Graphical Environment Manager Java programming language Library (computer science) Apple II family Common Unix Printing System Palm OS Macintosh Finder Disk cloning MSN Messenger Windows API MSH (shell) Server Version Stardock Windows Blackcomb Common criticisms of Microsoft SCO-Linux controversies GNU General Public License
