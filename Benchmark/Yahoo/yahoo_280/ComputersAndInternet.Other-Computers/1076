what does rgb stand for when talking about computers what does rgb stand for i tried wikipedia but it gave me another definition unless if it means the same thing the rgb color model is an additive model in which red green and blue often used in additive light models are combined in various ways to reproduce other colors the name of the model and the abbreviation rgb come from the three primary colors red green and blue and the technological development of cathode ray tubes which could display color instead of a monochrome phosphoresence including grey scaling such as black and white film and television imaging the term rgba is also used to mean red green blue alpha this is not a different color model but a representation the alpha is used for transparency these three colors should not be confused with the primary pigments of red blue and yellow known in the art world as primary colors as the latter combine based on reflection and absorption of photons whereas rgb depends on emission of photons from in the case of a cathode ray tube display a compound excited to a higher energy state by impact with an electron beam the rgb color model itself does not define what is meant by red green and blue spectroscopically and so the results of mixing them are not specified as exact but relative and averaged by the human eye when the exact spectral make up of the red green and blue primaries are defined the color model would then become what is known in science and engineering as an absolute color space such as srgb or adobe rgb see rgb color spaces for more details this article discusses concepts common to all the different rgb color spaces that use the rgb color model which are used in one implementation or another historically in color image producing electronics technology Regular expression Google search Typosquatting Search engine Search engine optimization Web traffic Spamdexing Yahoo!
