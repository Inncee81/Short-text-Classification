is there such a thing as your antivirus software becoming corrupted and howd you know if its happened probably if you get error messages from the antivirus software then something is probably wrong someone might have been up to no good but it's also possible for part of the hard drive to go bad and the antivirus software may be stored in that area if the antivirus software won't run try booting from something like an antivirus recovery disc perhaps the norton internet security cd for example and if nothing seems to be wrong after a scan for viruses try re installing the antivirus program and it probably wouldn't hurt to use a disk scanning utility to make sure there are no corrupt sectors or clusters on the hard drive a quick scan would be better than nothing but a surface scan would be even better but it may take a very long time i'm more familiar with norton systemworks than i am the other utility suites but it seems reasonable that there are other good programs out there good luck Naoko Takeuchi USS Skate (SS-305) Post office 1990s Trinity College (Connecticut) United States Postal Service Pretty Good Privacy The Globe and Mail Public-key cryptography Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Mail fraud Electronic Arts Michelle Kwan Inspector Gadget Pretty Woman USS Skate (SSN-578) Rachel McAdams Jeff Bezos Royal Mail Mail order Natural language processing April 1, 2005 E-mail Bomberman Inline speed skating Pukkelpop Queens Pretty Sammy Pretty in Pink Cross-country skiing Ice skating Konami Melissa worm Takuya Kimura Totally Spies!
