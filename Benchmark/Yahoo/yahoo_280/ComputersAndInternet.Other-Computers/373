how can i prolong my computer's life without getting into the details i have an hp running windows that i've had since about to and it's started getting quirky today i had to upload an older version of scanreg to get windows to load this computer is critical to my life right now what precautionary steps can i take to help it stick around longer i know it's going to die sooner or later but i'm trying to delay the inevitable like is there anything on it i can change or whatnot have you formatted your computer to rule out if it is a software problem you can prolong the life of it by taking care of the hardware that is really where it becomes unfixable if broken i mean once a cpu overheats there is really no use to buy a new one cause you can pay the money for a new computer you can do little things like use compressed air to spray out the dust inside the case this will stop the dust from insulating your electronic components and causing them to over heat you can install more fans to in the case to help with the air flow you want to get the heat out of the case becareful with this one though cases are already design for air flow and installing a fan can disrupt the flow usually one will pull clean air in the front and spit the hot air out the back if you smoke be sure to keep that way from the comptuer because that will cause the chips and other component to become sticky and collect dust which will not come off with compressed air you can try to take off your heat sink to clean it and whip off the cpu so there is no dust blocking the transfer of heat from the cpu to the heat sink use thermal paste to make the connection better computers are like cars they have peices that wear out over time a hard drive is most likely to be the one that wears out first because it is the most mechanical peice in the computer if you get alot of bad sector errors and such that is a sign of a dying hard drive and should be replaced Wi-Fi Ethernet Voice over IP Broadband Internet access WiMAX Uniform Resource Locator BitTorrent Digital Subscriber Line Cable television Hotspot (wifi) Broadband Local area network PHP Wireless Wireless LAN Network address translation PlayStation 2 Internet protocol suite Internet Xbox IP Multimedia Subsystem HyperText Transfer Protocol Domain Name System Denial-of-service attack AppleTalk World Wide Web Internet service provider Bluetooth Token ring Telephone Quality of service Ajax (programming) Etisalat Power line communication Transmission Control Protocol Public Switched Telephone Network Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Internet censorship in mainland China MAC address Port (computing) Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Wireless access point Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Router GameFAQs Digital video recorder IPTV OSI model Password Cross site scripting Wireless Application Protocol Category 5 cable Wireless community network Commodore 64 CPAN Asynchronous Transfer Mode Sega Dreamcast Windows XP Grand Haven, Michigan Modem Perl British Sky Broadcasting GSM services Broadband Networks Spyware Federal Standard 1037C Coaxial cable Social software Computer bus Wget Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Whois Halo: Combat Evolved America Online Television network Telewest Broadband Chorus Communications StarHub Universal Serial Bus Network switch Computer network Apple Macintosh Virtual hosting Data retention Internet Relay Chat Communications satellite E-mail spam Streaming media Digital divide Austar Common Unix Printing System Telegraphy Integrated Services Digital Network Uniform Resource Identifier Domain name Sky Digital Alex Jones (journalist) Direct broadcast satellite
