where do short movies go into your computer where do short movies go that are short and download automatically my dad downloaded some golf swing movies that are like seconds and he wants to remove them from the computer if they are on it they take like seconds to buffer and play in windows media player thanks my dad said that you just click a link on the computer and it starts playing in windows media player instead of clicking on the link to play the movie in media player do a 'right click' instead and then 'left click' on properties then click on the 'shortcuttab' if it shows one and look at the target box it should show you the target location on the hard drive to where it is stored depending on your version of windows you may even have a button on this menu box that says find target which if left clicked will take you to the file location on the hard drive Windows XP IPod Minesweeper (computer game) Macromedia Flash Object Desktop QuickTime Screenshot PlayStation Portable Gmail Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Windows 2000 File system Computer virus Mozilla Firefox System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Mobile Computer and video games Digital photography Hello world program Java programming language NeXT Digital audio player Day of Defeat Stardock Dance Dance Revolution Macintosh Finder Spyware BZFlag DVD Comparison of media players AOL Instant Messenger Forth programming language USB flash drive SonicStage Windows 95 MS-DOS Prank flash Apple Macintosh Visual Basic .NET Google Desktop ITunes Music Store Floppy disk GunZ The Duel Library (computer science) Double-click (computing) Diablo II Go (board game) In The Groove (game) Xbox Knoppix Windows registry Mac OS X Karaoke Spy Hunter Copy protection Half-Life HyperCard Emacs Halo: Combat Evolved Windows Media Player Nintendo GameCube Mac OS X v10.4 P__li AppleScript Option key Online music store NPAPI History of the graphical user interface Malware MDAC Windows Vista Internet Explorer MiniDisc Common Unix Printing System IPod mini Windows Me Uploading and downloading MSN Messenger Linux Perl Doom 3 Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) MP3 Microsoft Paint Halo 2 Hyperlink Unicode Start Menu Xbox 360 Stopping e-mail abuse IMac Digital rights management Steam (content delivery) Team Fortress Classic Cache
