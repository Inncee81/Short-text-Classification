weird voices talking coming from computer speakers virus yah i don't know whats' doing it but there is something that is broadcasting voices etc over my speakers even when the internet is disconnected it went away for a while and is now back i'm using an xp with service pack if that makes any difference anybody had a similar issue my isp thought that it wasn't his problem because when you shut the internet off it's still there the internet also shuts off after several hours of connectivity we thought that might be because of a filtering problem with the fax machine that our line is going through so i'm going to pick up a new filter we're running one computer with a modem no router if you have any thoughts etc they'd be apprecitated thanks it is most likely broadcast radio if there is a fm radio transmitter close by the length of wire that connects the speakers to the computer act like an antenna and then the speaker is a speaker and you hear the dj or music or what ever the station is playing to fix this try wrapping the speaker wire into a smaller bundle to shorten it HyperText Transfer Protocol Object Desktop Google Web browser Common Unix Printing System World Wide Web E-mail Cross site scripting AmigaOS GameFAQs Stopping e-mail abuse Web design Blue screen of death Website Wget Kazaa Mouse (computing) ITunes Proxy server E-mail spam Uniform Resource Locator Web page HTML AOL Instant Messenger BitTorrent Portable Document Format XML Domain Name System HTML element Hello world program International Phonetic Alphabet Emacs Windows Vista Windows 2000 Malware JavaScript Macintosh Finder Steam (content delivery) Screenshot Enterprise content management MDAC Konqueror Pop-up ad Web traffic Internet fraud PNG Google search Search engine optimization Computer virus Password TikiWiki Pretty Good Privacy Wireless Application Protocol Internet Explorer for Mac NPAPI Internet Neopets Minesweeper (computer game) Web server CPAN Mac OS X Danger Hiptop Unicode Internet privacy File system CPU cache OpenBSD Web application Outlook Express Denial-of-service attack Lotus Notes Prank flash Internet Relay Chat Google Talk Expert system Netscape Communications Corporation BlackBerry User agent
