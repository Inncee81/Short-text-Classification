my idea for artificial intelligence ok so what is the computer a device able to memorize all the books written in the human history a device with so good logical skills that no chess master can defeat it on chess obviously the computers are something very very smart now you say ok but they don't have a real intelligence and thus we use it only by meaning here is what i suggest assuming the great memory and logical capabilities of computers nowadays once could create a software so powerful to sistematize all of the important information on the planet and use it for the better of humanity imagine a software so intelligent to tell you what is the cure for cancer is our universe indeed infinite what is the best stock to buy and more and this is possible here is a simple example the man cannot fly alone but he invited the airplane for this job and again he can't find cure for aids but invited the computer to do this job thanks bob b georgievv abv bg ive been told by a literal math genius that a computer is only as smart as the person using it i like to think of a computer as a drawing board but yes for stocks a program could be written to predict changes and outcomes based on decades of information and hundreds of variables Pig The Super Milk-chan Show British comic Smart and Smarter Origin of language Ward Churchill Onomatopoeia Spoink Dennis the Menace (UK) Trade Buster (comic) Economy of Slovakia Alias (TV series) Predynastic Egypt Chinglish Contract Chinese astrology Stingray (TV show) John Mayer (musician) Richard Cobden Foreign relations of Fiji September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September Charlie Brooker World Trade Organization Southeast Asia Civilization Neolithic Minoan civilization Organ donation Ottoman Empire Association of Southeast Asian Nations Hohokam John Forrest, 1st Baron Forrest of Bunbury Agriculture in Australia Colony in Space Neolithic Revolution Kent State shootings Prehistoric Britain Phenomenalism Prehistory of Cyprus Sino-Japanese relations Offer and acceptance Indiana Pacers Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds Sun Wukong Free Trade Area of the Americas History of the Americas Marshall Plan Five Little Pigs Bellary Alec Douglas-Home Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Talking animal Jimmy Carter Speculation Iron Language game Combatant Status Review Tribunal Charmbracelet The Arsenio Hall Show Mark Fidrych Nanban trade period African slave trade Commodity markets Math ap Mathonwy Khanate of Kazan Muscovy Company Steel Tony Kaye (musician) History of Vilnius Luther Allison Treehouse of Horror IV Northern Ireland peace process Livestock Economy of Romania Lord of the Flies 1956 Hungarian Revolution Economy of Taiwan Deforestation They Saved Lisa's Brain Varangian Mad Capsule Markets Vietnam War TaleSpin Linear Pottery culture Responsibility for the September 11, 2001 attacks Archibald McIndoe History of Crete Mardi Gras Trademark Hong Kong Domestication Jay Leno Minor characters in Seinfeld Garret FitzGerald Pink Floyd pigs Slavery Porky Pig Economy of the Dominican Republic Appeal
