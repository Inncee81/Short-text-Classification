question on picture i received in an email okay this is difficult to explain my question i received an email w pictures through my comcast account i accessed it through my laptop in a hotel room i opened the picture by clicking on this i copied and pasted it jpg image jpeg it opened into adobe photoshop album starter edition there was only picture however when i clicked on the arrow for next picture no idea what made me do that there were a ton more pictures but they were pictures i could tell from internet surfing like pics of baseball players movie stars etc there were also a lot of porn pictures and person pictures of people i dont know who they are did these pictures get downloaded from my laptop or did they come from the attachment from the person that sent me the original picture i am really concerned because the pics are ones i never looked at and people i don't know so i am trying to figure out if someone is using my computer i hope this was clear enough thanks for any help i know the person who sent me the email it was of her daughter so the email was not bad i am the only one who uses my comp and i don't haven't gone to porn sites thats happened to me before too im not really sure what it is but i guess when you surfe a website or download something from somewhere the little icons or pictures will be saved on your hard drive im not sure why that happens but when i saw i had tons thats why i try not to download alotta stuff its no big deal though your computer is not hacked or anything like that hope this answers your question Dr. Watson Tom Watson (golfer) Cmd.exe Jack Nicklaus Windows 2000 James Eli Watson Emily Watson PGA Tour The Odd Couple The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (television) MTV Movie Awards 2003 MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Mikey Whipwreck Strom Thurmond The Tonight Show The Wild Geese Jack Webb Jack Albertson Houston Astros Mega Man The Open Championship Elephant (album) Mercedes Championships Windows registry Newcastle United F.C.
