windows suddenly appeared recently there is a window from firefox appeared to tell me to update my firefox browser but i dont even hav a it it always appear whenever i m using the pc it is such an annoying stuff i tried to block it and restrict it but it still happening to appear on my screen plz help cause this is extremely annoying ty the site address is http www linux com at first i thought your question a disguised advertisement and was all set to report abuse however the url you supplied is broken in a foreign language chinese korean japanese or other language which uses similar graphic characters or a parked domain and from my brief research never used by firefox or any of the others built on the same framework so i guess you are asking a legitimate question after all my problem with the url is scammers who use legitimate domains like linux and append numbers in exactly the same manner as the url you supplied my suspicions of you aside are you sure have you ever installed one of the predecessors mozilla or netscape the core of each is the same and if i remember correctly when i was using netscape it also checked for updates anyway if you had any of the precursors installed in the past and did not uninstall using their uninstall utility it may very well have left something behind which is still active what you might consider doing is searching the registry assuming you are running a version of windoze for mozilla and see what turns up especially in the run and run once sections i do not remember the section names exactly i would not be surprised to see you find a program running as a service in the background which is checking for the updates do a search for startup manager at someplace like http www download com and get a program which will assist you in examining your registry for applications which run when you start or restart your computer some of these start and run completely hidden from view in much the same manner as a virus or trojan horse application i'm not calling firefox a virus just that a hidden application even a legitimate one uses the same features which a virus takes advantage of blame that set of features on bill gates this window is not coming from nothing something is running and making it happen a startup manager will help you find out what it is so you can kill it as an alternative you can trying this install firefox and then uninstall it using their uninstall utility firefox is reputable and follow the rules set forth by ms for install and uninstall in that their uninstall utility undoes most all that the install utility did someone else suggested ad adware and spybot of the two i concur about spybot and use it over ad aware spybot catches things ad aware misses both are free programs and do a reasonably good job at finding adware and spyware Screenshot Windows XP Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Family Guy Blender (software) Homestar Runner Audio commentary (DVD) Mouse (computing) Hello world program History of the graphical user interface AmigaOS Macromedia Flash IPod Kill Bill Embedded system Nintendo GameCube Xenosaga X Window System Taskbar TV Tome Konami Code 24 (television) Teen Girl Squad Page widening PlayStation Portable Menu (computing) DVD $ale of the Century Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Babylon 5 AppleScript Danger Man COPS (TV series) Ren and Stimpy Whose Line Is It Anyway?
