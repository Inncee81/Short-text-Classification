limewire isn't connecting i have two computers in my house that have limewire downloaded on them and they are both connected to the internet from a wireless connection yet the computer upstairs gets connected to limewire while the other one downstairs is hardly ever connecting the one upstairs is always supercharged and it downloads super fast but now that computer has a virus and i need to get it fixed meanwhile i would like to use the computer downstairs but its not connecting anyone have any suggestions on what the problem might be i'd appreciate it thanks you most likely have a virus on the upstairs from using limewire if its a worm it probably infected the downstairs computer as well your best bet is to uninstall limewire and never look back since it eats up all your bandwidth kills your isp and gives you viruses but if you insist on using it you need to rule out the wireless try taking the computer downstairs to the upstairs or the router modem downstairs if possible run a cable if both devices support it wireless speed is based on signal strength and even a minimal signal on your wireless will be way faster than your internet connection the only time a low signal would be a problem is if it is constantly losing the connection if your house was built in the s or s they used plaster over a wire mesh that for some reason obliterates wireless signals from a command prompt ipconfig will tell you if it knows its next hop to the internet your router and ping yahoo com will tell you if knows how to get there and resolve dns if youre still having problems it could be a browser or your limewire app or a third party program like a firewall not letting you through Microsoft Jet Database Engine Database MDAC Java Database Connectivity Hash table PL/SQL Database management system File system Isolation (computer science) CPU cache Temporal database OLAP Object-SQL mapping Flat file database Web crawler Internet Group Management Protocol ITunes Virtual memory Microsoft Access SAS System Computer virus SimCity 4 Domain Name System Debugging Ajax (programming) WebObjects PostgreSQL Library (computer science) Texas hold 'em MySQL Database normalization Btrieve Rootkit Search engine Poker jargon HTTP cookie Linked list Windows XP Polymorphism (computer science) Netfilter/iptables Read-copy-update HyperCard Relational algebra Astrophysics Data System OpenDocument Halo 2 Windows 2000 Computer security DVD Associative array BASIC programming language Belief revision Whois Mozilla Firefox Gmail Collision detection Gnutella Resource Description Framework Super Bowl XXVII Dallas Cowboys Join (SQL) Software testing QUEL GSM services Prolog Gnutella2 Java programming language NTFS Copy protection BLAST SAP R/3 SQL injection Dither File Allocation Table Active Directory Filename extension Distributed hash table Bloom filter Perl Array Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Compact disc Objective-C B-47 Stratojet Legal research Oracle database Google search Usenet
