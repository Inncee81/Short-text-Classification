how to wipe my computer from start up menu hi my mum has just rung me and said her computer wont start up she cant get into the computer at all i no when i had this problem i had to wipe my p c but nothing is coming up to say how we do it its gets to 'windows starting in seconds' and then goes back to the begining basically windows just doesnt start up what does she do to delete everything she cant actually get into the computer as windows doesnt load please help as she is disabled and the p c is her only lifeline she doesnt have any disks either which makes it a bugger we tried hitting f but nothing worked okay this is very easy to do there are ways to recover the files but they would involve having another computer attach cables directly to the hard drive and that would become a mess if you don't need to get the files then go ahead and put in your windows xp cd boot it from the cd you need to go into the bios and then tell it to boot from cd when you boot up the computer it should say 'setup f ' or something similar for more instructions post the computer manufacturer please get to the setup screen then chose 'r' meaning repair install once this is finished pull out the cd and try booting the computer again if it doesn't work you have to do a complete wipe place the cd back in and boot from it then do 'install' instead of repair good luck hope this helps chris Gnutella Peer-to-peer EMule ITunes File sharing Warez Uniform Resource Locator Spyware Azureus Mozilla Firefox Computer virus Whois Windows XP Wget Macromedia Flash HTTP cookie Podcasting Gmail File-sharing program Web traffic LimeWire Windows Vista Windows 2000 Kademlia Linux distribution Web crawler CPAN Suprnova.org Jon Lech Johansen World Wide Web Web server HyperText Transfer Protocol EDonkey network Uploading and downloading Gnutella2 IPod Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Google Kazaa Common Unix Printing System Linux Vorbis MDAC AOL Instant Messenger PHP Search engine optimization Freenet Btrieve Opera (web browser) Malware Proxy server Mouse (computing) AppleTalk Streaming media PlayStation Portable SubSpace (computer game) Magnet link Representational State Transfer Distributed hash table Internet Cache EDonkey2000 DCPlusPlus Chess Secure Shell Perl Mozilla Application Suite Steam (content delivery) Server HyperCard Stopping e-mail abuse UK Singles Chart Network address translation Forth programming language TikiWiki E-mail E-mail spam File Transfer Protocol Konqueror VideoLAN MIRC Object Desktop We Belong Together Something Awful Forums GunZ The Duel Cheating in Counter-Strike X Window System I2P Emacs Website
