putting ares on flash drive make computer faster i have a ' acer computer been using it for a good couple of years now but i have ares installed mp player downloader and more songs that necessary could i copy all of my files and the program onto a flash drive and delete it from my computer to make it run faster then run the program from the drive this program is nearly x bigger than anyother program on my computer thanks storing data on the hard drive has little impact on performance except in cases where you run out of space on the drive then serious problems can occur under normal operating conditions moving the files you are talking about to a flash would not improve system performance in fact it could actually slow things down because data from the hard drive moves through the system than data being read from the usd drive if you want to improve system performance on a machine that old there are a few things i can recommend shut down all non essential processes make sure you have enough ram installed for the programs that you run and close programs when you are not using them other than it's probably time to consider a new machine even the lowest cost pc's on the market right now are going to run circles around anything built in Macintosh Finder Object Desktop Uploading and downloading Google Desktop Konqueror Screenshot Opera (web browser) Taskbar History of the graphical user interface Google Macromedia Flash Mac OS X Gmail Web traffic Computer virus Windows 2000 P__li Icon (computing) Kazaa Windows Vista Mouse (computing) Twm Search engine optimization Mac OS history Stardock AmigaOS Xerox Star Mozilla Firefox WebDAV Newline Minesweeper (computer game) Computing minimalism System 6 Web page Internet fraud Web browser Pretty Good Privacy Click fraud Computer Uniform Resource Locator Knoppix MSN Messenger Google search X Window System Windows Server 2003 Windows Explorer Stopping e-mail abuse Portable Document Format Start Menu Virtual Network Computing MS-DOS Ajax (programming) HTTP cookie Apple Macintosh Pop-up ad Sun Microsystems Hyperlink Desktop publishing Internet Relay Chat History of Microsoft Windows Computer accessibility Denial-of-service attack MDAC Menu (computing) Common Unix Printing System Website Spamdexing Java programming language Cascading Style Sheets LiteStep Mac OS X v10.4 Xcode Desktop search Aggregator Operating system Bluetooth OmniWeb Laptop Spyware Desktop computer Konfabulator Directory Internet Apple typography Linux Apple Computer Phishing Self programming language Spatial file manager E-mail spam Drag-and-drop Ebook Filename extension Double-click (computing) Digital object identifier DesktopX Klik Microsoft Windows
