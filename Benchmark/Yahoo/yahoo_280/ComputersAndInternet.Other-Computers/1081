computeach misleading adverts my daughter did the ecdl course through computeach and was told they'd help her find a job on completion of the course she passed with flying colours in june and all they've done to help her find work is post her cv on a couple of web sites she had already done this herself am i expecting too much from them to be honest they're nearly all cons of some description or at the very least not worth the money they charge in fact quite alot of them masquerade as computer training companies but are really in the business of getting their 'customers' to sign up for a credit agreement with their company to pay for the course what's left after they've taken their profit from the interest rate is used to register the 'customer' onto the course they applied to do if your daughter actually learnt enough from them to pass the ecdl course then they've fulfilled that requirement which is fair enough relatively few of these companies are organised enough to be able to actually provide enough support to get people through the course s and the small print in their agreements is a minefield but unless they specifically say in writing what steps they will take to try and get people jobs after they're qualified they're not really obligated to do anything major to find people work unless they'll be benefitting in some way from people gaining employment after the course i doubt they'd do much more than uploading cvs to websites since it doesn't pay AOL Instant Messenger Spam (electronic) HTTP cookie Malware Macromedia Flash Blue screen of death Computer security Windows Vista MDAC World Wide Web Internet Windows registry Proxy server Uninstaller Trojan horse (computing) Linux Pretty Good Privacy IPod E-mail spam Filename extension Ajax (programming) IBM PC compatible Java programming language Mozilla Application Suite E-mail USB flash drive System 7 (Macintosh) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Opera (web browser) Linspire AmigaOS Commodore 64 Cheating in Counter-Strike Domain Name System ITunes Browser wars Mydoom Website Adware Patch (computing) Perl Python programming language Mouse (computing) Web crawler Uniform Resource Locator BitTorrent Internet Relay Chat Mac OS X Phishing Copy protection Mach kernel History of Microsoft Windows Btrieve Comparison of web browsers Trusted computing Streaming media Common criticisms of Microsoft Web application Floppy disk Palm OS Bluetooth Microsoft Office Thread (computer science) Visual Basic Windows API XML HyperCard OpenBSD Warez Pop-up ad Denial-of-service attack Web server Game programming Internet security Ebook C programming language
