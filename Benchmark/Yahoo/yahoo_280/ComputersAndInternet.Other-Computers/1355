picture formats okay so now how do you change the format of a picture you already have saved into your pictures without downloading any converters or anything when i try opening it in an image program it just says things like cannot be found so i can't open it and save it under a new format i even tried photoshop and will it matter if i just rename it with a different format if i'm only using the picture for desktop backgrounds emailing myspace and the such if you're running windows xp you should have an application called paint it's usually under start all programs accessories paint if you open the image in paint you can change it to any of the following formats bmp jpg jpeg tif tiff png or gif other than that you'll probably have to look into using another piece of software don't just rename the file as was suggested by the previous post you may render the file unreadable if you're on a mac there should be an application like paint but i wouldn't know what it is if you're looking for the best picture converting software use photoshop or photoshop elements available for both mac and pc once you use it you'll never want to use anything else to modify pictures again good luck Windows XP Malware Stopping e-mail abuse Kazaa Computer virus Windows 2000 Gmail AOL Instant Messenger Central processing unit Microsoft Windows Denial-of-service attack Adware History of Microsoft Windows Domain Name System Rootkit Internet Explorer Peer-to-peer PaX Opera (web browser) RISC Trojan horse (computing) Compiler optimization Buffer overflow Internet security Voice over IP MDAC Pretty Good Privacy Macromedia Flash Proxy server NeXT Computer Surveillance Linux Trusted computing Computer surveillance NX bit Musical Instrument Digital Interface Perl Mozilla Firefox Instant messaging Mach kernel Website Virtual memory Apple Macintosh Computer security Internet fraud Cache Portable Document Format Embedded system Fritz-chip Component Object Model Host file X Window System NPAPI IBM PC compatible Windows Server 2003 Web browser PeerGuardian Justin Frankel File sharing 64-bit Linked list CDC 6600 Thread (computer science) Password Common Unix Printing System Windows registry Computer forensics Netscape Communications Corporation CPU design Java programming language Novell NetWare Transmission Control Protocol Google Client-server E-mail IP address Sinclair ZX81 Trademark Microsoft Redundant array of independent disks Software cracking Bluetooth Firewall (networking) PNG
