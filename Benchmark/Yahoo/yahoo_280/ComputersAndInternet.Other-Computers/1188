one of these myself so as to not confuse those that think that i have not my findings in these products are useless and sometimes scare the normal user also these products are not for the normal user as normal user do not take the time to read the manuals docs for what they download and or buy they just want to install and use stop using the following software avg avg has been known to report false positives also reports tracking cookies as trojan downloaders this is bad practice to me scaring the user half to death because that's all that we hear on the news anymore is about trojans worms
