why dont girls llke to watch porn the top ten reasons most porn out there is produced by men and targeted at a male audience and it has a different aesthetic than that which women generally enjoy although there are many women out there who like raunchy male oriented porn too women generally like storylines plots and softer more romantic sex most of this porn i mentioned has an inherent misogynistic attitude that treats women as b tches sl ts whores and ho's to be used and abused by the men if there's anything to turn a woman off quicker that'd be it most straight porn doesn't feature good looking men now there are of course some nice exceptions but on a whole and particularly the more amateur the production the less appealing the men are compare that to gay porn where the boys seem to all be model perfect while the women are still porn perfect it stems from whom the target audience is of course generally men and the mistaken idea that the only thing anybody is looking at is that inch penis but women tend to enjoy the whole package handsome faces sexy bodies everything no wonder women don't go ga ga for it it makes us feel bad about ourselves women are infamous for our comparisons to pretty much every other woman out there and if that's already a blow to our self esteem then watching porn or knowing that most men out there watch it is the ultimate nail in the coffin because who can measure up to those bleach blonde liposuctioned silicone filled models women worry that the reason men watch porn is because they're dissatisfied with the women that they have at home and wish they could have porn stars instead nobody wants to watch or condone something that makes them feel so insecure and self doubtful most porn doesn't feature much in the way of real female sexuality i once heard a female porn reviewer joke that if you added up all the male on female cunnilingus scenes in the entirety of porn it still wouldn't last longer than five whole seconds and while that's exaggeration it's a sad truth women in porn either don't have orgasms at all or the actresses fake really bad ones the cunnilingus fingering clitoral stimulation if there at all are usually pretty bad and inept in reality women take a while to get aroused and statistics overwhelmingly show that women do not in fact usually orgasm from the ol' in and out pumping but through clitoral stimulation instead try and find that reality in porn though and you won't what woman wants to watch something that doesn't feel real that she can't relate to some women don't like porn on the basis that it's degrading and objectifying to women that the industry is harmful to the actresses etc etc and given some of the porn that's out there and the horror stories i wouldn't exactly say they were off base in that feminist assumption still i very strongly feel that andrew dworkin and her like are wrong not all porn is inherently degrading but women often come from the standpoint that men are perverted horndogs who only want women for sex and their bodies and when they see porn that reinforces that idea they are not only turned off sexually but completely disgusted by the very idea of porn itself some girls just don't like porn just like there are some guys out there who don't it's just a personal preference women may view porn as cheating if it's watched in a relationship i don't agree with that viewpoint but some women believe that by fantasizing about being with another person it is an affair of the heart mind and that isn't cool and if you feel your partner is cheating on you of course you're going to be pretty angry and ticked off women can't connect with a lot of the acts portrayed in porn that is produced for men things that may turn men on like double penetration the concept of c m sl ts who take multiple ejaculations etc etc will probably have most women running for their lives forever branded with a fear of what they think most men secretly want to do to them and understandably so women are socialized to not be interested in sex even as things are getting better than they were say in the 's still female sexuality gets put on the back burner boys are encouraged to masturbate and look at pornographic materials i e the whole fathers giving their sons playboy magazines at puberty or at least their sexuality is turned a blind indulgent eye but girls are rarely encouraged to masturbate are definitely not provided any female oriented sexual materials and their sexual innocence is closely guarded the idea of virginity lauded whereas sexual conquest is expected for boys and basically being a sexually minded female is synonymous with being a sl t or a dirty girl most women don't even begin to seek out porn because they feel ashamed embarrassed don't know that porn made for women exists etc etc many women actually do enjoy porn it just takes a special type you can find porn that appeals to women in a variety of venues nowadays

candida royalle tristan taorminio nina hartley veronica hart betty dodson is guaranteed to be a pretty good bet but remember that some girls don't like porn or some may have difficulty gettin over
