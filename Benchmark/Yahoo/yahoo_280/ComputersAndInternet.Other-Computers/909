what are some good ways to try to get your money back after buying a piece of junk computer i bought a computer off of the cyberpower website back in february even after i read all of the terrible reviews about them it took forever for my computer to finally arrive but after it did i was fairly happy with it for about two weeks before it started having problems after having had it for six months i am thoroughly sick of it and would like to get all of my money back it cost about though they don't let you return computers after you've had them for over a month so i was wondering what kind of things i should say on the phone to try to get them to give me a refund i wouldn't really want to take legal action seeing as how i'm only fifteen the only reason i bought it was because at the time i was looking for a computer a price equivalent dell would not have even been comparable to the cyberpower i could get so i decided to risk it i did see some good reviews but there weren't very many you'd think i would have been smart enough to just go with a dell since we have seven that all work fine but i wasn't over the phone is not going to get you your money back you are going to have to get all your receipts together for having it fixed and then send them copies with your complaints send the same information copies only to the state's attorney general civil division and send copies to the better business bureau mention you are only it actually helps no one wants to see someone stick it to a kid i did this years ago for a car i had painted that was guaranteed not to split chip or peel well it did all of the above and within days of getting my car back the guy laughed at me and said what are you going to do your just a kid i wrote my letters and took pictures and mailed it to the right people the guy who laughed at me got fired and i got a new paint job a better one and one that did not split chip or peel so hang in there and remember that your age could be your advantage point Reach for the Top National Certificate of Educational Achievement Wikipedia Family Feud Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
