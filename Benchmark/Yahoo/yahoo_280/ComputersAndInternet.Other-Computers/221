i've lost a file on my computer help it's urgent ok i had this file which i had saved to my flash drive as i needed to work on it on another computer i plugged the flash drive in a said send to my documents i then took out the flash drive and started working on the file in my docs i had it perfect so i saved it and turned off my computer then i just turned on my computer opened my documents and it is gone i have searched everywhere in the recycle bin used the search setting looked in like a million files but is has just disappeared unfortuantly i don't have system restore enabled either please someone needs to help me is there any other way to find a file that has literally disappeared firstly system restore restores you system not your data files you say you took out your flash drive after you copied the document to the computer so there's no way that it would try to resave to there is there so with the flash drive out you opened the copied file from my documents made amendments and re saved did you click on the save icon so that it sved with the same name and would automatically save to the same place from where you opened it or did you click on file save as in which case it could possibly have gone somewhere else i know you said you searched for it which is perplexing sometimes these impossibilities do happen for no apparent reason i presume you have also looked in recent documents if you click on file is it listed at the bottom of the submenu as usually the last few files opened are displayed there if it shows as it should what happens when you try to open from there ok so you've searched looking for it by name and nothing has come up how about doing another search this time putting in so it searches for any type of file but confine the search to say the day before and the day after and see what comes up possibly it saved as a tmp file can't really think of anything else but hope you can retrieve in any event not all is lost because you have the original on the flash drive in future when working on any document save early on make sure autosave is down to perhaps or minutes but don't rely on it and as you are typing just use ctrl s as part of the typing process to keep the document continually updated Computer virus File system Windows 2000 Gmail Macintosh Finder IPod AmigaOS Windows XP Domain Name System Macromedia Flash CPU cache Backup Mouse (computing) Computer forensics Mozilla Firefox Apple II family File format Computer Digital photography Unicode Btrieve Floppy disk Search engine optimization Emacs WordStar Common Unix Printing System SCO-Linux controversies Knoppix Public-key cryptography Embedded system OpenDocument Linked list Trusted computing Screenshot EMule Product Lifecycle Management Redundant array of independent disks Windows Vista Master Control Program Enterprise content management Killian documents StarCraft Secret Missions PHP GameFAQs Flash memory Translation memory Portable Document Format Xerox Star Universal Serial Bus Virtual memory ITunes Modchip File Allocation Table USB flash drive Copy protection Wiki Daylight saving time Apple Open Collaboration Environment Hard disk Uploading and downloading Perl Web crawler Internet Relay Chat Bubble Bobble HTML element Uniform Resource Locator Ebook Icon (computing) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Read-only memory Computer science E-mail OpenOffice.org Public domain Linux Microsoft Windows Time travel Metadata Malware Ajax (programming) Spyware SETI@home Mac OS X v10.4 CPU design C programming language Apple typography Musical Instrument Digital Interface
