about how much space does compressing a file save i'm moving my music collection to online storage if i compress a gb file how much smaller will it be when i compress it if your music is in pretty much any format other than wav it is already compressed an mp file will probably grow slightly if you try to compress it because the compression software adds information to the file the only way to really compress music is to resample it at a ower bit rate which will also reduce the sound quality MP3 JPEG Audio data compression Data compression PNG WAV Compression artifact ITunes Audio file format Lossy data compression Video codec GIF Image file formats JPEG 2000 Musical Instrument Digital Interface SonicStage Lossless data compression Portable Document Format Digital image editing NTFS Image compression PlayStation Portable ZIP (file format) Digital audio player Streaming media Disk image QuickTime Tar (file format) MiniDisc Macromedia Flash Enterprise content management Laserdisc IPod File format Ebook DVD H.264/MPEG-4 AVC CPU design Advanced Audio Coding ITU-T Psychoacoustics Raster graphics DV Hydrogen economy Wood Vorbis Tagged Image File Format Steganography WavPack StuffIt Movie projector Library (computer science) CPU cache File system Ogg Raw image format Prefix code Modem Redundant array of independent disks FLAC ITunes Music Store Disc jockey Digital photography Sony Podcasting Virtual memory Delta encoding LZW Audio level compression Creative Zen Jet engine Warez Floppy disk Digital circuit UTF-8 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis SAS System Bit rate Federal Standard 1037C Audiophile Sound Blaster Mach kernel OpenDocument Speex CD-ROM File sharing Digital audio Comparison of file systems E-mail PlayStation Sound Format TTA XML MS-DOS Carbon dioxide Open-source software Backup America Online Gramophone record ZX Spectrum
