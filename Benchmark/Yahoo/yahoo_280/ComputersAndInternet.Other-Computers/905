how to i change a limited account in to a admin account my admin account was forced to change into a limited account where i can't do anything on i went into safe mode in the default admin account where i could have deleted the admin password but i can't because as soon as my brother finds out he'll probably take my computer away how can i find out what the admin password is without erasing it or changing it he stole my laptop and messed it up when i ask him to change it back he says no i guess it doesn't really matter because this will all end when i buy another laptop first off i believe in ethics in computing so the best thing i can do since it seems your brother is the administrator and choose to limit your access is to tell you to stop and consider what you're asking those to help you with i would ask your brother to give you reasonable access so that you can use applications legitimately but really if you're willing to hack your own brother's computer i have a feeling you lost admin privileges due to something you shouldn't have been doing in the first place like trying to find out the admins password for that reason and that it isn't your computer my best suggestion to you is to gain back the trust of the admin your brother and work from there BitTorrent Azureus EDonkey2000 Warez Linux distribution Sigur R__s Uploading and downloading Online music store Peer-to-peer File sharing Suprnova.org Minesweeper (computer game) Kademlia Web crawler Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Mandriva Linux Kazaa ITunes Music Store Internet Grateful Dead Wget Download manager Digital photography Mozilla Firefox GIF World Wide Web America Online File-sharing program Hash tree Anti-virus software Microsoft Office Windows XP CPAN Copyright infringement Typeface Sikhism SubSpace (computer game) EMule Web server Download.com Filename extension Gmail Star Wreck Cascading Style Sheets Streaming media AOL Instant Messenger Opera (web browser) Windows Mobile Domain Name System Commodore 64 Skype Democracy Now!
