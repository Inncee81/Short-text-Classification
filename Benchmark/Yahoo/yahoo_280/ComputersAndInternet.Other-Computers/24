i hope this makes sense but can you safely delete old upgrades or will it affect the latest upgrade and will it make any difference to space on computer i think it's risky microsoft keeps old versions of programs such as media player so that you can roll back to the old version if you have problems with the new one media player is such an example even if the new version is installed in a different directory i'm not confident that files in the old version may not be used by other programs try a custom uninstall and you will sometimes get messages asking you if you want to delete a file because it may be used by other programs if you want to delete an old version i'd suggest moving it to a temporary directory and waiting a week to check that there are no problems before deleting it it should give you a bit more space on your computer but it might not be that much unless the application contained a lot of video files such as some games ITunes File system Windows XP Computer virus Windows Server 2003 Macromedia Flash MDAC Windows Installer C programming language Object Desktop Blue screen of death File Allocation Table Steam (content delivery) Spyware Windows 2000 AmigaOS Microsoft Windows Filename extension Internet Explorer Mac OS X Gmail Btrieve Virtual memory Copy protection The Sims 2 Linux Master Control Program Apple Macintosh MSN Messenger Library (computer science) Windows registry Java programming language Uninstaller Computer security Stardock Pretty Good Privacy AOL Instant Messenger Opera (web browser) History of Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible NTFS NX bit NTFS junction point Emacs Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows Vista Rootkit SonicStage Data General Nova Podcasting Microsoft Plan 9 (operating system) System/36 Microsoft .NET Computer and video games E-mail WordStar Apple II family OS/2 Windows Me DragonFly BSD CP/M Novell NetWare Patch (computing) QuickTime Buffer overflow Enterprise content management Microsoft Jet Database Engine Windows 95 JavaScript X86 Error correction and detection CPU cache 64-bit IPod Mandriva Linux Common criticisms of Microsoft HyperCard System/34 SubSpace (computer game) Kazaa Chess Computer insecurity PlayStation 2 Final Fantasy (video game) Embedded system Perl Computer file ZX Spectrum Mozilla Firefox Linked list Computer History of operating systems Ethernet System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Mobile
