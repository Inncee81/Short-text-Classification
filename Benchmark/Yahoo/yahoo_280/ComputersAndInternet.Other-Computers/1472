toolbar question okay this is probably a dumb question but the toolbar that is normally on the bottom of the computer screen has somehow moved over to the right side of my screen and i don't know how to fix it i was typing something when the toolbar jumped to the side of the screen i don't know what i hit to make it do that so i don't know how to fix it i've tried dragging it back into place but that hasn't worked i'm sure there's an easy answer to this that i just don't know but i've never had this happen to me before can anyone tell me how to get the toolbar back to where it is supposed to go thanks right click the task bar and click properties make sure the lock the taskbar box is unchecked and then click apply now drag the task bar from the side to the buttom and drop it done Play-by-mail game Don Daglow E-mail Shogi Halo 2 Chocobo Dungeons & Dragons System Shock Email authentication Super Mario 64 Yu-Gi-Oh!
