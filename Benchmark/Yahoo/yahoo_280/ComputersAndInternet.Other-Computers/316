getting pictures onto your computer internet let's say i draw a pretty picture on a regular piece of paper and i want to put it on my computer internet for everyone to enjoy i'll cut to the chase and ask how do i do that and what kind of technology does it take in order to do that i would really appreciate it if someone answered and i thank anyone who's already read this far d i think you should buy yourself an all in one printer photo printer scanner but try to find one that is economical on ink some of the cheap ones use ink very quickly so they are false economy though you can take out the ink cartridges and give them a shake that makes them last much longer if you only want to copy pictures and you're not interested in printing anything then buy a stand alone flatbed scanner new ones are quite cheap and older used ones are so cheap people are practically giving them away you could probably buy an old flatbed scanner for but the new ones are much nicer to put your photos onto the internet you will need to use some kind of image hosting website be careful many of them are for porn photobucket and image shack are both perfectly safe and not too hard to learn how to use and they're free http photobucket com http imageshack us uploading a picture seems a bit daunting at first but it's very satisfying when you succeed and after the first one it's easy another way of doing it is to put your pictures into emails when you write an email look for the attachments option it will have a paperclip symbol it will allow you to add pictures audio files or even short video clips to your email message always do a virus scan on an email before opening email attachments it's one of the most common way that viruses are spread if you have a genuine copy of windows xp or windows vista you can download photo story http www microsoft com windowsxp using digitalphotography photostory default mspx it's a slideshow maker that can automatically add special effects all you have to do is put in the pictures and it does the rest you can also add music or narrate the slideshow good luck email me if you have any questions IPod Windows XP IBM PC compatible Universal Serial Bus Mouse (computing) Embedded system Game Boy Advance SP Personal computer PowerBook Dance Dance Revolution Battery (electricity) Canon T90 Oscilloscope Battery electric vehicle Nintendo DS Wi-Fi Toyota Prius PlayStation Portable Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IMac ThinkPad Computer forensics Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Common Unix Printing System Diesel engine Beatmania IIDX Game Boy Atari ST Floppy disk Lithium ion battery Xbox 360 DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Microprocessor Macromedia Flash Opera (web browser) Danger Hiptop USB flash drive DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX IBM PC keyboard Miami Dolphins Roomba Liquid crystal display Poker jargon Cincinnati Bengals NEC Corporation Taskbar Blue screen of death Nintendo 64 Desktop computer Ford Ranger EV Bicycle lighting Game Boy Advance Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Sega Saturn Gradius Prank flash Hibernation Dodge Charger Hard disk Armored Core Screenshot Stroke Acer (company) 2001: A Space Odyssey Goatse.cx Konami Code Macintosh Portable Sega Dreamcast Guilty Gear DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX New York Giants 2003 North America blackout Commodore International R-Type Jack plug Ecco the Dolphin Bubble Bobble Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Woking Game controller Cheating in Counter-Strike Pump It Up Crown Court Common User Access Peugeot MAME International Phonetic Alphabet Thermal power station MSN Messenger Enigma machine Booting Second Battle of the Atlantic The Time Machine The Parting of the Ways Archos Hybrid vehicle San Diego Chargers
