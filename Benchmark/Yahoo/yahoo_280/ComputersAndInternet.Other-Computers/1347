picture formats file extensions now i have figured the other things out but now i'm wondering does it matter if i just rename pictures using a picture format so that they show up in the thumbnails if i'm only using the pictures for desktop backgrounds emailing myspace and things like that nothing fancy will they still be usable for those simple things and another thing how do i know which picture format is the one i want any help is very appreciated also neither photoshop nor paint will allow me to open the files so the format can really be changed i just wondered if i will still be able to use the pictures once i rename them with a format even though it really doesn't change the format if you are only using them for simple things i would recommend that you either use bitmap bmp or jpeg or jpg as the others have mentioned changing the suffix will not change the file format it is something you do when you save the file it has the save as name then the save as type the save as type is a pulldown menu and the differing types of formats will depend on the program you are using the most common on the internet would be either jpg or jpeg same format slightly different extension or gif gif is a global image format pretty well does anything you will ever need an image to do and if you were to try and be fancy there are programs that make animations out of gif formats for a desktop background also known as a wallpaper i would recommend bmp or jpg bmp would be for simple designs and patterns like you would see in the ms paint program jpg would be for more detailed photos as for emailing and myspace i would say jpg would be your best bet gif is a little more advanced and i merely mentioned it to help you understand a little more hope this helps if you have any further questions the help section in windows may have a slightly more detailed explanation Computer and video games Computer hardware Ethernet Digital video recorder Computer bus Password Modem Universal Serial Bus Computer Floppy disk Personal computer Random access memory Nintendo Revolution Sound card Digital photography Commodore International Internet Motion capture Sound recording Quake Internet service provider FireWire Computer network Nintendo GameCube PlayStation Portable Telegraphy Bluetooth IPod Broadband Internet access DVD SCSI PlayStation 2 Graphics card RS-232 Game show Dynamic random access memory Coaxial cable Sega Dreamcast Videoconferencing Surveillance Wargaming Desktop computer Local area network Computer terminal TiVo Apple Computer S-Video Atari 8-bit family IBM PC Pirate decryption Randomness High-definition television Film Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Public domain Amiga Secure Digital card Minimum spanning tree Lag Chess variant HomePNA Cable television Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Civilization III PlayStation 3 D-subminiature Federal Standard 1037C Fischer Random Chess Board game Serial communications Television Read-only memory Digital video It's a Wonderful Life Multiplayer Screenshot AirPort Trusted computing One-hit wonder Card game Distributed computing The Walt Disney Company Copy protection Galactic Civilizations IBM PC compatible Pump It Up Wireless LAN Wi-Fi OSI model ITunes Memory Stick Scalable Link Interface Digital camera Neil Young All your base are belong to us Digital television TRS-80 Color Computer
