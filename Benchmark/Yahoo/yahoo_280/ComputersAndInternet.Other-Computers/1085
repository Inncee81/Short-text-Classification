can't figure out how to so here is the deal short of a long story workgroup network all xp users pretty basic boss's machine gets eaten hd survives and we've got to re install o s software and re connect him to the network we gave his machine a new name added him to the workgroup and re shared out all of his folders to the network but here is the quandry whenever somebody access a file on his machine through the network for example his my documents and tries to add a new folder they get access denied also if he adds the folder himself then somebody tries to place a file into that folder we get check security access privlidges access denied how to i rectify this so that everybody can add new folders in his my documents and also place files into those folders by default the share level for everything in the my documents folder is restricted to everyone the owner of the file or folder and local computer administrators have read and write permission to the file or folder nobody else may read or write to the folder or the files in it this is the default setting for all the folders and files in each user's my documents folder you would have to add permissions to read write recursively to everybody in my experience sharing folders under my documents is too much pain i prefer to create a dedicated folder somewhere else on the file system and share it Extended ASCII ASCII ASCII art Uniform Resource Locator Control character HyperText Transfer Protocol APL programming language Computer keyboard Emoticon Goatse.cx Tablature Teleprinter ANSI art Google Maps Strawberry Fields Forever Dash Dream Theater Base64 Umlaut Brainfuck Apostrophe (mark) Website Number sign Control key Keyboard layout Web server UTF-8 IBM PC keyboard Slash (punctuation) Slashdot trolling phenomena Wireless Application Protocol Rod Stewart Tab Gmail Mouse (computing) Function key Digital Unicode Sinclair ZX81 2channel Google Web Accelerator Greeklish Chorded keyboard String (computer science) Esperanto orthography Commodore PET World Wide Web Web crawler Prank flash Mona (ASCII art) MIME Gay Nigger Association of America MSN Messenger Jon Secada Question mark Apollo 11 Synthesizer Musical notation Copy protection Federal Standard 1037C System/36 Ajax (programming) ASCII armor Autostereogram Telegraphy Domain Name System Hexadecimal EIA-708 Jabber The Cure KIM-1 Leet Apache HTTP Server Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Screenshot Newline Space opera in Scientology doctrine Hey Jude BlackBerry TOC protocol Phoebe Halliwell Grave accent Care Bears Quotation mark MD5 Billy Sherwood Character encodings in HTML Baudot code Rastafari movement ISO/IEC 8859 Internet phenomenon Yes Nevada-tan Keyboard instrument Japanese mobile phone culture Talking Heads Typeface ISO/IEC 2022 Cross site scripting
