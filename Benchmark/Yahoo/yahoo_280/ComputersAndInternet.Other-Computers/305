convertxtodvd does anybody know how to use this program i am trying to use it to change my videos from divx to dvd format i can do that now i use roxio to burn them onto a disc but while i am changing the format it is suppose to create a folder where i can get my dvd format video after it is done and i need to know how to make that folder and change the settings to where it is ntsc format and not pal because if it is pal it wont work on any dvd's no need to convert to dvd if you're using roxio i hope you're talkin' about easy media creator or the format will be encoded into dvd while burning if you choose to burn as dvd ntsc or pal is not a problem as you describe it's a matter of screens but i exhort you to burn your movie directly Business intelligence Artificial neural network History of computing hardware
