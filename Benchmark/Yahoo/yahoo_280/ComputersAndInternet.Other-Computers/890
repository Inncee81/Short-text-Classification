i desperatly need help downloading things ok i'm trying to update my drivers from the dell site and it also did this for itunes and i'm having major issues running the programs i have dial up so i sit and wait ever for the thing to download i save the program instead of just running it just incase something happens then when i click run it asks me if i'm sure and i say run and the then command prompt i think that's wut it's called the black typing window that just types for you kind of pops up and before i can read what it says it goes away and that's it so when i tried installing itunes it didn't work and i know that most of the driver updates didn't work i really don't know what to do i'm pretty sure my firewall isn't blocking it because i disabled it and tried again the same thing happened i believe the problem is with down loading itunes and not your drivers try opening your security and add itunes web address to allowed list and then down load and run program i have never had to up date drivers even on my older computer most all new programs come with necessary drivers hope this helps Library Children's literature Book Digital library Librarian Library of Alexandria Library of Congress Legal research Mark Twain The Origin of Species Library and information science Ottawa Public Library Library reference desk Library catalog Interlibrary loan Bodleian Library The Library of Babel Augusta, Lady Gregory Collation Public library American Library Association United States National Library of Medicine Objective-C America's Most Wanted Flowers for Algernon Dewey Decimal Classification Papias Reading Borough Libraries Book burning Vatican Library Associative array Esperanto library Publication of Darwin's theory National library Enterprise content management National Library for the Blind Liang Qichao Information Technology Infrastructure Library Scholarship Wick, Highland Hospitality service Codex Joseph Campbell Gettysburg Address Header file Marvel Comics Paul Gallico Anton Bruckner Katherine Paterson Born on the Fourth of July Miss Marple .NET assemblies JavaServer Pages Enid Blyton Biblioth__que nationale de France Nag Hammadi library Municipality of Strathfield Technical writer Literature Sicilian Expedition Cthulhu mythos arcane literature Biblical canon Young adult literature Mark Millar Robert Anton Wilson Carnegie library Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Adaptation.
