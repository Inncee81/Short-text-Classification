in microsoft access how do i get a query to show the sort descending of years i m making a microsoft access query of players by years of experience now the problem is the rookies keep getting sorted at the top of players experience chart over players who have been on the team for four years how do i have the rookies on the bottom of the experience list rather than the top example i wrote i wrote john doe for four years of experience i wrote jane doe for three years of experience and joe public as r for rookie ideally i would store the players experience start date as this will then allow you to calculate the number of years experience obviously storing a value of r for rookie doesn't tell you how many years experience a player has and you will also need to update this value as the player gains experience which in itself will cause further problems if you forget to do this over time however if you are insisting on storing the data like this you should be able to add a column in a query and use the following expression expr iif experience is null val experience you can then apply a descending sort order on this column Search engine optimization Mozilla Firefox Open access Pop-up ad Web traffic Google Dance Dance Revolution Prank flash Uniform Resource Locator Web accessibility Minesweeper (computer game) Kazaa Google search Cascading Style Sheets Opera (web browser) Steam (content delivery) Volleyball Website Mozilla Application Suite Windows XP Spyware Belief revision Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Google Desktop Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Neopets Go (board game) The Standard Social bookmarking Homestar Runner Online advertising Infantilism Amazon.com Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Dictionary Diablo II Alexa Internet Beetle in an Anthill Search engine Web crawler Internet fraud Poker jargon PageRank Plagiarism IPod MAME Blue screen of death Nuclear fusion Anamorphic widescreen Ecco the Dolphin MMORPG Konami Code DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution HTTP cookie Beatmania IIDX GameFAQs OmniWeb Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Counter-Strike Glossary of American football RuneScape cheats Single Transferable Vote Web banner LiveJournal Internet Explorer Prostate cancer DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Theory of conduct Phishing Pump It Up Dance Dance Revolution Solo Google Talk Prime number GoldenEye 007 Blackjack Myst DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX The Matrix Online Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Halo: Combat Evolved A9.com Ajax (programming) Windows Picture and Fax Viewer Lemmings (computer game) The Revenge of Shinobi Formula One Grand Prix (Geoff Crammond) Online marketing Link spam Ontological argument Semigroup Mouse (computing) AdSense Cross site scripting Spamdexing Screenshot GIF
