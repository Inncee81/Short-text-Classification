system restore question what exactly does it do and do you need it to have a fast computer running windows xp home i noticed the box next to use system restore is not checked will i harm computer if i dont use it you will not harm the computer it helps it to go a slitght bit faster but you wont notice it see system restore is great to have on because if you install something and your computer all of a sudden doesnt work properly and uninstalling the program doesnt work you can system restore and it goes back to the settings before you did the install best bet is if you will install a fishy unknown effects to installing program set a restore point first sometimes it doesnt make the best restore points i find and i go back days in the system restore i have had to use it a few times but not alot and my wife too so for us it helps you can set up how much hd space it will take and the more you give the more you can restore to i find i havent had a virus problem on there yet but i suppose it could happen if you want just leave it unchecked until you want to install something that you dont trust also depends on your computer on the resources used if your computer is slower it will be more noticable but if it's faster you shouldnt notice it i have a p ghz and i dont notice it at all everything works fine for me p Macromedia Flash Windows XP Portable Document Format Mac OS X Wget Mozilla Firefox Internet Explorer Gmail Common Unix Printing System Windows 2000 Filename extension Web browser World Wide Web Object Desktop Windows 3.x Warez IPod AmigaOS AOL Instant Messenger USB flash drive MSN Messenger Web server Unicode File system Apple Macintosh HyperText Transfer Protocol QuickTime Mozilla Application Suite ITunes Emacs Digital rights management Mac OS X v10.4 WebObjects ASCII art OpenOffice.org Unix File format Opera (web browser) NTFS Mac OS 8 Python programming language Linux Perl Kazaa Windows Vista Microsoft Windows Apple Computer Unicode and HTML Wi-Fi Stardock Computer virus HTTP cookie Netscape Navigator File Transfer Protocol Mac OS Pretty Good Privacy Secure Shell Blue screen of death Metadata Spyware History of Microsoft Windows System 7 (Macintosh) Disk image File Allocation Table Screenshot Windows registry Transport Layer Security Linux distribution Apple typography Macintosh Finder Uniform Resource Locator World of Warcraft WordPerfect Hard disk X Window System TeX Btrieve Proxy server Windows Media Player Apple II family Apache HTTP Server Comparison of file systems LiveCD NeXT Mandriva Linux Mac OS X Server Mac OS history Online music store Microsoft HyperCard User agent Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Apple Filing Protocol Internet Binary and text files Logo programming language CPAN Steam (content delivery)
