computers what is the difference between application testing and acceptance testing nah it just means this is a homework question as i've always understood it as a developer application testing is where you run it through the paces and make sure it doesn't crash and doesn't damage anything and does what it attempts to do acceptance testing is when a client outside the company or perhaps inside the company tests it to certify that it actually is what they asked for this may include application testing for robustness example client asks for program to connect to a server and download data and display it on screen in a certain way application testing is running it through its paces see how it behaves when the internet connection is lost for instance or this or that happens make sure it works under various scenarios acceptance testing may include that but also is part of the certification process to make sure that the client is getting what they thought they were getting and paying for undoubtedly they want to make sure it doesn't crash etc but at a minimum they want to make sure it does what they asked for that it's acceptable and meets their specifications Optical character recognition Enterprise content management Portable Document Format Automatic number plate recognition Ebook Document management system Gmail Computer virus Captcha Astrophysics Data System Paper Greek language GNU Free Documentation License Uniform Resource Locator Digital photography Web crawler HTML Comment Warez Emacs Optical mark recognition Spell checker Mouse (computing) File format Unicode MDAC Passport Tagged Image File Format Stopping e-mail abuse Distributed Proofreaders Machine vision Laserdisc Word processor Cocoa (API) Killian documents Windows Vista OpenOffice.org Digital video Domain Name System Wiki Ada programming language Wikipedia Search engine optimization Goatse.cx Sudoku Software testing Unix C plus plus Internet pornography Revision control Eiffel programming language E-mail spam Freenet Project Gutenberg United States Constitution PNG Natural language processing Jacob Neusner Handwriting recognition Object-oriented programming Digital circuit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Podcasting Bluebook REBOL High-definition television Translation memory Amazon.com Proxy server Computer security Comics OpenDocument Fagan inspection Blog UTF-8 Geographic information system Chu nom Melissa worm Google Website ZX Spectrum XML Encyclop__dia Britannica WYSIWYG Mac OS X 2D computer graphics Image scanner Pages Macromedia Flash Hyderabad, India False positive OpenDoc Open Directory Project Magnetic ink character recognition Everything2 Interlace Qt (toolkit) LaTeX
