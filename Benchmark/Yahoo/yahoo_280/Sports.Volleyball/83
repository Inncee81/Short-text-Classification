totally don't understand what's going on on my volleyball team help okay so i'm in th grade and my coach started to teach us this new at least i think that's what it's called i don't remember it's really complicated anyway all the other girls on my team have played select and have done this stuff before except for me and one girl i really don't understand what is going on and i am clearly the weakest player on my team i don't want to fall even farther behind on my team can somebody help me understand this there are like setters on my team and when the other side has the ball everyone changes positions or something and when it comes back we go somewhere else aaarrrggghhh i need a volley ball expert hi it takes a little time but you will get it first some background the setter is a very important position they always take the second hit so they are involved in every play and if the hitter doesn't get a good set they won't be able to hit the ball so a means that there is one setter and five hitters when the setter is in the back row this is great because there are hitters in the front row but when the setter is in the front row there are only other people in the front row that can hit this means that the defense has an easier time blocking because there are less people to worry about the solution is the where people are setters and the one that is in the back row sets this way there are always hitters in the front row all the running around is people going to their position in the front row the middle hitter should always try to hit in the middle the power hitter on the left side and the setter on the right in the back row the libero should be in the middle back the setter on the right side so they can easily move up to set and the back row power hitter on the left side unfortunalty you have to rotate in volleyball and after the ball is served everyone just moves to their positions so if you the middle hitter but you are in the left front position you will move to the middle front the first chance you get your best bet is to walk through each rotation for the position you play so you will know where to go you can ask the coach to explain it to you good luck Baseball Badminton Baseball statistics Batting average Chess strategy and tactics Rugby union positions Glossary of American football Designated hitter Baseball scorekeeping American football American football strategy Baseball Stars Aerial (dance move) Batting (cricket) Toronto Blue Jays Water polo Sandy Koufax Fast bowling 1919 World Series Snooker Satchel Paige 1957 World Series St. Louis Cardinals Backgammon Chicago White Sox Super Bowl XXXVI Rugby league Super Bowl XXV Boston Red Sox National Football League Atlanta Braves Super Bowl IX Rugby league positions Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXVII World Series Craps Gary Sheffield Pete Rose Softball Fielding (cricket) San Francisco 49ers Four square Major League Baseball All-Star Game Beach volleyball Carolina Panthers Pittsburgh Steelers Laws of cricket Hank Aaron Tennis Poker jargon Switch hitter Cleveland Browns Robin Ventura Blackjack Skateboarding trick Super Bowl XVIII Buffalo Bills Xiangqi Tag Offensive team Canadian football Betting (poker) Ravi Shastri Seattle Mariners Baltimore Orioles Troy Glaus Seishun Academy Middle School Manny Ram__rez Babe Ruth History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Cincinnati Reds GunBound Cricket Super Bowl XXI Tris Speaker Pinball Chess terminology Oakland Athletics Barry Bonds National Football League Lore Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Home run Super Bowl XXVI Reggie Jackson Blitzball Slot machine Super Bowl X Sydney Riot of 1879 Box score (baseball) Mike Schmidt Chicago Cubs
