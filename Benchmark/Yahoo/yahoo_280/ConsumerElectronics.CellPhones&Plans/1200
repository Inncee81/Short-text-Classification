how to stop others from hearing a ring and let them hear music instead some of my friends that i call have music playing instead of hearing just the simple ringing i don't mean a ringtone i mean what the caller hears i just want to know how to do this any help on this would be great thanks you didn't specify which cell phone carrier you have i have verizon and it is called ringback tones you go to www verizonwireless com and you will find the links to the ringback tones you can do a jukebox of up to tones and they wil cycle through those and you can set it for all calls or you can set a certain tone for certain people right now i have a jukebox with tones and it cycles for everyone but my mother she get's to hear fur elise by beethoven and that's it i know cingular at t has one but not sure what it's called but i'm sure you can find it on their site verizon charges for each ringback tone and that is for one year of use after one year you would have to renew but they send you text message days prior to the expiration date so you don't have to remember when the anniversary date is once you've purchased a ringback tone you will be charge one flat rate of cents a month and it doesn't matter how many tones you have it's just a month but keep in mind the initial cost is for each one at the time of purchase for year of use hope this helps and good luck Verizon Wireless Virgin Mobile Ring tone Verizon Communications Social rule Telephone numbering plan Toll-free telephone number Phreaking Cingular Wireless GSM services Session Initiation Protocol Federal Standard 1037C AT&T Modem Skype Musical Instrument Digital Interface BlackBerry 9-1-1 24 (television) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Journey (band) Morse Code Musical acoustics 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Friends The Hobbit Euro Speech recognition Directory assistance Musical mode IPod Good Times Gmail Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Voice over IP Harmonic series (music) North American Numbering Plan Jennifer Lopez Dual-tone multi-frequency Cellular network Ron and Fez Thomas Dolby Good Morning, Vietnam Life and work of Ludwig van Beethoven Vodafone Sound Advanced Mobile Phone System N-Gage Interval (music) Legal research Radiotelephone John Layfield Vertical service code Solar cell Battery electric vehicle Twelve-tone technique Nas (rapper) Nintendo Das Lied von der Erde United States Postal Service Manitoba Hydro Opie and Anthony T-Mobile General Packet Radio Service Sprint Nextel Corporation Timpani UK telephone numbering plan Tone (linguistics) Payphone Caller ID Internet fraud Frequency Blue box Mobile phone Integrated Services Digital Network Roswell UFO incident The Ashlee Simpson Show Oasis (band) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Domain Name System Blonde on Blonde Kraftwerk Synaesthesia Clarinet Automatic number announcement circuit Vegeta Treo 650 Fugue American Idol 2004 Republican National Convention MCI Radio
