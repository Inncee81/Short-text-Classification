how can i cut down on my phone use i have to pay for my own phone and minutes i have the tmobile prepaid plan where you buy a card for and gives you minutes for a year this plan unfortunately only lasted me less than months are there any plans that would be better for me and that would be cheaper suggestions learn to use your voice mail better sometimes people just call to tell you thing but if you answer the call you end up talking for an hour or something let some calls go to voivemail and reply only if needed if possible turn the phone off when taking a nap or sleeping if its already off i make fewer impulsive calls since i have to turn the phone on only charge your batter half way when our phone batteries are low we tend to only use the phone when its really needed if you are near a land line phone when you get a call tell them to call you there or you can hang up and call them back from the land line dont give your number out to so many people GSM services Virgin Mobile Modem Public transport United Airlines Flight 93 Social rule 24 (television) George Costanza Telephone exchange Telephone tapping Baseball Apollo 8 British national identity card Surveillance Mobile phone Shaggy dog story Friends Q-Telecom Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phreaking Emergency telephone number Cruising (maritime) Oyster card Verizon Wireless Skype Wal-Mart Telephone numbering plan Ocean's Twelve IBM PC compatible Battle of the Bulge Telephone call Voice over IP Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Narcolepsy Apple Newton Grand Theft Auto (game) Japanese mobile phone culture The Amazing Race Dial M for Murder Mattress Nickel-cadmium battery Wheel of Fortune Phoebe Halliwell Poker jargon Dilbert Time Out of Mind Little Britain 2005 World Series Microeconomics Private branch exchange Payphone Digital photography Babe Ruth Chess terminology Telephone booth Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
