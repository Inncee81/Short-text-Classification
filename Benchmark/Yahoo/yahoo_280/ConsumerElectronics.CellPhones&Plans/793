about n me music player i bought a new n me i tested the music player and its great however when i put about mb worth of songs into it the start up of the player became very slow also i used nokia pc suite to transfer songs in m a format and it takes a lot of time to transfer the songs also i borrowed an n from my friend and i noticed the music player was different i noticed the n music player's interface looks different and it had na equalizer n music player does not have an equalizer plus n mp loads a lot faster than n i dunno if the antivirus i installed made it slow is there a way for my n data transfer to improve faster is it possible to install the music player of n to my n or at least reduce the slow processing speed of my n music player im using n me it has a gb mmc and i have mb free mmc space the antivirus hasn't made it slow the n itself has a very slow interface and if you put a gb card in it it becomes even slower you can speed it up a bit by getting the latest firmware you can download the latest one from http www nokia com a normally i don't use the pc suite music manager to transfer songs instead when you connect the n to the pc go to my computer nokia phone browser nokia n memory card copy paste the songs you want in the 'sounds' folder here the songs will be in mp format since the songs don't get converted to m a the process is a bit faster the music player does take a lot of time for processing but there's nothing much you can do about it a gb card does slow down the mobile considerably but if you want to store songs you'll have yo use a gig only no help there you cannot use the n music player on the n it won't work since both the mobiles operate on different symbian platforms you could consider downloading a third party music application instead like ultra mp http www lonelycatgames com app ultramp or alon player http www alonsoftware com these applications load up pretty fast check here for more music applications http www dotsis com mobile phone forumdisplay php f also see http in answers yahoo com question index ylt ajehjdh y n folhrbpe ni hqx qid aagci http forums mobileburn com showthread php t BitTorrent N-Gage Linux Windows 2000 Windows XP Secure Digital card Symbian OS Opera (web browser) PlayStation Portable PHP Wireless Application Protocol RISC CPU cache IPod Computer virus Flash memory Mac OS X Domain Name System Digital photography Computer ITunes Web crawler IBM PC compatible HyperText Transfer Protocol USB flash drive Federal Standard 1037C MSN Messenger Mozilla Firefox Morse Code PlayStation 3 Library (computer science) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Python programming language System 7 (Macintosh) Commodore 64 Java programming language Short message service Forth programming language Verizon Wireless Common Unix Printing System Apple Macintosh Modem AmigaOS Ajax (programming) CPU design Skype Mozilla Application Suite ITunes Music Store Apple II family Telephone exchange DVD Macromedia Flash Hard disk Universal Serial Bus Timeline of computing 1990-forward Virgin Mobile Octopus card Windows Vista Mac OS X v10.4 Floppy disk Speed of light ITU-T Nokia 6620 Object Desktop Mac OS Warez Hash table C programming language GSM services Danger Hiptop Transmission Control Protocol BlackBerry Virtual memory Rootkit Perl Computer software NTFS Compiler optimization Central processing unit Mach kernel Radeon Steam (content delivery) MySQL Internet NX bit File system Surveillance Btrieve
