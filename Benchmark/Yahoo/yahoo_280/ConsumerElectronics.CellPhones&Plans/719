reviews of the new chocolate phone how is it does anyone know if they will come out with more colors than the they have now and also what are the differences between the new one and the old one i'm sure that there will be more colors of the new chocolate released the demand in the market for different colors is pretty large i'm wary of the new chocolate the old chocolate had a lot of problems but those problems were linked to the button layout the send and end keys were moved to the bottom half of the phone which will prevent the phone from calling random people if you accidentally touch the touch pad on the phone however the slider on one of the new chocolates in my store seems to be developing problems already it's getting stiffer and i fear that it won't open and close very easily in the future the differences are mostly in the physical design the new chocolate looks different but it has all the same features the only feature difference is that it will support a gb memory card instead of a gb memory card other than that they changed the touch sensitive buttons the send end and camera buttons are now all on the bottom half of the phone instead of the top half the speakerphone works better instead of a touch sensitive pad for menu navigation it has a wheel used for scrolling i like the wheel a lot better than the old version the corners have been rounded out which makes the phone look much smaller even though it's about the same size i think the new chocolate is a big improvement but i would wait for a few months before getting one if you wait a few months the problems with the phone will be well documented it will be easier to see whether or not the phone holds up if you read reviews for it in october or november IPod Tungsten Handheld Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Poker jargon BlackBerry Pump It Up DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Nintendo DS Surveillance Game controller Palm OS Digital photography Opera (web browser) DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Beatmania IIDX Windows XP Danger Hiptop Handheld game console Atari 8-bit family DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Gmail Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis AmigaOS Bubble Bobble Winning Streak Wheel of Fortune Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Hard disk Resident Evil (video game) Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution CPU cache Nintendo Revolution ATI Technologies In-N-Out Burger N-Gage Redundant array of independent disks Cascading Style Sheets Violin Mach kernel Dance Dance Revolution Clarinet PlayStation 2 Windows Mobile HTML element Windows Vista Octopus card Harmonica Radeon Computer Textile manufacturing Tag WordStar Pretty Good Privacy Slot machine Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Floppy disk Musical Instrument Digital Interface Virgin Mobile Oscilloscope Photography Punch card Xbox Secure Digital card Mac OS X v10.4 Verizon Wireless Game Boy Final Fantasy Cangjie method System 7 (Macintosh) GameFAQs Dance Dance Revolution 4thMIX Web design Ethernet Modem Atari ST Screenshot X Window System Nintendo 64 Minesweeper (computer game) Radar Social rule MSN Messenger Retronym Toyota Prius Fecal incontinence Game Boy Micro Inkscape
