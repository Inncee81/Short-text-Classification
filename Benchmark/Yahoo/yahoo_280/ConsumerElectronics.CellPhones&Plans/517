did you know this that all bottled water is exactly the same as jus normal water from anywhere they get it directly from the public drinking water lol that's not entirely true just because aquafina is a bunch of crooks doesn't mean they all are the truth is that the big drink companies pepsi and coke to be specific who bottle these name brand waters feel they are so big that they can put crap in a bottle and sell it for twice as much as everyone else and they also think they don't need to name their source there are water companies out there that use natural spring water or glacier water and not tap water from public water reservoirs the tip is to look on the bottle to make sure what you are drinking is natural spring water and nothing else purified water like aquafina for instance has been run through a million processes and has minerals and chemicals added to it on a side note true story someone that i know had a pet bird she was walking by the cage one afternoon and noticed that the bird's water dish was nearly bone dry she emptied the rest of her dasani into the bird's dish a few hours later the bird was dead Dasani Bottled water Water Soft drink The Coca-Cola Company Pepsi-Cola Coca-Cola New Coke Hamster Kosher foods Water purification Diet Coke Beer Champagne (beverage) PepsiCo, Inc.
