lg cherry chocolate can i have some feedback of the old lg cherry chocolate tell me what u think about it and why im planning to get one and i dont want to waste my money thanx soo much my daughter has had the first generation lg cherry chocolate since february and she loves it it is touch sensative but you can change the sensativity level her's has been quite durable dropped it piled binders and books on it in her back pack etc teenage kid the only problem was when it became possessed after months and when she would slide it up it would dial numbers on it's own as well as scroll through the various features such as the get it now it would scroll through all the options without stopping verizon would not do anything other than to give us a refurbish which i told them was garbage since it cost about and was only months old then they try to tell me to just use the insurance that i purchase on it to get another one again i told them that was garbage because that would require me spending more for the deductible when it is only months old and they should be replacing it with a new phone instead i ended up contacting lg sent it in to them and they said it was a defective keypad and told me they repaired it lg is a great company because the send a brand new phone different serial number everything was new but there is always one lemon in the bunch periodically somehow they slip through quality control quality assurance but since she's gotten the new one it works fine no problems no complaints etc just to let you know you cannot download any tunes from itunes onto the phone even when purchase the music essentials software kit from verizon it is not itunes compatible however someone has told me that you can burn your itunes music to an mp format and then reinstall it onto you computer to transfer it to your phone i don't know how to do that so i haven't tried yet and you can store your music and pictures on a mini sd disk that does not come with the phone but you can purchase it check out the pricing for it though i got one for my razr and one for my daughter's cherry chocolate super cheap at staples and that was researching and they were both mb i think i paid each for a mb another thing to keep in mind is there is a back up assistant so you can back up all your phone numbers with contact names it is listed in the get it now under business toosl it will say it is a month but if you log onto your verizon account on the internet periodically it will not cost you anything i did this to back up my info and my daughters especially when we sent her phone in to lg as it came back completely wiped out of all information and we just pulled the back up assistant information that was sent to verizon back onto the phone worked great and you can have it back your phone up once a day when the phone is turned on it's a good feature to use best of luck to you Global System for Mobile Communications Gmail GSM services Windows 2000 Virgin Mobile Visual Basic Asset Resident Evil 2 Bank Modem Embedded system ARM architecture Bluetooth Steve Wozniak IP Multimedia Subsystem Apple II family Steam (content delivery) Konami Code System/34 E-ZPass Octopus card System/36 Customer relationship management Credit card AT&T Super Mario Bros.
