can you upload a black and white photo onto your cell phone hi i was just trying to transfer a black and white picture onto my razr vc so that i could use it as a wallpaper but once the picture is on my phone it shows up all distorted is there any way to fix this like anything i could do to the image in photoshop so that it remains a black and white picture once i put it on my phone thanks in advance hi deepinapitt i don't think the fact that your picture is black white has anything to do with it i have black white on mine with no issues be sure the picture is displaying correctly on your computer and don't use the sepia setting to make the picture black white if it is originally in color the sepia setting will distort it god luck norm PNG Computer wallpaper Wallpaper group Digital photography NTSC Digital image editing Film colorization PlayStation Portable Television Photography Goatse.cx Modem Billboard (advertising) IPod Dither Anti-aliasing Technicolor Laserdisc Color Grayscale GIF Stereoscopy Bluetooth Autostereogram Adobe Photoshop Machinima Color Graphics Adapter Game programmer Color blindness Aliasing Camera phone JPEG Danger Hiptop RGB color model Yu-Gi-Oh!
