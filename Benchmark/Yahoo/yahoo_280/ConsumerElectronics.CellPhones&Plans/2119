i'm looking forward to buy a rizr z on wirefly is this a secure website going to activate it with t mobile though not sure if this website is secure for buying cell phones or if it's better to buy it at a normal tmobile dealer here's a trick tell t mobile you are interested in the phone pricing you saw on wirefly you will need to do this at a t mobile store or over the phone to a company store not the kiosk in the malls ask them if they can meet or better the deal if they come really close price wise ask them to put it in writing which they will do then get them to toss in a car charger or a case free of course they do have the ability to do this you might come out with a better deal than wirefly maybe if you decide to go the route of wirefly be careful to read the terms and conditions of service they are not t mobile and set their own terms other than all this yes they are a legit place to buy and they are secure hope this helps good luck Surveillance GSM services Internet fraud Mobile phone Poker jargon Sears Holdings Corporation Tesco Gmail Microeconomics Arbitrage Telephone tapping Bluetooth Economy of the United States Global System for Mobile Communications Monopoly (game) Battery (electricity) Flash memory Internet Voice over IP Telephone numbering plan Dodge Charger Retailer Stock Skype Contract Public transport Security (finance) Great Depression Telephone Customer relationship management Pocket PC BlackBerry Capitalism Betting (poker) Toyota Prius MTR Octopus card Digital photography Penske Racing Black-Scholes Short message service Password New York Giants Mutual fund Best Buy Auction Verizon Wireless Short selling Virgin Mobile North American Numbering Plan Estoppel Telecom New Zealand Eaton's Digital rights management Bond Enterprise content management N-Gage ITunes Music Store Filling station Externality Beltway sniper attacks Supply and demand Craps Nintendo Free trade DeviantART Electronic commerce Euro Phoebe Halliwell Cellular network New Deal Rational pricing Vodafone New York Jets Sprint Nextel Corporation Data retention Ericsson Continuation War AT&T TransUnion American Broadcasting Company Islamic banking Network Switching Subsystem UK Singles Chart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Skat Game programmer T-Mobile Coin collecting Advanced Mobile Phone System Melbourne gangland killings Confidence trick General Packet Radio Service Global Positioning System IPod Social rule Symbian OS Eircom Commodore International TELUS
