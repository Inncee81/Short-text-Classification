which is better nokia n or n or n or n personally i would recommend the sony ericsson k i which has megapixel camera xenon flash music player etc but between the nokias the n would be the best since it also has megapixel camera and has stereo speakers on the top and bottom of the phone i have also heard that the n battery is not that good compared to the mah n battery it also has top reception and call quality just make sure you're happy with the navigation key which can be a bit annoying World Wide Web Mozilla Firefox Opera (web browser) Web browser Cascading Style Sheets Browser wars Web page Website Web server Netscape Internet Explorer for Mac Netscape Navigator Uniform Resource Locator Gmail Web design The Book of Mozilla Unicode and HTML Gopher protocol Domain Name System Pop-up ad Mozilla Application Suite EWorld America Online Portable Document Format MySpace Scalable Vector Graphics JavaScript Internet Browser Helper Object Comparison of web browsers Spyglass Ajax (programming) Safari (web browser) Macromedia Flash AOL Instant Messenger Web crawler Cross site scripting CompuServe Wiki The Internet Movie Database GameFAQs Search engine Unicode Spyware GIF XForms Web portal Internet Explorer Malware Virtual hosting Web application Mozilla Blogger Proxy server Myanmar Mosaic (web browser) PNG User agent NEXTSTEP Lynx (web browser) Internationalized domain name United States v.
