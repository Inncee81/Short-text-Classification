why arent cell phone numbers listed in the phone book or directery i understand they change alot and stuff but the people i know don't even have a house phone instead they have cell phones i understand also privacy but they don't ask your permission to put your house number in the phone book so why wouldn't they put cell numbers in usually there is only one company in most areas that handles land line phone numbers and what not you actually have to pay to not have your phone listed there are o many cell phone companies out there and with all of the new area codes haveing to be created it is not cost productive for any one company to publish a book especially since the whole reason for having a cell phone is different than having a land line cellphones may be used for business or private use and the fact that there are so many disposable phones out their it just isn't practical to publish them when i was growing up and you cancelled or changed your phone number with the phonbe company your old number was held out of service for months before being reassigned with all the cell phones changing numbers and what not thats not practical anymore and the turn around is weeks therefore its not reasonable to publish a cell phone book as it will be outdated as much as each month for those who cancel their services or are disconnected for not paying the bills cell phone companies will reassign your number if you do not reactivate your service in as little as days i know this is alot of infor for your answer but there are other reasons as well Telephone numbering plan Short message service 9-1-1 North American Numbering Plan Telephone tapping Phreaking Surveillance Global System for Mobile Communications Phone fraud Data retention Mobile phone Japanese mobile phone culture Vertical service code Insurance Modem Ocean's Twelve Toll-free telephone number Video game developer Gmail Cellular network Contemporary culture of South Korea Subscription business model Phone sex UK telephone numbering plan Telephone booth Telephone America Online Telkom Secretar__a de Inteligencia Overlay plan Telephone directory Spam (electronic) Private branch exchange Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Telephone number Morse Code Payphone Skype Telephone exchange Eircom Broadband Internet access Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Verizon Wireless Whois Ashton-Tate Fuel cell Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Legal aspects of transsexualism E-mail spam Eric Bischoff Microeconomics Octopus card 9/11 conspiracy theories 555 telephone number Wheel of Fortune Game development Ryanair Direct marketing L4 microkernel family Argentine telephone numbering plan Legal research Voice over IP Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Social rule Electrophysiology Nickel-cadmium battery Privacy Mobile phone radiation and health Public domain Sex reassignment surgery British national identity card Customer relationship management Ethical consumerism 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Mach kernel Associative array Instant messaging Pharmaceutical company Software patent debate Bluetooth Battery (electricity) Ben Johnson (athlete) NorthwesTel Wal-Mart Best Buy Privatization Taxicab Live 8 Code division multiple access Judith Miller (journalist) FairTax Caller ID Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 SCO-Linux controversies Drug test 24 (television)
