cingular experts how much does it cost each text message and how much does it cost when you are trying to download a ringtone when you are downloading a ringtone from a non cingular site will it count the money by how much internet you use kb s or whatever please thanks let me first tell show you this this is off of cingular at t terms and conditions data transport is billed in full kilobyte increments and actual transport is rounded up to the next full kilobyte increment at the end of each data session for billing purposes the charge is per kilobyte it doesn't matter if you are downloading ringtones or games from cingular at t or from a non cingular at t site you will still be charged for the data that you are using each text message if you are on a pay per use plan cost per message unless it's a text message from cingular at t corporate then it's free the ringtone ranges from taxes and internet usage depending on which one you download so for example if you purchase a ringtone off of cingular com and receive a text message that you have a download ready you open it the text message didn't cost you anything but the ringtone did and so did the internet usage you used to download it and if you purchase a ringtone from a non cingular site the text message ringtone and internet will cost you does that make sense Virgin Mobile Musical Instrument Digital Interface Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Short message service MAME BlackBerry Wireless Application Protocol Opera (web browser) Uploading and downloading E-mail spam We Belong Together Dave Matthews Band Commodore 64 Bulletin board system Credit card Broadband Internet access Internet Steam (content delivery) E-mail Spam (electronic) Internet fraud Gmail GNU General Public License Oxford English Dictionary IP Multimedia Subsystem Microeconomics Tax America Online Advertising Web crawler Taxation in the United States Online music store GSM services Macromedia Flash Windows XP Mutual fund Prank flash Open-source software Micropayment PDP-8 Webmail PLATO C plus plus Pretty Good Privacy The Internet Movie Database Blackjack BitTorrent Brainfuck MSN Messenger Steganography System/34 System/36 Yamigo Modem Netscape Navigator ROM hacking ITU-T Common Unix Printing System Life insurance Global Positioning System Open access Surveillance Counter-Strike United States Postal Service File Transfer Protocol Publicly funded medicine MIME GIF MDAC Insurance Website Live 8 ITunes Music Store Nintendo Revolution Betting (poker) Binary prefix Mozilla Firefox N-Gage Pirate decryption Freenet Nintendo Corporation Spyware Ammunition Intel iAPX 432 Warez M16 (rifle) Data retention America's Army Digital AMPS National Weather Service Something Awful Forums Gross domestic product
