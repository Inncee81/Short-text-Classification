is there any way i can get my son who is born in december to start school early ok i'm not sure how your question wound up in cell phones and plans but if you really want your son to start school early try looking into private kindergartens it may also help to ask the school to test your child to see if he is ready and if they would make an acception to their policy it does happen i however must say that i disagree with sending a child to school early especially a boy while you may feel that your child is ready for school and he may be mature enough it may cause problems down the road schools set a date for children to start based on research Kindergarten Education in the United States Generation Y Homeschooling Charter school Avenue Q Education Education in the People's Republic of China GED Independent school (UK) Infantilism About a Boy Stem cell Cyprus dispute Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Australia Education in Taiwan Puberty Stomach cancer Education in Hong Kong Mach kernel Education in Germany Public education Education reform Surveillance Public policy God Emperor of Dune Adolescence No Child Left Behind Act Discovery Bay Jeb Bush Justification (theology) Kodocha Heinkel He 100 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Graduate school Child sexual abuse Alcoholism Modem Education in England Oxford English Dictionary Edward Gibbon Wakefield Whitton, London Telephone numbering plan Education in Romania Road safety Science The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Androgen insensitivity syndrome Education in India Hikikomori Infant baptism 2005 United States Grand Prix Software testing Culture of the United States Gmail Dragon Ball canon Telephone Messerschmitt Bf 109 Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse X Window System Adam-God theory Education in Japan In vitro fertilisation Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Juliana of the Netherlands Child sexuality Mobile phone Voice over IP Second language acquisition Dyslexia Manitoba Hydro Intelligent design movement History of intersex surgery United Airlines Flight 93 Pitaten Ethics Robert Watson-Watt Breastfeeding Automobile Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Transsexuality Medical analysis of circumcision Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Healing Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Education in South Korea Human cloning Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal School choice Friends Current teachings of Prem Rawat Act of Parliament Secondary education in Japan Bob Jones University Freeway Year 2000 problem Affirmative action
