motorola krzr i recently got the krzr k and so far i like it alot but there's one problem i'm having with it i made some ringtones out of mp 's and applied them to specific people but it's the same ringtone whether they call or text message me i prefer a ringtone for when they're calling and then just a little beep when i receive a text message the weird thing is for some people that works the way i want it but for others it doesn't does anyone know how to have specific ringtones for certain people while still being able to use a generic one for all text messages sorry dude i dont have a k but its its anything like the v x go into the profiles where it says 'silent' and 'general' and stuff like that then click options when 'general' is highlighted then you can edit the ringtone message tone etc if this doesnt work try going into the motorla website and download the manual or email a staff member Virgin Mobile Morse Code E-mail Mobile phone Musical Instrument Digital Interface Wireless Application Protocol Opera (web browser) Ring tone Gmail Internet fraud AmigaOS Modem IPod Dave Matthews Band Single (music) Pretty Good Privacy Mouse (computing) Post Office Protocol Fark.com Blue screen of death Crazy Frog Anonymous remailer Objective-C Nokia Unicode and e-mail Homestar Runner Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Mozilla Firefox Internet forum E-mail spam Phishing Internet pornography Something Awful Internet Message Access Protocol Stopping e-mail abuse Live 8 The Best Page in the Universe Manual transmission Spam (electronic) Cross site scripting DeviantART Computer virus Sound design International Phonetic Alphabet HTML XML Halo: Combat Evolved Danger Hiptop Search engine optimization DragonFly BSD Boards of Canada ASCII art Prank flash Webmail System/34 Cryptography Amstrad CPC Yahoo!
