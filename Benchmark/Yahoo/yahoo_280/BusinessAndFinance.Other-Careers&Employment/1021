any advice please ok yesterday i went for my second interview at a gym for a front desk position and it was a different manager but at the end he told me that he wanted to hire me and said that he just needed to go tell the other guy the one who interviewed me the first time to hire me well he said they would either be calling me last night which they never did or today sometime do you think he would lie to me and not hire me he was very nice and said he liked me alot and everything and he wants to hire me employers can't tell you that if they don't mean it and i will be so mad the reason i had a second interview is because i had to meet the other manager that i would be working with thats what the first guy told me so do you think they got busy or something calm down wait a day or so and call them nicely asking if you had misunderstood the situation and that they really weren't interested in hiring you if you are at the front desk you are going to meet a lot of demanding people some of whom won't like you because of something going on in their life you want to demonstrate your cool under fire rather than volatility with your call you will demonstrate good qualities establish that you are interested in the job and clarify that you intend to interview at other places if there is doubt about your being hired there good luck The Apprentice 2 Reservoir Dogs Social rule Paul Is Dead The Contender (television series) Sharon Tate Late Night with Conan O'Brien George Costanza Plame affair Unemployment Eric Bischoff Call centre Steven Wright The Ashlee Simpson Show Time Out of Mind Cliff Richard Andrew Dice Clay The Apprentice 3 Ocean's Twelve Keynesian economics W.
