does this seem fair okay maybe i'm weird but today at work i got called to the office and got written up four times for a didn't tell a manager i was leaving that my shift was over no other associates tell the manager they are leaving b was short on a community drawel couldn't tell who done it c had a minute break hrs before i leave as my managers words rippin' the company off i don't see how it rips the company off the other associates do it they never get written up and then to top it off i'm still a minor almost and nobody would come up and take my place either does all that seem fair when the other associates do it and i just get written up maybe its just me the manager who wrote me up never talks to the girls just the guys this is weird but i was thinking today he doesn't like me and he is sexist haha as a former manager in several positions i would be very irritated if employees just left would be suspect of anybody but especially the new guy if a drawer was short and would want all employees to take their break when scheduled or when they were given permission to you are an employee of the company and do not have the right to be there you are being paid to follow the company policies and to do the job they ask of you not to have free roam of the place regardless of what other associates do if you want to set your self apart as a good employee just do what you are asked to and follow your employers guidelines sometimes things may seem unfair but they are not always as they seem i was often the hardest on those who i thought might have the best potential to be a really good employee if it is a good manager he will eventually notice if you are doing a good job Blood on the Tracks Baseball Piccolo Junior Saga The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan 1957 World Series Theory of conduct Avenue Q Corporate governance Surveillance One Tree Hill (TV series) Air traffic controller W.
