stay at home mother in resume or cover letter or both i am going back to work after being a stay at home mom for two years should i list present stay at home mother on my resume to explain the fact that my last employment ends in and nothing is listed since then or should i mention my stay at home mom status only in the cover letter thanks i actually disagree with the other posters here is why during your job search your resume will get seperated from your cover letter resume gets forwarded cover letter does not etc when people see no employment for the past two years they will wonder why and often won't have the cover letter to explain it somewhere in your resume not at the top you should put what you have been doing for the past years i would suggest doing it at the bottom where you list professional associations and other interests i would also suggest you work with a professional resume writer to write your resume it can b e expensive for the good ones but it is worth it not only do you get more job offers but with a really sharp resume the offer will tend to be higher as well one guy i worked with is marty at http www resumepro com he's kind of a butt to work with but does a good job best of luck on your search Intelligence quotient Billiards Wayne Gretzky Economic inequality Torquay United F.C.
