i have a question dealing with business right now i am currently attending college and going for a bachelor's in either management or marketing i haven't decided yet but i do know that i want something in the business field i want a high paying job and i know that there is high demand for people in business what can i do with either management or marketing i'm just really confused about what there is out there i don't know where to start and i need help to put me on the right track should i stick to management or do marketing or in that case should i just go into another field instead of business i just want a good future with a high paying job so i can settle down and work toward that goal please someone tell me what good jobs are out there i know i sound desperate but this is my future and i need help thank you in advance honest answers will help me a lot peace ideally speaking you should be doing what you are passionate and interested in have you tried taking up an attachment to see if you are interested in management or marketing my advice to you would be to disregard the starting pay for whichever discipline you are going to take up the high pay will come if you have proven your ability in your job the more important factor is your interest and whether you have the stamina and capability to take up that particular industry after which the next most important will be the company you choose to work in the first company is always the most important because that will determine if you like the industry and whether your ability can carry you far in that industry the high pay will come if people recognise your ability Supply and demand PE ratio Graduate school Economics Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Strategic management Corporate governance Trademark Tariff Corporate finance Requirements analysis The Apprentice 2 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment Trade union Labor theory of value Free trade Coercion Baseball Institutional fund management Academia Monetary policy Outsourcing Consensus decision-making Political economy Lord Chancellor Education Prices of production Education in Japan Inflation Publicly funded medicine Privatization Apple Computer Bond Computer and video game industry Microeconomics New York Giants Anarchism and society Product Lifecycle Management Current teachings of Prem Rawat Ethics Commodore International Capital accumulation Insurance Efficiency wages Education in Portugal Predestination Intellectual property Financial analyst Anarchism and capitalism Plame affair Capitalism War Management Halting problem Vanity press Offshoring Education in the People's Republic of China Call centre Roxette Enterprise content management Bretton Woods system United Kingdom corporation tax Social rule Pharmaceutical company Electronic Arts Lawyer Newcastle United F.C.
