interview for macy's service associate tomorrow i have prior work experience in sales i worked at pet store and old navy i have a group interview any tips in what to do or say so i can get the job i hate group interviews but they seem to be the norm these days from an hr perspective i find them to be a nightmare but when you have a group interview one of the main purposes is to establish how you fit in so be pleasant professional and upbeat and ready to point out how you interacted with customers in your other jobs positive experiences they may also ask about negative experiences this is okay tell them what went wrong and then tell them what you did to resolve the situation Ethics Outsourcing Contract Social psychology Social research Department store Friends John Lennon Child sexuality George W.
