can i be paid if i left employment after only weeks i am currently working on a month probationary status on my new job and undergoing some training i found a much better job and decided to leave after about weeks though i havent signed any contract with the old job yet are they entitled to pay me by law on those weeks even though im still training with them am i required to work out a certain number of weeks notice this week is my rd week so im about to leave yet so are they going to ask for a notice period first of all it's pretty crappy to leave after only three weeks but you have to do what you have to do right the department of labor determines all the rules that determine pay however if you worked you must get paid as far as the notice goes to be professional you should give a week notice but my guess is they will say thanks anyway and let you leave immediately becasue they don't want to invest any more time or money in someone that isn't there for the long haul a notice is given so the employer has the time to get a replacement but in this case they can go back to their candidate if they are still available just a word though be open and communicate with the company you're leaving it's a small world and everyone knows everyone and if you burn bridges here the word may get around be forthright with them and they'll respect you much more and next time you take a job make sure it's the one you really want Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Minimum wage Article One of the United States Constitution Graduate school Freeters Unemployment benefit Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax National Football League Trade union Education in the People's Republic of China United States Army Life insurance Outsourcing Leasehold estate H-1B visa Unemployment Paralegal Contract Apple Computer Advance fee fraud Working time Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Civil rights Military of Switzerland Short selling Labor theory of value National Insurance Employment British Rail Class 86 United States labor law Wal-Mart Insurance Newcastle United F.C.
