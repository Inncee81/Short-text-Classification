accountants in a nutshell what do you do do you use mainly a software is their much writing compared to sums figures is the work you do repitetive any other advice would be great there are many different types of accountants from auditors finance managers or chartered like most industries accounting software is used i work at the finance management end of it which is why i'm studying cima my job is a bit repetitive i've been at the same level for years now and i can't get promoted further until i fully qualify but i've lost a bit of my ambition i'll need to get it back i review other peoples work make sure they are adhering to the rules set out by government ensure no fraud is being committed by looking for audit trails ie money they said has been paid out has been etc i used to manage staff but i asked for a change there but the main 'processor's of the work i review' the people at the coal face as my old boss used to say still come to me for advice i have audited some groups too but i'm not heartless enough for that i look at the great work they do as opposed to the fact they can't find an original invoice see i really need to get 'attitude' again i write up procedures and training manuals etc but its more sums than words Financial audit Scientology beliefs and practices Accountancy Information technology audit Corporate governance ISO 9000 United Kingdom corporation tax Mail fraud Sarbanes-Oxley Act Information Technology Infrastructure Library National Kidney Foundation Singapore Education in the People's Republic of China Institutional fund management HIPAA Government of Maryland Software testing Bretton Woods system Accounts payable Division of labour Electronic commerce Sponsorship scandal Scientology Cray Inc.
