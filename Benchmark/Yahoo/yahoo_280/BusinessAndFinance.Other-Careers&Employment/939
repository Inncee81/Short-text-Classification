i need a job i'm and i've never had a job n my parents didn't want me to get a job this summer and next summer i'll be in another country so i need a job during the school year the problem is that i take all ap classes so i can't work during the weekdays it's hard for me because i need a job for experience before i go to college but i never have time also i travel a lot so i would miss a few days here and here would any place just hire me for weekends and understand when i miss a few here and there or is that too much to ask for in addition is there any way or solution around this and please don't say don't get a job thanks in advance it's hard to find a job when you are new to working and have no experience or a whole lot of time so you need to wow them in the interview for sure and use the line i have no experience but i am a very quick learner you could also make a resume of your accomplishments in school and what ap classes you are taking i did that and interviewers like to see you organized and see that you are responsible and goal oriented as for where to apply target is where i had my first job they start you off around and there are always employees working in any type of department store so if you do have to call out then there is a greater chance of finding someone to cover you as opposed to a smaller working enviroment anywhere like that or even a grocery store if only you were you could work at blockbuster which is the best job enviroment ever and you have alot of fun working there apply there when you turn hope this helps Education in the People's Republic of China Unemployment Social rule Graduate school Labour economics Education in Germany Driver's license 2000 Australian Grand Prix Software engineering New York Jets Steve Jobs Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Pittsburgh Steelers Time Out of Mind GED The Apprentice 2 Scientology beliefs and practices Ultimate (sport) Education in Romania Economic inequality American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Education in the United States Redundant array of independent disks Transactional analysis Employment Inheritance (computer science) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kodocha Air traffic controller Motivation American football Freeters Baseball Experiential education Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Affirmative action Michael J.
