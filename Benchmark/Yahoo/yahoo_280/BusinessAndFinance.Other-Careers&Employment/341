can my employer ask me if i have a best friend at work my mn employer passed out surveys to all staff asking us questions like 'does my supervisor or someone at work seem to care about me as a person ' 'are my coworkers committed to doing quality work ' and 'do i have a best friend at work ' also we are required to put our names on the surveys i don't see what these questions have to do with my work performance and i don't feel comfortable honestly answering these questions what if managment doesn't like someone's answers and sets them up to get fired or forces them to quit i think you should go to human resources and ask whether it's appropriate generally when these surveys are given to employees they are given anonymously so that employees feel they are able to answer honestly once you are asked to put your name on the survey there is no way you are going to be able to answer to questions honestly and the surveys are a wasted effort i understand your concerns about the surveys being used as a reason for firing employees but i don't think that is their intent notice they don't ask you to point fingers and name names e g name an employee you feel is not pulling his or her weight around the office this seems to be a fairly standard survey to assess the work environment and see where improvements can be made the main issue is the one about writing your name on the survey that's a huge no no in any research science i think your employer just made a mistake there but isn't trying to trap you Theory of conduct Statistical survey ISO 9000 Unemployment Corporate governance Breastfeeding Polyamory Ethics A Course In Miracles Social rule GED The nature of God in Western theology Domestic violence Galactic Civilizations John Lott Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economics Scientology beliefs and practices Environmental Protection Agency Psychology Kyle Broflovski Strategic management Internet troll 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Call centre Census Equine conformation Organic farming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Efficiency wages Coming of Age (TNG episode) Expert system Cult National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration George W.
