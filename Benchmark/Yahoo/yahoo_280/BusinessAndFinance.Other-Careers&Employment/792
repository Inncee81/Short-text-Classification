what to do if there is problem's in the work place ok well theres a woman at work that has been giving me problems like if i ask her something its always a short and rude answer and doesn't speak to me any other time well i told the manager and she was like well if things dont get better then we can talk about it well it had already been going on for a few weeks and then i finally said something she was always nice to me till i got promoted to assistant manager so im guessing thats the reason cause i cant think of anything else that she could not like me for i'm going tomorrow to look for another job cause i can't take it anymore i think the thing you are missing is you are letting this happen if you are the am that means you are the boss of this other lady she will keep up the attitude unless you do something to stop it some people have a hard time when someone they know is promoted above them maybe they thought they should have gotten the job but you can't let them take this out on you not in this job or in any future job what i would do is bring her aside very private and say what's the problem i think you are acting rude to me listen to what she has to say if she brings up a problem she's mad at you or having problems away from work deal with itt but either way end it like this you don't do this to a customer and you don't do this to another employee and you certainly don't do this to a supervisor you need to act like this job is important to you because right now you act like you want to get fired do you want to get fired because if this keeps up one of us will have to go who will be let go you or the am i don't want any special treatment i don't care if you don't like me but on the job i will treat you with respect i expect you to treat the customers with respect and also all of your fellow employees including me if you can't do that you need to find another job give it a couple more days and if you haven't gotten any inprovement make a formal written complaint to the manager good luck Theory of conduct Social rule Singlish Software engineering Extreme Programming The Apprentice 2 Past teachings of Prem Rawat Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The nature of God in Western theology Health insurance Cliff Richard I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Shaggy dog story Gender-neutral language Avenue Q Outsourcing Charles Goodyear Haven (TNG episode) Customs and etiquette of Japan Unemployment Pip (South Park episode) John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism W.
