when quitting job is it fair to ask to be paid for remaining vacation time i'm leaving my job shortly i gave about a month's notice to the company but i was wondering if it is fair common to get paid for the remaining vacation time i hadn't really thought of it but a co worker of me told me i should i get about days vacation per yr and i have only used a couple of those days the company has a use it or lose it pollicy as far as vacation goes at the end of the yr if you don't use it you don't get paid for it but would it be different in this case theoretically i guess i could have said my last day was a week later then it actually was and then just said that would be my vacation week but i wasn't sure if that would be right but now this is my last week so i think it might be too late to say anything ok thats for the feedback actually i gave my notice about a month ago and this is my last week so i just feel kinda weird about springing this on at the last minute especially since they probably did all the paperwork setting what my last day would be and everything hopefully i have a handbook still somewhere maybe i can see what it says not only is it fair it's the law Wheel of Fortune Jack Charlton Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Wal-Mart Dead Like Me Public domain Leo Frank Cliff Richard Leasehold estate Working time Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Atlas Comics (1950s) Rosa Parks Knots Landing Michael Garibaldi Paul Is Dead She Loves You Abigail Folger Satchel Paige Highway 61 Revisited Blonde on Blonde Sandy Koufax EastEnders Charmed Social rule Unemployment New Morning Blood on the Tracks Ocean's Twelve Plame affair timeline Kurt Cobain Alex Ferguson Leeds United F.C.
