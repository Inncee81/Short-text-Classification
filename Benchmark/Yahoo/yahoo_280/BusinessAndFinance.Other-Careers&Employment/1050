previous employer not providing me with a reference for uni hi all i am starting uni in september hope but the offer is conditional on references my first reference is ok but my second one from my previous employer is not responding to the university i don't know why as i was a hard worker and when i left i was even told by the managers themselves i'd be missed as i was a good worker so why aren't they replying to the university i'm really worried as the offer bows down to two references and i've only been in three jobs one i've used already as a reference and the second everyone i worked with has left i have written a letter to my manager asking him if he could fill out the ref form for uni but no responce what can i do call your previous employer who has not respond or go visit them in person let them know that you would really appreciate it if they could provide you with a reference and that they have your permission find out when would be the best time for your new employer to call them then contact your new employer with the best time to reach your reference you really need to help facilitate this in order to make easier on everybody Unemployment Social rule United States Postal Service Sweatshop Univision Offshoring Baseball Employment Freeters Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an StarCraft Episode VI Education in the People's Republic of China Call centre Unemployment benefit Plame affair Killian documents Mach kernel Labour economics Michael D.
