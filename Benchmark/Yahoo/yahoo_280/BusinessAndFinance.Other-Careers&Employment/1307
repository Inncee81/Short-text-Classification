how many babysitting flyers should i print i'm starting to babysit for money and i'm about to print my flyers how many should i print i'm years old and i'm going to ask my parents to give them to there friends at work who have little kids also i'm going to give them to my neighbors that have little kids edited given your plan you are distributing by hand to a very limited number of people you know this is a very good strategy for two reasons it is safer because your parents always know who you are sitting for and where you are from an advertising standpoint you get a much better response rate from people you know need your services than randomly carpeting a parking lot with flyers unfortunately your answer depends solely on how many friends your parents have and how many neighbors you have with small kids i would suggest the following formula parents friends neighbors with kids x your parents will probably only distribute once and with your personal parent sales force that should be all that is needed the neighbors with kids should see a stuffer in their mailbox once a month for about four months this way you are more likely to 'hit' them the same week they need a sitter you can't expect them to keep your flyer around for more than a day so they need occasional reminders persistence helps also if you have not done so already i recommend the red cross safe sitter program if you have the certification put it on your flyer adam Aerial (dance move) Breastfeeding Day care Community emergency response team Pharmaceutical company Tag EastEnders The Fairly OddParents Advertising United States Postal Service Television in the United States Ocean's Twelve Extreme Programming Disney's California Adventure Social rule About a Boy Annuity Mac OS X Education in the People's Republic of China South Park Lionel Corporation Formula One Student loan Fox Broadcasting Company Poker jargon Religious Society of Friends Motion picture rating system The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Theodore Kaczynski Daylight saving time Diwali C plus plus Gmail Radio controlled airplane Spice Girls GED Humphrey Bogart Ra (board game) Billboard Hot 100 Tattoo Textbook Education in Germany Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Redundant array of independent disks Wright brothers Animal Crossing Interstate Highway Wheel of Fortune Wal-Mart Trip sitter TLC Inflation Baroque chess Cable television Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Education in the United States Sento Nuclear fusion David Beckham Privatization File sharing BBC Kasparov versus The World Oxford English Dictionary Keynesian economics OC Transpo Theory of conduct Monopoly (game) Crime prevention through environmental design One Tree Hill (TV series) Carl Barks Bus models used in New York City Transit Normal distribution Trademark Ben Johnson (athlete) Columbine High School massacre Justification (theology) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Unemployment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Alcoholics Anonymous Doomsday argument Avenue Q Capitalism Fischer Random Chess Our Gang Limp Bizkit Politics of Canada Garth Brooks Big Brother UK series 6 Political campaign Public domain George Burns Childbirth Two Treatises of Government Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial UK Singles Chart Scientology beliefs and practices
