i think i am screwing up at work and need advise i have been at this wonderful upscale business for about months now today i missed the second big deal staff meeting with the owners and all because i made a bad call and had some sunday afternoon cocktails with a couple friends i figured i shouldn't show up smelling like alcohol so i called my boss and said i had a very important client i could not put off for the meeting i feel horrible and under the microscope i slept thru some training a couple weeks ago too i don't know if my job is going to be on the line many people want this position and how do i fix this i too was faced with a very similar situation here's what you do no alcohol during work hours get up early and be on time every single day work a little harder and do extra things around the office this will show your boss you're serious about your job that's all i did and i got a promotion and fell off my boss' radar lol i hope this helps Social rule Humphrey Bogart 2000 Australian Grand Prix Friends Sin City Eric Bischoff Poker jargon The Cure EastEnders The Emancipation of Mimi Ron and Fez Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Avenue Q W.
