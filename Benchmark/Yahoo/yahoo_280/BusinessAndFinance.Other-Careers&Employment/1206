i need to get a full time job i have been a stay at home mom for years and now am ready to have a full time job i miss having money to buy my kids things i am divorced and in my second marriage and are living check to check i enjoy staying home taking care of my kids but while they are at school i feel like i could be making some money but then once i get a job they get sick or other things come up where i have to miss work and i end up quitting before getting fired how will i know when i'm ready to start working again i realize it is a general question so those of you with smart ass answers can just keep them to yourselves i am i a real delima here hopefully you have a number of female friends mothers working friends start asking about possible job opportunities or if they know of any places hiring you are ready to start working but what i would suggest is a flexible job career that allows you to work around your children school etc even if you started out working one or two days a week or or hours a day this would allow you to be available for emergencies dr appts and all the other things that require your time you might also consider starting a small business out of your home be sure it is something you truly enjoy though this to would allow you the freedom needed since you can basically set your own hours hopefully this will help you or at least get you thinking about being able to balance home kids and a job don't rush into a full time job or career they can be very demanding and you will be forced to choose between your children and work instead ease into it gradually until you know the children can take care of themselves or at least not require you to miss work to sit home and take care of them good luck single parent who faced the same problem Friends Unemployment Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents Alcoholics Anonymous EastEnders The Amazing Race Saved by the Bell Economics The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Critic Breastfeeding Freeters Social rule New York Giants Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Care Bears Poker jargon Betting (poker) Laura Schlessinger Labour economics $ale of the Century Pitaten The Amber Spyglass Knots Landing Mach kernel Kodocha T'Pol Keynesian economics Good Times Public Eye Extreme Programming Eric Bischoff Ben Johnson (athlete) Divorce Kevin and Kell Shit Money supply Health insurance World Championship Wrestling Escape from New York Charmed San Francisco 49ers The Human Stain Mother Teresa President (game) Fancy Crane New York Jets Labor theory of value Adoption Sharon Stone Jon Secada Alexander Technique The Ashlee Simpson Show Anarchism and society 2000 Australian Grand Prix Athrun Zala Culture of the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Scientology beliefs and practices Blonde on Blonde Kurt Cobain Married... with Children Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Economic inequality Polyamory Rich Mullins The O.C.
