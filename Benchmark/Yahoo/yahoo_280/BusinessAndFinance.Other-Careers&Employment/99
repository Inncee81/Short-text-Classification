will i eventually take over or is this just another bull job i accepted a job at a local dealership as an accountant the pay is to start i have to work monday thru friday every other saturday when i interviewed with the current controller her boss they explained that i would eventually take over the current controller's position however i have been there two weeks i have ascertained that the current controller is a total control freak she has wanted me to do deposits book deals etc basically the stuff the clerk does she refuses to show me anything she does on a daily basis now i realize i have been there only two weeks but i have worked for a dealership before doing the same thing she also set up the accounting system it must be followed exactly as she has it she lets me know daily mistakes i have made i really do not think this lady will leave if she does is she going to give me autonomy or micro manage me i think the job gives her purpose also did i mention she is the gf of the owner advice so you have been there two weeks and you already want the reins of the accounting department you should just sit back and learn as much as you can instead of worrying about what you are going to do when you take over Ocean's Twelve MTV2 New York Giants One Tree Hill (TV series) Wheel of Fortune Gregorian calendar Sydney Riot of 1879 The Drew Carey Show The Apprentice 2 Sin City Education in the People's Republic of China Knots Landing Workplace democracy Big Brother (Australian TV series) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March National Football League Badly Drawn Kitties Gospel Canadian House of Commons United Kingdom corporation tax Air America Radio Operation Market Garden The Daily Show Computer EastEnders Canadian Senate The Colbert Report Saturday Night Live Michael Garibaldi Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Internet fraud Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) The Daily Telegraph Mad Money Evan Mecham A Course In Miracles George Costanza Back to the Future trilogy Jewish services Rosa Parks Sabbath Gold standard The Ashlee Simpson Show Back to the Future timeline Charmed Stone Cold Steve Austin Labor theory of value 2005 trial of Michael Jackson WWE RAW Bernie Ecclestone Nintendo Series finale Paul Wight Oakland Athletics Spice Girls Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Information Technology Infrastructure Library Edward R.
