i would love your input about my current job situation i have been working at a retail shop for a while now and have wanted to quit for some time the reason why i have stayed is for the money the people are very unfriendly and have at times treated me as well as other employees like we are years old i have received my schedule for next week and am only scheduled for under hours of work this is suprising and shocking to me since i have been scheduled over the past couple weeks for hours in addition i feel i am a great employee i have come in as early as am to help with new items being brought into the store i have never complained about early or late work hours or last minute changes i am really thinking about quitting it has lately seemed that they do not appreciate me or my work ethic the positives of quitting would be that it would give me a real kick in the pants to find something and spread my wings and find something i could really build as a career the negative aspect no immediate money coming in gurl first thing to remember when considering changing jobs is never quit a job unless you have another one to go to immediatly like quit on friday and start the new one on sunday or monday but of course you may already know that the thing is in your field of retail business retail personal have a high turn over basicly because it takes no degree to work they usually hire teens from high school because they can get them to work in the evenings and the company does not have to pay for insurance when your not considered full time you did not say did you recently get a new manager or assistant manager because when these come in they have a tendency to clean house so to speak' and that's getting rid of those they do not like or want in order to hire some of those they do the new hires may have come from a store they all worked at this could be one of the reasons for the cut hours did the store just hire a few new people this could be a reason too as they will need some of your hours to train the new ones it' is possible they are gearing up for the holidays yep i said the holidays if you have been in this business very long you know what i mean the retail business is a very demanding job to have as yes customers do treat you like you the scum of the earth and think your as stupid as dirt and you know the old saying that the customer is always right lol but we all know you have brains for one thing your putting up with idiots all day long now if you do decide to leave then you do leave with one thing expierence in retail therefore you can go to just about any other retail shop and work if that's what you want go to your manager and ask to talk privately with him her get to the point right off say john or whatever their name is i need to talk to you about my hours they will say something like ok what's on your mind then tell them i noticed that my next week schedule only has me down for hours and i was wondering since i have been working like why the cut be honest and up front with them ask why how when and what do i need to do to get back my hours back up if they give you an answer that you feel is stupid or just plain dishonest then you need to move on but be coy about how you move on tell them i really need the hours and i m sorry but i just have to find another job that can give me the hours because i need the money to pay for yadda yadda yadda you'll think of something this gets you a good reference when putting them down on a new application somewhere else haveing retail expierence can get you in doors you might not think you may want to become a manager highly paid but get treated like crap from the district managers and home office you may want to rethink that one lol my husband worked in retail as assisstant and manager for family dollar and dollar general and loved the money but the home office and district manager can make you life a living h i have heard everything from them cutting his hours for his employees right at their holidays when he needed more hours to get things done weekly truck loads of boxes came going from to then jumped to boxes and was expected to get all this out in weeks time plus moving the store around plus redoing shelves it was a very hard job to do unless you were in a bran new store where when you went to work the store wasn't already filthy and had peices of boxes still waiting to get oput on the shelves plus another coming in days i hope i have enlightened you on a few things but hang in there and do what you feel is best for you good luck Wal-Mart Social rule
