accounting or paralegal studies which one should i major in i'm trying to decide whether i want to major in accounting or paralegal studies i'm interested in both fields the accounting program at my school is a bachelor degree program where as the paralegal program is just an associates of applied science degree at this point the accounting program would only take me more semesters the last one being part time where the paralegal program would take me more semesters it seems there is a greater demand for accountants as far as i can tell plus more room for advancement and i'm sure both careers have a good amount of stress with them i appreciate any advice you can give me thanks so much figure out which one you are a little more interested in right now and perhaps find a summer job or internship in an office connected with that field that would give you a better idea of what the job would be like if you find it's not what you expected then the next summer find a job or internship in the other field then you will have better knowledge of both and can decide for sure what to major in you can always switch majors if necessary it might take you a little longer to complete school but at least you will make a more informed decision another option is to volunteer this summer at each type of office talk to the office manager and tell him her why you want to volunteer most people will understand wanting to know more about career choices before committing good luck Paralegal Education in Germany Medical school Graduate school Lawyer Education in the United States Juris Doctor Physician Cooperative education Education in the People's Republic of China American University Intern Professor Chinese University of Hong Kong Far Eastern University Software engineering Walt Disney World College Program University of Maryland Baltimore County Education in Portugal Education in Romania Master's degree Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dentistry Librarian Georgetown University Northeastern University, Boston Baseball Labour economics Supply and demand Jewish studies Outsourcing Architect Law school Education in Japan Anarchism and society Economics GED Decision making Ethics Plame affair Expert system Science Psychology Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Massachusetts Institute of Technology Chiropractic Academia Hampshire College Associate's degree Community college Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Florida Institute of Technology One Tree Hill (TV series) Education in Canada Seneca College Kwantlen University College City and Guilds of London Institute Computer United States Air Force Academy Cornell University University of Hawaii at Manoa Unemployment Management information system School for International Training University of Scranton Bologna process Lyceum of the Philippines Student loan Microeconomics Education Consensus decision-making No Child Left Behind Act Annuity Experiential education Education in Austria Simon Fraser University Scientology beliefs and practices Stonehill College Mathematics LiveJournal Free will Master of Business Administration Corporate governance Prostate cancer Pitzer College Social rule Pharmacist Emerson College MapleStory Open access Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Athabasca University Jayson Blair Education in Australia University of Southern California Management Babson College Efficiency wages
