working from home please help i have been blessed with the opportunity of being a stay at home mother which i love i enjoy the fact that i am able to see my children grow up and spend as much time with them as possible and not have someone else experience all the good and bad things with them but i do know that my husband does need help he doesn't want me to work and wants me to stay with our children but i do see the need to help him for our children and for us my question is does anyone out there have any suggestions of what i might be able to do from home i know there are plenty of things that people offer to work from home but i want something that's legitimate and not a scam i hope there is someone that might provide a suggestion maybe someone that has gone through the same experience and situation i greatly appreciate anyone taking the time to help me with this god bless first of all be very cautious about clicking on the links provided in some of the answers they are referral links which means they get paid for what you do they are not really interested in answering your question or helping you out they are interested only in making money off you most people who work at home and are successful are doing one of two things getting paid a commission on everyone they convince to join the program also known as mlm or pyramid plans or they have their own business your own business is something you create yourself not find on the internet you create it based on your skills your passions not on what someone else tells you is the greatest thing going another answer although not exactly to the question you asked would be looking at money management techniques to make it easier to live on what your husband does make you can get all sorts of information on how to make and keep a budget online that way you and your husband can sit down together and decide how you want to spend the money it's all about taking back control of the money rather than letting it control you Pyramid scheme Avenue Q Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Past teachings of Prem Rawat Internet fraud Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Incarnations of Immortality Social rule God Emperor of Dune Multi-level marketing Sant Thakar Singh MMORPG One Tree Hill (TV series) Spam (electronic) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Primerica Financial Services Children of Dune Pitaten Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kender Good Times Justification (theology) Apology (Plato) Charles Ponzi Great Teacher Onizuka Scientology beliefs and practices The Apprentice 2 Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Meaning of life Advance fee fraud Microeconomics Muslim ibn Aqeel Ocean's Twelve Jacob 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Plame affair Hospitality service Current teachings of Prem Rawat Beetle in an Anthill Fiddler on the Roof Simone Weil Gross domestic product Phoebe Halliwell Probation officer Live 8 U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Bank fraud Escape from New York Mother Teresa Melanie Wilkes Confidence trick Therion (band) Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The Amber Spyglass Ashton-Tate Expert system Blackjack School choice Ethics Coming of Age (TNG episode) Dot-com Samurai Deeper Kyo Breath of Fire III Arthur Machen The Subtle Knife Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Marshall Plan Katelyn Faber Le Malade imaginaire The Sims Capitalism Sola fide Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Damn Yankees Phishing Sant Mat Summa Theologiae The Star Wars Holiday Special Grandview, U.S.A.
