nervous about my interview i have the experiance but my criminal background messes it up any advice it was back yrs ago and i fill like is honging me any advice or sucess storys just as a head note certain jobs will not accept a worker with a criminal background i e civil service working with children police public sector so that unfortunately might affect you greatly maybe i am not the best person to answer back seeing as i do not have a criminal back ground but if you have the experience then that should be one thing that sustains you it sounds obvious that your criminal history is in the back of your mind but if you know that you are resentful or regretful and freely reformed of what you did in the past and they were to ask the only thing you can do is be honest and demonstrate that what you did in the past has no reflection on the duties you are able to perform in the job you are applying for so to speak the interviewers obviously see enough in you to invite you for an interview in the first place you could have been rejected at the application review point much earlier so thats one positive thing to take with you into the interview room what you did in the past is in your past and obviosuly you cant change that every bad instance carries a consequence true but what you can do is continue down your line of positivity not every employer is going to necessarily like what they see on your record and you like any other normal person will face rejection just pick yourself up and keep on learning from each experience and the further you go and the more you learn the less it will worry you Plame affair Ethics Hearing impairment Victor Cousin A Course In Miracles Social rule Government of France Workplace democracy Graduate school Goodness and value theory Appeal Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of language Theory of conduct Cultural relativism Education in the People's Republic of China Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Economic inequality Psychology Time Out of Mind Gay rights Yusuf al-Qaradawi Alcoholics Anonymous Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Franz Boas Hillary Rodham Clinton Coercion Dissociative identity disorder Efficiency wages Copyright law of the United Kingdom Infantilism Shaggy dog story Strategic management Ontological argument British national identity card Slow Train Coming Jiddu Krishnamurti French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Scots law Bayesian inference Inheritance (computer science) American and British English differences Australian constitutional law Highway 61 Revisited Behaviorism Contract Friends Charles Dickens Arthur Cayley Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead Politics of the People's Republic of China Stuttering Singapore gay equality movement Notary public Transactional analysis God Emperor of Dune Attorney General Entropy Scientific method Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sexual orientation Autism Crime Labor theory of value Nuclear option (filibuster) Divine grace Biblical inerrancy Transsexuality Theodicy True Crime: Streets of LA Charles Grandison Finney Divorce Unemployment Law of the People's Republic of China Music Software engineering 1957 World Series Loudspeaker Simon Commission Singlish Common law Meme Extreme Programming Education in Hong Kong Copyright Aikido Shit Parliament of the United Kingdom Immanuel Kant Supernatural Media bias Antisocial personality disorder Immigration to the United States Peer review Lie
