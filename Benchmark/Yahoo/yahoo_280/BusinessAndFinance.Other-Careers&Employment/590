how should i go about changing job titles without having worked the current one i was offered a job at target at an hour for a sales floor position well after looking at other job titles that i found for another target location on monster com i'd like to have a clerical position i'd like to have the position of the operator that you speak to when you call target because it entails more office work which i need more experience in than working as a sales associate i haven't even had orientation yet so i'm assuming i should probably tell someone before hand so i'll be going to an orientation that is fit for someone doing clerical work should i call and speak to the manager to change positions if possible or should i just stick this position out since i'm planning on quitting anyway there isn't a reason not to ask contact the store manager or their recruiting department and explain to them that you have seen their other job listing and that you would like to be considered for the clerical position instead of the sales associate employers are generally pretty receptive as hiring staff is expensive and staff who like their jobs are much more productive if they say no then you can always simply move on and find a job you would like Wal-Mart Management Electronic Arts Professor Efficiency wages Call centre Employment Outsourcing Secretary Civil Air Patrol Sexual orientation Division of labour Software engineering Secretar__a de Inteligencia Plame affair Education in the People's Republic of China Unemployment Employment agency Michael D.
