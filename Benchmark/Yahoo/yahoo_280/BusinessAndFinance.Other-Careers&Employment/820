what should i major in to work at sea world i want to be a dolphin trainer and i talked to one of the trainers there and told her about myself and she said that it would be almost guarenteed that i would get it because of my personality experience and love for animals i just have to pass the grueling swimming test i'm going to college and i don't know which subject to major in i was thinking animal psychology or zoology or marine biology i can't do all three and most of the trainers there are majoring in psychology of some kind i'm sort of stuck if anyone has a good answer about the courses to take i'd appreciate it very much thank you well you could always do a combined degree program where you major in one subject and minor in another so for example a bsc hons combined honours in animal biology and psychology where the major is the animal biology and the minor is psychology but it seems that the best person to ask is to talk to the trainer and ask her what she feels would be the best thing you study to strengthen your experience and personality another thing is of course to keep close contact with sea world while you do the chosen degree i can't forsee any problems here if a trainer is saying that you already have those three qualities well there you go just make sure that whatever you study at degree level is something you really want to do othwerwise you won't do well in it Consciousness Psychology Epistemology Education in the United States The Mind of an Ape Biology Human Transactional analysis Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Australia Social psychology Behaviorism Rudolf Hermann Lotze Theodicy Memorial University of Newfoundland Aristotle Graduate school Alfred Kinsey Ecco the Dolphin Theory of conduct Chinese University of Hong Kong Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Portugal Happiness Ethics Philosophy of perception Dualism (philosophy of mind) Orca Infantilism Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Social sciences British degree abbreviations Carl Jung Western philosophy Reincarnation Medicine Theory of multiple intelligences Master's degree Clever Hans Human sexual behavior Altruism Academic degree Marine biology Attention Education in Romania Animal cognition Neuro-linguistic programming Abduction Phenomenon History of evolutionary thought Person Hartwick College Free will Ecology A Course In Miracles Whale Virginia Military Institute Physician Coercion Milton H.
