desperately need more hours at work but they're shorting me i hope this is the right place to ask this question so i really need more hours at work and i'm scared to ask for them you see i work a part time job in retail and i leave for college in a week and won't be working there anymore for the time being i asked my boss for more hours a couple weeks ago and he said he would give them to me but i haven't gotten any more hours than usual my work has not been the very best lately so i'm worried he doesn't want to give me extra hours because of that but i really need extra money for school and it's my last chance to work since it's my last week about half the employees are teenagers who're off the schedule this week because of school so i figured they could spare more hours at least but i'm afraid to ask because i'm scared he thinks my work has been bad how should i go about asking him for more hours when i already did and that got no results please help all help is appreciated have you done anything earlier in the season to warrant him not giving you the hours like calling off last minute or not showing up leaving early even if you think that you fooled him with a good excuse this might have an impact whether he said it or not i would remind him of what he told you and explain to him that you really need the time Shaggy dog story Haven (TNG episode) Poker jargon EastEnders Wheel of Fortune Avenue Q Social rule Unemployment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blonde on Blonde Rent (musical) New York Giants 1957 World Series The Apprentice 2 One Tree Hill (TV series) Ocean's Twelve Extreme Programming The Amazing Race Kodocha Pok__mon Live! 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sydney Riot of 1879 I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Fahrenheit 9/11 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Dead Like Me Humphrey Bogart Saved by the Bell Family Feud Bowl Championship Series Big Brother (USA TV series) Cleveland Browns Singlish GED Hollywood Squares Blackjack Time Out of Mind Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Trapped in the Closet Sin City Hebrew calendar Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jumping the shark The Inside Neighbours Dilbert Incarnations of Immortality Theory of conduct New York Jets K' Internet fraud Pittsburgh Steelers Saturday Night Live The Joker's Wild Apollo 8 Alex Ferguson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Only Fools and Horses Past teachings of Prem Rawat Survivor (novel) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Surveillance Honey and Clover Labour economics The Smoking Room John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Babe Ruth Norway national football team Winning Streak Wal-Mart Ken Jennings Big Brother UK series 6 Labor theory of value Jennifer Lopez Boom Town (Doctor Who) 24 (television) The Family from One End Street Fight Club Jeopardy!
