i'm a cashier at a restraunt is less than weeks notice acceptable i'm years old and this is my second job as a cashier in a restaurant making an hour i have worked at this place for about a month and i am ready to quit i asked for hours max when i applied and this week they scheduled me almost and when i confronted them they said there's nothing they can do about it because they fired one cashier and another quit so they have no one else i am starting college in less than weeks and i have alot to get done before then and with my hr schedule i just can't i would feel bad for just quitting or not showing up due to the fact that they would have only morning cashier left after i leave i do not need this company as a reference so i do not know if weeks is necessary i am scheduled to work tomorrow and sunday with the new schedule coming out on monday so would it be okay to write a letter stating i cannot work after monday or what should i do also if i just quit on the spot i would still have to go back to collect my last paycheck can that cause a problem weeks notice is just a guidline quiting this job or any job is your prerogative but this is an opportunity to show good judgment moral character and that you are a team player aside from job qualifications these are what employers look for in a potential employee as well as current and previous employee for rehiring i suggest that you talk to your manager face to face and be sincere write your letter but make a list of the things you have to get done to get ready for college and a schedule try to work something out but don't be afraid to lay out your terms if weeks notice is too much for you then compromise if compromise doesn't work then quit if they fire you then that's really not a good atmosphere while your in college anyway you have tried your best to help them but you've got to do what's best for you what you want to keep is a good reputation and a clean concience a former employer gave a letter of recommendation for me that landed me a scholarship i've quit and rehired by this employer several times all the while i've been professional and up front with my priorities if my schedule conflicted with them we parted ways with their blessings and every time with a letter of recommendation for another job if there was a job opening they would check up with me if i was available and i would work for them occasionally sometime i'll tell them i need more money and i'd get a little raise it's a long lasting relationship that got me through college National Football League Avenue Q Unemployment Wal-Mart Monday Night Football Education in the People's Republic of China Plame affair Sydney Riot of 1879 Friends Eddie Guerrero Social rule Ocean's Twelve EastEnders Extreme Programming New York Giants Ty Cobb Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Walt Disney World College Program Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Major League Baseball television contracts DisneySpeak STS-59 Education in Germany Explosive material World Championship Wrestling Badly Drawn Kitties Goodness and value theory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Amazing Race Poker jargon Graduate school Risk management Advance fee fraud Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drug test Leon White The Apprentice 2 I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Fight Club Saturday Night Live Scientology beliefs and practices American and British English differences Blonde on Blonde Aldi Operation Market Garden Eric Bischoff Shawn Michaels Article One of the United States Constitution Babe Ruth Health insurance Seinfeld Ten Commandments Memorial Stadium, Clemson PGA Tour Larry King Boston Public Honey and Clover Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Contender (television series) Blackjack MTV2 Labor theory of value Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Spice Girls John Layfield Leeds United F.C.
