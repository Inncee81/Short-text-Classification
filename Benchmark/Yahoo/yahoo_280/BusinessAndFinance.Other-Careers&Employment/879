i have had great interviews and was told i am one of the top being considered for the job after the rd interview i waited a few days and called the vp to see where they are in the hiring process i was told by his assistant he was on the phone and would contact me tomorrow i am on pins and needles i know i am one of the two being considered however being put off for another day after a month long process has taken the wind out of my sail any ideas on what could be going on pretend you didn't get the job and move on with your life i personally hate indecisive managers if they are extra vague then the company may have chosen the other candidate but they are haggling over salary they are stringing you along because you're their employee in a glass if they call back with a job offer then its a pleasant surprise but you are living your life on hold it's one thing for them to be unfair to you but its another thing to be unfair to yourself your building dreams and spending a salary that isn't yours yet also by moving on you're giving yourself permission to apply for other jobs its better that another company learn about you offer a job and this original company offers you a job too than lose this job and have no backups good luck Social rule Professor Plame affair Employment Knots Landing Outsourcing Ocean's Twelve Friends The Apprentice 2 Steve Jobs Avenue Q John Peel About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Karl Rove The Amber Spyglass The Apprentice 3 One Tree Hill (TV series) Eddie Guerrero Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Freeters Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kodocha The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Goodness and value theory Characters in the Smurfs Graduate school Workplace democracy Stan Lee George Costanza Shaggy dog story Amiga Power Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Job interview Textile manufacturing Warren Buffett EastEnders 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Software engineering Great Teacher Onizuka Management Wal-Mart William Adams Montreal Screwjob Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Jack Charlton Salary Kurt Angle Inheritance (computer science) Education in Germany Ruy Lopez Call centre Rosa Parks Survivor (novel) New York Giants Education in Portugal Milton H.
