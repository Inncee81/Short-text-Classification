is nursing a better career than chef cook what do you think im confused i love to cook it's my passion working with my hands eating smelling cutting but i also like to help people feel better and cure them which one is better i'll be in grade in september i have to decide fast please help i dont know where to go after high school or where to go can you please list some advantages and disadvantages that you think these jobs have either chef cook nurse or law clerk correction where to go or what to do as a disadvantage both careers involve long hours working nights weekends holidays when everyone else is off and are physically demanding although i'm a cook and my aunt is a nurse i think both jobs have their advantage in that you are directly affecting peoples' lives whether you feed them or help heal them you'll make better money as a nurse but you need less formal training and education to be a cook with both jobs you may face shifts of up to hours and who knows when you'll get a break just to sit down with both jobs you'll have a very high level of responsibility if you mess up there is a potential to seriously hurt someone with both jobs you can have the personal satisfaction from meeting the challenges of the day oh and there is a difference between being a cook and a chef it all depends on how much paperwork you're willing to do how many hours you want to work despite being salaried instead of paid by the hour how many years are you willing to apprentice yourself for low pay and how well you handle being a supervisor give it lots of thought talk to your family friends school advisors they'll help you choose the right direction as for the schools to attend that depends on where you live and what tuition you can afford nursing programs are found at and year schools as are culinary programs good luck Graduate school Pitaten Social rule Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus EastEnders Education in Germany Nurse Affirmative action Tuition Education in Australia Baseball Education in Romania Nursing Division of labour Student loan Supply and demand The Apprentice 2 Education in Portugal Microeconomics Principal-agent problem Appeal RuneScape skills Extreme Programming Breastfeeding T'Pol Education in Hong Kong Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Restaurant Inflation Characters in the Smurfs Juris Doctor W.I.T.C.H.
