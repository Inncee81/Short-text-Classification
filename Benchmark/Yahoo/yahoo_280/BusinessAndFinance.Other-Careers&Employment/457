is a temp job basically being available on call i recently met with a staffing agency which said that i was accepted but they don't know anything yet unless their client finds a suitable candidate for the job does that mean that if i continue to work for this agency the clients will only hire me for short term periods weeks and following that period i will be left to do nothing until the agency finds a suitable client for me yes it is an on call position however there are too many temps for them to keep track of so if they don't call you with something in one week remind them that you are still available some temps can go on for many weeks months without working Modelling agency Karl Rove Employment agency Temperature Call girl Barrister Business continuity planning Traumatic incident reduction Plame affair Security (finance) Paralegal Unemployment McKinsey & Company Graduate school EMule In Search of Lost Time Domain Name System Employment Education in Germany Sabbath Military history of the Roman Empire Billboard Hot 100 Incident Command System Extended Euclidean algorithm Real estate broker John Layfield Computer virus John Forrest, 1st Baron Forrest of Bunbury X Window System Advertising agency Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Air traffic controller Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sweet Smell of Success: The Musical Enterprise content management Canadian House of Commons Computus Job interview The One (film) Unemployment benefit Ocean's Twelve Administration Corporate governance Software engineering Grammatical tense Samuel Beckett Neighbours Common Unix Printing System Public Eye Vanilla Ninja Go (board game) Evan Mecham Principal-agent problem War Stories (Firefly) President of Germany Outsourcing Jules Verne U2 (band) Operation Market Garden Drill instructor Avenue Q Information Services Procurement Library The Smoking Room Politics of Russia Abstraction (computer science) Drug test Balikpapan Freelancer Ernie Irvan Bogdanov Affair Institutional fund management Ultima Online U.S. Democratic Party presidential nomination, 2004 A.
