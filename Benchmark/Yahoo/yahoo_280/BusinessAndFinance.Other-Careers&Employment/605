another interview story today i went to an interview as part of formalities i shook hands with the interviewer who also happens to be the admin director and showed him my academic certs well he placed it aside and he told me nicely that he doesn't believe in papers qualification and it is the last thing he will see when deciding a candidate very normal isn't it yeah i think so too now the problem lies in the nature of business of this company you see this company is actually a commercial school dealing with education and courses if the director of the school does not believe having a good paper qualification can get you anywhere then why are they in the education business indeed it's a question i may pop during the nd interview but i guess that will more or less blew the whole session haha it is difficult to answer because your details of the school are sketchy before anyone can be hired they need to prove their qualifications and unless they are explained verbally in the interview the papers need to be reviewed again not knowing more about the job or school the incident maybe some kind of test kind of a stupid idea but this world is made of all sorts if your questioning the incident then the results must have been positive because you are looking for an answer to go back to them a second time Theory of conduct Extreme Programming GED The nature of God in Western theology The Apprentice 2 High school Roswell UFO incident Academia The Ashlee Simpson Show National Certificate of Educational Achievement Graduate school Aesthetic Realism Social rule Education in Portugal Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Deconstruction G__del's incompleteness theorem Coming of Age (TNG episode) Scientology beliefs and practices Avenue Q Plame affair Philosophical skepticism SAT Education in Germany Shaggy dog story Karl Popper Scientific method Database normalization Russian joke Second language acquisition Donald Rumsfeld Milton H.
