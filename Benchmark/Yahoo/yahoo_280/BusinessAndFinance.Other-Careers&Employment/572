moving to washington d c without a job lined up i'm going to be startng college in d c in january but want to move there soon i know it's very expensive but i want to move there soon so i can begin the job search in person and not from halfway across the country i have decent savings and what not so i'd be able to live fine for a while before i start school and get a job any thoughts on moving there without a job or would it be advisable to have a job lined up beforehand thanks i'm not sure what you mean by decent savings so let me give you some information single bedroom apartments in the area go for anything between month depending upon where they are you can generally find a roommate using craigslist roommate com or some other similar service rooms for rent in people's basements or whatever can generally go from and up so you can usually get by for a bit that way if you don't mind sharing with your landlord groceries are probably fairly typically priced but i bought a gallon of milk yesterday for and i pay about for gas in the burbs and around in the more expensive areas in the city if decent savings means k i'd say find a job first if it means k i'd say you're safe finding work here most likely after you move the job market in the area is pretty good especially if you work in the tech industry and have or can get a security clearance metro doesn't travel far outside dc but it can get you to some of the suburban areas of maryland and virginia so you can get a reasonable distance out of the city for some slightly cheaper rents still in the ranges i indicated above if you're willing to travel longer to get to work school metro closes at midnight weekdays and weekends so that might be a factor for you and i believe it opens at or am good luck Public housing Public transport Washington Metro Supply and demand Gross domestic product Warren Buffett Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Arbitrage Rapid transit Insurance Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Leasehold estate Broadband Internet access Dairy Wal-Mart Capitalism Graduate school Airline Taxicab Renting Friends Unemployment Avenue Q Publicly funded medicine Tax ZIP Code Monopoly (game) Gentrification Mortgage Supermarket Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Taxation in the United States Prostitution in Germany Narrow gauge Light rail Hydrogen economy Health insurance Price discrimination Stuyvesant Town Milk Plame affair Apartment Offshoring NorthBridge Apartment Complex Capital accumulation Hash table Mutual fund Chatham Square Tesco Real estate economics Inflation MTR Outsourcing Filling station Annuity Indian Railways White flight Theory of conduct Drug test Oplan Bojinka Scientology beliefs and practices Password Open cluster Bond Singlish Apartment building Alcohol fuel Wonderful Town Floppy disk Amtrak Free trade Wan Chai Implications of peak oil Carburetor FairTax Bulk vending Sam Walton Autonomous building The Commons Celtic Tiger Team Fortress Classic Karl Rove Portland, Oregon Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Daylight saving time Ford Motor Company Labour economics Mister Fantastic Labor theory of value Beltway sniper attacks Traffic light Air traffic control
