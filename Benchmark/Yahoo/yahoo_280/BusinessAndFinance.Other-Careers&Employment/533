i've been going to school for the last two years and now am looking for partime work for the summer which got me thinking as well i have major gaps and a very spotty track record when it comes to employment what can i do about these gaps plus some of the position don't follow one career path for example i have worked in youth programs for instance with the school district and worked on tug boats as a deckhand when applying for work how do i explain these gaps in employment and what do i do with the experience that doesn't go hand and hand with the job i'm applying for for the last year i haven't worked when i did work i was a commodities broker for months then left later i got a email from my employer stating i was fired before that i worked for the school district for the better part of a year before that i worked as a deckhand for a tug boat company month before that a sign company for month befor that i work for service comm out let for month crazy stuff my life i know now that those how become sucessfull in life stick to thing i don't think that's necessarily true having a broad spectrum of employment shows that you are well rounded and that you have much to offer to answer your question on your spotty track record what i would do is this omit those jobs from your resume or application that you were fired from or didn't leave on a good note with to make up for the gaps come up with an excuse perhaps that you were in school full time second if you are looking for a descent paying part time job i would suggest food service especially waiting tables restaurants tend to be less fussy about the details of your resume good luck Outsourcing Plame affair Graduate school Division of labour Economic inequality Poker jargon George W.
