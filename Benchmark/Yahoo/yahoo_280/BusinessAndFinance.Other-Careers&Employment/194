can you ask for the empoyer to show his resume on the first interview after landing a personal interview with your propesctive employer is it ok to ask him ot show his resume this is because a lot of people in construction tend to do a little bit of extra marketing even though they might not have performed those projects and there are so many new companies coming up that is my reason do you mean you want them to show you a portfolio of the work they have done if that is what you mean then i would think this would be appropriate however it would not be appropriate to ask to see someone's personal resume you should also do some research online about the company before you interview and you will likely find the work they have done in the past then you have something to ask about at the interview Institutional fund management Social rule Statistical survey Super Mario 128 Intelligence quotient Strategic management New Coke Finance IBM Steve Jobs Economic inequality The Apprentice 2 Michael Milken Product Lifecycle Management Privatization Politics of the People's Republic of China Computer Sexual orientation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mergers and acquisitions Annuity Mutual fund Modern portfolio theory Marketing research Management information system Seymour Cray Central processing unit Corporate governance CPU design Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Diversity America Online Google Surveillance Sociology Transmeta Soundbite Manitoba Hydro Portfolio Freeters Supply and demand Podcasting Airline Warren Buffett Health insurance RISC Qualitative marketing research Corporate finance Relationship marketing Electronic commerce Montgomery Blair High School Margaret Mead The Mary Tyler Moore Show Interview Incentive Online marketing Animal Liberation Front Economics Diseconomies of scale Experiential education Graduate school Hewlett-Packard Ken Jennings Job interview Randi Rhodes John Peel BAE Systems Bulgarian language Management Modelling agency Open access Supercomputer Land use forecasting Brand management Tesco Cray Inc.
