is it ok to interview with a company again even if i interviewed with them before i just wanted some thought about interviewing with the same company again i had an interview with a big accounting firm a year ago but it did not go so well it is a year later and interviews are coming up again i am a college student about to graduate and the big accounting firms usually do a lot of hiring in the fall i am applying for other jobs also but i really want to work for the big i plan on getting my cpa which hopefully would open the doors and increase my qualifications more why not i have reapplied at the same companies before and had repeated interviews you might just land the job this time never ever give up this will also show your very interested you just didn't state what happened the first time though if it was that bad don't remind them you might be interviewed by a new recruiter anyways so go for it and good luck Accountancy Coalition Provisional Authority American Institute of Certified Public Accountants W.
