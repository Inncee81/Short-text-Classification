careers in woodworking and cabinets my husband has been working in custom cabinets for the past years he knows all phases from fabrication to install but has focused the last as the finish department manager at it's pretty clear that the pay is topped out already and for the most part we've yet to find a company that offers medical benefits of any sort he's also concerned about being exposed to all the paint fumes hours a week he enjoys what he does but is considering a change to hopefully earn what he's worth and get benefits to those of you who have experience in the woodworking field what can you tell me about careers in cabinets does the pay get better what about becoming a general contractor up's and down's of opening his own shop to do finishing and refinishing work he's exploring possibilities right now and he really wants to make a smart move where there is room to grow decent money and lots of work we would like our own business but 's an issue thanks i work for an hvac contractor the amount of work we have in any given month depends on what the housing market is doing the same would be true if your husband were a general or cabinetry contractor his best bet is to stick with cabinetry since he enjoys it but maybe open his own shop so homeowners can buy new cabinetry when they remodel their home and also provide contract services to general contractors who are building in the area as far as the money thing goes many banks will make loans to start a business but you can also get government grants for the same thing i've never tried getting a government grant so i can't tell you about the process but i have heard it can take a long time to get approval Insurance ITV Student loan Bank Table saw Annuity Wal-Mart Mortgage United States Postal Service Extreme Programming Enron Corporation FairTax Woodworking Monetary policy Investment bank Primerica Financial Services Credit card Bank of China (Hong Kong) Wheel of Fortune American individualist anarchism Mutual fund Outsourcing Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Octopus card Poker jargon Unemployment Classified information Schabir Shaik Trial Microeconomics Gambling Product Lifecycle Management Graduate school Unemployment benefit Information Services Procurement Library Sears Holdings Corporation National Health Service Corporation Islamic banking Upholstery Electronic commerce Cabinet making United Kingdom corporation tax Education in the United States PE ratio Privatization Health insurance Construction Tesco Capital accumulation Temasek Holdings Derivative (finance) Price discrimination Blackjack Health care in the United States Financial services Money Government National Mortgage Association Personal finance Cooperative Capitalism Public good Inflation Economic inequality Kitchen Arturo Frondizi Bond Money supply Risk management Ethical consumerism Airbus Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Anarchism and capitalism Economy of the United States The Apprentice 2 Minimum wage Toronto-Dominion Bank Customer relationship management Sam Walton CPU design Microcredit Oil-for-Food Programme UK Singles Chart Animal Crossing Short selling Craps Mergers and acquisitions Debt Security (finance) Starbucks Contract Warren Buffett Finance Mainframe computer Plastic Information Technology Infrastructure Library
