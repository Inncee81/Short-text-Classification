graveyard shifts so i work graveyard shifts a couple of nights a week can anyone tell me any ideas to keep me entertained throughout the night oh yeah since i am being asked for more details on what i do i work at a hotel but there is never anyone coming in during the hours that i work and ipods are out of the we aren't allowed to have things like that i dunno y tho i work in the emergency room on the midnight shift once in a blue moon others were bringing in ipods and psps to keep them occupied but they banned them after a while i'm assuming because it just looks unprofessional to have headphones on anyway we discovered it's not a big deal if we use the ipods but just hook it up to the computer so it plays the music like a typical radio there's a program called podplayerpackage that we use to be able to listen to and exchange music files it's always fun going through other people's list to find new music if you place the ipod behind the computer or anywhere else out of sight then i don't see the problem with it so long as it's not at a disturbing volume level other things we do include reading books surfing the web doing puzzles studying and playing those previously installed computer games solitaire freecell etc maybe i'm weird but sometimes when there's seriously nothing to do i look at the forms that we use and if they're horribly copied or the print is starting to look blurry or otherwise not up to standard i find myself re typing them my boss found this out and she gave me employee recognition bonuses if all else fails we turn to gossip IPod PlayStation Portable ITunes Music Store FreeCell Apple typography The Emancipation of Mimi Headphones Apple Computer Perl Podcasting Game Boy Digital rights management Computer Digital audio player World Wide Web Gramophone record Computer and video games IPod shuffle Copy protection Walkman MTV2 Interactive fiction Redundant array of independent disks Wheel of Fortune Computer virus Little Britain Diablo II: Lord of Destruction WNNX (FM) Ocean's Twelve The Apprentice 2 Apple Macintosh Karaoke Steve Jobs I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Shaggy dog story Card game PLATO $ale of the Century IPod nano Whose Line Is It Anyway?
