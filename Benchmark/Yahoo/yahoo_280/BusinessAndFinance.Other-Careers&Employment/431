why do recruitment agencies say they've temp work for you but you never get any from them wow i'm amazed at two things here there must be some really awful recruiters out here for people's opinions of temp agencies to be so low not a lot of people really understand what a staffing company really does i own a staffing recruiting and consulting firm so let me try and clear up some of the misconceptions on this subject from the perspective of the agency agencies get paid by how many candidates they have in their database at times i wish this were true but this is completely false we get paid based on how many hours a hired candidate works for a temp position and a negotiated fee for permanent hires the reasons why you are not getting assignments could be anything but more often than not the reason you did not land the assignment is because it closed that fast in temporary staffing especially most proficient agencies can react to a candidate need within hours and by react i mean submit a candidate have them interview and be ready to start the project with jobs being filled that quickly the reason recruiters want to meet with you even if they may not have a position immediately available for you right this minute is because when they do they need to be able to move swiftly on your behalf and if they've met you already this is something they will not have to do later i could talk about this subject all day feel free to send me a follow up message if you'd like to discuss this further Plame affair Employment agency Karl Rove Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Incident Command System The Apprentice 2 Call centre Internet fraud Education in the People's Republic of China Advance fee fraud British Civil Service Drill instructor Probation officer Graduate school Anarchism in Spain Extreme Programming Secretar__a de Inteligencia Theory of conduct Economic inequality Election Principal-agent problem Social rule Wal-Mart Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Time Out of Mind America's Army Continuation War Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) A Course In Miracles Microeconomics Martin Heidegger The Amazing Race Air traffic controller Determinism Coalition Provisional Authority W.
