had a good second interview whats next has anyone ever had a second interview usually what happens afterward i talked with all the managers and even employees who have the position i am applying for it seems redundant to be asked for a third interview and from what i was told this was the last round from your experience usually how long does it take to hear if i got the job or not i recently had a great second interview with a local company and they told me to give them a couple weeks to respond with an answer the hr manager should have told you to expect to hear back from them within a certain number of days or a couple of weeks sometimes the company can make a decision within a matter of a couple of days or couple of weeks call and ask them to when they will make a decision good luck Social rule Plame affair Eddie Guerrero Big Brother UK series 6 ITV The Ashlee Simpson Show Teen Girl Squad Michael D.
