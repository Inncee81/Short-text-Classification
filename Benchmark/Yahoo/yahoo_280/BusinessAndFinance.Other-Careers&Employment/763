what sort of job can i get well i'm working as a part time builder not a bad job but i wouldn't mind a job where basically i get paid loads for doing nothing because i'm fairly laid back and don't like to give orders the job that i've got doesn't give me enough hours and doesn't pay very well i've basically spent the past ten years going from job to job but nothing really sparks my interest i like to play alot of video games i love going on the computer i am actually good with people but feel as though i should be an employee rather than an employer as i don't like to give orders but idk but i feel as though that i need a career otherwise i'll get to with no job and that would be just weird so yer can anyone help you only live once so find a career that you enjoy if you like computers maybe you can find something in that field my best advice would be to get a career book occupations handbook at the library and search through it it lists just about every career and everything about it including pros cons hours wage how easy it is to find a job in that field and education level needed for entry thats how i ended up picking my career software developer Unemployment Game programmer Video game developer Economic inequality Labour economics Computer virus Game tester Education in the People's Republic of China Software engineering Graduate school Mach kernel Employment Extreme Programming Social rule Computer Sydney Riot of 1879 1957 World Series Computer role-playing game System/36 Librarian On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Linked list Common Unix Printing System HyperCard Education in Portugal Offshoring Sweatshop Outsourcing Ocean's Twelve System/34 History of operating systems Trade union Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Domain Name System Electrical engineering NeXT BASIC programming language Visual Basic CPU design ZX Spectrum Time Out of Mind Game programming President (game) Library (computer science) Unemployment benefit IPod Friends Gross domestic product Expert system RISC ITunes RuneScape quests Apple Computer Anarchism and society Buffalo Bills Sheepshead Anderson Cooper Blog Enterprise content management Labor theory of value The Life and Times of Juniper Lee IBM PC compatible Knots Landing Hash table National Football League Social Security (United States) The Sims 2: University Debugging Salary Avenue Q Spam (electronic) Kender Pitaten OpenOffice.org Employment in Hong Kong Working time MMORPG Microsoft The Catcher in the Rye Charmed CPU cache Inflation Search engine optimization Sant Thakar Singh Altair 8800 OpenGL New York Jets Gary Gygax Electronic Arts Guild Perl Lou Gehrig America Online Baseball Kasparov versus The World Alignment (role-playing games) Atari 8-bit family Wal-Mart
