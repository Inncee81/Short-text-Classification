i never expunged my childhood legal record will a government job find it years ago years old i got in legal trouble all my jobs since have done background checks and i still got the job this time i didn't admit to any offenses i thought it was sealed and it is too late to expunge my record by the time i start this job i am going through the steps but will they find the record and should i make a copy of the expunction forms to bring in should i e mail them to tell them or wait till they say the background check found something if you really want the job you need to be completely honest usually an employer won't do more than check your background any more than the last five years or so nevertheless it is better to be straight up now than to have it come up suddenly some time down the road then you are fired without prior notice and you'll find yourself not only looking for another job but with a bad mark on your employment record and getting caught lying looks really bad a government employer on most occasions will check your background thouroughly and if they look they're going to find it you aren't alone by any means don't stress too much about it though most employers understand that people make mistakes in their lives and if you've kept your record clean for years they can easily see that you've made an effort to do well and have left all that stuff behind if you've already lied on the application just hope for the best but yes you need to have the expungement records with you just in case and keep those documents handy many things get lost misplaced or just fall through the cracks when it comes to government records but you don't want this coming up and taking a bite out of your butt later good luck nad Poker jargon Social rule New York Giants Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix One Tree Hill (TV series) Computer virus Volleyball The Apprentice 2 Unemployment The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shit Shaggy dog story Sydney Riot of 1879 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Transactional analysis Cincinnati Bengals The Shining (film) Charles Goodyear The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Termination of employment Phoebe Halliwell Jon Secada Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair Theory of conduct Equine conformation Hey Jude Piccolo Junior Saga New England Patriots 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines The Amber Spyglass Toronto Raptors Infantilism Legal research Domain Name System Aerial (dance move) Year of the Spider Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Debugging Beavis and Butt-head Super Bowl XXVII EastEnders Kasparov versus The World I Want to Hold Your Hand Gospel of Thomas Paul Is Dead San Francisco 49ers Kim Possible Pitaten Draw poker Captain Thunderbolt Rich Mullins Prime Minister of Canada Software engineering Operation Market Garden St. Louis Cardinals Nicomachean Ethics Cheating in Counter-Strike United Kingdom corporation tax Journey (band) Reservoir Dogs Nation of Islam Alcoholics Anonymous Pok__mon Live!
