do you think a geographic information systems certificate could get me a decent entry level job in the field i have always been interested in the field but mistakenly thought one could only be a teacher if i majored in geography so i ended up majoring in business like everyone else and can't get a job since i was unable to find an internship and i don't know anyone of any importance at a company to get me a job it might i also majored in geography and then did my masters with a concentration in gis i did an internship with a state department and learned some other areas such as grant writing with that job i never worked in the field again i think it's just getting yourself in the door so you might be able to do that with the certificate i don't know where your certificate is from but i'm sure you could probably get your foot in the door somewhere you have to meet the right person to let you in Geography Intern City and Guilds of London Institute Graduate school Professor University of Maryland Baltimore County Electrical engineering Certification Physician Apprenticeship School counselor Education in Germany Medical school Software engineering Paralegal Community college Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the Republic of Ireland UCAS Geographical indication Literacy Unemployment benefit Geographic information system Scientology beliefs and practices Enterprise content management Scholarship Education in Portugal Juris Doctor Academia General practitioner H-1B visa Pretty Good Privacy Management information system Teacher PLATO Chinese University of Hong Kong Motion picture rating system Jewish studies Unemployment Computer Master's degree Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ISO 9000 Software testing Education in Australia No Child Left Behind Act Tai Chi Chuan Education in the United States Experiential education Security (finance) English as an additional language Outsourcing Far Eastern University Education in India The Hobbit Master of Urban Planning University of Phoenix Education in Romania Education in Scotland Education in Hong Kong Augsburg College Geographic coordinate system Single certification Librarian Walt Disney World College Program Education in Malaysia Junior Certificate Accountancy Ball State University Hogwarts subjects Receptionist Web of trust United Parcel Service Physical therapy Asperger syndrome Bumiputra Social rule Friends Martial art Lyceum of the Philippines Srinivasa Ramanujan Trademark Same-sex marriage in the United States System administrator Georgetown University Education in Singapore Cooperative education Sweatshop Legal aspects of transsexualism Harvard College Lawyer College Trinity University (Washington, DC) Architect Economics College admissions Drexel University Geography of the United States Franz Boas Flag of Denmark
