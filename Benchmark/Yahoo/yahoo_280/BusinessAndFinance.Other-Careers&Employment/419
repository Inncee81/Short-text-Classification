is a cdl good in any state we currently live in the midwest but plan to move to the southwest late in to be nearer our aging parents my hubby wants to drive a truck instead of continuing with his current long standing career he'd like to get into trucking through a national company that will pay for his schooling in exchange for his employment but isn't sure if they would let his employment period be transferrable from the midwest to the southwest same company different base does anyone know is this possible of any companies that may do so if cdls are transferrable other than having to renew like any other due to moving in otherwords if he goes to school in one state gets his cdl and moves or months later is the schooling license transferrable and are there any companies that would allow him to work in one state for half his employment period and continue with the same company in a different state any info would be appreciated as an added note we realize he'd be gone for long stretches but we've been together over happy years the kids are grown and gone and we are secure in our marriage we each have hobbies that we pursue when the other is not around i spend a lot of time working on the house something i love to do he doesn't enjoy it as much as i do but loves the end product we both agree i'd probably get a lot done if he wasn't around for me to dote on it'll probably be tougher on him than on me i spoil him so rotten but he enjoys driving long distances and is getting too old to deal with the demands of his current job the decision is made now it's just a matter of when to get started he doesn't want to still be dealing with his current job another winter but will if he absolutely must i think we'd both be happier if the switch was sooner a cdl and your medical examination certificate is good in all of north america canada and mexico as well the federal department of transportation sets standards for cdls and i believe all states have adopted those standards here in pa you only need to go to the dmv and take your old cdl with you and fill out a few forms quick and painless just be sure you cancel your license in the midwest after you get your new one in the south it is a federal violation to have more than one license there are usually time requirements as well so i would make an appointment with the dmv the same week you plan to move Pitaten Department of Motor Vehicles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics SCO-Linux controversies Life insurance Wal-Mart EastEnders Economics FairTax Interstate Highway Alcohol fuel 2004 Republican National Convention Education in Hong Kong Pretty Good Privacy Gold standard Apple Computer ExxonMobil Telephone numbering plan Plame affair Gross domestic product Supply and demand Public domain Software engineering Paralegal United States Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Child support Microsoft H-1B visa New Deal Nurse OpenDocument Vehicle registration plate Motion picture rating system Speed limit Delta Air Lines Midwestern United States Theory of conduct New York Giants Graduate school School bus Fathers' rights Hillary Rodham Clinton Friends Advance fee fraud North American Numbering Plan Good Times United Kingdom corporation tax National Football League Grand Forks, North Dakota Same-sex marriage Nuclear power One Tree Hill (TV series) Fox Broadcasting Company United States Postal Service Call centre Economy of the United States Pilot certification in the United States Topps Federal Communications Commission Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 US and Canadian license plates Single Transferable Vote Economic inequality Equal Protection Clause Charmed She Loves You Bretton Woods system Immigration to the United States Lawyer Electronic Arts Multinational force in Iraq Government of Maryland United Parcel Service Ocean's Twelve Capitalism E85 Kowloon Motor Bus Dave Reichert Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Culture of the United States Mach kernel Freeters Game programmer Drug test Karl Rove
