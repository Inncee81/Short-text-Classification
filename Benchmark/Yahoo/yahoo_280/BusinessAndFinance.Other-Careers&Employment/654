should i stick it out tell me if i'm overreacting so here's the situation and examples i work in a room that's about x small both my bosses and myself are shoved into this room he sits about feet behind me so he can see my computer screen he gives me tasks but doesn't speak to me he emails them to me some of his tasks are dumb like he'll stand up get a post it put it in my inbox then without saying a word to me email me a task that it typed up saying write 'for you ' on one and 'for a friend' on the other he couldn't write that himself or just give me the post its and tell me about it it's sooooo degrading he blames me for all his mistakes like he told a client something that was wrong and blamed it on me in front of everyone in the company he forgets to tell me important details then reprimands me for it he listens to every word i say over the phone and will correct me while i'm on the phone while he has no idea what the person on the other line is saying there will be more in add details continued ex he told me to write a welcome letter to a list of companies and introduce our company which is what i did a week later i get a note saying i need to use common sense this one company that was on the list is in fact not joining and just wants to work for us on a saturday how the hell am i supposed to know that when they re on the list if i ever yawn or take a deep breath he calls me lazy he sitstwo feet behind me and watches my every move i once put down that i got to work at and he said the computer said so i was a liar and didn't want to pay me for the minutes i do other stuff when i come in like check the messages read his stupid notes heck my inbox i don't immediately turn on the computer he promised me health benefits then was only going to contribute about so i'd have still have to pay about a month tells me to never put anyone on hold to answer another call then yells at me when i don't pick up the other line note it pays really well and i'm scared to take a step back i don't care what this job pays it cannot possibly be worth the way this man treats you i just left a job where the ceo blamed me for things that were not my fault many times like in your case it was his fault because he hadn't given me enough information he was often rude to me saying negative things and just like your boss does he'd walk right by me without saying a word and then go send me a crappy email i was always thinking if you have something to say say it to my face anyway start looking for another job don't leave this one without another job to go to but get the heck out of there as soon as possible you'll be happier i promise i started a new job a month ago and it's the best thing i ever did Shaggy dog story Little Britain E-mail Dilbert Theory of conduct Sin City Ocean's Twelve National Kidney Foundation Singapore Gmail Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Sydney Riot of 1879 Humphrey Bogart Friends Milton H.
