yelled and cursed at my boss i work for a hospice type of program we recently got a new patient which i worked with a couple weeks ago he was rude and screamed at me and has an attack dog which already attacked one of our girls and almost got me he has no condition where his behavior should be this way i reported his behavior and told my supervisor that i refused to work with this man i have never refused to work w anyone company policy is that we are not to be spoken to in an abusive manner or our safety put in jeopardy i feel the way he spoke to me and put me down was abuse and his dog is not safe for strangers to be around he even said so i was to work with this man again sat i reminded my supervisor all wk to get someone else to do it friday i talked to her to be sure it was covered and she avoided me until the end of the day by the time i spoke to her i was very frustrated i raised my voice not screaming insanely and used a few curse words damn mostly and i think i said i was sick of of this shit anyways she threatened my job if i did not go so i called our head office and told them they said i was valid in not wanting to work with the man i went to work sat nothing was different the head office said for me to call them monday and we could work something out since i got nowhere with my supervisor should i call the supervisor and apologize and see if we can work something out or should i let it go and talk to the head office or should i suck it up and just work witht he man against my will i hate to step on toes and i wasnt trying to jumpt the chain of command the supervisor is great ive been w the company for a few yrs and never had a problem with her until now and i dont want to make her angry bc im going to school for my rn and she has always worked great w me to keep my hours and work around my classes what should i do you have worked with this company for a few years and have never complained like this before it sounds as if you have a legitimate concern for your safety i would advise to contact your supervisor and apologize only for your language and letting your emotions momentarily get the best of you tell her you have always had a great deal of respect for her and you should not have used the language however your concern is legitimate and still stands begin writing detailed documentation of the incidents with this patient do not include your opinion or how you felt simply state what transpired include any dates times etc wherever you can send this documentation to your supervisor and to hr if you are told to go again it's a predictament you can refuse based on the documentation and the fact that you have brought it to the attention of superiors if they terminate or demote you based on your refusal you need to contact an employment attorney i feel for you there's no good choice in this situation hopefully your company will find alternative arrangements you certainly can and should seek legal action if things go the other way however it will be emotional and trying good luck Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scientology beliefs and practices Domestic violence Plame affair Dog training Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Jam (TV series) The Marshall Mathers LP Autism Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Sin City Social rule 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Milton H.
