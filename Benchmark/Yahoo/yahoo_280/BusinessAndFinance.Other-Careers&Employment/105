i have an interview for a job i want but i have to work that day what do i do a company that i have really been wanting to work for is holding a group interview followed by one on one sessions coming up this week and i really want to be there the problem is i'm working that day right at the time that they'll be interviewing i called the new place and explained that i have to work and they said that they could have their manager contact me for a one on one if i can't make it but that it will be after a couple of weeks i'm afraid of appearing uninterested or being passed up for a great opportunity if i don't go to the interviews that are being held this week i don't want to miss any chances should i just go to work that day and contact them afterward to set up an interview or should i call in sick and go i always feel guilty calling in sick but i don't think it's good to ask for the day off with such short notice either i need some perspectives thanks everyone this is a tough one a lot depends on your current employer and only you know them you could go to your supervisor and say you have an appointment for that day and you need to take some personal time off if they ask what kind of appointment just explain it is to take care of some personal business if you do this very rarely it should not be a big problem in many companies also do not expect to get paid for the time off like vacation or sick leave Social rule Health insurance Unemployment Wal-Mart Poker jargon Air traffic controller Time Out of Mind Ra (board game) Shaggy dog story Year of the Spider Alex Ferguson W.
