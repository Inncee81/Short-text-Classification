last question re intervieing while pregnant i got the interview it's tomorrow at so i'm little bit beside myself in excitement i'm also months pregnant weeks to be exact i've done a little research and i believe that since i volunteer the fact that i'm pregnant an month belly really can't be hidden i'm walking in with my head held high knowing that i'm going to be perfect for that job i've decided that i'm going to basically say the following maybe not so rehearsed i'm excited to be working for organization and i look forward to a long tenure here i wanted to tell you upfront that i'm due to have a baby via c section on sept it is my plan to work here until sept so that i can document duties and work out the details of my return i do not plan on taking more than weeks of leave but i am also very flexible i realize that what you want to know is it i will be a committeed employee and i assure you that i will be any advice you can give me how does that sound okay i'm also planning to mention that i am not a person who likes to be idle and plan on taking work home with me during the time i am not physically able to travel to and from work i know the odds are stacked against me but i hope that my previous experience with them and the sample projects they had me create and turn in will be enough to wow them i should clarify things though i thank you all i've been an intern for this small nonprofit before the person interviewing is also my mentor and knows my history i gave birth to my son during my second to last semester took off weeks due to a hospital stay and still finished hours with a i also graduated cum laude with distinction as for the c section it's scheduled for around weeks so the chances of working up until then are quite posible the most important thing to remember when you are being intreviewed is that the person who is asking questions is an expert regardless whether he is or he is not you must assume he is and that any slight negative attitude that you may display will generate a motive for the interviewer to reject your application considering your pregnancy stuation and how it could affect your job performance now and after the baby is born i think the choice of the words you want to use is adequate however when you say those words make sure you are saying them with total self confidence and reliability the less you say the better as long as you can impress your interviewer that you are reliable and trustworthy i am sure a positive attitude will generate such an environement Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Breastfeeding EastEnders Sharon Tate Abortion debate Expert system Professor Childbirth Reliability engineering One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Pregnancy Killian documents Extreme Programming Hospitality service Infantilism Time Out of Mind Knots Landing She Loves You G-Man (Half-Life) Ethics Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Second language acquisition International League Birth control Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Scientific method Prenatal diagnosis Education in the People's Republic of China Franz Boas Doomsday argument Scientology beliefs and practices New York Giants Software engineering Poker jargon Rosa Parks Intelligent design A Course In Miracles Bayesian inference Plame affair Stroke Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion Probability Premature birth Guinea pig CPU cache Aerial (dance move) Apple Computer Autism Melanie Wilkes Child sexuality Big Brother UK series 6 Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sex Pistols The Emancipation of Mimi Jon Secada Acts of the Apostles Oral sex Days of our Lives Neighbours CPU design Urinary incontinence History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Australian constitutional law Species Abortion in the United States Incarnations of Immortality Roe v.
