how to become a publisher hi i want to become a publisher and eventually own my own publishing house however i have no idea of how to get into it or where to begin has anyone out there got any advice about where to start or any good references i could used online i did a search myslef but came up with nothing thanks in advance to any replies claire you'll have to move up the ladder of publishing and let me just forwarn you that it will be difficult the publishing business is hard to crack into right now and long hours and small pay is most likely in the future for you as you get into the business once you're in the upper echelon of a publishing house this will change though first off did you go to college already you'll need to go to school for english or journalism so you can apply for some entry level jobs in the publishing field while in school it would be good to work on some sort of publication newspaper magazine etc to gain some experience for your resume do internships at publishing companies while in school as well even if it's not required by your school it can only help you i work as an editor at a book publisher right now i got the job after graduating with a journalism degree this is an entry level position but that's because i live in a small city and there's not a lot of competition for these jobs if i was applying at a big publishing house in nyc for example i would never have gotten this job i would have had to start as an editorial assistant or administrative assistant you'll have to spend years in the industry working your way up before you can even think about becoming a publisher yourself there's so much to learn in this field and it wouldn't be smart to put out the money lots and lots of money it will require to start your own business before you know it well it will carry the same risks as starting any kind of business but it can be done with patience and dedication Education in the United States Extreme Programming Columbia University Labor theory of value Editor Professor Publishing Academia American University Management information system Plame affair Medical school Oxford English Dictionary Peer review Unemployment Yearbook Physician W.
