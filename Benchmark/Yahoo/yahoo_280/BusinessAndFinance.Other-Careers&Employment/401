problem with my job i am working for a staffing agency and they gave me a job for an hour and monday thru friday the problem is this job is way to laid back meaning you can go on the internet and do whatever you want and my job basically is just expediting meaning i just call acouple of places and ask where products are and are they shipping and i do that for an hour and that is really it the rest of the day i just sit at my desk and go on the internet and after doing this for three weeks i am so bored i can't take it now since i still work for the staffing agency can i just tell the agent to look for a new job for me and that is that i can get another job and still make the same and i have been on the internet for so long that i am so sick of the interne and is it sad that my second job that i work part time as a car prep meaning cleaning cars all night is more fun then my full time and just let you know this is a very small company it really seems dead end there is only one place and there are no managers just two owners life is too precious to stay in a job you don't enjoy never let anyone or anything make you feel like you have to stay just because it's a paycheck i was in a job that many people would give an arm and a leg for but it still wasn't fulfilling so i left it's better to be free and poor or free and confused than chained to a job just for money or a sense of stability i'm sure you have a ton of talents that could be utilized and appropriated in a better way than to sit at a desk all day on the internet i would say start looking for a new job with all that internet time monster has good services for figuring out what you want to do and many people contact you if you post your resume up there good luck and god bless you The Catcher in the Rye Social rule Ocean's Twelve Call centre The Apprentice 2 Avenue Q Aerial (dance move) The Drew Carey Show EastEnders Pitaten Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Paul Is Dead The Life and Times of Juniper Lee IBM PC compatible Jewish services Time Out of Mind The Amazing Race Money Air traffic controller Sola fide Labour economics Chair Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March New York Giants Professional wrestling slang Poker jargon Outsourcing Kodocha Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act System/36 Heinkel He 112 Internet fraud Professional wrestling holds Year of the Spider Whose Line Is It Anyway?
