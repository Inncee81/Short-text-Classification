what reason should i give to postpone a decision on a job offer i already have an offer from one company but i just did an onsite with another and waiting for their response how do i put off the first company for few more days till i hear back from the second company i am keen on joining the second company and also the pay of the first company is average negotiate with them a bit ask for some additional holiday time ask for some additional pay it will usually take them a day or so to respond to you be sure to not answer the phone when they are ringing so they have to leave a message and then dont respond until during the next day's business hours be sure to ask them about their fringe benefits and ask for a day or two to look those over and again ask some questions again as a stalling tactic ive used this method successfully a few times and can gernally stretch it out at least a week doing so and have managed over weeks before it also has the added side benefit of possibly resulting in a higher wage or more time off for you if you do take the position Wal-Mart Social rule Unemployment Minimum wage Call centre London Congestion Charge Sydney Riot of 1879 Plame affair GSM services Microeconomics Breastfeeding Trade union Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment benefit Life insurance Ives Manufacturing Company Insurance Same-sex marriage in Canada Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Airline Operation Market Garden Air traffic controller In-N-Out Burger Principal-agent problem Walt Disney World College Program Yom Kippur War Jeopardy!
