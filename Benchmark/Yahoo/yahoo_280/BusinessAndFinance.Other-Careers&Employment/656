how do i become an extra in a tarantino film or harry potter film keep in mind that i am under years old my daughter did work as a model did commercial work and film work as an extra featured extra etc you need to contact various agents by sending in pictures your measurements height etc resume if you have one etc if an agent is interested they will contact you to come in for basically an interview if an agency wants to sign you to their agency make sure they do not ask for any money as my daughters agent had said if an agency asks you for money up front run and run fast they are not a reputable agency agencies make money base on the work you do the only money you should be forking the bill for are for the photographer that will take you pictures for your composite printing of your composites and either a cell phone and or pager these composites are what you give potential employers when your agent sends you on a go see and or an audition and it is best to print your info on the back of these composites from your computer don't do too many as your information always changes this will consist of your name measurements work you have done such as print work for mervyn's back to school flyer any and all film work any classes you've taken to better yourself in acting modeling etc special interestes such as green belt in tai kwon do years of classical ballet years in jr high high school band playing flute etc my daughters agent always required that we had a pager in the agents area code if that is what your agent requires i would suggest you also have a cell phone so you don't have to bother trying to find a pay phone when they page you a prior answerer told you that the agent will tell you what film you will be in wrong the agent will send you on go see's which is for print work magazines etc if this is what you want to do and they will send you on auditions which is for any and all types of film work this does not guarantee that you have been hire this is only an audition and sometimes you have to come back several times others it's just the one time and you may not get hired there are no guarantees film work can be an industrial training film for a bank my daughter did this and no one but the bank employees board of directors etc will see the work the general public will not see this in a movie theater music video commercial major film independent film etc anything that is on a film not still camera if you are hired by the employer not the agent you will be categorized depending on what work you will be doing extra featured extra principal etc a principal is generally someone who actually has speaking parts is more of a major person in the film an extra is just that a person who is an extra in a piece of film work featured extra is someone who has a little more to do on the film etc there are various categories you are also compensated based on what you are hired for categorized if you are an extra you get one flat fee and that is it let's say you could get paid for an all day shoot which could be or hours you do not get an residual payments at all if you are a principal you will get residual payments for instance you do a commercial it is nationwide you will get a residual check periodically based on how many times it is show the regions that it is shown etc and if the employer decides to take the original commercial and change it a bit you get another check because the basically made another commercial and you get another residual check if they stop running the commercial you stop getting checks on film work the agent will take basically a percentage of each check if memory serves me correctly my daughters agent took again this is for each time you get a check this is how they make their money print work is a one time check and going by memory again my daughters agent took i believe now on film work since you are under the age of you need an entertainment work permit which allows you to work it is similar but different from your standard work permit that you would get to work at a department store book store etc this entertainment work permit has to be signed by your parents as well as your school you are only allowed to work a certain number of hours like any other work permit some employers get around the long hours by not having you on the set for instance my daughter was filming a commercial at a house but they had us stay at a hotel and watch tv order room service etc until they needed her once she was on the set that is when the clock started ticking being a minor if you are working on a set during the school year there needs to be a studio teacher on the set and yes you still have to do school work and the studio teacher signs and dates the back of your work permit stating that you have down what is required by law also since you are a minor any and all film work that you do requires the employer to take a portion of your pay i believe it is and put it in a blocked trust account that you cannot access until you are years of age not even your parents agent manager can touch this this is a law i can't remember if it is just for california could be for other states as well but i know for sure in california called coogan's law for the former child actor jackie coogan who basically had no money after his childhood acting career thanks to his parents he also play uncle fester in the original adamm's family show i feel like i'm forgetting to tell you something but i'm rushed to go to work and i saw your question and felt compelled to answer you if you have any questions please feel free to ask me via yahoo answers i'd be more than happy to answer any questions that i can if i can also check out the link below it was my daughters agent she no longer does this sort of work she is concentrating more on her school studies go to frequently asked questions and then submissions and this will give you an idea as to what her agent required people to submit if they are interested in having her become their agent remember you don't hire the agent they basically are hiring you so there are no guarantees that the agent is going to sign you to their agency and going to go see's and auditions does not guarantee you a job think of it as an interview best of luck to you and again feel free to ask me any questions through yahoo answers Constitution of the Turkish
