best way to call in sick when you're not sick on wednesday morning afternoon my friend is leaving to go to texas we've been buddies for a while but lately i haven't had time to hang out with him or my other friends on wednesday he's taking off and i wouldn't feel right not being there i just finished high school and for now i'm working part time at a grocery store from what i can tell so far they aren't too strict i actually slept in last week because i thought the store was closed when it wasn't and they shrugged it off and just gave me some extra hours but anyways i was thinking of throwing a party for him on tuesday night and then going to the airport with him and some other friends on wednesday morning afternoon i have to work on wednesday i was thinking of getting my mother to call in sick for me while i'm at the airport but what if they ask to speak to me what would be a believable method i asked a co worker if they'd let me off for such an event and she said nah so this is the way i have to go welcome to adulthood being an adult means putting things in priority for most that means not taking off work without a good reason and many times not taking off work even with a good reason your coworker was right this is not a good reason to take off work having mom call in for you is childish if you are taking the time off you need to be the one to take the time off in many workplaces they do not allow anyone else to call in for the employee regardless of the circumstances i'd settle for saying goodbye at the party tuesday night with cellphone email etc there are lots of ways to keep in touch over long distances Time Out of Mind Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Charmed Cindy Sheehan Social rule Fasting Hiberno-English Ocean's Twelve Avenue Q Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Pitaten The Catcher in the Rye Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Humphrey Bogart Shawn Michaels Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Poker jargon About a Boy September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September Saturday Night Live Carnival Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Theory of conduct Blood on the Tracks Wal-Mart John Kerr Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Friends Customs and etiquette of Japan Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February STS-59 History of Test cricket (to 1883) Good Friday Grandview, U.S.A.
