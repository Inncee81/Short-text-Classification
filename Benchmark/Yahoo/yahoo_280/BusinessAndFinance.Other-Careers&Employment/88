new name same 'company' i'm reposting this because my other question didn't get any good answers i worked for a company that within a couple days was about to fire me on false pretense basically 'he said she said' but proved to be a lie almost immediately the management that was attempting to fire me said sorry once they found out it wasn't true and still said i might get fired yes weird they never did anything to the slandering person i was offered another job and rather than dealing with management that was going closer to a lawsuit by their actions i just took the other job and quit without notice years later the company changed management and it's name ie it was bought out i wish to work there again but i don't want to explain my reasons for leaving their former owners my question is will they be privy to the formers owner's employement information i really don't feel like explaining something that can't be verified but i'd like to work there nice answer phillipa gordon thanks i know this is going to sound wishy washy but my answer is it depends often when a company is bought out it retains the human resource records and employment histories of the previous owners so if someone needs to verify previous employment those records still exist however the detail you mention in your post may not be present in those records sometimes the records for an employee's departure are pretty scant e g employee x resigned on nov meaning there's no detailed record of what transpired i think the most likely place for the discussion to arise is in the interview process where you'll likely be asked for you reasons for wanting to return so to speak you can be intentionally vague in your response to this i left to pursue another opportunity but i discovered that this company job is a better fit good luck Plame affair Slander and libel Theory of conduct Expert system Microeconomics God Emperor of Dune Scientology beliefs and practices Michael D.
