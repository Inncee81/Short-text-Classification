need advice i work at the cinema should i switch jobs or will it drive me mad i work at a cinema i sell popcorn etc or prepare coffee and when there are lectures there i help set up the place and so on it s a boring job and during the hours when there is literally nothing to do when people are inside watching the films after every inch is clean i m still not allowed to read draw or do anything i m expected to stand still and smile they give you looks even when you re talking to other staff members who don t have anything to do either but still it s an easy job which is not physically demanding and you barely do anything there and i get to see movies for free in the cinemas belonging to that company there s this other job working as a steward receiving people into the theatre checking their tickets making sure they re seated in the correct place it requires checking whether there are any technical problems and getting them fixed and cleaning afterwards it s pretty much the same difficulty level as selling food but what i see as an advantage is that you have to stay during the film and this way you get to watch movies while you work as opposed to doing so in your spare time which i don t have much of it sounds perfect for me as i love cinema but my boss said that it ll drive me mad to watch each film times or so if you have experience in this kind of job i d love to hear your point of view on the job i don't have any experience but i do think that you'll never want to watch the same movie more than times you'll hate it just my opinion if you ask this question in a different place you might get more answer Movie theater DVD Social rule Theory of conduct RuneScape quests G-Man (Half-Life) Poker jargon Education in the People's Republic of China Motion picture rating system Singlish Floppy disk Mach kernel Whose Line Is It Anyway?
