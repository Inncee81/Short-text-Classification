what is the silliest reason you quit a job i quit a job because they had me sitting in the coldest part of the office directly under an air conditioning vent that never seemed to shut off after buying an electric blanket and a heater fan would not keep me warm and many complaints from them about me not being at my desk i thought it best for us both that i quit i had politely asked them to move me to a warmer location but they all acted as if that were impossible even though there were tons of empty desks in much warmer areas of the office i only lasted two weeks i had an employee quit because i sold some childrens dvd movies she was wanting to get for her child the child wasn't even born yet she was months pregnant i told her by the time her kid is old enough to watch the movies dvds will be obsolete and we will be watching disney movies some other way HVAC EastEnders Married... with Children Climate of the United Kingdom Quarashi Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Futurama (TV series - season 5) Paul Is Dead Carl Barks The Inside IBM PC compatible Marilyn Monroe Anime Oasis (band) Ben Johnson (athlete) Friends Charmed Pok__mon (anime) Clay Aiken SpongeBob SquarePants Fan (implement) Carburetor The Apprentice 3 Mickey Mouse Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Kill Bill Blonde on Blonde Television in the United States Whose Line Is It Anyway?
