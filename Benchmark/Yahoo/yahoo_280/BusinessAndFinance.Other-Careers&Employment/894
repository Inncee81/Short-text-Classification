i like children and i like law what's a good career i would love to be a teacher or a lawyer but i know i don't have the discipline to finish that much schooling i'm just one of those people but what are some good careers that involve working with children or law i've been looking into early childhood education but was told the dont get paid a lot anyone have any good ideas of jobs i'm over looking money isn't an issue it's time i am just one of those people that doesn't finish what they start i need it to be something i'll enjoy but quickly i think that you should become a children's' right advocate which is sort of like a children's' lawyer they deal with children that are being mistreated i think it would make a great job b c you would be helping these children find a voice in a world that isn't always fair to them a lot of these children find themselves in bad situations which most of the time is not their own fault or you can go and work in the district attorney office da and defend children against sexual offenders this job will also help you give these children a voice and stand up to somebody who hurt them in the most vile way you could also become a counselor who works primarily with adolescents either way it goes it doesn't matter how much money you make the only thing that matters is that you are happy Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pitaten Pedophilia Lawyer Great Teacher Onizuka Kender Plame affair Adolescence Social rule Sexual abuse Extreme Programming Avenue Q Friends Transactional analysis Child sexual abuse Kodocha Psychoanalysis Attorney at Law Fathers' rights Graduate school Human sexual behavior The Ashlee Simpson Show Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Maison Ikkoku Alcoholics Anonymous EastEnders Philip J.
