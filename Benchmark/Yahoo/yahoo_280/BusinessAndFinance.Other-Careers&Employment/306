job question no call after strong verbal interest i met with someone about some volunteer work i am doing they asked me about my background work education i told them they asked me for work samples and resume b c they had a project that they thought i could help on i sent everything during the meeting about the volunteer work and via an email they expressed strong interest in hiring me to do some contractrual work told me all about the project etc since that initial meeting and one email i rec'd nothing i have emailed to check in but nothing a total lock out weird what is weird is i will have to interface with her about the volunteer work i guess i shouldn't mention the paid work how awkward pls thoughts these are excellent points i will not take it personally and be confident thanks so far to answerers it might not be anything personal perhaps they lost the funding for this position and don't have a paid job to offer anymore or maybe they are awaiting a decision from somebody higher up the chain of command this is pretty common in business and the hiring process can take much longer than you'd think if you want you can mention that you're always interested in doing more work with company to signal that you're still interested you can ask about the job outright but it might be an awkward conversation Plame affair Advance fee fraud Social rule The Apprentice 2 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Pretty Good Privacy G-Man (Half-Life) Karl Rove Episodes of Lost (Season 1) God Emperor of Dune Expert system Outsourcing One Tree Hill (TV series) Labor theory of value Call centre Fight Club Michael D.
