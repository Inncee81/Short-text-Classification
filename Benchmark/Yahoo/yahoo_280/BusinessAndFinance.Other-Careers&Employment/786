should i call back my potential employer i had an interview on last saturday night i felt that the interview went well at the end of the interview they told me that they were going to do a background check and then call me back on monday or tuesday well they didn't call me back at all i am sure my background check was just fine because my credit score is fine i haven't done any crimes or anything like that etc anyway should i call them and ask them whats going on and if i were to call what would i say pathfinder i got the impression that since the interviewer said i'll call you on monday or tuesday and didn't just say i'll give you a call that he was interested in hiring me i don't think he would have said a specific day if he was just giving a generic response i would say that it's ok to call the interviewer back at this point when you get him her on the phone just say something along the lines of i was just checking back with you to see if you had any additional questions for me and let you know that i'm excited about the opportunity keep it short sweet i think it's likely that the interviewer had something come up and the time frame got skewed Ocean's Twelve Plame affair Sharon Tate Our Friends in the North Jayson Blair Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Ashlee Simpson Show New York Giants The Shining (film) Amiga Power Background check 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans STS-59 Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February James Hanratty Time Out of Mind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Kurt Cobain Paul Is Dead Saturday Night Live Major League Baseball television contracts Tennessee State Constitution W.
