does anyone else find that working in an office in mind numbing i have a college degree in business management and an employment background in human resources and retail management i currently work in an hr dept and find myself missing the amount of interaction that i was used to in a retail environment i began at my current company about a year ago in the hopes furthering my career and knew the adjustment would take some time but still find myself feeling the same way i am hesitant to go back to retail management because it is often times looked at as a dead end type of job advice it would be nice to someday own a business i would love to have a small bed breakfast or cafe i don't know how i could afford to pay my mortgage and pursue something like that at this point though maybe in the future yup i feel braindead in this job but it isn't because it's an office job just not enough interaction with other people it is possible to be very fulfilled in office jobs i'm a programmer but i just don't like the self motivated figure it all out yourself mentality these days it would be so much more fun to work in teams Unemployment Wal-Mart Alex Ferguson Strategic management Plame affair Microsoft Theory of conduct Call centre Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Division of labour Freeters Mortgage Have I Got News For You Wall Street EastEnders Bon Jovi Knots Landing Avenue Q Electronic commerce Hal Trosky W.
