how to tell about a planned vacation on an interview i have a job interview today and my onlyproblem is that i have had my vacation planned and paid for for months i would be gone for weeks in the beginning of sept i want to be upfront about it and let them know but i don't want this vacation to hinder my chances of being hired how should i go about telling them or do i wait for the second interview thanks you should be upfront about it the last thing you want to do is walk into a job work for a few weeks and then announce you have a vacation planned trust me it's better to be honest about it they'll ask you when you'll be able to start and if you can start next week say that you'll be able to work through the month but have a long planned vacation in the first of september after that you look forward to really immersing yourself in your work but call it a trip not a vacation best Wheel of Fortune Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Cindy Sheehan Hurricane Katrina timeline Wal-Mart Plame affair Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Plame affair timeline Unemployment Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Karl Rove Family Feud She Loves You Shaggy dog story Knots Landing The Apprentice 2 WWE RAW Johnny Carson Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005 Rosa Parks Advance fee fraud Steve Jobs Spidey Super Stories I Want to Hold Your Hand King Crimson Fahrenheit 9/11 Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Live 8 The Miracles Dream Job (Season 2) Jennifer Lopez Eric Bischoff Air traffic controller Richard Marx The Sims Slow Train Coming Leeds United F.C.
