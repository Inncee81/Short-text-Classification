i showed up for a job interview one week early i'm mortified i must have mis read the email do i have a chance in answering this it would help to know what the potential employer's reaction was to your unexpected arrival i know that if i were the one who had been doing the scheduling i would be just as worried that my email to you had stated the wrong date were they okay with it at the time did they laugh it off or did they just say see you next week in a humorless kind of way as an employer who interviews people all the time i can say that i would not necessarily take it as a bad sign that someone came in on the wrong date i've had people show up hours late for appointments and i rejected them immediately because it made it look like they didn't want the job very much you at least come off looking like you are eager to have the job better a week early than an hour late i say the best consolation i can give is to say that you should go by their reaction if they were okay and amused then you should not worry even if they looked at you askance go in on your regularly scheduled date and wow them i would even make some joke about it as you go in to show that you're not afraid to admit when you made a mistake Plame affair Social rule Shaggy dog story EastEnders Television syndication Johnny Carson The Ashlee Simpson Show Killian documents Jeopardy!
