how to deal when my company pockets my sales incentive i work as a salesperson for a small printing company various vender offers me extra for selling their printers in a form of gift vouchers or small cash amout but my boss told me that the company will pocket these small rewards is this normal how can i deal yep since you are not an independent contractor then everything you do goes through your company even gifts from vendors now if there's a way for you to do this without the company's knowledge then go for it but rest assuered that if they find out you may lose your job here's an example i was a manager for a large retailer we would offer gift cards as incentives to employees if someone won a giftcard the store still withheld taxes on the amt won so they get a gift card for then on their paycheck they have taxes deducted for that it ticks a lot of people off but that's the american way so either keep it to yourself or don't do it or look for another job take care Taxation in the United States Wal-Mart Bulk vending Microeconomics FairTax Credit card Electronic commerce Sales promotion The Apprentice 2 Loyalty program $ale of the Century Tax Octopus card Privatization Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Food Stamp Program Sales Poker jargon Management Computer printer Social Security (United States) Mutual fund Best Buy ITunes Music Store Flat tax Mergers and acquisitions Apple Computer United Kingdom corporation tax Automatic teller machine Warren Buffett Outsourcing Education in the United States Incentive Sinclair Research Ltd David Beckham Wall Street Health insurance Insurance Citigroup Donald Trump Annuity Internet fraud Staples, Inc.
