why would employer's put job applications on line it's too time consuming and it's quicker to just fill out paper applications it's like when i fill out on line job applications i'm always told they don't have a position for me at this time when they clearly have it posted that they're hiring for that particular position the theory is the online app's are easier to distribute to prospective employers and save time in reviewing they often lead however to a much less personal review and can be more easily ignored i suggest a phone call or personal email to a particular person referencing your online application then you can get the best of both worlds the automated response system becomes your only interface if you don't try to augment it with a personal touch good luck Customer relationship management E-mail Plame affair IPod Enterprise content management Blog Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Expert system Craps Surveillance Private branch exchange Password Global Positioning System Ajax (programming) Linux IBM PC compatible Software engineering Morse Code Game programmer America Online Internet fraud Computer-supported collaboration Killian documents NeXT Apple Macintosh Voice over IP Outsourcing Internet forum Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer Microsoft Mac OS history Social software Xerox Star Windows XP Call centre Electronic voting Opera (web browser) BitTorrent Florida Central Voter File Social network Workplace democracy Academia Mach kernel Unemployment benefit Embedded system Mac OS X Inflation MDAC Mac OS X v10.4 Gmail Computer virus DBASE Mouse (computing) Common criticisms of Microsoft Air traffic controller EGovernment Stopping e-mail abuse Chromatography Spam (electronic) Whois Michael D.
