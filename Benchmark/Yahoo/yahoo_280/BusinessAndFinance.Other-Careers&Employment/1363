what is the best place for a new grad to look for a job what are some good strategies for getting a job names of good websites listen i am a recent college graduate don't listen to these people who are just passively telling you to go to careerbuilder com or monster com they tell you to submit your resume into a blackhole and act like everything will turn out fine it's a war out there and in war you must resort to aggressive tactics i've noticed that the internet is a good place to start with a job search but not necessarily a good place to finish people still seem to respond faster to paper applications than ones submitted online i understand some jobs don't accept paper applications i'm just saying there is still something special about that extra effort to try to meet with a breathing person then they remember you it is also better to conduct your own specialized job search instead of using a massive database such as monster or career builder you should compile a list of the companies you would like to work for and then go to their individual website and see if they are hiring contrary to popular belief no all employers don't post their career opportunities on monster or careerbuilder do anything to stay out of the mainstream even craigslist org may be helpful to search for local employment just do whatever you can to stand out above the thousands of graduates who are out there competing against us when interviewing if you have related job experience emphasize your maturity and work experiences rather than your college experiences most employers just see education as a basic requirement but not as an end all way to decide if you possess the skills necessary for a specific job to them education is just a box that they check off the long list of things that they expect from you some employers are also reluctant to hire new graduates because they see them as unstable volatile or immature i recently registered for several staffing agencies that was one of the smartest moves that i made initially i was against the idea because i was against temporary employment i discovered it's not as bad as i thought it's a good way to get into prestigious companies on a trial basis then you can gain not only skills and experiences but also the respect of the company after accessing your performance they may decide to take you on permanently lastly a good outlet for me is federal government employment you should go to usajobs com and search for jobs the advantage is the government has great entry level opportunities in almost every field imaginable that include training you would be looking for a gs or entry level job the disadvantage is the application process is very different than it is for private sector jobs and can take up to months to be considered for a position happy job hunting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Software engineering Graduate school Affirmative action Education in Portugal Education in the People's Republic of China Paralegal Economic inequality Unemployment Intelligent design Education in Australia GED Milton H.
