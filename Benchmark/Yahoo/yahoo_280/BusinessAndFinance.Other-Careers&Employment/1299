is career councelling helpful or simply waste of time pls help me good question it depends on who is doing the career counseling if it is through a college or high school the counselors have been trained in all the theories relating to adult development and all of the theories relating to different types of career counseling they should also belong to several professional development groups that link with employers to study trends and issues however many of the freelance career counselors are simply people who are not good enough to land jobs in colleges because they are not very qualified these folk then open up their own business and charge quit a lot they also usually can not afford to stay very current as they have to pay for all of their own professional development you may not get a lot from them i am a college career counselor and we just hired for a position in our office we had very qualified applicants to choose among we also had about less qualified applicants everyone always thinks they would be good at counseling because they want to give people advice most people are not and we really do not tell people what they should do we help people assess themselves and explore options there is very little of my personal opinion in my counseling therefore like any counseling you get out of it what you put into it you can tell you are working with a good career counselor if they meet with you counsel you and then send you on your way to update your own resume and apply to positions yourself if they are doing it for you they are more of a placement official or headhunter these people are usually not qualified counselors if that is the type of service you are seeking those are the people you should hire if you want to explore your career options look at transferable skills and figure out what is the right niche for you then consult a career counselor i will add that i have been doing this for eight years and i am much better now than i was my first year i would ask how long the counselor has been practicing good luck Psychotherapy School counselor Psychoanalysis Paralegal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deprogramming Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Philosophical counseling Exit counseling College admissions Lawyer Psychology Life insurance Appeal Education in Romania Unemployment Education in the United States Affirmative action Public domain Transsexuality Plame affair Freeters Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Economics Career United Kingdom corporation tax Scientology beliefs and practices Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Community college Division of labour Insurance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Ethics Barrister Rick Ross Adult attention-deficit disorder Software engineering Call centre Pretty Good Privacy Social work Cooperative education Physician Town meeting Trademark Labor theory of value Priesthood (Mormonism) Norway national football team Workplace democracy Management Extreme Programming GED Law school Genetic counseling Notary public Conscription Education Consensus decision-making Microsoft Associate's degree Juris Doctor Self-concept Bentley College Air traffic controller Taxation in the United States Immigration to the United States Mediation Expert system ISO 9000 Osteopathy Neuro-linguistic programming George W.
