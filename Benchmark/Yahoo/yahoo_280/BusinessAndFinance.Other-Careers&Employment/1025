i'm and in th grade i am attempting to buy a car only have after saving everything for a year i can't get a real job bc i go to school and don't have much time with all my sports activities i know i don't have to pay all at once but i dont want to be paying on this thing for years my parents won't give me a dime towards it they say i need to earn it how can i earn more money i have sold every valuable thing i own on ebay and i babysit all the time i got all money for my sweet so that went into the dollars thanx for any ideas first off your doing great i know you are not even rd of the way there and it seems like you'll never have enough money but you are doing so much more than most people and i really admire the efforts you are making let me tell you a quick story not what you want but i think it will help just after finishing college i went to work at a large company making good money but i hated the work it was ok for some but i found it boring and i just couldn't get along with my boss i didn't feel like things would be any better at another company so i decided to save up to start my own business investing in real estate i studied real estate investing for years kept working at the job i hated and eventually started buying palces and fixing them up while still working the regular job after i started buying places i'd fix them up myself to save typically i'd get up go to work work until around then work on an investment property until midnight and work on the proeprty day each weekend go home fall exhausted into bed and repeat everything the next day the work was grueling i remember x mases eating at the only open restaurant the chinese restaurant as my family was 's of miles away but i wanted to stay in town to work on the property but many years later i saved up enough and made enough that i did quit my job now i'v made enough doning this that i am pretty well set but it took many years and was really really tough the point is thats what you have to do in life life isn't easy its challenging and you've got to work at it but keep with it and you will eventually meet your goal and it will be all the sweeter so great what you've done so far but if this is what you truly want just keep to it the lessons you learn accomplishing this will stick with you your whole life and put you ahead of of the other people out there sorry again i don't think this holds the ideas you were hooping for but i think the best advice is just to keep at it best luck EastEnders Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Warren Buffett Carl Barks 2000 Australian Grand Prix Poker jargon Avenue Q Insurance Theory of conduct The Amazing Race Kodocha Alex Ferguson Bond Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Apprentice 2 Evel Knievel Capitalism Bank The Critic Scrooge McDuck Internet fraud Donald Trump Charles Ponzi Capital accumulation Deflation (economics) Pitaten Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Great Teacher Onizuka Everwood James T.
