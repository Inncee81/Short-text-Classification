how often does this happen just moved into a new appartment in a big city i have one roomate who is female right from the start there has been a strong sexual undercurrent between us she is very attractive and extremley smart i figure sooner or later will eventually go at in the next months whats the best way to do it right if it does happen so it doesnt become awkard or wrong i have heard stories guys and girls moving into gether and of course the sexual undercurrent reares its head and relationships and even marriages have resulted from living together i guess its because you basically live together without the sexual benfit and become friends and now what each is like and then eventually if that spark exists you end up sleeping together am i wrong or crazy please help i am the male in the situation yes i think when males and females live together they tend to end up with feelings and usually followed by actions because they are just friends your right things can get weird first decide how far you are willing to go and what you want from it make sure she expects the same make sure neither of you have a bf or gf at the time have a back up plan for living arrangements afterwards once you hook up its hard to date other i people would you want to date a girl who was living with somebody she had slept with Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Teen Girl Squad Pitaten Sexual orientation Humphrey Bogart Human sexual behavior Sexual attraction Kodocha Shaggy dog story Blood on the Tracks Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sleeping Murder Sex and the City Sexual differentiation Age of consent Love One Life to Live Polyamory Bisexuality Scenes from a Memory Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Theory of conduct Undergrads God Emperor of Dune Pedophilia R.
