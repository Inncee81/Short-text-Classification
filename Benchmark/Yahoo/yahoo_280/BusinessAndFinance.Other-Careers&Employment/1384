unilateral hearing loss and the workplace if someone has really bad hearing loss in one ear that prevents them from hearing everything people say then should they let their employer know about it also what advice would you give them about rude customers who become short because they can't hear them because they're too quiet for their good ear to pick up the sound or the person isn't speaking clearly to be understood i just think it's wrong for anyone to be rude to the handicapped and slightly handicapped people no matter the reason because it's not like they can help it yes the person with the disability must inform their employer this is the only way that the employer can assist the person with making accomodations customers are rude no matter what most will understand if the person just says something like i am having trouble with my left ear i am going to turn my head to try to hear you better but i am definitely listening to your concerns that will make most customers a little more willing to work with the worker but there will always be some who are just mean or impatient or whatever who will not care if the employee has a disability or not they are going to take out their anger on the employee the best response to these is to work hard on customer service skills of letting angry people vent without escalating and then giving them what they want after all most places do have the employees train that the customer is always right and yes it is wrong for people to be rude to those with disabilities but it isn't going to go away soon the best way to help is to inform teach whole communities at a time the more disabled there are out in the community the more people will come in contact with them and over time they will be seen as people and not the disabled Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mental retardation Traumatic brain injury Dyslexia Hearing aid Learning disability Unemployment Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Contract Disability Morse Code Theory of conduct Employment in Hong Kong Ontological argument Stuttering Deaf culture Health insurance Management Volleyball Consensus decision-making Social work Political correctness Plame affair Martial art Religious Society of Friends Nurse Models of deafness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Involuntary commitment Pitaten Human sexual behavior Euphemism Fast bowling Insurance Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Cochlear implant Autism It's All Gone Pete Tong Microphone Negima Book of Isaiah Asperger syndrome Helen Keller Kender Extreme Programming Call centre Fathers' rights Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Clinical depression Abortion debate Royal Assent Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Customer relationship management Corporate governance Poker jargon Apprenticeship Ethics Strategic management Information warfare Ear United States Postal Service Milton H.
