group interview at topshop i have a group interview tomorrow morning at topshop has anyone ever had one of these what happens what kind of questions might be asked i'm terrified there are two kinds of group interviews you are interviewed along with the other candidates for the position this is a cut throat play against each other type of interview the strategy for this type of interview is to answer very thoroughly when you are the first candidate to speak and is you are second of third you can agree with what the other candidates say but you must also add to your answer good luck these are tough you are interview by a panel of people asking questions i think this is actually easier than a regular one on one interview because the interviewers are more relaxed there is less pressure on them just be sure to look at each person and make eye contact as you answer every question remember everyone's name i got down initials and smile you should also send a thank you note to each person good luck in either case the questions will probably be similar see this website http www rileyguide com interview html Social rule HTML World Wide Web Plame affair Expert system Game show Roswell UFO incident Cross site scripting Statistical survey Have I Got News For You The Apprentice 2 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Interview Nicomachean Ethics HyperText Transfer Protocol Sampling (music) Deep Throat (Watergate) Trumpet Contract The Joker's Wild Family Feud Quotation mark Plame affair timeline Website Hollywood Squares Crossword Theory of conduct Wesley Clark Sharon Tate Time Out of Mind Proportional representation Consensus decision-making Cascading Style Sheets Web crawler Poker jargon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Edward R.
