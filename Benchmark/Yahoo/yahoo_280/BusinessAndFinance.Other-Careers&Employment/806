is it a bad idea to use leave time after giving a two week notice i'm not talking about leave time that can be cashed out after termination i'm talking about use it or lose it leave time on one hand i could see how it might look bad on the other hand i earned that leave time and don't want to lose it what are your thoughts it really depends on how important it is to you to leave your current organization on a good note if you have any interest in returning to the company or if you think you may need your supervisor to provide you a reference at some point i really don't recommend it it also kind of depends on how much time you're talking about if you're talking about calling in sick or using a personal holiday one day during your two week notice that's one thing it's another thing entirely to use several days or a week's worth of time the whole point of the week notice period is to give your employer a resource to keep things running until they can replace you and to give them enough time to learn as much as they can from you if you're not actually there than the whole week thing doesn't really do them any good on the other hand you're not actually required by any laws or anything to give two weeks notice at all it's just a courtesy that's customary to extend so at the end of the day it's up to you you may want to check before doing anything though as some companies have begun to refuse to pay outstanding vacation time to employees that don't work a two week notice period i would check with hr before you miss any days Microeconomics Annuity Theory of conduct Social rule Wheel of Fortune Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Supply and demand Extreme Programming Ra (board game) Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of language The Joker's Wild Unemployment benefit Unemployment Tax Leasehold estate The nature of God in Western theology Warren Buffett Karma Health insurance Copyright Prostate cancer Life insurance Flat tax Sheepshead Insurance Draw poker Inflation Chess strategy and tactics Public domain Graduate school Credit card Mutual fund Payroll Apprenticeship National Football League Objective-C Ocean's Twelve Spanish verbs Drug test Pyramid (game show) Computer virus Game programming Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Grade (education) Air traffic controller The Amazing Race Wal-Mart Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Hash table C plus plus Winning Streak $ale of the Century CPU cache Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bond Hey Jude Redundant array of independent disks Mojave people Taxicab Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Education in Germany National Insurance Web crawler 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Screenwriting Traumatic incident reduction Trade union Good Times Jennifer Lopez Royal Assent Betting (poker) The Catcher in the Rye Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Goodness and value theory Non-aggression principle Intellectual property Evan Mecham Milton H.
