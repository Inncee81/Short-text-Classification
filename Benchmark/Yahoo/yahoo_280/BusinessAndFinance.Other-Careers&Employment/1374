your boss told you to do something and his boss come to tell you do another thing in that case what to do in that case do i should stop doing my boss request if yes i want to know why yeah i've been there before his boss probably should not be doing that but here's a couple good ways to handle it tell his boss that conflicts with what my manager said do you still want me to do it if he says yes then you tell him yes sir i'll tell my manager my new directions and get right on it that's because it is your responsibility to keep your direct manager informed of what you are doing if his boss says no don't tell your manager then do as he says let your manager know next time you see him that you'd like some clarification on who to take orders from because right now you don't know which are the right orders stay polite and just be interested in doing a good job and they'll probably work it out good luck Theory X and theory Y Social rule Anarchism and society Big Boss A Milhouse Divided Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act CPU cache Rocko's Modern Life Moral Politics Eric Bischoff Yes, Minister Honey and Clover Alex Ferguson Little Britain Management Singlish Consensus decision-making The Critic 2000 Australian Grand Prix Billboard Hot 100 Colony in Space David Brent Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Air traffic control Corporate governance Timon and Pumbaa Stone Cold Steve Austin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair timeline Knots Landing Customs and etiquette of Japan Friends George Costanza Workplace democracy Librarian Death Comes to Time The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Infantilism She Loves You The Apprentice Cro Advance fee fraud The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Canadian House of Commons Transactional analysis Homer's Enemy Syphon Filter Infidels Gradius Michael D.
