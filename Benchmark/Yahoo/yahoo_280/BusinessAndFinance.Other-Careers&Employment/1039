employers advice please ok yesterday i went for my second interview at a gym for a front desk position and it was a different manager but at the end he told me that he wanted to hire me and said that he just needed to go tell the other guy the one who interviewed me the first time to hire me well he said they would either be calling me last night which they never did or today sometime do you think he would lie to me and not hire me he was very nice and said he liked me alot and everything and he wants to hire me employers can't tell you that if they don't mean it and i will be so mad sorry they can and will tell you anything regardless of meaning it unless they had you sign an intent to hire form they don't have to there may be a ranking of managers so the last guy might not have trully had hiring power Eric Bischoff Andrew Dice Clay Steven Wright IBM PC compatible Reggie Jackson Reservoir Dogs Late Night with Conan O'Brien Time Out of Mind Bon Jovi Plame affair Paul Is Dead The Apprentice 2 Dilbert Knots Landing The Apprentice 3 George Costanza Leo Durocher Mad Money Karl Rove Infidels Cliff Richard Call centre Satchel Paige Sharon Tate History of SNL:1980-1985 Renault F1 The Ashlee Simpson Show Microsoft Oh Mercy 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind I Want to Hold Your Hand Fernando Alonso Midnight Run Jayson Blair 2005 European Grand Prix Survivor (novel) Desk Pearl Jam Wal-Mart Donna Moss Modal auxiliary verb Amiga Power Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) U.S. presidential election, 2008 M*A*S*H (TV series) Dream Job (Season 2) The Boondock Saints Sandy Koufax John Kerr Spencer Tracy Bob Costas Taxicab Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Humphrey Bogart Secretary desk David Letterman X-COM: Genesis Shawn Michaels Shaggy dog story 613 mitzvot New York Knicks Neo (The Matrix) Norway national football team Electronic Arts Expert system Dial M for Murder The Apprentice 2 candidates Aerial (dance move) Cindy Sheehan Nikita Koloff Goatse.cx Conker's Bad Fur Day Waylon Jennings Melbourne gangland killings Chess strategy and tactics Jordan Grand Prix Janet Jackson Ann Coulter Michael Jackson Roxette The Inside Tupac Shakur Sersi Coldplay The Beatles discography Sub-Zero Stan Lee Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law Akuma (Street Fighter) Guy Fawkes Meat Loaf 2005 British Grand Prix Fair Game (Scientology) Singlish Mindy McCready Job interview Therion (band)
