how do you quit a job in order to advance where your boss is like a good friend and relies on you i don't make enough but i enjoy my job for the most part and my boss counts on me almost entirely since it is basically him and i except for a part timer leaving will hurt his business bad but i can't survive on my pay and need to advance find something with more pay then respectfully go to him and say i wanted to let you know that i have been job hunting and i found a job offering me more money i didn't want to leave you i a lurch but i have been having trouble making ends meet on my salary here and i wanted to give you the opportunity to match or beat this offer before i give you my notice then if he can match it or beat it then go with it if not then serve that as your notice to terminate now obviously if you don't want to stay whether you get more money or not then simply state the above and instead of offering him the chance to raise your pay just say i've been having trouble making ends meet with my salary here and i've found something offering me more so i'd like to submit my week notice it will be hard but you can do it you don't owe your boss anything parting will be hard but you don't owe it to him to live poor forever you owe it to yourself to make a good life take care EastEnders Alex Ferguson Satchel Paige Unemployment Knots Landing Blackjack Professor Humphrey Bogart Poker jargon Pitaten Babe Ruth St. Elmo's Fire (film) Montreal Screwjob Ocean's Twelve Professional wrestling slang Contract Social rule Vladimir Peter Tytla Rayman Graduate school Newcastle United F.C.
