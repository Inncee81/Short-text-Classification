hi i completed my mba yrs back i have not been working but now i would like to hi i completed my mba in finance yrs back i have not been working but now i would like to but i cant remember a single thing i learnt i am thinking of doing a small course or something like that online but dont know what direction to go will somebody help me with this i don't think you will be asked to take tests to verify your academic knowledge at the job interviews so i don't see any needs for you to take additional courses at your job if you ever need to check something you can go back to your old textbooks or ask your colleagues you will not be handling the job alone and people will support you so no worries although the potential employers will not probably ask mba test like questions they will probably ask what you have been doing after completing your mba that i think you need to prepare if you are looking for a job start sending your resumes and accepting the interview opportunities even if the company or its business is not something you have in your mind you can turn them down at any point and even if they turned you down you only applied to get the feeling of the interview so pls don't get discouraged that will give you a lot of hands on information to achieve your goal best of luck Master of Business Administration Strategic management Social rule Graduate school Master's degree Babson College Scholarship GED Extreme Programming Academia Plame affair Education in the People's Republic of China Philosophical skepticism Theory of conduct Milton H.
