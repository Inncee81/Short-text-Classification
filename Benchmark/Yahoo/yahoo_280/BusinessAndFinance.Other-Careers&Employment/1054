continuing my earlier question i have been working this job year she started months ago and makes more i just dont know what to do make sure you have your information correct first sometimes rumours spread around a company that are not correct i worked summers for this one company for years in a row in my th year people were complaning that i was making more money then them and did not know what i was doing since i was new when the truth finally came out how long i was there for things setteled down also how do you know how much your co worker is getting paid did they tell you are you sure they did not lie there are a lot of people out there who pretend to make more money then they actually do or misread their contract so please look into it first then if in fact the other person is making more money then you when you have more experience go talk with your boss ask your boss what sort of things can i improve on to get a raise when pay rates are re evaluate maybe even ask is there any additional responsibilities i can take on at this time take this meeting as an opportunity to let your boss know that you enjoy your job and take it seriously and would like to improve your skills and abilities whatever you do do not mention the other person who is making more money then you you will just look like a whiner who's is only in it for the money and your boss will not appreciate it Education in the People's Republic of China EastEnders Unemployment Theory of conduct Economic inequality Minimum wage Social rule Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Affirmative action Anarchism and capitalism Principal-agent problem Life insurance Trade union Minor league baseball Annuity Alex Ferguson Contract Labor theory of value Friends Microeconomics Wealth Advance fee fraud George Costanza Apprenticeship Toastmasters International Insurance RuneScape quests Final Fantasy XI Inflation Avenue Q Anarchism and society U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Medical malpractice Workplace democracy PE ratio Dead Like Me Warren Buffett Betting (poker) Ocean's Twelve A Course In Miracles Simone Weil Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capitalism Efficiency wages Wheel of Fortune United States Postal Service Plame affair MapleStory Negima Strategic management Publicly funded medicine Enron Corporation Labour economics Meaning of life Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 What Makes Sammy Run?
