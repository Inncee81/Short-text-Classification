how can i get a job i am an intelligent man with a degree in finance i speak languages fluently have years of experience in trading commodities domestically and in international markets and i can't get a freaking job i dress speak and behave in a very professional manner and i have gone through everything from editing my resume to sharpening my interviewing skills etc any ideas what recruiters or hiring managers are looking for these days i have been literally unemployed for almost years in which i've lived off of my life savings i am a very optimistic person with a lot of confidence and a good attitude on life but i seem to have gotten somehow into this rut in my life any suggestions as to how i can get out of it i am starting to get very desperate and frustrated to say the least i'd very much appreciate any suggestions cheers please do not be offended there is obviously nothing wrong with your qualifications i think you are rubbing people the wrong way because of your 'brilliance' suggestion look for someone who knows you very well and ask him to check you out request him to help you 'diagnose' your situation ask him what is wrong with me why can't i find a job there are many reasons an interview doesn't result in a job offer the interviewer may think that the applicant lacked the skills to perform the job was unable to answer questions clearly and concisely didn't project and successful profile and lacked poise or confidence was overly aggressive personality wouldn't fit with team was unprepared and asked few if any meaningful questions lack of research about the company was unable to explain unfavorable factors in a resume such as employment gaps or lack of degree had unrealistic expectations about salary was more interested in salary benefits than the job you may also be targeting the wrong industry or going after the wrong job almost all interviewing problems could be avoided by taking the time to prepare and practice before the interview remember it is not necessarily the candidate who is the most qualified who gets the job it's the applicant who convinces the employer that she he can do the job and become a dynamic part of the company team the formula to success is part skills and part personality so make a good impression peace and every blessing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule The Apprentice 2 Economic inequality Inflation Capitalism Plame affair Social psychology Gross domestic product Graduate school Asperger syndrome Unemployment Game programmer Software engineering Theory of conduct Education in the People's Republic of China Freeters Alexander Technique GED Milton H.
