change my major or can i just take the exams on my own at what point in my college career do i take the exams is actuary work any fun any information advice would be a big help i cut and pasted the following from the source i think it answer your questions applicants for beginning actuarial jobs usually have a bachelor s degree in mathematics actuarial science statistics or a business related discipline such as economics finance or accounting about colleges and universities offer an actuarial science program and most offer a degree in mathematics statistics economics or finance some companies hire applicants without specifying a major provided that the applicant has a working knowledge of mathematics including calculus probability and statistics and has demonstrated this knowledge by passing one or two actuarial exams required for professional designation courses in economics accounting finance and insurance also are useful companies increasingly prefer well rounded individuals who in addition to having acquired a strong technical background have some training in liberal arts and business and possess strong communication skills in addition to knowledge of mathematics computer skills are becoming increasingly important actuaries should be able to develop and use spreadsheets and databases as well as standard statistical analysis software knowledge of computer programming languages such as visual basic also is useful two professional societies sponsor programs leading to full professional status in their specialty the society of actuaries soa administers a series of actuarial examinations in the life insurance health benefits systems retirement systems and finance and investment fields the casualty actuarial society cas gives a series of examinations in the property and casualty field which includes fire accident medical malpractice worker s compensation and personal injury liability the first four exams in the soa and cas examination series are jointly sponsored by the two societies and cover the same material for this reason students do not need to commit themselves to a specialty until they have taken the initial examinations which test an individual s competence in probability calculus statistics and other branches of mathematics the first few examinations help students evaluate their potential as actuaries many prospective actuaries begin taking the exams in college with the help of self study guides and courses those who pass one or more examinations have better opportunities for employment at higher starting salaries than those who do not after graduating from college most prospective actuaries gain on the job experience at an insurance company or consulting firm while at the same time working to complete the examination process actuaries are encouraged to finish the entire series of examinations as soon as possible advancing first to the associate level with an asa or acas designation and then to the fellowship level fsa or fcas designation advanced topics in the casualty field include investment and assets dynamic financial analysis and valuation of insurance candidates in the soa examination series must choose a specialty group and health benefits individual life and annuities pensions investments or finance examinations are given twice a year in the spring and the fall although many companies allot time to their employees for study home study is required to pass the examinations and many actuaries study for months to prepare for each examination it is likewise common for employers to pay the hundreds of dollars for examination fees and study materials most actuaries reach the associate level within to years and the fellowship level a few years later specific requirements apply to pension actuaries who verify the financial status of defined benefit pension plans for the federal government these actuaries must be enrolled by the joint board of the u s treasury department and the u s department of labor for the enrollment of actuaries to qualify for enrollment applicants must meet certain experience and examination requirements as stipulated by the board to perform their duties effectively actuaries must keep up with current economic and social trends and legislation as well as with health business finance and economic developments that could affect insurance or investment practices good communication and interpersonal skills also are important particularly for prospective consulting actuaries beginning actuaries often rotate among different jobs in an organization to learn various actuarial operations and phases of insurance work such as marketing underwriting and product development at first they prepare data for actuarial projects or perform other simple tasks as they gain experience actuaries may supervise clerks prepare correspondence draft reports and conduct research they may move from one company to another early in their careers as they advance to higher positions advancement depends largely on job performance and the number of actuarial examinations passed actuaries with a broad knowledge of the insurance pension investment or employee benefits fields can rise to administrative and executive positions in their companies actuaries with supervisory ability may advance to management positions in other areas such as underwriting accounting data processing marketing and advertising some actuaries assume college and university faculty positions
