what should job should i do ever since i was little i wanted to be a vet now that im older though i have been thinking about other carrers that work with animals like wildlife rehabilitation or working to help animals that have been abused and persecuting their neglectful owners i still want to be a vetrinarian but im worried that i wont be able to deal with the blodd would i get used to it give me your opinion i would say you definitely should look into other options if the sight of blood makes you queezy i would give the wildlife rehab centers in your area a call tell them you would like to come in for an 'informational interview ' let them know your age and tell them you are looking at careers they will likely let you come in and talk to them about the possibilities not at their company perhaps but at the industry in general also you might want to apply for a part time job where you would have the opportunity to work with animals even if you are just doing clean up work exposure in the area you are interested in is always helpful and will be even more helpful in the future good luck hope this helps Social rule Pet skunk Prostate cancer LiveJournal The O.C.
