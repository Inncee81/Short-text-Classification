i am looking for a permanent full time job is temp to hire positions recommendable in today's job market i wouldn't recommend it there are so many people looking for jobs so many more people than there are jobs that employers pretty much can take their pick speaking as the one in my company who does the hiring why would i pay an agency a fee if i can just hire someone outright yes the temp to hire gives many employers the feeling that they're not paying those high agency placement fees but they're really just spreading that over a longer period keep looking for a direct hire job but if you need something right away and temp to hire is all you're being offered make sure your recruiter knows you're still looking for a direct hire position the one advantage to temp to hire is it's a lot easier to quit since they haven't actually hired you yet anyway good luck Employment agency Graduate school Unemployment Employment Education in the People's Republic of China Management Wal-Mart Software engineering Academia Efficiency wages Drug test Exploitation Student loan Mutual fund Immigration to the United States Principal-agent problem Outsourcing Air traffic controller Seventh Sea (collectible card game) H-1B visa Social rule The Apprentice 2 McKinsey & Company Time Out of Mind Karl Rove Freeters Denis Law Housing cooperative Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Economic inequality Internet fraud Peer review Call centre Unemployment types Broadband Internet access British Civil Service Insurance Cable television Corporate governance Food and Drug Administration Affirmative action Union shop Relationship marketing Primerica Financial Services Social Security (United States) Plame affair Burbank, Los Angeles County, California Ashton-Tate Mach kernel Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Advance fee fraud RuneScape quests Education in Portugal United Airlines Education in Germany Health insurance Electronic Arts John Layfield Neuromancer United States Marshals Service Craps Kasparov versus The World In-N-Out Burger Vladimir Peter Tytla Mortgage Hartz concept Call girl Charmed RuneScape Therion (band) Michael D.
