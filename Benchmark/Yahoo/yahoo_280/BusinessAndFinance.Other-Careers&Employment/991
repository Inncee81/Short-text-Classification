really bad at writing resumes so i'm in the market for a new job i need one desperately i'm very unhappy where i am now but i'm not so good at writing a resume i did the whole resume builder thing but i just feel as though i need to beef it up any suggestions i have had occasion to interview people in the past and based on that and merely by talking with other people who do hiring the resume is overrated by most people it carries weight but not in the way that people think the sole object of the resume is simply to convey clearly and understandably what the nature of your employment history is there are many too many books and articles written on the subject of resumes and cover letters you should be able to get as much specific information as you need and more from them the basic idea is to be clear be direct follow the generally accepted format explain any gaps or other irregularities in work history and of course never lie a little white lie can get you fired years later and it will then become a permanent black hole in your employment record generally the employer is trying to figure out what kind of worker you are in the context of the job you are applying for try to put yourself in the shoes of the manager if you had to hire people for the job what would you be looking for try to frame your experience in previous jobs in a way that highlights the kind of experience you know a particular employer will be looking for i said that the resume does not carry the weight that people think if you have adequate qualifications for the job you will be called in for an interview no employer makes any final decisions before the interview in fact the interview is just about everything there is information about a person that you can get from an interview that you can never get from a sheet of paper before the interview everything is up in the air no matter what font your resume is typed in or what kind of paper it is printed on so what about the resume it simply gets you in the door by showing that you have the proper qualifications for the job if you've got the qualifications as long as the resume is passable you don't have to worry about beefing it up you have only to worry about screwing it up while an employer really doesn't care how much fudge you put on your resume glaring mistakes as improper spelling punctuation or other if the resume is difficult to read it will really start you off on the wrong foot along with the resume is the cover letter again there are many books out there but generally it should not go over one page and it should convincingly convey to your employer that you are qualified and able to do the job excellently and you are very personally interested in the job and would love to get it in the interview you should convey these same points again a resume and cover letter are generally memorable to an employer only if they are particularly bad no matter what is written down on a sheet of paper the interview is for all the marbles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Plame affair Goodness and value theory Black hole Killian documents Unemployment Deconstruction Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Appeal Sydney Riot of 1879 Social rule Economic inequality Milton H.
