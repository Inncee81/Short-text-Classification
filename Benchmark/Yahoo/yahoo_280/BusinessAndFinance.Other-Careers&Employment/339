interview advice background in i was an intern for this nonprofit organization now they are hiring for the same position i was interning and after completing mock projects for them the chances of an interview are high my mentor is the head of the hiring staff so i am feeling good about the interview i'm not giving my hopes up but i'm proud of the work i put in for them now i have a year old and was still in college at the time i had to spend nearly weeks in the hospital yet i still went on to finish that semester hours with a and graduated in years c um laude as great as this job is it comes at an awkward time i'm months pregnant i applied for this job mainly because we have nothing to lose and you never know what could happen now i'm preparing questions and such but i need advice how do i approach the pregnancy what general advice could you give me continued i'm not looking to take maternity leave mainly because i'm not given that right by law as i would be newly employed in an organization with employees should i speak about going to work weeks after the baby is born which is what i did while i was in school should i explain that we already have childcare lined up interviewing is not my strong point in fact it's a major weakness good questions i think in the end honesty always pays off they can not discriminate against you for being pregnant but they can find another reason not to hire you you have worked with them in the past and that could be in your favor let them know your plans about your last pregnancy and that you do plan to return to work shortly after baby is born and daycare is already set up let them know that you believe you are the best candidate for this position and that you are eager to learn and give your best be confident but not over confident most of all be yourself and be honest good luck and i do hope that you get the job Pregnancy Graduate school Breastfeeding Social rule Childbirth New York Giants Knots Landing Abortion debate Days of our Lives Affirmative action Karl Rove Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Psoriasis Day care Sharon Tate Plame affair United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Melanie Wilkes EastEnders Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Fertility awareness Abortion Employment Unemployment Poker jargon Avenue Q Neighbours Kasparov versus The World Charmed Professor Moe Berg Boston Public The Apprentice 2 candidates Everwood Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Lawyer Incarnations of Immortality Pitaten Doomsday argument Juris Doctor Alex Ferguson Paralegal The Apprentice 2 Charter school Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 Roe v.
