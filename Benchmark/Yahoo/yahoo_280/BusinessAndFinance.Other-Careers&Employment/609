how do i build good connections to very imnportant people in the community and state i realize that three fourths of success is one hundred percent connections if that even reasons as such i was wanting to ask anyone out there who might be knowledgeable in regards to building up connections amongst people in short i am a young college student who has a burning desire to be more successful than everyone else it is a nature in me that will not accept to be anything less than absolutely the best at what i do no matter what that is i also know though that i have not a clue how to get to know the people at the top in order to build a network of people that i can use in the future so how does a young relatively unnoticed and unimportant college student meet people whom he has absolutely no chance of meeting under normal everyday circumstances what can i do to get my name out there so that people will remember me when i go knocking on the door of opportunity upon graduation thanks for your help communicate you have to start by getting involved in your community functions etc right now many states and cities are in the process of voting get involved in someone's campaign volunteer for activities or something that you might be able to do phone calling is a great way to be recognized if you are in college check with the student message boards there are always activities going on whatever your major is law economics education etc you should have a mentor or advisor who can help you if you have not committed to a fraternity or other organization you might do that go to the parties and meet people one of the most important things you should know is that 'you have to have something that others are interested in what is your commodity what are you selling example when i first moved to this town from la i found the best way to expose myself musically and get involved with projects was to let people know i could sing once i was invited to dinner at a very nice place and there just happened to be a baby grand piano near the rear nobody was playing it and people were having dinner i sat and began to play some nice jazzy music and sang a couple of oldies blue moon i'll get by and before i knew it people were putting money in the huge brandy sniffer on the piano and asking for requests before the night was over i was singing respect and had made before i walked out and had a contract for the next month to sing at the dinner hour it's all about getting out there and stepping into a situation and being ready you do have to 'come ' with something in order to 'get' something so don't say you are unimportant you have not been noticed yet just like i wasn't use the gifts that god gave you they are there waiting to be exposed go for it and good luck Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule Plame affair Jon Secada Microeconomics Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Education in the United States Past teachings of Prem Rawat Poker jargon Current teachings of Prem Rawat Contract Delta Tau Delta Infantilism Friends Theory of conduct Barrister Time Out of Mind The Star Wars Holiday Special AFI 100 Years series Humphrey Bogart Education in the People's Republic of China North-American Interfraternity Conference She Loves You Hillary Rodham Clinton Milton H.
