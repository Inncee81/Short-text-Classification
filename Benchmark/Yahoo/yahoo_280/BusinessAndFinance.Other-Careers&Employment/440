brother needs a job my much older brother still lives at home with us because he's physically handicapped he's had job coaches from some company try to help find him a job by taking him out and filling out applications an older company that did a much better job has moved their practice and we are stuck with a new company that hasn't done anything with my brother i think he should take the matter of finding a job into his own hands any suggestions about where he could work p s he has cp and he can't read or write very well but other than that he's a pretty normal and social person also places like walmart big lots k mart lowes he's applied to them all and none of them will hire him because he's a liability if he hurts himself on the job they don't want a court case on their hands he could try applying for janitorial work at a school or hospital many places hire handicapped people to work the night shift cleaning i work at a medical college and all the cleaning people have to do is remove trash your brother could do that try local green houses or lawn care people he could probably take care of weeding and picking up brush also try local animal shelters these places always need extra hands to clean out the cages try the humane dept or possibly a pet store he'll get to be around animals which is always enjoyable perhaps he could apply as a bagger at a grocery store this type of job seems to be within his capablities try a smaller mom and pop's type of store because they may be more understanding hope one of these ideas helps Wal-Mart Hamster Social rule Professional wrestling match types Computer Unemployment Theory of conduct Software engineering Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Floppy disk Japanese tea ceremony Domestic rabbit Kashrut Fancy rat Chiropractic The Apprentice 2 Kodocha Freeters Pitaten Bulk vending Tooth Abortion debate Surveillance Infantilism Poker jargon Garfield Textile manufacturing Milton H.
