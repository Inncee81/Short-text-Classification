why didnt i get the job so there was a new target branch opening locally my credentials were ok even tho i didnt have much retail experience the interview was complete bs the questions were annoying and painfully general and i had to give generic answers apparently i didnt get in was it because i said i could do part time only they asked me about full time committment about twice it had to do with your availability that's funny because target stores are always requesting part timers for evenings and weekends and hardly ever full time but this may have been the exception remember next time you have an interview regardless of what your availability is turn their boring generic questions with great answers keep in mind attitude is also an important aspect Social rule Jeff Gannon GED Toastmasters International Have I Got News For You You Don't Know Jack Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Quizbowl I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Little Britain Plame affair timeline MTV2 Family Feud Probation officer The nature of God in Western theology Downing Street memo Canadian House of Commons The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Bowling for Columbine Dream Job (Season 2) Social psychology Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Target Corporation Karl Rove Economics Hollywood Squares Heinrich M__ller Education in Portugal Statistical survey The Doctor Dances Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internet Group Management Protocol Creationism Final Fantasy magic Seinfeld RISC Plame affair Psychology Rove Live Halting problem Time Out of Mind Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Cognitive dissonance Milton H.
