can i opt out of sunday working in any job i currently work in retail but am looking for a new job a couple of years ago i chose to opt out of sunday working is this going to be an option wherever i work or is it up to the employer i am looking for a full time job but more like hours a week rather than the hours that i work now this will be dependent upon the agreement you reach with your new employer and the employment contract quite a number of retail outlets require staff to work on a sunday somtimes on a rota i e one sunday per month but others employ staff just for weekends you should really try and apply where you know the business employs weekend staff then you would have a higher chance of avoiding working on sundays good luck hope you find what you are looking for UK Singles Chart Unemployment Labour economics Daylight saving time Sunday shopping Neopets Employment Graduate school Wal-Mart Week Otakon Video game developer 3dfx Unemployment benefit Social Security (United States) ITV National Football League 2000 Australian Grand Prix Divorce Publishing WNNX (FM) Minimum wage Social rule Electronic commerce Major League Baseball television contracts Fasting Conscription Microsoft Computus Plame affair Credit card Non-aggression principle Apple Computer Octopus card Freeters Working time Poker jargon Outsourcing Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Doomsday argument Liturgical year 401(k) Business ethics Tax Education in Germany Retailer Game programming Inflation Sam Walton Coptic calendar NFL on television Military of Switzerland President (game) Gregorian calendar Hebrew calendar FairTax United States Postal Service Eaton's Contract Employment in Hong Kong Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Glastonbury Festival Call centre United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Education in Portugal Baseball Metcard Fertility awareness Hersheypark Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Weekend Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Management Economic inequality International League $ale of the Century Mac OS X Instant-runoff voting London Congestion Charge The Standard Scientology beliefs and practices Full line vending Education in the People's Republic of China Topps Betting (poker) Principal-agent problem Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Target Corporation Diseconomies of scale Extreme Programming Food Stamp Program Transport Workers Union of Australia Division of labour Electronic Arts University of Warwick Apprenticeship MTV2 Auction Delta Goodrem
