cdl walk around is it hard to learn this stuff for the test i start truck driving school in a few weeks to get a cdl b i'm worried about the walk around you have to do before the road test though i'm reading the dmv cdl book and it's freaking me out there's a billion things you have to remember to point out to the tester how the heck did you guys pass this part of the road test please tell me you get to bring some sort of guide to help remember what to check because this seems impossible i hope school helps me out with this because it seems you have to be a mechanic to get a stinking licence anyways for those that have cdl's please let me know the real deal peace i passed it by like one point i just flaked on it the tester was cold and heartless i remember telling one of the instructors later that i felt bad that i only passed it by a point and his response was that a doctor has his degree license on the wall of his her office and you don't know whether he or she was st in the class or st that did make me feel better i suggest you ask as many questions before the test that you need too and do practice runs on it daily and calm down i know that i almost tensed myself out of passing that part of the test lm Software testing Extreme Programming Software engineering Memento (film) Theory of conduct Department of Motor Vehicles Time Out of Mind Graduate school Lawyer GED Stomach cancer The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Social rule Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story God Emperor of Dune Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories A Course In Miracles Martial art Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices Game development The Contender (television series) Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Aikido Year of the Spider Nightmares (Buffy episode) Science The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Prostate cancer Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Education Turing test Lucid dreaming National Kidney Foundation Singapore Driving Little Britain The Shining (film) Milton H.
