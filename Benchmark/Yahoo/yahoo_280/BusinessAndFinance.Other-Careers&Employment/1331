how should i ask for the day off help im currently working for a temp job and note that this friday is my last day i have a job interview for a very promising job this wednesday i originally was just going to call in sick that day but when i came in to work this morning i realized i left the details of my interview on my desk how should i tell my current job that i need wednesday off help honesty is generally your best bet everyone has been on the job hunt before and your supervisor is likely to sympathize you also probably don't need the entire day off see if you can work out an alternative schedule that allows you time for your interview but also ensures that no one at your current job is left in the lurch ultimately though the temp job is wrapping up and you're going to need to be able to eat in the coming weeks don't burn bridges if you can avoid it but do what you need to do to make the interview Fasting Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Ocean's Twelve Paul Is Dead Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Hurricane Katrina timeline Wednesday Good Friday STS-59 Lent Operation Market Garden MTV2 Call centre The Addams Family BBC television drama Liturgical year Monday Night Football Dominical letter Air America Radio Jayson Blair Draw poker Battle of Gettysburg Cindy Sheehan Betting (poker) Mordechai Vanunu WNNX (FM) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Shaggy dog story Little Shop of Horrors Sharon Tate Dan Rather Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Saturday Night Live Compiler optimization Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Rosa Parks Occupation of Iraq timeline USS Vestal (AR-4) Air traffic controller Battles of Lexington and Concord DragonFly BSD Who Shot Mr. Burns?
