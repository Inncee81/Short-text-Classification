help when am i going to stop quitting my jobs i've had three jobs this year calling people to get them to donate blood answer all kinds of calls even for a ministry that had us praying for people and then trying to get them to buy things or make donations calling people on the phone to do surveys about anything from snack cakes to pest control i've had to work crazy hours and i haven't made enough money and right now i'm tired i'm tired of quitting jobs but i know i won't advance or thrive on them i only get them to say i have a job i don't even make enough on them to pay off the stupid credit cards i got in college i want to go back to college but i want to work too recently i had an interview with an airlines company i had phone interviews being a flight attendant could totally change my life i've never made over buck an hour in my lifetime and they get paid over but they have limited hours it would take me away from here but i wouldn't be able to go to school and i don't want to retire at as a flight attendant first issue here you've had jobs and i think you are looking for a career all of your jobs involved phone work and you quit each one i suggest staying far from those positions in the future flight attendent great career i know a few people over at jetblue and they love it i get jealous of them when they talk about it don't expect to rake in the cash because it isn't going to be an incredibly lucrative career but it has so many other benefits for those who love to see new things and meet interesting people and for now that hr is quite an improvement over your hr before returning to college consider if you are just going to college to get a degree and make more money or if there is actually a particular subject discipline that interests you i think it's pretty well known that many people go to college without that specific passion and end up doing something totally unrelated to their degree when they get out of course any degree is better than none but i think you are doing a very good job of weighing your options right now good luck Poker jargon Social rule Life insurance Plame affair Friends Education in Germany Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Capitalism Spice Girls Game show Kodocha Surveillance Knots Landing Insurance Ben Johnson (athlete) United Airlines Flight 93 Annuity Graduate school Health insurance Education in the People's Republic of China Married... with Children Avenue Q Slot machine Internet fraud Delta Air Lines Microeconomics Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Monetary policy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Craps Education in the United States Unemployment Badly Drawn Kitties Marilyn Monroe Wal-Mart Ashton-Tate Steve Jobs Singlish Time Out of Mind Good Morning, Vietnam Cindy Sheehan Credit card EastEnders Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye Professor Hyperinflation Royal Canadian Air Farce Social Security (United States) Something Positive The Smoking Room Taxation in the United States Garth Brooks Tom DeLay Software engineering Eddie August Schneider Great Teacher Onizuka Flat tax Warren Buffett Wheel of Fortune Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jehovah's Witnesses Inflation 1957 World Series Current teachings of Prem Rawat Professional wrestling slang Karl Rove Secretar__a de Inteligencia Monopoly (game) Community college Academia Animal Crossing Milton H.
