would this be too presumptuous for a st interview i applied to a job as teaching assistant in another state the school i applied to indicated that only shortlisted applicants would be notified and i recently received a schedule for a phone interview the interview is next week good sign right i will actually be in that state the following weekend to visit some friends and i was wondering whether it would be ok for me to tell my interviewer that i will be in the area in case they want to give me a nd interview in person would it be too presumptuous to mention it i really want to make a good impression please help i think you should casually mention that you will be visiting a friend there and tell them when i would leave it up to them at that point to schedule another interview Social rule Royal Assent Walt Disney World College Program Professor Unemployment benefit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair The Ashlee Simpson Show Probation officer Education in Germany Graduate school Roswell UFO incident National Football League George W.
