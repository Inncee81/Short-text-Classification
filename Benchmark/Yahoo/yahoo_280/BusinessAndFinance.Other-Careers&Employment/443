i am and about to talk to my boss about me being treated unfairly at my work and i am very nervous as he is a very rude man i never talk about how i feel and usually just do as i'm told today i've had enough of this can anyone please give me some advise as how to go about this i don't want this ending up in a fight thanks thank you to everyone for your help i talked to him and everything is sorted out now the best way is to find a job elsewhere if this is no possible then confortation is inevitable you have to confront him and this will very well end in a fight or your dismissal if however he is a sensible person he will comply believe me that is the best way you are a professional not someones lackey you do not have to put up with it Social rule Fancy Crane Theory of conduct The Smoking Room Little Britain Nico Robin Rosa Parks Mega Man X8 Plame affair Royal Rumble Knots Landing Friends Breath of Fire III W.
