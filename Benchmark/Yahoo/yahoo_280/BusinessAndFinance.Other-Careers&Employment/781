how to dress for interview i have a interview with office max like best buy tomorrow and i wanted to know if it would matter if i just wore jeans and a tshirt because i feel really uncomfortable wearing anything else if u think it would matter what do u think would be best to wear and how should i act in the interview and stuff also does anybody know how much they start sales reps a dress shirt and dress pants are u freaking kidding me this is not a office job simply a retail position i wouldnt were that crap there if i ever got the job so y wear it there to an interview i really dont care how much it impresses them it shouldnt be all about that if i wear a collared shirt should i tuck it in indefinately nothing says i don't care more than wearing jeans and a t shirt to a job interview while for most job interviews it is best to dress to impress in professional attire i e shirt and tie for men at least it's important to just look nice and presentable obviously that is not the kind of atmosphere office max has you could dress professional but it'd be okay to wear a sports shirt with khakis remember you will not be able to wear jeans and t shirts while you're working in the store as to how to act in the interview just stay calm and confident likely questions they may ask will have to do with problem solving the interviewer may ask you about a specific time you helped a customer be satisfied keyword specific also another possible question could be about teamwork like a rewarding teamwork experience if you don't have a real answer you can be hypothetical also use proper grammar and avoid slang altogether as for starting wage i'd think it'd be somewhere around may be fair it's been a long time since i've been in retail but your area may command higher because of higher costs of living or higher minimum wage laws Minimum wage Social aspects of clothing Culture of the United States White-collar worker Black tie Heavy metal fashion Jesuit College Preparatory School Transsexuality Aerial (dance move) Social rule Suit (clothes) Lawyer Cowboy Bob Jones University Labor theory of value The Apprentice 2 Singapore Police Force Theory of conduct Efficiency wages Football (soccer) Warrant Officer Modern Western square dance United States Marine Corps Japanese tea ceremony Swimming pool Economic inequality Air Training Corps Kilt George Costanza Softball Clothing Academia Beavis and Butt-head Trailer Park Boys Kimono Beachwear MC Hammer Paul Is Dead Little Britain Human sexual behavior Skinhead Barrister Sauna Garth Brooks Characters in the Smurfs Wal-Mart Sento David Beckham Unemployment Goodness and value theory Necktie Whose Line Is It Anyway?
