what's the longest youve had to wait for feedback from a job interview i went for an interview five weeks ago this monday and i haven't had any feedback the interview was arranged through an agency who say they haven't heard anything i would tell them to ram it but i really want the job if they didn't like me can't they just say or if they did like me then surely they would want to let me know how long can they do this for did you follow up with an email saying that you where interested in the position after the interview this is very important and a lot of people skip this step you could always call or email them and ask if they made a decision if they did hire someone else be polite and send an email saying that you appreciate the interview and that you would be interested in joining the company in the future if anything becomes available the person they hired may not work out and you might get another shot at the job this is how i got my job it doesn't sound good but you can always try you never know even if you find a job that would be perfect for you and you have an interview that went great do not stop looking for another job until you actually sign the offer letter i learned this the hard way i know it sucks but never get excited about a job until you have the offer letter in your hand Time Out of Mind Plame affair Social rule Make money fast Software engineering The Apprentice 2 New York Giants Internet fraud E-mail Outsourcing Karl Rove Ocean's Twelve Spam (electronic) Advance fee fraud Extreme Programming Dragnet (drama) 2004 Republican National Convention Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban It's All Gone Pete Tong Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Downing Street memo Able Danger Charles Ponzi Sharon Tate Red Ribbon Army Haven (TNG episode) Shaggy dog story Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Call centre Irish language The Inside Michael Garibaldi Major League Baseball television contracts Knots Landing Pitaten Star Wars live-action TV series Rosa Parks MoveOn Cindy Sheehan Electronic amplifier The Price Is Right Little Britain Sin City Unemployment Piccolo Junior Saga Good Times W.
