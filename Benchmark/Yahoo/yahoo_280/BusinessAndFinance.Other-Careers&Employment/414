what can i do if employer will not supply a good reference i am trying to leave my job as i dread going in every day dont particulary get on with the people i work with and get little support in what is a very difficult and demanding job my employer is aware i am trying to leave and i have applied for different posts and am receiving interviews however my employer is not writing favourable references and is concentrating on picking up on faults in my work during a short period when i was suffering domestic abuse and had a close family bereavement i seem to be stuck i would either leave the previous employer contact info out of your resume application and when asked in the interview explain that the previous employer insists on giving a bad reference based on a specific occasion in which you were going through a lot usually interviers will understand and not even try to contact him her if they do at least they are aware that the information that they are receiving might be skewed i would also check with a local emplyoment agency and ask them the same question there doesnt seem like there is much you can do about it other than being upfront and honest with the your interviewer most will understand and your ex employer should stop being such a baby and get over it and respond with a no comment instead of brining out every little weakness you showed while going through a though time good luck and i hope it works out Social rule Plame affair Expert system Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Adoption Probation officer Sydney Riot of 1879 Labour economics Rick Santorum Unemployment Transactional analysis New York Giants Scientology beliefs and practices Poker jargon Inflation The Amazing Race Labor theory of value Drug test Air traffic controller Atomic Kitten Equine conformation Theory of conduct Whose Line Is It Anyway?
