should i give a two week notice or just stop showing up i have been working a part time job for about three months and i have been hoping it will get better for along time but it just keeps getting worse the managers are awful i end up getting fucked over for so many reasons this place is making my life a living hell out of all of the jobs i have ever had this is by far the worst should i give a two week notice or should i just tell my manager to go fuck himself every job i've had i never gave a notice i pretty much stopped coming to work i live in san diego ca and have had great jobs since in ca no employer is allowed by law to tell another company that a certain employee gave a notice they can only confirm the dates of employment this differs in other states so i wouldn't tell your boss to fuck off just tell them you are seeking other opportunities Alex Ferguson Paul W.
