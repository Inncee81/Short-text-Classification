what kind of career i am really lost when it comes to a career at mind i know i may be a little premature to be seriously thinking of something i really want to do for the rest of my life but i guess i'm just not the type of person to plan ahead i really love to solve problems and make up my own way of fixing a problem ha got on my chem teacher's nerve's with that he'd teach the class to do a problem a certain way and i'd solve it going off in another i also love to think and construct anything i thought of aeronautical engineering for awhile because flight interested me but now i'm not really sure it's probably something i can only help myself with but i figured it would be worth a shot asking here if anyone could please suggest any type of career worth looking in to i'm all ears thanks it seems you have an analytical mind you can go for sciences but thenmost of the jobs in sciences are research related you can go for engineering because its a vast field and changing from one to another is simple also you have diversed career choices available at the end of it Josip Plemelj Scientific method Dynamical system Computer Expert system Computer and video game genres Philosophy Simulation Engineering Logic Mathematics National Aeronautics and Space Administration Philosophy of language Philosophy of mathematics Education in the People's Republic of China Homeschooling Psychology Ludwig Wittgenstein Neuro-linguistic programming Computer science Epistemology W.
