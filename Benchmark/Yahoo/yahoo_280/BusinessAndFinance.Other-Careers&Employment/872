working in retail i'm going to be hunting for my first job soon to start a collection of money for a down payment on my first car i'd work anywhere but retail seems most appealing i've worked at my uncle's shoe store for a little bit and i know it's quite a demanding job and that even if you help a customer for hours they might walk away wanting nothing and since it was working for my uncle i didn't really have to go through an interview he just needed an extra hand and pair of eyes to watch out for people stealing so can anyone tell me what i should be like for an interview at a retail store do i need much experience dress up nicely etc i liked working retail yes i'm a freak but anyway dress to what your selling you'll accumulate lots of whatever you sell as for experience you really don't need much in fact i'd say your ahead of most as for the interview they won't ask you much just if you've ever had a bad customer how would you respond to a certain situation my first three interviews in retail consisted of them basically telling me i had the job so good luck and don't worry about it Unemployment Social rule Denis Law Sears Holdings Corporation Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Electronic commerce Knots Landing The Contender (television series) Milton H.
