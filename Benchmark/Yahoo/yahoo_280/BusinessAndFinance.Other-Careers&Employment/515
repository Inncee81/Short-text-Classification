my wife took a salaried position and now i feel like a single parent suggestions ever since she took the position her employers are abusing her hours keeping her for hour days days off and with no compensation with the hours she is putting in she is making less than her underlings the compnany claims to be in support of a healthy work life balance but of course this seems to be bs i have barely seen my wife for weeks they wouldnt even tell her what she would be making in the new position until after she agreed to take it i know this was not the smartest move but at this point is quitting the only option she asked for a demotion and was told that the company frowns on demotions i want my wife back she works at a car lot and if there are deals in the works they make her stay hours after closing and they say that all the positions below her are filled yes tell your wife to leave that job a job is supposed to enrich a person's family life not destroy it there are millions of good companies and good jobs out there peace and blessings Wal-Mart Poker jargon EastEnders Unemployment benefit Charmed Social rule Friends Internet fraud George Brown, Baron George-Brown Whitney Houston Zhao Yun The Ashlee Simpson Show James T.
