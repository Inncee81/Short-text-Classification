which is better hx for a sinc board or the tgr it's going in my hd module always use the hx modle for a hd effects module because you get less frequency barriers and the load rate is almost twice as much which gives you faster scanning meaning a clearer picture Low-pass filter Aliasing Federal Standard 1037C Atari 8-bit family Low frequency oscillation Transistor Items in the Metroid series Modem RISC Web crawler Bandwidth Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Acorn Electron Digital audio broadcasting DDR2 SDRAM Early IBM disk storage Universal Century Technology Refractive index Alternating current VHS Anti-aliasing CDC 6600 Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing DDR SDRAM Radar Computer virus Broadcast television system Optical coherence tomography Analog-to-digital converter Original Amiga chipset Electronic amplifier Variable Frequency Drive PAL Bluetooth Modelocking Ultra wideband Frequency modulation Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire Commodore 64 Athlon Synthesizer ATSC Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line TV-FM DX CPU design Pulse-width modulation Apollo Guidance Computer X10 (industry standard) Ring modulation Speed of light Interlace NTSC Nuclear magnetic resonance Automatic number plate recognition Television Sound Blaster Phasing Compact disc Digital photography MIM-23 Hawk Atomic force microscope Digital Subscriber Line Metroid Prime 2: Echoes High-voltage direct current Oscilloscope Persistence of vision Radio Cathode ray tube Nintendo GameCube S__CAM Amplitude modulation Diffraction Cray-1 Piezoelectricity Phonograph Global System for Mobile Communications Audio timescale-pitch modification IEEE 802.11 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Nanotechnology Solar cell Moir__ pattern Balassa-Samuelson effect Sega CD Python programming language Upper Memory Area Apollo Command/Service Module Human brain Dispersion (optics) Fax MIPS architecture Compression artifact Front side bus Helical scan Cellular network ZigBee Heat Programmable logic controller Composite video
