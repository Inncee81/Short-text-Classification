harman kardon avr connection to subwoofer i just got a harman kardon avr everything was ok until i got to the subwoofer connection the avr has speaker connections for the center left right left surround and right surround but for the subwoofer connection it has what looks like a purple component connection its completely different that the other outputs from the receiver the polk subwoofer i have is expecting the same connection as the other speakers am i missing something please help that purple connection is a standard line level subwoofer output this is the best way to hook up your sub you will probably have to tell the receiver in its menu to send this signal to the sub your polk sub almost certainly has a line level input if it only has speaker level inputs just send the speaker wire to the sub first the sub should then have speaker level outputs that pass on the signal to the main l r speakers this connection usually passes the signal through a crossover if you want to avoid this you can send the signal to the sub from the speakers output on the receiver Loudspeaker Electronic amplifier SCART Power Mac G4 Cube Operational amplifier Oscilloscope Surround sound Bose Corporation Jack plug Telephone exchange Digital circuit Receiver (radio) Home cinema Low-pass filter Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Impedance matching Switch Central processing unit Transformer Color TRS connector Sound Blaster Audio crossover Input impedance Netfilter/iptables Teleprinter Nominal impedance Mixing console Electrophysiology Computer Pebble bed reactor Sound reinforcement system Programmable logic controller Car audio Speech recognition Morse Code TGV Xbox Capacitor Circuit design Rail terminology Cerebellum Artificial neural network Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Quadraphonic Electronic filter Atmel AVR DVD Pipeline (Unix) James K.
