which speaker do you recommend boston acoustics or bose for home stereo and electronic musics hi the only way to buy a particular brand of speaker is to listen to as many as you can in your price range before deciding on one a good loudspeaker will reproduce all kinds of music without emphasising any part of its frequency range also the amplifier you use will have some bearing on what you buy as you can see from other answerer's they either love bose or hate boss i would not buy a bose speaker system simply because i don't like the sound colouration i am not familiar with boston acoustics so i can't comment i prefer british loudspeakers which generally have a neutral type of sound so as not to be disappointed buy the speakers which sound good to you irrespective of the brand name Bose Corporation High fidelity Subwoofer Audiophile Bass guitar Headphones Microphone Stereophonic sound Gramophone record Player piano Synthesizer Impedance matching Surround sound Electronic organ Instrument amplifier Home cinema Binaural recording Audio crossover Super Audio CD Receiver (radio) Electrostatic loudspeaker KEF Sound reinforcement system Vowel Decibel Magnetic cartridge Audio feedback Electronic amplifier Hiberno-English Sound recording Organ (music) Radio Esperanto as an international language Acoustics Sound effect Sound Color Audi A2 Amplifier Analog-to-digital converter Amstrad CPC Car audio Jack plug Audio system measurements Effects unit Electric guitar Effects pedal Grateful Dead Equal-loudness contour Modem Pet Sounds MP3 Low-pass filter Sonar Bicycle lighting Piezoelectricity Muddy Waters Herbie Hancock Electronic music DVD Electronic filter Stethoscope Electromagnetic spectrum Australian English Compact audio cassette Walkman Singlish Mixing console Commodore International Ubykh language Harmonic series (music) Medical ultrasonography Double bass High-end audio Stereoscopy Kenwood Electronics English grammar Clarinet Hearing impairment Speech synthesis Magnet Dobro The Pet Sounds Sessions Electronic musical instrument Klipsch Remote control Bluegrass music Panasonic Music radio Audio power Marshall Amplification Roland Corporation Gender-neutral language Leslie speaker Guitar Hearing aid Violin
