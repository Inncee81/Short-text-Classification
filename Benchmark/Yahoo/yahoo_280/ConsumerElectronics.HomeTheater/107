best sound reciever home theater with hdmi pcm i've been looking for a home sound receiver to compliment my ps i'm looking for a sound receiver that is hdmi enable that supports dolby true hd dts hd and uncompressed pcm is there such machine yet also i'm a bit ignorant about receivers so if you could educate me as to what to buy i would appreciate it but if there's anything above it that is worth it i'll go for it as long as its a quality product i want the receiver initially for the ps to enjoy uncompressed pcm games and movies if anyone can help i would appreciate it hi what is your budget there are some very good receivers which support the features you want but they are all priced differently also there are new features coming out all the time it is hard to keep up with the technological changes some of these receivers are so complicated you need a licence to set them up that's why we get a lot of questions about them on answers hdmi can be a problem it is not as simple as people are led to believe ok if you let us know how much you can spend we will give you some suggestions addition information thanks for the e mail one of the best receivers just released is the denon avr ci the specifications are very impressive and it definitely has tru hd dts hd this is what is said about the pcm signal you are after i'm not sure if this is what you want but this is what they say conversion of optical or coaxial digital signals to analog audio outputs for nd and rd rooms pcm only i hope that's what you want i don't use a receiver myself as my sound system is geared for hi fi music reproduction with separate stereo pre and power amps the greatest compromise in a receiver is the use of a single power supply for all three sections the pre amp the power amp and the tuner the needs of the power amp section affect the pre amp section not good the result is receivers no matter how well made and expensive are not as smooth effortless open and full sounding as separate components with their own power supplies one important improvement of this denon is the inclusion of power transformers and power supply circuits as far as i know none of the other popular receivers has this feature it is one huge step forward for a receiver now there is one thing left to do all amplifiers have their own particular sound it is possible to hear differences between them when using the same speakers the difference in sound quality between them is not as pronounced as there is when you listen to different speakers but the differences are there denon is a brand you can trust and i have never heard someone say they do not perform well so there you are mate if the specifications are to your liking i feel you can't go wrong with this model particularly with the extra power suppy etc although the rec ret price is about i have seen it advertised for around here is a link to check it out http www crutchfield com s wojn drb f cgi bin prodview asp i av c edit i have not looked at any other brands yet but if you like i can do that but they wont have the extra power supplies like the denon Loudspeaker MP3 Audiophile Compact disc Dolby Laboratories Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Operational amplifier Movie projector Home cinema Atari ST Television Blu-ray Disc XML MiniDisc High-definition television High fidelity Amstrad CPC Gramophone record PlayStation 3 Super Audio CD Super Nintendo Entertainment System Analog-to-digital converter Musical Instrument Digital Interface 8 mm video format Sound Blaster Bass guitar Kenwood Electronics Subwoofer Atari 8-bit family Electronic amplifier Xbox Modem Phonograph Audio data compression Original Amiga chipset Warez Digital audio C programming language Synthesizer SCART Central processing unit Transformer Enterprise content management High-Definition Multimedia Interface Nintendo 64 Computer Dolby Digital VHS S/PDIF Acorn Computers Pulse-code modulation Digital circuit ZX Spectrum Surround sound Voice over IP Compact audio cassette DVD-Audio CPU cache Video game music Oscilloscope Microphone Camcorder GSM services Visual Basic Federal Standard 1037C PHP Ethernet Electric guitar Telephone Decibel Circuit design NTSC Sound effect IPod Vorbis Impedance matching Social rule Microeconomics Gmail ATI Technologies Inflation Diode Sega CD Cassette deck Teletext
