snow despite having hdcp compliant projector i'm trying to get a rca drc n hdmi upconvert dvd player to work with a planar pr xga dlp video projector i have a small adapter that converts the dvd player's hdmi to the projector's dvi the dvd player's menu and default screen along with dvds i've burnt show up although it seems overexposed via the hdmi dvi configuration i have but when i try to play a commercial dvd i get the anti piracy warning then static snow from my research it seems that this 'snow' results from the display device in this case the projector not having hdcp the projector documentation claims that it features a dvi d digital input with hdcp decryption high bandwidth digital content protection i don't know if this will help but when trying the setup with a lg rc h dvd recorded dvd player w hdmi all i could get was a very poor picture with little color quality and a heavy purple tint what i can i do to resolve this problem turns out that while the planar website says the projector is hdcp compliant it is not if you are using an upconvert dvd player make sure that the output setting is set for i or i not p or p and then set the input planar to also i or i the upscaling material should resynch and your picture will appear to be smooth and clear good luck Television High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection Digital Visual Interface DVD High-Definition Multimedia Interface High-definition television Home cinema Laserdisc Digital cinema Anamorphic widescreen Blu-ray Disc Movie projector PlayStation Portable Compact disc Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting British Sky Broadcasting 1080p Video Graphics Array NTSC IPod Widescreen MP3 S__CAM TeX Mouse (computing) Macromedia Flash Universal Serial Bus Oscilloscope Loudspeaker Copy protection Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows Vista Xbox Warez Video Xbox 360 DLP Liquid crystal display Windows XP Computer display Analog-to-digital converter DVD player DVD-Audio ITunes Gramophone record Nintendo GameCube Liquid crystal display television Nintendo DS Telecine Film Bluetooth Video codec Slide projector Enterprise content management Holography PlayStation 2 Light-emitting diode Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Original Amiga chipset Amstrad CPC Super Nintendo Entertainment System Electronic amplifier Videocassette recorder Computer display standard Federal Standard 1037C TFT LCD Atari ST S-VHS Headlight DVI file format Operational amplifier Modchip ZX Spectrum Cathode ray tube Composite monitor Graphics card H.264/MPEG-4 AVC LCD projector Synthesizer Laptop Nintendo 64 Transformer Technicolor Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Computer Atari 8-bit family Pixel Digital television Apple Macintosh
