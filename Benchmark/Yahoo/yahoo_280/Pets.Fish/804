a question i want to know if u can feed red blood worms to salwater fish more convincing answers i keep both fresh and saltwater tanks although my freshwater fish love them i haven't had any saltwater fish that have shown nearly the same amount of enthusiasm for eating them i've seen bloodworms suggested as food for saltwater fish but since they're the freshwater larval form of a terrestrial insect they can be found in almost any lake pond stream or river i'm not sure that most saltwater fish recognize that these are even food that said it would be possible to feed them to the fish i just can't say with any certainty that the fish will eat them they wouldn't be harmful as an occasional treat but they shouldn't be used as a sole food i always prefer to give my saltwater fish a basic diet of flakes or pellets but any frozen live foods i give i try to match with the environment where the fish would naturally be found so for saltwater fish i would give mine enriched brine shrimp plankton krill clams etc based on the size of the fish Marine aquarium Shrimp farm Salmon Krill Fly fishing Fish farming Striped bass Zebra Danio Halfbeak Axolotl Sockeye salmon Clownfish Fauna of Australia Seabird Fishing Water (molecule) Discus (fish) Plankton Vegetarianism Goldfish Angling Antarctic krill Fish Mussel Tilapia Crayfish Lake Eutrophication Tlingit Dwarf gourami Sea-Monkey Brine shrimp Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Blackfish Sodium chloride Hamster Murray Cod Lamprey Tetrapod Roman eating and drinking Aquaculture Aztec Anchovy Bioluminescence Cantonese cuisine Freshwater angelfish Crocodile Snail Desert Ecology Jellyfish Water resources Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Chlorophyta Bengali cuisine Taboo food and drink Octopus Albatross Smelt Earthworm Sawfish (fish) Shrimp Domestic rabbit Florida Living fossil Killifish Chinook salmon Dead Sea Mazon Creek fossils Nerpa Osmosis Cheese Cuisine of Denmark Gar Lobster German cuisine Russian cuisine Animal New York SuperCroc Annelid Japanese cuisine Copepod Tofu Chicken Kashrut Brook trout Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Cuisine of Malaysia Fish and chips Omega-3 fatty acid Macquarie Perch Aquifer Fugu Wisconsin glaciation Seafood
