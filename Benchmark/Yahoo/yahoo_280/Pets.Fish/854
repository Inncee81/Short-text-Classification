my fish bowl is getting cloudy and smelly just days after cleaning it what should i do i have a betta fish in a fish bowl and i have just cleaned his water days ago the water is becoming smelly and cloudy and i don't know what to do i use tap water that i let sit for a few days and i also use a conditioner for the water also he hasn't been moving as much is this a sign of sickness or just near death unfortunately bowls aren't the best homes for bettas despite the myths floating around if the water is getting cloudy you're probably feeding too much also if you're feeding flakes i suggest switching to pellets the reason bowls aren't great is because they don't really live in puddles or muddy footprints they live in rice paddies and slow moving streams in east asia so the small environment bowls provide is pointless bettas don't feel more comfortable in small spaces also the temp where they naturally live is about f and i'm willing to be you don't keep your ac at f it's nearly impossible to heat bowls so really the smallest they should be in is a gallon tank with a small filter and a watt heater watt for gallons and watt for gallons so it's very likely the poor water conditions and the cold are getting to your betta and might eventually lead to him getting sick instead of just being lethargic good luck if you have any other questions feel free to email me or check out the link in my profile Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Marine aquarium Aquarium Autonomous building Brewery Carburetor Hydrogen economy Solar power Rice HVAC Goldfish Fish farming E85 Renewable energy Coffee Shrimp farm Thermostat Air conditioning Sewage treatment Tilapia Wind power Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Upholstery Bong Nuclear reactor Drowning Thermal power station Climate of the United Kingdom Water Biodiesel Environmental vegetarianism Sea-Monkey Axolotl Water heater Customs and etiquette of Japan Dishwasher Alcohol fuel Dwarf gourami Fire extinguisher Mars Exploration Rover Japanese toilet Chopsticks Fossil fuel power plant Japanese tea ceremony Sake Elephant Fire fighting Cruising (maritime) Dairy Cannabis cultivation Hydropower Phase (matter) Hyperthermia Galileo spacecraft Domestic rabbit Gmail Diesel engine Rail terminology Apollo 13 Great Lakes Hamster Ocean thermal energy conversion Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Temperature Beer Southeast Asia Sun Vacuum cleaner Weather lore Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Transformer Wine making Kannur district Alan Watts Desert Potomac River Quicksort Terraforming Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Energy development Elis Prefecture Opportunity rover Dialysis The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Louisiana Superdome Yacht Tea Dry cleaning Whale Domestic water system Tlingit Pasadena, California Porridge Deluge (mythology) San Francisco 49ers High-definition television Water (molecule) Heat Wall Street Aluminium
