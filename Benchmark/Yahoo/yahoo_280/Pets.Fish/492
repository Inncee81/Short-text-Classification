what's the most popular breed of betta what's the hardest breed of betta to find what's usually most likely breed to be sold at petsmart i have gotten all my betta girls there i refuse to get walmart fish and would like to know what breed my girls are one of my girls have a non smooth edge on her fins and tail kind of spikey but i know she's not a crowndail cuz it's not that pronounced at all her bottom fin is quite curved in vs drooping down is she a delta my other girls have beautifully long finage for being girls yes they're girls this i know the bottom fin hangs low coming to a point and their tails are not half moon or anything fancy like that just longish compared to the other female would these possibly be super deltas what do you think any genuine betta breeders out there know what i'm talking about i love my girls they're the highlight of my community tank but i am curious to know what they are and why they look different thanks again for your help guys o actually i think i've got one now that i've found a decent site with pics of cambodians she's got a whiteish body gets darker as she gets older with beautiful deep red fins i call her bloody mary for good reason she's one i feel may be a super delta with the long finniage thanks nicole i had found that page just before i posted this question a day late and a dollar short but a great site to help identify chris you may be right now that i think about it but that doesn't explain my short finned female she's my oddball out of the group of girls she's the one i'm most curious to identify please send me apic via email and i will begld totellya but petsmart usually only sells vts and cts i did pick up a ctf from petsmart but usually vts chances are that they are all vts the hardest tail to find is a ohm over halfmoon that is over degrees in spread but in petstores deltas doubles super deltas hms ddr cts shorts are rare in petstores because they dont tend to sell as well in a lfs than a cheaper vt deltas have straight tail rays so most females sold at lfs are not deltas if they are really long they are vts that what a vt is long and non straight rays my betta site has the tail shapes http www bcaquatics com edit to the first post shame cambodian is a color form not a tail shape and cambodians are by far one of the most common colors in petstores edit petsmart is common for having the bettas i believe your talking about it has a purplish body and orange redish fins those are popular at petsmart but i dont believe it is a color combo that is reconized by the ibc but still a great fish superdeltas are based on fin legnth superdeltas have their tail spread from to a straight tailrays like a delta edit short finned females are what i consider vts true short tail females like plakat females arent colored like petsmart bettas and have different faceal characteristics but i do have some vt girls from petsmart that are short in fins but i refer to them as vts Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Equine conformation Dog Poker jargon Gray Wolf Knife Skateboarding trick Humpback Whale Strap-on dildo Jon Secada Yu-Gi-Oh!
