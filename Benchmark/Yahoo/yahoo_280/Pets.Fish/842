where can i get this license where can i get a usda approved fish breeding license and are they expenisive also do i realy need one to sell fish to the petstore i think it's going to depend on the stores policy if they are willing to buy from you for starters if you have talked to them and they agree they'd try then you'll want to look up your local and state laws for any particular fish you want to breed and sell long before you go looking at federal regulations usda sounds to me like consumption fish food and tropical home owned fish i highly doubt would fall into this catagory you could probably get better guidance and assistance contacting your local wildlife agency i think they would be in better position to advise you jv United States Department of Agriculture Organic food Hunting Milk Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Common Fisheries Policy Pet skunk Agriculture Genetically modified food Taxation in the United States Organic certification Fugu Livestock Food Stamp Program Economy of the United States Nutrition Seabird Motion picture rating system Real estate broker Legal issues of cannabis Social work Vegetarianism Cable television Biodiversity Beef Ketchup Alcoholic beverage Shrimp farm Tilapia Macquarie Perch Prohibition Magistrate European Union Free trade Economy of India Dairy Fish and chips Agriculture in Australia US and Canadian license plates Federal government of the United States Medical prescription Gray Wolf Administrative law of the United States Life insurance Work of the United States Government Environmental Protection Agency Controlled Substances Act Intellectual property Alcohol fuel Code of Federal Regulations Government of Maryland Software license Mount Sinai, New York WWOR-TV Sodium chloride KCAL-TV Insulin Systembolaget Windows XP Jamaica Bay Salmon Independent agencies of the United States government Maryland Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Economy of Chile Government of India Vehicle registration plate Cabela's Biodiesel Food and Drug Administration Daylight saving time Gun politics in the United States Capitalism Roman eating and drinking Nintendo Pornography United States Department of State Environment Agency Economy of Suriname Externality Media in Hong Kong Fox hunting Federal Reserve Animal Crossing Ann Veneman Albatross Chicken AT&T Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Taboo food and drink Illegal drug trade Bird migration Fish farming Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Medical cannabis Kashrut
