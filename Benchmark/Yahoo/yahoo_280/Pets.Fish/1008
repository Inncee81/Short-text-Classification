whats the best environment to set up for a salamanda walking fish what do they eat and do they have to stay in a certain temperature range are you talking about a salamander or a mudskipper if you are speaking of a mudskipper than you can feed them frozen brine frozen blood worms pellet food and clams if you want they do get fairly large almost inches for some species while other can get almost a foot long so you should have a decent size tank they can drown so they need to be able to pop thier heads out of the water you should also have a lid on top of the tank they are just as good of escape artists as eels you also should have really smooth sandy bottom thats alsmost muddy and have some sort of smooth rockwork or drifywoof maybe that is over the waterline to enable them to pop out of the water hope this helps and good luck they are really cool pets if cared for properly Axolotl Goldfish Sea-Monkey Fish farming Clownfish Goby Food preservation Autonomous building Kosher foods Hamster Guinea pig Fishing Discus (fish) Shrimp farm Angling Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Tofu Atlantic Ocean Sea ice Brewery Desert Dog Refrigerator Tilapia Shark Pikmin Nile crocodile Thermoregulation Thermal power station Domestic rabbit Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Water (molecule) Solar power Lobster Japanese tea ceremony Vermicompost Blood (computer game) Gar Ice cream Warm-blooded Zebra Danio Shotgun Freshwater angelfish Hiking Myxobolus cerebralis Aquarium Teen Girl Squad Hydrogen economy Fancy rat Nerpa Swimming pool Carbon dioxide American Alligator Salmon Trawling Striped bass Meat Octopus Animal Crayfish Happy Tree Friends Taboo food and drink Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Marine aquarium Fish Brine shrimp Bird migration Chesapeake Bay Pachypodium ambongense Anchor Diving suit Ren and Stimpy Severe weather terminology (United States) Tlingit Sewage treatment Customs and etiquette of Japan Minor Harry Potter Beasts Death Valley National Park Camp Lazlo Aerial (dance move) Chicken Marine biology Brachiopod Glossary of firefighting equipment Hemp Sodium chloride Lake Burley Griffin Sonar Trophic level Knife Plastic Sushi Ecology Salamander Cuisine of Denmark Houseplant Creatures in Bionicle Punt (boat) Clown loach
