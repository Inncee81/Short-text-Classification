my goldfish have ick and i don't feel comfortable using the salt treatment i just bought goldfish the other day all of which were fine except one which had a fish lice on it which i removed and treated now i'm noticing ick developing and it might be from the change of tanks but i'm sure it's from the stress of the parasite i looked online and found out that the ick treatment i bought for my last goldfish only kills what's fallen to the tank not what's on them i don't want my fish to die again i read about the salt treatment where you dilute and put teaspoons of salt per every gallon and as an example they said that would be tspns for gallons what i have they say it's a treatment for goldfish but this doesn't sound right i don't want to kill my fish by adding salt to their water but i don't want them to die of ick either i need confirmation that the salt treatment is safe for goldfish that just seems like a lot of salt to put in gallons source http thegab org articles ichsalttreatment html you could do a few thing to fight ich the easiest method would be to buy white spot medication an dose as instructed make sure that it's filter friendly the other is to use add a concentration of salt g per litre fishes have to be keep in this concentration until the white spots symptom disappears this concentration will not cause problem for the goldfishes lastly you could slowly increase the temperature of the tank to degrees c and keep it there for a week at this temperature the reproduction of the ich parasite will halt large water change on alternate days will also disrupt the ich reproduction cycle as you will be removing large amount of tomont and theronts different stages of the parasite during the water change this will reduce the parasites within the system for you to manage Sewage treatment Goldfish Water purification Fish farming Marine aquarium Brewery Aquarium Diseases of the honeybee Bipolar disorder Thermal power station Biodiesel Decompression sickness Diarrhea Cancer Clinical depression Myxobolus cerebralis Ich Hyperthermia Common cold Sleeping sickness Fire fighting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Electrophysiology Hydrogen economy Antidepressant Hydrogen peroxide Concentration Ecology Nuclear power Atherosclerosis Autonomous building E85 Environmental concerns with electricity generation Fugu Caffeine Psoriasis Stomach cancer Foodborne illness Corrosion Insulin Cyanide Shark Coffee Hard water Fire extinguisher Intravenous therapy Hypertension Sodium chloride Asthma AIDS Shrimp farm Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Eutrophication Vitamin C Microeconomics Dairy Allergy Cannabis (drug) Palliative care Dry cleaning Ammonia Urinary incontinence Stuttering Nuclear fallout DDT Mouth ulcer Anorexia nervosa First aid Schistosomiasis Energy development Paracetamol Tank Diazepam Discus (fish) Rabies Common Unix Printing System Dialysis Medicine Lithium salt Fossil fuel power plant Cannabis cultivation Chronic fatigue syndrome Cephalic disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Menstrual cycle Rocky Mountain spotted fever Hard disk Sigmund Freud Cirrhosis Rebreather Hormone replacement therapy (trans)
