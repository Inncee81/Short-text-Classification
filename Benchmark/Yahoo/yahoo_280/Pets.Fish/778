hospital tank for female bettas hi i currently have a vacant gallon with an undergravel filter and a heater so the water stays around f with it in it i also have a gallon with female bettas so my question is if one of the girls are to get sick can i use the one gallon as a hospital tank thanks if all got it or if it was a really common easy to treat disease like ich ten i would treat the whole gallon i am talking about if one gets dropsy or something to prevent them from spreading the illness and saving me from spending x as much money on the good meds like maracyn tc or something you can use the one gallon tank as a hospital tank however it may be better to have something slighty larger than the one gallon if one of the bettas get sick most likely so will others many fish diseases are highly contagious one gallon would not allow for the treatment of more than one or two fish at a time i would look for at least a gallon tank it is still good to have the one gallon for an emergency though addition note treating the main tank is not a good idea as many medications can kill off your good bacteria and you will need to recycle the tank this can be as harmfull as the illness itself Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Marine aquarium Pneumonia Medicine Common cold Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sewage treatment Health insurance Tuberculosis Psychiatric hospital Autonomous building Fish farming Aquarium Legionellosis Fossil fuel power plant Disease Ebola Traditional Chinese medicine Water purification Publicly funded medicine Dairy Psychiatry Fire fighting Foodborne illness Clostridium difficile Sexually-transmitted infection Homeopathy Biodiesel Sleeping sickness Cruising (maritime) Prostate cancer Anorexia nervosa Virus Malaria Escherichia coli O157:H7 American Red Cross 2001 anthrax attacks H5N1 Hygiene Decompression sickness Reef tank Stomach cancer Diarrhea Biological warfare Sea-Monkey Duesberg hypothesis Bipolar disorder Quarantine Hospital Dysentery Anti-psychiatry Chronic fatigue syndrome Anthrax Brewery Pharmaceutical company Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Smallpox E85 Shrimp farm Charles Darwin's illness Chlamydophila pneumoniae Chiropractic Asthma Goldfish Gasoline Milk Bottled water Alcoholism Atherosclerosis Combat stress reaction Scouting Antiviral drug Rabies Influenza Alcohol fuel Migraine Sickle-cell disease Apollo 13 NEWater Emergency Medical Services Drowning Health care in the United States Blood Sigmund Freud Vitamin C Hepatitis C Medicare (Canada) USS Yorktown (CV-5) Conjunctivitis Canine parvovirus Omega-3 fatty acid Axolotl Alternative medicine Water heater Intravenous therapy Bacteria Growth hormone treatment AIDS reappraisal
