what are some cool tropical fish for a gallons tank i just bought a gallon fish tank and want to start with some tropical fish but have no idea about fish what are some cool fish that arent too expensive that would be good if you just bought your tank don't put fish in it right away or you are going to be buying more fish very soon your tank has to cycle which basically means it needs to get the good bacteria that keep the ammonia and other chemicals right in the tank this can take up to a month you can hurry it along a little by getting some inexpensive starter fish for your tank but don't put expensive fish in there until the process is done rule of thumb you only want to have as many fish in full size inches as the tank stay away from the cute little pleco's and do some checking to see how large your fish are going to be full grown some fish get to be over a foot long unless you only want one or two fish in your tank stay away from larger growing fish also aggressive fish tend to kill down a tank pretty quickly that beautiful cichlid oscar jack dempseys texas cichlids etc will get big and they do not share their space well at all fish can be just as much work as a dog sometimes they can also be very rewarding just make sure you know what you are getting into and do your research you will be glad you did Tilapia Marine aquarium Hydrogen economy Poker jargon Autonomous building Discus (fish) Oscar (fish) Cruising (maritime) Cichlid Dairy Advanced Squad Leader Aquarium Fish farming Fossil fuel power plant Brewery Sewage treatment Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Jack Dempsey (fish) Fugu Thermal power station Sea-Monkey Wine making Hamster Goldfish Tank classification Dry cleaning Carbon dioxide Drill bit Solar power RISC Biodiesel CPU design Paintball Ozone depletion Gas turbine Ocean thermal energy conversion P-38 Lightning Swimming pool Toyota Prius O scale Cloud Social rule Ozone hole Mach kernel Tank locomotive Houseplant Cannabis cultivation Fire fighting Biodiversity Hash table Knife Terran (StarCraft) Messerschmitt Bf 109 Saturn V Yacht Marine biology Diesel engine Sake Biology Welding Milk Reef tank Pebble bed reactor Transformer Nuclear power Origin of life Microeconomics Sexual selection Plastic Hurricane Frances Tiger I Mutual fund Cyanide RuneScape quests Livestock El Ni__o Ammonia Dog training EVE Online Dog agility Fire extinguisher Crocodile Cryonics Axolotl Fishing Milton H.
