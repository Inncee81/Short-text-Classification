one of my neons died in just days i got fish last sunday i got male long tailed guppies and neons one of the neons dies like days l er after i got her because the tale was gone oen fo them must of attack her and got the tale off but the question i wanna no is which fish did it one of the guppies or the other neon would the neon tale grow back if it was half of the tail i took her out of the tank for the nite to avoid any further damage but she died and i flushed her down the toilet would she of survived if it was only half of the tail or died anyway which fish do u think would of done it o and here's the fish by the way and yes this is me talking feel free to comment if u like http www youtube com watch v d ydxeoibi most likely one of your guppies bit your neon because neons are community fish and rarely are aggressive and your neon probably would of died from tail rot soon after unless you treated the tank with tetracycline but since it's such a small fish there more susceptible to infection and disease you did the best you could do in such a short amount of time i reccomend watching your fish's behavior much more closely especially your guppies and separate the aggressive ones i hope you'll have better luck with your fish Sea-Monkey Poker jargon Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Hamster Rabies Myxobolus cerebralis Gray Wolf Cat Clownfish Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pocket cruiser USS Tunny (SS-282) House Mouse Urinary incontinence Chicken Phishing Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Autonomous building Sewage treatment Gar Japanese toilet Neon tetra Traumatic brain injury Prostate cancer Acne Orca American Alligator Xenogears Stomach cancer Dog Unreal USS Threadfin (SS-410) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Flush toilet Coeliac disease Shrimp farm RuneScape locations Parthenogenesis The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Multiple sclerosis Conker's Bad Fur Day Gaia Online Fugu Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Goanna Tocopherol Rosacea Battle of France Animal communication Tasmanian Devil Social rule Tampon Malaria Bat Felix the Cat Dwarf gourami Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Atherosclerosis Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Sperm Whale Lyme disease Platypus Neon HyperText Transfer Protocol Neon Genesis Evangelion Biology Rocky Mountain spotted fever Sexual selection Ulcerative colitis Biological warfare Transformer Tooth enamel AIDS Cephalic disorder Fancy rat Gay slang Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Herpes simplex virus American lobster Mega Man X3 USS Thresher (SS-200) Lung cancer Axolotl Toilet Nile crocodile Insulin Toxoplasmosis Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Neon lamp USS Atule (SS-403) Sesshomaru Helicopter STS-51-L Psoriasis Tsetse fly Gypsy moth Foodborne illness Adult Swim Capercaillie
