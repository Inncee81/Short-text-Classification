betta can't eat i just got a male betta last night and he's been trying to eat the pellets but he keeps spitting them back out they seem like they are too hard or something for him is he getting any food off of the pellet even though he's spitting them back out it's not like he doesn't like them he rushes up to them and try's really hard to eat it please help thanks he is also acting lethargic and then swimming fast and then rushing into walls i'm kinda worried thanks i have a gallon tank you're exactly right they are a bit hard and he's just trying to soften them a bit try soaking them in a little water for few minutes before you feed him and that should help as for the rest he's probably just adjusting to his new home and will settle down before long at all mm Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goldfish Piccolo Junior Saga Kitchen Natural Selection (computer game) Spider Bladderwort Nerpa Unreal E85 Chinese food therapy Carbon dioxide Dishwasher Brewery Clownfish Fecal incontinence Domestic rabbit Drill bit Hard water Mattress The Legend of Zelda series enemies Tlingit Swimming pool Blood (computer game) Rush (band) Sodium hydroxide Rice Tooth Swimming Dwarf gourami Shark Nuclear reactor USS Indianapolis (CA-35) American lobster GunZ The Duel Water purification Freshwater angelfish Operation Market Garden Ron and Fez Antarctic krill Shrimp farm Fish farming Comanche Giant Panda Fasting Sketch comedy Tilapia Hip hop collaborations Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Elephant Halfbeak Paint Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
