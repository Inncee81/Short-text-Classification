questions about my leapard ctenopomas how do you like them if u have them are they intersting to watch in atank i have only read about them how much should i feed my pair they are only babys about inches im gonna go with brine shrimp to start okay acually will they disturb my pair of butterfly fish ans will my neopns be eatin i bought a pair tagged as spotted climbing perch and found they were a pair of leopard ctenopoma they weren't very interesting as they would tend to hide in the bunches of aponogetons and 'lay in wait' which i found out was part of their hunting behaviour in the wild they are 'semi aggressive' and were aggressive toward some of my upside down catfish so i eventually had to sell them as for feeding you can try a trick i use for my tetras and their various foods i feed them freeze dried bloodworms twice a week so i mix a small amount in a cup half filled with tank water and allow it to sit for a few moments then dump it all in freeze dried foods tend to float but this way most of it will at least stay suspended in mid water range for enough time that the pair geta few mouthfuls and follow it to the surface these fish are carnivores so you should stick with carnivorous pellets krill bloodworms and other food marketed for carnivorous fish only a pinch every day will do until they reach adult size at about inches your tetras will clean up after the pair as tetras are omnivorous but this might also trigger aggressive behaviour as long as the neons don't fit in the leopard ctenopoma's mouths they won't be eaten but they may be harassed you should have a densely planted tank or at least half of the tank planted very well which will curb some of the aggressiveness until the leopard ctenopoma's get bigger than the neons at which time you might have to move one or the other into another tank as for butterflyfish i assume you mean the african butterflyfish they are also semi aggressive so i wouldn't recommend putting the two species together when the leopard ctenopoma get bigger and a little more belligerent everything should be treated on a case by case basis because there are exceptions to any rule you may end up with a harmonious tank but leopard's and butterfly's also have two different tank requirements leopard's like dense vegetation and butterfly's perfer open water like tetra's Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sea-Monkey Krill Axolotl Discus (fish) Leopard Spider Shrimp farm Antarctic krill Tilapia Clownfish Cat Carnivore Tooth Fishing Tofu Seabird Poker jargon Fauna of Australia Cheetah Dog Bladderwort Salmon Fancy rat Insect Brown Bear Carnivorous plant Domestic rabbit Albatross Goldfish Frog Halfbeak Butterflyfish Kosher foods Danio Guinea pig Platypus Minor Harry Potter Beasts Gar American lobster Ecology Zebra Danio Moorish Idol Vegetarianism Coconut crab Nerpa Carburetor Blue Whale Tasmanian Devil Water (molecule) Internal ballistics Sewage treatment Beetle Autonomous building Livestock Thermal power station Neon tetra Mountain Gorilla Gray Wolf Tyrannosaurus rex Puma Elephant Vermicompost Trophic level Knife Yosemite National Park Veganism Clouded Leopard Life in the Freezer Nile crocodile The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Textile manufacturing Chicken Breastfeeding Lion Goby Tarantula American Black Bear Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Carbon dioxide Banana Caterpillar Dolphin Murray Cod Hard disk Domesticated turkey Noah's Ark Death Valley National Park Chinook salmon
