how could you prevent sickness i had a sick fish in the tank but i got it out close to its death he wouldn't eat anything and would swim only at the top right past the fish flakes then he would come down and lie down a bit on the bottom then come back up is this contagious if it is what can i add into the water to prevent it from reaching into my other fish first rule when you spot a sick fish take it out and keep it in another tank i call those hospital tank next change of the water in your original tank this helps to dilute the poor quality water which probably cause your fish to fall ill and reduce the concentration of parasites or bacteria in your original tank water and hopefully your other fishes in the tank doesn't catch them it's hard to diagnose what disease your fish is suffering but he probably has some form of swim bladder problem since he's lying down at the bottom from that i suspect it could be some kind of internal bacteria infection you can try dosing general anti bacteria you can buy from the aquarium shop hopes this helps Pneumonia Foodborne illness Common cold Shark Sea-Monkey Infectious disease Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sewage treatment Asthma Urinary incontinence Bacteria Fish farming Rocky Mountain spotted fever Diarrhea Chronic fatigue syndrome Disinfection Medicine Psoriasis Aquarium Disease Legionellosis Virus Guinea pig Prostate cancer Multiple sclerosis Malaria Discus (fish) Clownfish Intravenous therapy Poker jargon Vitamin C Tuberculosis Dairy Water purification Cyanide 2001 anthrax attacks Bladderwort Iron Sexually-transmitted infection Crohn's disease Halitosis Decompression sickness Swimming Seine (fishing) Thermal power station Sleeping sickness Traumatic brain injury Paracetamol Tooth enamel Oily fish Livestock Carnivorous plant Escherichia coli Sickle-cell disease Smallpox Swimming pool Anthrax Siphon Solar power Omega-3 fatty acid Crayfish Rabies Allergy Rebreather Factory farming Ebola Lake Fish Minamata disease Cancer Body piercing Stingray H5N1 Hypoglycemia Salmon Sodium hypochlorite Tsetse fly Gas bladder Folic acid Ecology Fancy rat Radiation poisoning Clinical depression Acne Goldfish Diseases of the honeybee Nutrition DDT Bipolar disorder Fishing
