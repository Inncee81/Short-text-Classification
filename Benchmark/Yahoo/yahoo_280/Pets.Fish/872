how do i clean the inside of my tank fast i suspect that my aquarium is dirty from the inside how do i clean it it is not green the water looks dull but when i take the water out in a cup the water is perfectly clean i got it just on sunday first there is nothing about fish keeping that is fast everything about keeping fish is about time and patience if you just got the tank on sunday then it has not had time to cycle yet the term cycle is referred to allowing the tank time to set up a bio filter a group of positive bacteria that assist in keeping the water balanced many whom are new to the hobby add fish to the system too quickly and end up a with an ammonia spike and loose the fish if you already have fish in the tank do a partial water change take out of the water using a gravel vacuum and replace with water as close to the same temp as possible dont forget to add the stress coat to remove the chlorine and other harmful things from the water you need to go pick up a product called cycle add it to the water and this will help boost your bio filter and help get it established then maintain by doing weekly partial water changes each week to maintain a healthy system Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Fish farming Dairy Brewery Dry cleaning Swimming pool Thermal power station Ammonia Biogeochemical cycle Hard disk Sea-Monkey Siphon Reef tank Water supply Motor oil Disinfection Water purification Electrophysiology E85 Solar power Menstrual cup Temperature Dishwasher Discus (fish) Eutrophication Motorcycle Tank Chlorine Domestic rabbit Nuclear power Cannabis cultivation Fossil fuel power plant Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Toyota Prius Rail terminology Poker jargon Goldfish Axolotl Carburetor Swimming Refrigerator Textile manufacturing M60 machine gun Coffee Diseases of the honeybee PID controller Tofu Natural gas Dead Like Me Volleyball Home repair CPU cache Carbon dioxide Entropy Wetland Kalman filter Escherichia coli O157:H7 Menstrual cycle Polarization Energy development MS-06 Zaku II Kosher foods Audio level compression Sodium hypochlorite Fish Unreal Web crawler Hydrogen economy Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Liquid crystal Japanese toilet Shrimp farm Sterilization (microbiology) Heinkel He 100 Advance Wars: Dual Strike Hybrid vehicle Fugu Biodiesel Brackish water Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Biology Japanese tea ceremony Hamster Ocean thermal energy conversion Tilapia Tea Mooney M20 Sabbath Healthy eating Butterfly stroke Hypoglycemia Ecology Dodge Charger Internal ballistics Seine (fishing)
