can i house female bettas in a gallon tank i know females can live together obviously males cannot in larger tanks i've even seen them housed together peacefully at pet shops instead of in the little cups it seems if you keep a large enough group it diffuses their aggression but i thought gallons might be pushing it this can work with enough plants as already mentioned but there is no guarantee some betta females are nearly as aggressive as males and can even kill other females it works best when they were raised together then they don't pick on each other much the other and better possibility would be buying betta imbellis crescent betta instead of betta splendens they look like the wild forms of betta splendens albeit smaller and are called peaceful bettas for a reason the males won't kill each other when they fight but not because they are really more peaceful but because they are smaller weaker and don't protect such a large territorium even other possibility is to buy some mouthbrooding bettas like betta picta they are not as colourful but they are really peaceful and even should be kept in small groups with a number of both males and females but still plants are important for all bettas out there Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Poker jargon Dairy Tilapia Fire fighting Dwarf gourami Tarantula Hamster Leopard Elephant Lion Sexual dimorphism Brewery Marine aquarium Combine (Half-Life 2) Free trade Nuclear power Domestic rabbit Treaty of Versailles Liger Spider Mountain Gorilla Domestication Clownfish American lobster Tank Hydrogen economy Tiger Chris Kanyon Sesshomaru Unreal Fish farming Arab-Israeli conflict British Army Cosmic Era human enhancements Non-aggression principle Hyperreal number Single Transferable Vote House Mouse Aquarium Platypus Axolotl Sea-Monkey Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Canary Betting (poker) Toyota Prius Agriculture Tank classification Species Gourami Surveillance Conifer cones Banana Gas turbine Antioch, Pisidia Nuclear warfare Democratic peace theory Playoff Brit Awards Craps Corporation Discus (fish) Non-human animal sexuality Internal ballistics Rave Master Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Biodiesel Sento Monogamy Centre Province, Cameroon Gray Wolf U.S. Electoral College Fossil fuel power plant Mallard Guinea pig Legend of Mana Greco-Bactrian Kingdom International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Autonomous building Iraq disarmament crisis Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina First Maori War Thermal power station Winter War Mark I (tank) Dragons (Pern) Chamarajanagar Erwin Rommel Al-Aqsa Intifada F-16 Fighting Falcon Cooking weights and measures Gallon Fancy rat Final Fantasy XI Solar power Nickname Animal communication Panthera hybrid
