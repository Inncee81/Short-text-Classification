betta compatability are rams compatible with a betta in a large enough tank i know theyre not aggressive to other fish but im wondering how they would do with a long finned fish i have a ten gallon tank that i can put the betta in but if it can be with the rams ill put it with them in my gallon and stick my angels and swordtails in the ten they killed my last betta ive learned my lesson oh and dont worry its only three small angels and four half inch swords theyll be okay in the ten right now i have two rams but if i stick the angels in the ten ill buy about three more if its okay with you guys no they will not grow it out easily the angels are fully grown and my swords come from small parents and have been so far rather slow growers if they do grow it out i have another gallon tank with a few other swords that i can stick them in the only reason why the fish grow slow is from tank size the angel needs gallons each and they grow inches the betta and rams woud be good in the gallon tank just put alot of plants the swordies would be good with the angels but its best to get them a gallon too Goldfish Dwarf gourami P-47 Thunderbolt Fruit tree propagation Hydrogen economy Biodiesel Poker jargon Green swordtail IBM PC compatible Brewery Hard disk Aquarium Laptop Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Fish farming Ford Mustang Firearm Apple St. Louis Rams YuYu Hakusho Refrigerator car Marine aquarium Sailfin Molly Lionel Corporation Discus (fish) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items USS Tunny (SS-282) Goby English unit Anti-aircraft warfare Toyota Prius Barrel (storage) Team Fortress Classic Gallon Alcohol fuel Terminal ballistics Peanut RISC Nintendo GameCube Nickname Knife Microeconomics Tilapia Weapon Gears and Vehicles (Xenogears) Metrication arguments and counter-arguments Orca Elis Prefecture Autonomous building Metrication New York Giants USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB 11) Supply and demand Bowie knife Timpani Dairy Atari 8-bit family O scale Sea-Monkey Elephant Axolotl Grand Theft Auto (game) Tank locomotive Fin Whale U.S. customary units Link (Legend of Zelda) Thomas the Tank Engine Fire extinguisher Gourami Clownfish Kylie Minogue Illegal drug trade The Legend of Zelda series races Eskrima Random access memory Charles Ives Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories F-16 Fighting Falcon Cannabis cultivation Striker Pack Moorish Idol CPU design Empire Earth II American lobster P-38 Lightning PC Engine USB flash drive CPU cache Atari ST Tamil language Shell (projectile) Armoured warfare Commodore 64 Cleveland Browns Clown loach Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory
