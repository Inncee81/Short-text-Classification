my goldfish has a little problem i just noticed my gold fish has black blotchy spots all over it and i don't know what is going on anyone got a clue water quality is poor change the water your ammonia level is high the black spots are blood hemorrhages coming to the surface of the skin the blood looks black or brown on a goldfish because it is being seen through an orange skin the reason they get these hemorrhages is because the ammonia in the water is mixing with their blood through their gills and it is keeping the oxygen in the water from going into the blood as the fish is starved for oxygen the blood comes to the surface in the fishes body trying to get oxygen if you do water changes you lower the concentration of ammonia in the water and the fish can get oxygen again and then the blood spots go away Ammonia Sewage treatment Decompression sickness Water (molecule) Hydrogen economy Traumatic brain injury Lake Gill Pulmonary alveolus Blood Urea Osmoregulation Aquarium Stroke Cyanide Iron Earth's atmosphere Fish farming Marine aquarium Carbon dioxide Discus (fish) Titanium Eutrophication Water Insulin Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Gas metal arc welding Homeostasis Alternative biochemistry Fishing Rebreather Skin Dam Lung Dialysis Hemoglobin Ozone depletion Bacteria Red blood cell Corrosion Welding Drowning Anemia Poison Breathing gas Coagulation Ozone hole Diabetic retinopathy Ozone layer Origin of life Color Circulatory system Hydrogen Copper Cetacea Carburetor Roach Hydrogen peroxide Fire fighting Hypoglycemia Enceladus (moon) Coronary heart disease Atherosclerosis Intracranial pressure Hyperventilation Blood pressure Neptune Partial pressure Cheetah Blood vessel Water pollution Gas bladder Electrolyte Liquid breathing Terraforming Pneumonia Koi Shark Algal bloom Biochemistry Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Thermoregulation Tetrapod Brewery Beryllium Atlantic herring Lake Burley Griffin Cocaine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Oily fish Thermal power station Global warming and agriculture Diabetes mellitus Nitric oxide Nutrient Nitroglycerin Gas exchange Sulfuric acid Nitrous oxide
