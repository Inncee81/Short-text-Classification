why are lake malawi cichlids so much more available than lake tanganyika cichlids i see the malawi cichlids regularly in pet stores but rarely if ever lake tanganyika cichlids if i do see a lake tanganyika cichlids its usely a frontosa any ideas maybe prices it has to do with alot of things mbunas haps and peacocks are more popular because of their vibrant colors and relatively small size they have been on the market long enough that many are farm raised in the far east this allows them to be sold at much lower prices as well you also have to take into account political situations many of the countries surrounding lake tanganyika are war torn and it can be more difficult to export from that area driving the price up when you buy a wild caught fish you are paying for the divers fishermen their equipment the transporters to the airport the air cargo the wholesaler and so on the smaller tanganyikans are not that popular because of their needs and lack of bright color tropheus are not that popular because of their high price and insane aggression frontosa are fairly popular due to their nice blue and white stripes but even they are expensive Lake Malawi Cichlid Discus (fish) Zambezi Diamond Tanzania Rift Valley lakes Peanut Tilapia Microeconomics Illegal drug trade Malawi Airline Sexual selection Economy of Africa Economy of Malawi Commodore 64 Floppy disk Hamster Banana Gross domestic product Geography of Africa Milwaukee, Wisconsin Common Agricultural Policy Mutual fund MMORPG Airport RuneScape economy Chevrolet Camaro Salmon Supply and demand Sport utility vehicle Filling station Tax Digital photography Economy of the Republic of Ireland Fishing Laserdisc Common Fisheries Policy Inflation Hard disk Economy of the United States Privatization Shrimp farm NeXT Neopets Lionel Corporation Atari 8-bit family Wal-Mart Panama Canal Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Sega Saturn Tesco Economy of Iceland Price discrimination Inventory Economy of Mexico Externality Fish farming Ithaca, New York British Empire Great Lakes Ferret Light-emitting diode Shau Kei Wan Plasma display Economy of Chile Economy of Venezuela Hyperinflation O scale Insurance Carlsbad, California Manitoba Hydro Nile perch Livestock Dog Grand Forks, North Dakota Lake Freshwater angelfish Chicken PE ratio Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Clarinet Farmers' Alliance Uganda Railway Video game crash of 1983 Economy of Suriname Redundant array of independent disks Dragons (Pern) Economic history of Canada Taboo food and drink Bond Ryanair Economy of Kuwait Bulk vending Dodge Charger Commodore International Economy of the United Arab Emirates Broadband Internet access
