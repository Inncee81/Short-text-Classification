gallon aquarium whats some good combinations of fish for a gal aquarium i want something with color and not all small fish have any ideas i like angels and catfish type things or cichilids i know they cant all be together so give me some good combos such as like angels and like plecostomus or something thanks best combo gets points would any cichilids be allowed with angels i know i definitly want angels based around that i need to know if i can have a plecostomus catfish and or cichilids how do you pronounce cichilids angel fish are cichilds actually you would pronouce it sick lids a good combination is open to many possibilties here consider this though gallon tank is roughly feet in length by feet wide that's the rough area you have to work with when considering your population if you go with angelfish then i'd stick with those only for your cichilds you can also go with africans but actually you'll want to overstock it to aggression is limited there are some africans that are fairly peaceful for africans as well i have protomelas stevani's aka taiwan reef cichilds in my and they cooexist with different types of mbuna in there and i have yet to have a fight between species go on the mbuna have fought within themselves and i also have four nicely growing yellow labs that fight sometimes among themselves but never between species granted my spacing is feet by two feet more area but the idea is if you want to intermix for colors then i'd go with groups that are relatively peaceful for africans and you get better colors out of them imo if you go south american i'd try blue acara as your main cichild nice colors on it and pretty peaceful fish you could probably get to breed i'd limit any plecos you get to just one given how big they get as adults take a peek at taiwan reefs and possibly red empress they have nice colors but i'll tell you one thing i've learned about schools of them there will be only one dominant male of the group the males usually have the most colors to them and if there is more then the colors you see on pictures that will be the colors on the main male the other males will have colors subdued and the females are many times not even the same color grouping at all making them easy to identify you can get further help still at fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv Discus (fish) Aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Clownfish Marine aquarium Goldfish Color Georgia Aquarium Freshwater angelfish Fishing Stereoscopy Fish farming Yu-Gi-Oh!
