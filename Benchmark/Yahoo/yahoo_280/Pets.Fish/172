bringing a fish home for college break i want to bring a fish to college with me but i have to drive fly home for breaks because i know i shouldnt leave the fish there even if it is just a goldfish or beta fish any suggestions on how to get it home hi laura if you can do the entire journey by driving it would be better for the fish you will need a battery powered double air pump a couple of new buckets half fill both buckets with tank water in one transport your fish with an airstone running but nothing else in there ensure it is safely stowed preferably on the floor in front of the passenger seat secured with cushions so it cannot move also ensure you have suitable 'breathable' cover over the top such as netting secured with elastic bands it would be good if you could keep it as dark as possible so perhaps cover with a towel in the other bucket of tank water place the filter so as to preserve the beneficial bacteria on the media any tank ornaments plants gravel finally place the other airstone in this bucket you are ready for the off depending on how large the volume of water you may need further buckets it's best to try to keep as much of the original water as possible dismantle pack the tank fish last thing before you leave unpack rebuild the tank first thing on arrival hope this is some help good luck drive carefully it sounds a big ordeal but it's really easy just takes some time to organise once you have done it once it will be a breeze your fish is obviously well loved Aquarium Sewage treatment Sento Brewery Energy development Dairy Marine aquarium Cruising (maritime) Solar power Anchor Seismic retrofit Glossary of wildland fire terms USS Yorktown (CV-5) Stock car (rail) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hydrogen economy Cannabis cultivation Autonomous building Mars Exploration Rover Fossil fuel power plant Professional wrestling throws Redundant array of independent disks Tractor USS S-35 (SS-140) Protoss Vacuum cleaner Fast bowling Novelty (locomotive) USS Tunny (SS-282) Airport Armoured warfare Wildfire Flush toilet Fishing Sea-Monkey Glossary of firefighting terms Yerba mate Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Hard disk Menstrual cup Locomotive Fish farming Comanche Fountain Aerial (dance move) RuneScape locations USS Thresher (SS-200) International response to Hurricane Katrina Fire fighting Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Water purification Automobile Textile manufacturing Volleyball Fugu E85 Terran (StarCraft) Paragliding Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy SS Andrea Doria Tlingit Upholstery Eldfell RuneScape quests Mosquito Combine (Half-Life 2) 24 Hours of Le Mans Tilapia Solar cell Baseball Professional wrestling match types Street-Legal Tidal power Final Fantasy: Unlimited GunZ The Duel Panama Canal Ocean thermal energy conversion The Star Wars Holiday Special B-47 Stratojet Tunisia Campaign Drag racing Airbag Chevrolet Corvair Advance Wars: Dual Strike Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Gas compressor Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Shen Gong Wu Elevator Operation Market Garden Aerial firefighting
