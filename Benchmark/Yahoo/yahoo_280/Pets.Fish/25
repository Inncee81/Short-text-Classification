can jewel cichlids and convict cichlids be kept together in the same tank i currently have a tank that i have an oscar in but he has outgrown his tank i have purchased a new tank to transfer him into but i do love the old tank i think i want a few jewel cichlids can they live semi harmoniously with convict cichlids jewels are african cichlids and convicts are south american cichlids normally you wouldn't want to mix africans and south americans but since convicts don't get too big like oscars and parrots it might be ok if your tank is big enough i would say at least a gallon with lots of plants and caves convicts breed easily and are very protective of their young and the territory they've claimed to lay their eggs so just be careful of that and you might be ok Cichlid Tilapia Discus (fish) Lake Malawi Oscar (fish) Freshwater angelfish Live-bearing aquarium fish Brewery Beetle Rift Valley lakes Theory of conduct Aquarium Minor Harry Potter Beasts South America Marine aquarium Platypus InuYasha (character) Goldfish History of the tank Australia Ostrich Jack Dempsey (fish) P-47 Thunderbolt British comic Transcontinental nation Encantadia Kakapo Appeal Music history of the United States Rum Sin City Patton (film) Brotherhood of Nod Oscar Wilde Hydrogen economy Aladdin (1992 film) Biodiesel Plame affair USS New Jersey (BB-62) Characters in the Smurfs Clownfish Ocean's Twelve Music genre Thomas the Tank Engine Bird Agriculture Ten Years of Harmony San Fernando City, Pampanga Katie Holmes Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Monogamy Socrates South Park Armoured warfare Monster Rancher monsters Midwestern United States Salsa music Kazan South Africa Liger Sea-Monkey Pansy Chicken Lion BoA Endangered species Axolotl Northern Territory Equine conformation Keith Richards F1 hybrid History of South Africa in the apartheid era Endless Harmony Soundtrack YuYu Hakusho Fire fighting Crown jewels Tank Mountaineering Cliff Richard Potomac River Louisiana Purchase Honda CX series Fleetwood Mac GunBound Advanced Squad Leader John Wycliffe Caving Double jeopardy Middle-earth Mark VIII (tank) African Grey Parrot Casablanca (film) Septic tank InuYasha media and release information Fossil fuel power plant Tobacco Kryptonite Darwin from Orchids to Variation
