friends for my fighting fish pls help my brother recently got a betta from his friends and he doesnt want to take care of it much so i will be the one to do so the tank its in is about gallons big it has no filter so its a still water environment im thinking of getting a filter as well as a few other fishes and snails to keep the betta and me some company maybe about more i know not to put male guppies or goldfish or colorful fish in the tank with the betta cause they'll pester him and he'll kill them lol so here are my questions feeding the fish betta pellets which are microscopic times a day is fine is that right any suggestions for fish i can put would a filter be better for the betta preferable the cheaper lower maintenance fish p should i get a bigger tank pls answer all help is appreciated thanks your feeding seems about alright but if the pellets are microscropic it probably wouldn't hurt to give it more filters are always a good idea but i think that for a betta it isn't necessary i've had friends and heard of people that had bettas without a filter and they did fine i would consider that a personal choice that you should make based on how much money you are willing to spend and how much time and energy you have to devote if you want to get more fish i would definetly go with a bigger tank if you got other fish plus your betta that would be fish in a one gallon tank is overstocked a bigger tank would give more room so they wouldn't be threatened to attack eachother over space that would be your best bet try getting a gallon tank that would give your fish idea room and you could also have the room to add a few more fish if you wish in the future if your going to have to get a bigger tank getting a filter would make alot of sense more fish and more water should be properly circulated don't purchase more fish then what you can care for and don't get yourself in to deep financially if you want cheap maitenance it's not cheap to keep an animal so if you want to keep it cheap i wouldn't reccomend creating a large aqaurium there is chlorine testing ph level testing gravel proper plants food filters and other things in the cost just don't get yourself in to deep because with animals it's hard to get yourself out good luck Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Brewery Biodiesel Aquarium Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Fish farming Goldfish Water purification Autonomous building Theory of conduct Nuclear power Organic farming E85 Axolotl Solar power Shark Shrimp farm Dairy Single-stage to orbit Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Inflation Microeconomics Space Shuttle program Veganism Thermal power station Dry cleaning Zerg Tilapia Motorcycle Poker jargon Fire fighting Economics Ecco the Dolphin Reef tank Light-emitting diode Antarctic krill Hydrogen vehicle Koi Ozone depletion Dwarf gourami Ozone layer Cannabis cultivation Domestic rabbit Extreme Programming Galileo spacecraft Diving Gar Deflation (economics) Alcohol fuel Solar cell Piccolo Junior Saga MS-06 Zaku II Simone Weil The nature of God in Western theology Ecology Environmental vegetarianism Whale Hydroponics Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Electrophysiology Nuclear reactor RuneScape Random Events Thermal depolymerization YuYu Hakusho Biology Hamster Environmental concerns with electricity generation Seabird Rei Ayanami Samuel Goldwyn Health insurance Jon Secada Friends Tank Social rule Coffee Energy development Stereoscopy Garfield Biodiversity Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 RuneScape skills Terminal ballistics Meaning of life Hardware random number generator Strap-on dildo Loudspeaker Theodicy P-47 Thunderbolt
