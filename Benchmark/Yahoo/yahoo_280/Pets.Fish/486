why does my single betta's face get puffy for no reason i have a single male betta and whenever i glance over to his tank his face is all puffy its as if to make himself look bigger i think this may be a sign of aggression but i only have one betta so why is he acting like he is getting ready to fight does this mean something else you have the right idea the males and females will both do this it's called flaring when they open their gill covers and spread their fins and they are trying to warn other fish that if they're not in the mood for a fight they'd better back off chances are he's seeing his reflection in the side of the tank or the glass of the heater and he thinks it's another male betta too much of this can cause him to be stressed so it might be a good idea for you to try and figure out what he's flaring towards and use plants they can be fake ones or a tank background so he doesn't see the reflection as often Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sean Combs Poker jargon Dwarf gourami B-47 Stratojet T-64 Blur Aquarium Chris Kanyon Ecco the Dolphin Tank The Emancipation of Mimi Marine aquarium History of the tank Fire fighting Mercury Atlas 6 Operation Barbarossa Conspiracy (TNG episode) Goofy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baldness Equine conformation Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Thermal power station Tenshinhan Gourami Professional wrestling holds Halfbeak Shark Solar power Fish anatomy Betting (poker) EastEnders Yom Kippur War Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Weekly World News Fish farming World Championship Wrestling Shen Gong Wu Glossary of partner dance terms Armoured warfare The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases SS Division (motorised) Wiking Rail terminology Gulf War Waterworld American lobster The Ashlee Simpson Show Frankie Goes to Hollywood Evidence of evolution Miss Saigon Tamil language Eye contact Solar collector Autonomous building Mark I (tank) The Temptations Jodeci French Defence Octopus Cannabis cultivation Rent (musical) Clownfish House of Leaves Water heater Bad Wolf Fantasy (Mariah Carey song) Hydraulic machinery Clown loach Avenue Q Rocket propelled grenade Combine (Half-Life 2) Battle of France Nickname Street-Legal Discus (fish) Warrior (World of Warcraft) Polish September Campaign Missy Elliott Vowel Kakapo Reef tank American Conservatism Lens (optics) Moe Szyslak Ruy Lopez Ra (board game) Kasparov versus The World Parthenogenesis Lifeboat Battle of Mokra Fish Nas (rapper) The Kinks StarCraft: Uprising The Who Clinical depression Tier One The Notorious B.I.G.
