female bettas and other fish what kind of fish are good with female bettas are african dwarf frogs good tank mates for them my original plan was to have female bettas and maybe an adf or in the tank it's a gallon adf get along great with beta's male or female you can keep several females together however do not keep more than one male per tank as they will fight to the death we have had female bettas in with platy's and mollys successfully we however have a much larger tank the amount of fish you mentioned would be a nice fit in a gal just be sure you have allowed time for the tank to cycle develop a bio filter of positive bacteria before adding all the fish you can speed that process by purchasing a product called cycle at petsmart petco another tip to remember is that betas are surface breathers so it is essential that they be able to reach the surface to breath also make sure to remember to do your weekly water changes where you vacuum the gravel and remove of the water and then add fresh water along with a product to remove chlorine etc such as stress coat and you will have a happy healthy set up Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sewage treatment Brewery Dairy Aquarium Fish farming Marine aquarium Dry cleaning Dwarf gourami Biodiesel Water purification Hard disk Floppy disk Glacier Spider Mark I (tank) Thermal power station Carbon dioxide Ecology Bong Fugu Sea-Monkey GunBound Sailfin Molly F-16 Fighting Falcon Motorcycle Hydrogen sulfide Autonomous building Halitosis Insulin Goldfish Fire fighting Rebreather Water Eutrophication Solar power Jet engine E85 Rice Tank Faster-than-light Ozone depletion Fossil fuel power plant Elephant Gas metal arc welding Carnivorous plant Sonar Corrosion Water (molecule) Sugar beet Final Fantasy magic Hamster Drill bit Breaststroke Glossary of firefighting equipment Motor oil Sugar Dinghy Panzer I Galileo spacecraft Shrimp farm African clawed frog Wetland Ozone hole Swimming pool Chlorine Helium Milk Toyota Prius Coffee Diving Plastic Welding Butterfly stroke Swimming Fishing Rail terminology Sun Polymerase chain reaction Development stage Electrophysiology Tank landing ship Ecco the Dolphin Mitsubishi Zero Dead Like Me Leatherback Sea Turtle Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Platypus Software testing Clownfish CPU cache B-24 Liberator Antarctic krill Shark Microeconomics Panzer II RISC Menstrual cup
