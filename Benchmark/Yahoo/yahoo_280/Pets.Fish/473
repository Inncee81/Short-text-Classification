what kind of fish should i get i was thinking of buying my yr old a pet fish that i will help him care for he wants a goldfish like the one elmo has on sesame street and i don't want a big aquarium i want fish and a small fish bowl easy to care for and keep clean but my husband says that goldfish die to easily and that my son would be crying so what is a good fish to buy of course i would feed the fish thanks for the info we have a miniture chihuhua now and i have never had fish so i don't know you're going into this all wrong if you want something that doesn't need much maintenance then you don't want a bowl bowls need to have water changes every days so that means twice a week you'd be putting the fish in another container dumping out all the water rinsing the rocks in a strainer to rinse out poop and food wiping down the bowl filling it back up again with conditioned water that is the same temp as water that was in the bowl then putting the fish in again not to mention a bowl is not healthy for any fish the only fish that can really survive in a bowl okay is a betta which still aren't great choices because they prefer water temps around f if your son really wants a goldfish and you want something that is low maintenance i suggest getting a gallon tank a filter for a tank slightly larger i'll make suggestions with price estimates lower and then letting your son pick out the decorations then cycle the tank and after the tank has cycled take your son to pick out one fancy goldfish these are the round bodied goldfish only one will fit comfortably in a gallon and slim bodied or common goldfish like you win at a fair get way too big for a gallon then take the fish home float his bag in the tank for an hour adding a little of the tank water to the bag halfway through after the hour is up use a net to scoop him into the tank so you don't get the store water in the tank gallon tank no hood whisper filter i recommend one for gallon tank possibly cheaper net gravel master test kit to read up on cycling go here http www kokosgoldfish com fishlesscycle html good luck Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Biodiesel Japanese tea ceremony Sea-Monkey Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Brewery Thermal power station Dairy Fish farming Poker jargon E85 Fancy rat Dishwasher Bong Social rule Hamster Menstrual cup Microeconomics Carburetor Hydrogen economy Tea Nuclear power Toilet humour Fossil fuel power plant Milk Extreme Programming Cannabis cultivation American Dad!
