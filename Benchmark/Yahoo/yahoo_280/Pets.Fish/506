will angel fish work if not what will i have a gallon aquarium with three rainbow sharks about each five giant danios around each one female beta a long shark catfish and a long pleco i need to trade the pleco out for a smaller one and assuming i do following the inch of fish per gallon formula i figure i can add about more fish to this set up i was thinking a couple of angel fish might be nice are their diets tank water requirements etc compatible with what i've already got and would they be a good choice i was also thinking of rosy red barbs too what do you think the barbs or the angels or something else entirely grow up ggclub you have fish that will grow big and some that will grow aggressive the shark catfish will grow inches but are peacful the rainbow sharks grow inches and are semi aggressive even if you remove the pleco your tank is still overcrowded so remove the pleco and the shark catfish and rainbow shark then you can add get a king tiger pleco that grows around inches and or barbs the barbs needs to be in groups of or more and are semi aggressive and will attack or fin nip other fish mainly the betta because its slow swim and longfins makes it a perfect target for barbs unless if they are in groups Tilapia Danio Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Catfish Fish Goldfish Fishing Zebra Danio Dwarf gourami Orca Suckermouth Catfish Clownfish Fauna of Australia Great White Shark Aquarium Discus (fish) San Jose Sharks Bottlenose Dolphin Whale shark Pearl Danio Nickname Jaws (film) Gar Fish farming Ecco the Dolphin Marine aquarium Creatures in Bionicle Sailfin Molly Basking Shark Barbed wire USS Tunny (SS-282) Fugu Chinatown Poker jargon Shrimp farm Live-bearing aquarium fish Oceanic Whitetip Shark Shedd Aquarium Monterey Bay Aquarium Microeconomics Angel shark Shortfin Mako Shark Blacktip Reef Shark Sea-Monkey Giant squid Grouper Thresher Shark Carp RuneScape skills Georgia Aquarium Durban Bull shark Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Grunion Corydoras Diving suit Clown loach Nurse shark Kosher foods Goby Finding Nemo Whaling Chondrichthyes The Red Sea Sharks Anti-aircraft warfare New England Aquarium White Cloud Mountain Minnow Rainbow trout Freshwater angelfish Zambezi Hydrogen economy Hamster Myxobolus cerebralis Terminal ballistics Goldeen Tlingit Australian salmon GunBound Knife Torpedo Cantonese cuisine Land mine Axolotl Rice American lobster Sandbar shark Batoidea Taikyoku shogi Halfbeak E85 Ictaluridae Lamniformes Krill 2000 Australian Grand Prix Coral reef Zebra Shark Tag Autonomous building
