should i turn the lights off in my aqurium at night and why well should you keep the lights in your bedroom on at night i suppose you could but it wouldnt be very pleasant for your fish p there is also the factor of algae growth but if you care about keeping your fish heathly you absolutely have to maintain a healthy biorythm for them fish need adequate amounts of rest and predictable day night cycles to stay healthy just as humans do for algae growth and to save you money on bulbs it is recommended that you leave the light on no more than hours a day it would be best if you were able to turn on your light shortly after sunrise and turn it out at dusk to let your fish sleep on a natural schedule but since that probably isnt practical i would recommend letting them wake with the sunrise turn on their light sometime midmorning or even early afternoon but only if its dark in your house and you need it on otherwise youre just wasting your money on electricity its dark in our house so our ruykin's light is on from about am till pm also you should set a lights out time for your fish and stick to it i know that sounds absurd but trust me it will pay off in happy healthy long lived fish our fish gets lights out no later than if we are using the room and cant keep it dark after we cover his tank with a blanket until we go to bed the only other thing is to be sure to turn lights on and off gradually try lifting the hood before turning it on and off this way the light increases slowly and decreases slowly when we turn out our fish's light at night i make sure there is also a light on in the room to help ease him into the change this is because fish have no eyelids and a sudden light going on or off can really shock them good luck with your fish Daylight saving time Sleep USS Tunny (SS-282) Cannabis cultivation Fish farming Sewage treatment Weight training Eutrophication Incandescent light bulb Mattress Marine aquarium Insomnia Light pollution Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Future energy development Theory of conduct Economy of the United States Urinary incontinence The Dunciad Weather lore Blankets (graphic novel) 2003 North America blackout Dairy Capitalism Capercaillie RuneScape economy Battle of Jutland Ecology Knife Dieting Keynesian economics Autonomous building Oh My Goddess!
