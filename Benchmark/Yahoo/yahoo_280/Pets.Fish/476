compatible fish okay so i am planning on upgrading my tanks in about a month and in two days i am going to get more fish so they can ajust to eachother while they are young i want opinions about the fish in my tanks such as if you think they will get along am i overcrowding and if you think i have a cool combo of fish first tank is a g with ghost shrimps sunset platy orange fancy guppy lyre tail guppy and zebra danios all male i am going to add sunset platy fancy guppy and ghost shrimp all female i will then upgrade the tank to g i know the fish might breed so i will have a g for the fry incase do you think this is a good combonation tank is a g with two australian rainbows peppered corydoras and otocinclus i am going to add albino corydoras and clown plecostomus they will then be upgraded to a g tank good combonation remember i just want opinions i have already read up on these fish but you cant trust everything you read i would say the rainbows should be in an even larger tank than a they might get by if it's a long but a tall wouldn't give them much swimming room a gallon or larger would be better for these the oto could probably use more of his kind as well to school with i would hold off moving the otos and clown pleco until the tank has had a chance to cycle since these are both sensitive to water quality be sure to give your pleco some driftwood in the tank for the smaller tank what you already have in the is a little overstocked rather than move these into a new with even more fish why not move them into the gallon once the other fish have been moved out if you keep the same gravel that's in the tank now you wouldn't have to wait for the tank to cycle and add enough danios to get the total number up to the compatibility in both tanks is okay Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Zebra Danio Danio Clownfish Tilapia Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Platypus Shrimp farm Marine aquarium Sea-Monkey Axolotl Fish farming Lake Burley Griffin Brewery Aquarium Discus (fish) Guppy Live-bearing aquarium fish Toyota Prius Shark Gar Tank Myxobolus cerebralis House Mouse Sailfin Molly Poker jargon Goldfish Dwarf gourami Pearl Danio Halfbeak Lion Cuisine of Denmark Mark I (tank) Suckermouth Catfish Shrimp M4 Sherman Aqua Teen Hunger Force Hard disk Salmon Fish Tung Chung Krill Fishing Clown loach MS-06 Zaku II General Dynamics F-111 Grunion Freshwater angelfish Hamburger Carp Panzer II Leopard tank Roman eating and drinking Fire fighting Sewage treatment Chinese New Year Hydrogen economy Wine making StarCraft: Uprising Cajun cuisine Messerschmitt Bf 109 Three Mile Island USS Tiru (SS-416) Autonomous building Seal Beach, California Squirrel Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour Solar power Hurricane Rita Rainbow Islands E85 American lobster Dairy Goby Swimming pool Orlando, Florida Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy Zerg Tag Curry Pok__mon Abilities Bay de Verde, Newfoundland and Labrador Junkers Ju 188 Pocket cruiser Peruvian cuisine Mikoyan MiG-29 Short Sunderland CPU cache Transformer Livestock Refrigerator SS Andrea Doria Mosquitofish Fossil fuel power plant Australian bass Fancy Crane Captain Thunderbolt Trout Inca Empire
