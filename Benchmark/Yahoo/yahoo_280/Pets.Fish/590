my aquatic crab has lost both claws plz hlp i have to crabs that live in my fish tank with my rainbow i got the second one after the first one and he only had one claw when i bought him a little while after putting him in the tank the first one attacked him and he lost his other claw i removed him and put him in a different aquarium is he going to die can he still eat will he grow back his claws i do believe that crab claws grow back shortly after they have been removed although it may be a slow time i don't believe your crab will die at all though although you should keep a special eye on him and make sure he's alright and about the food question i don't think the claws will have a major effect on his eating considering crabs use claws to grasp food items just make sure it at least eats somehow is all i can say Goldfish Coconut crab Otter Professional wrestling holds Hermit crab Arthropod Lobster Aquarium Fishing Sea-Monkey Creatures in Bionicle Crayfish Scorpion Marine aquarium RuneScape weapons Cuttlefish Claw Brown Bear Octopus Crab Fish American lobster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Super Metroid Discus (fish) Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Horseshoe crab Osaka Snake Bottlenose Dolphin Fauna of Australia Antarctic krill Kingler Halfbeak Goby Crab louse Dungeness crab The Crab with the Golden Claws African clawed frog M4 Sherman Shrimp farm Professional wrestling throws Minor Harry Potter Beasts Clownfish Cutey Honey MapleStory Unclean animals Craps Hamburger Sesshomaru Frog Fishery Fugu Finding Nemo Shark Orca Blue crab Boston crab Meat analogue Goanna RuneScape skills Stomach cancer OZ-08MMS Cancer Doom enemies Sabretooth (comics) Kosher foods 613 mitzvot Confederacy of Independent Systems Cantonese cuisine The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Tilapia Angling Chinatown RuneScape Random Events Age of Mythology Roanoke Island Great White Shark Zebra Danio American Black Bear Sewage treatment Salmon Tyranid Stingray Rainbow Islands American Alligator YuYu Hakusho Warrior (World of Warcraft) Porcelain crab Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of the Philippines Stock car (rail) Tetrapod Shedd Aquarium Apple Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Shen Gong Wu Asian supermarket
