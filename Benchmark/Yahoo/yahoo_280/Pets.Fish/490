dwarf gourami acting strange fin rot i have a dwarf gourami that i have had for about months now recently he began acting stranger than normal when i turn on the light he is usually laying on the bottom of the tank the first time i saw him doing it i took him out and isolated him within minutes he was fine and i placed him back in the big tank where he continued to do fine he would usually do this once a week i figured he was just being weird this gourami has never really been normal in my opinion this morning i saw him doing it again watched him and he seems like this time he isn't getting better so i put him in an isolation tank and thats when i noticed one of his tentacles looks like it's rotting could this be a version of fin rot i've never heard of fin rot on the tentacles all the other fish in my tank are fine and acting normally just this one gourami he appears to be eating normally when he isn't laying on the bottom acting strange there are several things that could be going on you should first check your water for nitrates if these get too high you will have all sorts of problems over time it is probably a secondary infection from some sort of injury are there any other fish in the tank they could be picking at the gourami if there are no other fish in the tank and your water tests come back fine then you might want to try adding a small amount of rock salt about tablespoons per gallons to help the wounds heal Dwarf gourami Kissing gourami Gourami Marine aquarium Squidward Tentacles Cantonese cuisine Brewery Wheel of Fortune Thermal power station Sewage treatment Poker jargon The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Whaling Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Shrimp farm USS Yorktown (CV-5) Hamster Flax Discus (fish) Sea-Monkey Wine making Ecco the Dolphin RuneScape skills Carnivorous plant Age of Mythology Aquarium Fish farming RuneScape locations Saturn V Urinary incontinence USS Waters (DD-115) Shaggy dog story Battle of France Goldfish Anchor Perciformes Bread Fugu Equine conformation Eutrophication Shark Debugging Coffee Marathon (sport) USS Tunny (SS-282) Transformer Octopus Sin City Houseplant First aid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Reef tank USS Ammen (DD-527) Discworld gods RuneScape Random Events Carbon dioxide RuneScape quests Fire extinguisher USS Trigger (SS-237) Theory of conduct Fire fighting Hearing impairment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Three Mile Island Carburetor Messerschmitt Bf 109 The Wotch USS S-37 (SS-142) Ammonia USS Seadragon (SS-194) Sperm Whale Jellyfish Bob and George Cessna T-37 USS S-38 (SS-143) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Day of the Tentacle Bocas del Toro Province SS Andrea Doria STS-51-L Fossil fuel power plant Autonomous building Iditarod Stomach cancer Opportunity rover HIV test Daylight saving time Insulin Attack on Pearl Harbor Dinghy Nile crocodile Fish USS S-32 (SS-137) Betting (poker) Amateur telescope making The Parting of the Ways Textile manufacturing Halfbeak Axolotl
