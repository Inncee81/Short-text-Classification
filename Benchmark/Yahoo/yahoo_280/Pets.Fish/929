how many snails should i get for my gallon reef tank my somewhat new reef tank about months is starting to get a slight cyanobacteria outbreak while ammonia nitrites are at and nitrates close to i think this problem was due to using tap water in the initial setup and old pc bulbs i've replaced the bulbs and have done a number of water changes and the red slime algae seems to be lessening i would like to get some snails to finish it off and to take care of some of the other algae in the tank i'm probably going to stay away from any hermits as i would like to build this into a reef tank and people have noted their hermit crabs messing with some of their corals so for now i want to go with astaea turbos but i don't know how many i should get for a gallon i've had snails in the past with no problems with them over reproducing i've noticed a lot of the janitor packages included a sea star or two would you recommend these i've had a lot of problems in the past with algae in the sand do the hermits do a good job of sifting i have a gal reef tank full of corals sps lps fofties crocea clams this tank has been running for well over a year now and i have about assorted snails and about the same amount of hermit crabs i could use more of each blue leg hermits and scarlet reef hermits will not harm your corals as far as i'm concerned they are a must addition for any good reef cleaner crew the scarlet reef hermit crab is best kept in a reef style aquarium where it will have ample supplies of algae to eat it is helpful in keeping algae under control including filamentous algae and cyanobacteria the dwarf blue leg hermit crab is a valuable addition to an aquarium because it will eat algae including green hair algae and cyanobacteria in addition it provides valuable aeration by sifting through the sand it is one of the hermit crabs that is reef safe http www liveaquaria com product scateg cfm pcatid cerith snail one of the most ideal scavengers detritus eaters and algae eaters these snails are perfect for the reef aquarium quickly devouring detritus uneaten food decaying organics fish waste and several types of nuisance algae cerith snails will often bury themselves in the sand which will help maintain adequate oxygen levels in the substrate the astraea conehead snail will do well in an aquarium if provided with ample hiding places and sufficient room to roam an aquarium with live rock is preferable so that it can graze on the algae it will also graze on algae on the side of the tank in addition it eats cyanobacteria and diatoms if it falls it is often unable to right itself and will need the aquarist to place it upright again the nassarius snail is a small scavenger with an oval spiral shell that resembles an olive pit with a long tube like siphon that protrudes from the end of the shell one of the most ideal scavengers and detritus eaters these snails are perfect for the reef aquarium quickly consuming detritus uneaten food decaying organics and fish waste nassarius snails like to bury themselves in the sand which will help maintain adequate oxygen levels in the substrate trochus snail it does well in an aquarium when provided with ample hiding places and room to forage live rock provides algae cyanobacteria and diatoms for food but it also is an effective film algae eater grazing on other surfaces such as the sides of the tank http www liveaquaria com product scateg cfm pcatid i would put a good mix of all of these your tank will not look like it is infested as these animals have very good camoflage some you will see at night and others during the day some you will probably never see because they spend most of there time under the sand bed or in the rockwork http saltaquarium about com cs aboutjanitors a aa n htm ps dawn m you have absolutly no idea what you are talking about saltwater snails very rarely reproduce in an aquarium a algae eater or ghost shrimp would probably last about min in his tank if you don t want to read the question don't answer it pss a small sandsifting sea star would be good but is not needed some of the snails i've mentioned do a great job of sifting through the sand and the
