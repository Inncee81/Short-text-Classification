my angel fish has a fin that is coming off my angel fishs' left fin is deteriorating and his other is very fuzzy and he floats on the top sideways i have put teaspoons of kosher salt in the tank he seems a little more lively but he still wont stop floating i can push him under and he can stay down for a few seconds but when he slows down he comes right back up will he die can his fin come back is this a lost cause it sounds like fin rot coupled with fungus and some kind of swim bladder disease the swim bladder is the organ on the fish that controls buoyancy the salt was good but unfortunately not enough to save him try maracyn i and ii products although this particular fish may die even after dosing it with the maracyn you'll have it for next time in case this happens again and actually i recommend using the product on the tank for about a week or so following the directions then change about of the water and clean some of the rocks and then the filter a few days afterward this will ensure that none of your other fish become contaminated and if they do you'll have the proper antibiotics to treat it before it gets too serious good luck Drowning Shark Fish farming Kosher foods Swimming pool Gas bladder History of swimming Shrimp farm Cantonese cuisine Nuclear fallout Water purification Escherichia coli O157:H7 Buoyancy compensator Tetrapod Sea-Monkey Marine aquarium Mouth ulcer Schistosomiasis Sailing Thermal power station American lobster Menstrual cup Livestock Psoriasis Omega-3 fatty acid Fish Water Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Cryptosporidium Diarrhea Carburetor USS Tunny (SS-282) Swingout Mercury 4 Swimming Diving suit Disinfection Gar Brewery Dead Sea Antibiotic Myxobolus cerebralis Slow sand filter bed Gonorrhoea Diseases of the honeybee Fugu First aid Common cold Carnivorous plant Hypertension Anthrax Cave diving Tank Fishing Foodborne illness Rocky Mountain spotted fever Seine (fishing) Urinary system Prostate cancer Atlantic herring Fin Whale Breaststroke Sperm Whale Radiation therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Tuberculosis Biological warfare Aquarium Frogman Otitis externa Flight controls Dysentery Roach Mars Exploration Rover Cannabis cultivation Balloon Danio Backstroke Industrial wastewater treatment Circle (dance move) Gimli Glider Naval mine Dwarf gourami Kissing gourami Cheese Legionellosis Bottlenose Dolphin Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sterilization (microbiology) Nasal irrigation Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Butterfly stroke Conker's Bad Fur Day Unclean animals
