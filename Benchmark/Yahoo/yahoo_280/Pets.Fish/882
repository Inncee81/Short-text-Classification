molly fry i have had some baby mollies for around three weeks maybe more and i bought the mom about two months ago she is almost ready to have more fry she was in the creamsickle lyretail molly tank and i picked her out because she was the only one that was creamsickle with black spots all over her and the rest were regular creamsickles well she came to my tank along with a dalmatian lyretail molly ready to have fry i have a dalmatian sailfin molly male who is a bit older than these two ladies and he doesn t seem to bother them i have had dalmatian sailfin gold dust lyretail crosses before so i know it can be done and yes they are gorgeous fish that i can t find anywhere in stores sadly a goldfish that i was forced to keep in my tank attacked and ate my two young males and that was the last of the line i am trying to restore it but my sailfin male molly is more interested in eating food and chasing everyone away from his findings i looked at her lyretail fry last night and found that one was pale with black dots some where just pale one was orange with dark reddish orange spots some where just a reddish orange and three appear to have a gold dust pattern orange head grayish body i was wondering what genes do creamsickle mollies carry and what kinds of babies can they have since it seems i can t categorize my fry into one group except for lyretail also they are getting a bit big for their box but not quite big enough for the tank male molly has huge mouth and betta will eat anything there are a few babies that are huge then the majority are medium then there is one or two baby mollies that are really tiney should i separate them into two breeding boxes so they grow bigger and get more food there are babies in all so there would be in each box you probaly will end up having some mollies that arent creamsickles and maybe some gold dust and a few dalmation crosses you should put the bigger ones in one tank and the small in another Sailfin Molly Discus (fish) Cheetah Leopard Goldfish Clownfish Shark Dog Elephant Horse The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Piccolo Junior Saga Futurama (TV series - season 4) AFI 100 Years series Minor Harry Potter Beasts Sea-Monkey Cat Potato EastEnders Ron and Fez Characters in the Smurfs Chopsticks YuYu Hakusho Ocean's Twelve 101 Dalmatians: The Series Dalmatian Lion Hamster Futurama (TV series - season 5) Battle of Kursk Second Battle of El Alamein The Amber Spyglass Ron Weasley The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Hamburger Fugu Pysanka Salad Fingers Textile manufacturing Runaways (comics) Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) God Emperor of Dune Squirrel Puma Breastfeeding Tofu Cat coat genetics Unreal Joke 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Legend of Zelda series enemies Trish Stratus The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Guinea pig The Time Machine Breakfast Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Gaia Online Paramount Pictures USS Yorktown (CV-5) Knots Landing Queen (band) Korean cuisine French fries Extraterrestrial skies Kurt Cobain Chicken Cuisine of Denmark Tasmanian Devil Tank Mario Marilyn Monroe Red Squirrel Chocolate Fancy rat Sin City Creatures in Bionicle Marine aquarium RuneScape locations The Inside Gray Wolf Little Britain Conspiracy (TNG episode) Pet skunk My Little Pony Mario series enemies Honeybee Armoured warfare Frankie Laine Geology of the Grand Canyon area Shaggy dog story Tunisia Campaign Bengali cuisine Capercaillie
