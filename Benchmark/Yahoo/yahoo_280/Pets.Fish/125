my guppies are dropping down and cannot swim in an hour they die is there any way to prevent i changed the water however some of my guppies cannot swim what do i do should i take out the healthy looking one into another tank i placed them into a bucket to clean out the water and the next thing i know they are dropping dead what should i do to prevent anymore from dying i cleaned out the bucket well and washed my hands with soap before doing anything i tried returning them to the original tank but they seem to still be sick i had another tank since there were many different sizes of guppies but it they all seemed to be very healthy should i try placing them into that tank also what do i do with the guppies that just stay on the bottom and cannot swim or move i agree with the above about shocking the fish you also need to make absolutely sure that no soap gets transferred from your hands into the water how is your water quality do you have a water test kit you need to be checking ammonia nitrites and nitrates regularly and you need to cycle your tank this keeps your water safe for your fish without having to change the water as much water changes do stress out your fish and water changes even more so search for aquarium cycling on the web and you'll find plenty of good information and if you need any help feel free to email me Marine aquarium Menstrual cup Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Eutrophication Dairy Dry cleaning Sea-Monkey Saturn V Sewage treatment Sento First aid Soap Water Aquarium Fugu Thermal power station Bong Biogeochemical cycle Gar Fishing Fish farming Fire fighting Avalanche Diseases of the honeybee Seine (fishing) Nutrient Cruising (maritime) Mattress USS Tiru (SS-416) Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hygiene Pocket cruiser Myxobolus cerebralis Cyanide Swimming pool Poker jargon Infantilism Computer virus Discus (fish) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ammonia The Dalek Invasion of Earth Swimming The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Brewery Upholstery Web crawler Hyperthermia Menstrual cycle EastEnders Drowning Foodborne illness Ammonium nitrate Breaststroke The Amber Spyglass Shark Soil life Salmon Rebreather Clownfish Pretty Good Privacy Sodium chloride Bottlenose Dolphin E85 Water (molecule) Coral reef Goldfish Autonomous building USS Tunny (SS-282) Hard water Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Water purification Glass Glossary of climbing terms RuneScape quests Water polo Diving Oplan Bojinka Textile manufacturing Japanese toilet Philosophy of space and time Guppy Nitrogen cycle Shrimp farm Kashrut Bhopal disaster Antarctic krill Dishwasher Soap opera Hamster Fecal incontinence Battle of France Giant squid Whale Biodiesel Firefighter Eczema Advance fee fraud Fossil fuel power plant
