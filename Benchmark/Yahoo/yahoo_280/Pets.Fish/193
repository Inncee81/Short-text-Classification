arowana jon v voilet fusion super red arowana us spoon head voilet super red arowana us chilli red arowana us red tail gold arowana us wich should i chose and the prisecs are to mouch diffrant and do u think they r really difrant like this hey zoz just got back in i can't say i personally am much impressed with the violet super reds to be honest i think a more realistic name for it should be malay blue xback red is what they more look like chilli red at is a good price i think i'm going to link you some sites i think give an accurate picture of what you can expect to pay rtg's are popular in asia for sure i personally prefer the blood reds or chili's myself but if you really like it it sounds like you're paying for a younger arowana which is ideal by getting a younger arowana you can watch them grow and watch thier colors shift and brighten as they age difference in prices are basically two major factors is the grade of the fish and is the location you buy them from bc is correct in the point that if you don't have your arowana microchipped then you run a risk of someone finding out your arwoana was taken from the wild and you could face signifcant legal action because of that your safe bet is to get one from one of the farms that grow raise and microchip them you pay slightly more but the confidence level that you are getting a fish that you are paying for is better there have been reports of rtg's being dyed to simulate a blood or super red thus the person paying a higher price for a lesser quality fish if you buy right from a reputable farm you don't have to worry about this and you'll get documents certifying the bloodline and microchip of your arowana the way i see it is like this if you are going to pay this kind of money for a great fish like this you might as well take the time to buy it from a reputable seller you protect yourself and are more likely to get the actual fish you are paying for if you buy from someone off the streets you have no guarentee's here's some links to read over i'm sorry i didn't get back to your email requests sooner i was away this weekend for some time just getting back in now it's good to know i have your trust and that you know the difference between an accurate answer and an answer that is somewhat questionable and full of bs as always you may email me anytime you need and if you need more extensive help you can get it at fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv Poker jargon Microeconomics Plame affair Inflation Life insurance Surveillance Diamond Red Hot Chili Peppers Gold standard Supply and demand Internet fraud Contract Commodity markets Hyperinflation Economics Game show Blackjack Capitalism TLC Health insurance Dog agility Advertising 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Jeopardy!
