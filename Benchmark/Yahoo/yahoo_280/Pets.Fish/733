why is this fish so popular i've been seeing a few people asking about keeping this fish called an arowana on here when i googled it i saw this fish gets pretty big we have a gallon tank in our home and we keep some clown loaches and a couple oscars in it this fish looks nice but if it gets that big i would think that would cost alot of money wouldn't it are these fish hard to care for and would you reccomend one and why thanks arowanas especially the asian species are only found in a few countries within south east asia they are getting rare in the wild and are protected under cites some people likes to keep large fishes and other love rare species with the improvement in aqua culture technology acquiring this fish is now possible as there have been successful farm cultured fishes available in those countries the law in the west still forbids or makes it very difficult for westerners to obtain these fish therefore there are also people who are into fishes that no one else keeps kinda like eating the forbidden fruit even if you can acquire one it wouldn't come cheap and the grace and majestic attitude of this fish only comes only when the fish is mature so you gotta invest and take good care of it before you get any returns personally i don't think it's hard to care for as with any fishes knowledge of it's requirements pristine water and plenty of room to swim will ensure that your pet is happy arowana feed on insects worms feeder fishes and some even pellets so that ain't too fussy and eats what most predatory fishes eats and whether it's nice beauty is in the eyes of the beholder personally i love the look of the matured specimens in asia espeically with the chinese the arowana is said to bring the keeper luck and prosperity thats another reason why they are so sort after Chicken Shrimp farm Gar Discus (fish) Goldfish Hamster Rice Clown loach Marine aquarium Cheetah Domestic rabbit Poker jargon Clownfish Tilapia Animal Crossing Agriculture Kashrut Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Apple Theory of conduct Pysanka Salmon Aquarium Kosher foods Myxobolus cerebralis Shark Durian Monster Rancher monsters Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Taboo food and drink Fishing Seabird Whaling Economic history of Canada Cat Mushroom hunting Loach Original sin Spider RuneScape quests Nile crocodile Rise of Nations Aquaculture Aqua Teen Hunger Force Bat Tarantula Cuisine of Malaysia American Alligator Beetle Gray Wolf Chinese cuisine Physical attractiveness Summa Theologiae Care Bears Garfield Giant Panda Plastic Hunting Fugu American individualist anarchism Economy of Africa Axolotl Cliff Richard Orca Halfbeak Hydrogen economy Lamprey Guns, Germs, and Steel French cuisine Killifish Rich Mullins Fruits Basket Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tlingit Dairy Sea-Monkey Sauna Bamboo Lake Burley Griffin Vegetarianism Coelacanth Conker's Bad Fur Day Characters in the Smurfs Mail-order bride Patent Free trade Humphrey Bogart MMORPG
