safe aquarium rocks and how to test hi i was wondering if the rocks that i have been getting from the bank and bottom of my creek is safe for an aquarium i am planning on using them for cave making in my g some are thin and flat round thick and square is there any way to accurately test them thanks in advance there are a few tests you can do first you should get them cleaned up so it's the rocks that you'll be testing not anything growing on them put them in some hot water and scrub them a little with an old toothbrush or something similar then let them air dry once they're dry put a few drops of vineger on them and see if they fizz and produce bubbles if so these have carbonates in them and they'll raise your ph these wouldn't be good to use unless you have cichlids that need higher ph water rinse the vinegar off then put them into a clean container of water for about a week after the time is up look to see if there's an oily film on the water if you can it's also a good idea to test the ph of the water they were in a pet store can also do this and compare this to the ph of the water source if the ph of the water the rocks were in in below and your water shource isn't you don't want these in your tank some sandstones contain small amounts of pyrite fool's gold and this will make your water too acidic other than the rocks you've eliminated with the above tests they should be okay to use Carbon dioxide Brewery Dry cleaning Marine aquarium Hamster Nuclear power Polyethylene terephthalate Bread Sugar beet Bong Aquarium Energy development Origin of life Tooth Textile manufacturing Acetic acid Vinegar Cookware and bakeware Sento Discus (fish) M16 (rifle) Death Valley National Park Drill bit Wok Poker jargon Casting Sulfuric acid Pebble bed reactor Japanese tea ceremony Renewable energy Thermal power station Heinkel He 100 Internal ballistics B-47 Stratojet Ice core Opportunity rover Knife Tofu Anchor Dairy Mineral Sulfur Dishwasher Goldfish Solar power Fire extinguisher Glacier Diving suit Welding Zambezi Flat tax Porosity Rebreather Nuclear weapon design Menstrual cup Pyrite Biodiesel Four square Tilapia Plastic Ramen Mattress E85 Flood geology Desert Water (molecule) Omega-3 fatty acid Jellyfish Hydroponics Survival skills Geology of the Grand Canyon area Gilding Autonomous building Cheese RuneScape skills Novelty (locomotive) Carbon nanotube Automobile emissions control Gas metal arc welding Campfire Hemp Dialysis Heinkel He 112 Motor oil Carbon dioxide sink Oscilloscope Wine making Tuff Halitosis Carlsbad Caverns National Park Delaware Basin Scuba set Hydrogen economy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sedimentary rock Flax Compiler optimization Glossary of firefighting equipment Billboard Hot 100
