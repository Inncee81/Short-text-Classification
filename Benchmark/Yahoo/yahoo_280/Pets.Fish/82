which on would you choose i cant decide coral beauty or flame angel i think there may be to much red color in the tank so there for i would say coral beauty but there is already an orchid dotty back which is purple so what would you pick both are beautiful fish the only problem when choosing a dwarf angel or any angel for that mater is you can only have one per tank i personally like the rusty angels because everyone has a coral beauty or a flame so its a cool fish to have when someone sees it and it looks like a coral beauty but with more red blue and orange if you found a flame and a coral beauty in a store that you like id look at which one looks nicer and has more defined color you cant go wrong with either but once again you can only have one per tank another really nice dwarf angel is the multicolor pygmy angel these are very nice but have a high price tag if your tank is large enough to go for a larger angel my personal favorite is the imperator angel but these fish need a tank of at least gallons preferably more the color change they go through from babies to adults is amazing here is a site that shows them in both stages http www liveaquaria com product prod display cfm pcatid anyway i hope this helps and doesnt make you decision harder i love angelfish so i have so many tankis just so i can keep various species good luck and im sure you will be happy with whatever choice you make Discus (fish) Marine aquarium My Little Pony Pysanka CPU cache Color Freshwater angelfish Atomic Kitten Dragon Booster Sea-Monkey Orchidaceae Reef tank Hydrogen economy Pitaten Utilitarianism 2000 Australian Grand Prix Microeconomics Los Angeles Kings Butterflyfish Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Brewery Aquarium Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Mary Jane Watson AFI 100 Years series Timeline of alternative rock Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Fantasmic!
