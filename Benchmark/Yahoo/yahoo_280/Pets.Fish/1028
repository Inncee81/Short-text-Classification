selling fish for profit i am wondering if there is a website or if petshops will buy fish that i have raised most of the fish i am selling are oscar fish and jack dempsy fish which are fairy expensive thanks even most of the privately owned pet shops won't buy them anymore at most they will give you store credit or an exchange in which they will benefit from best thing you can do is put ads in your local paper you can try craigslist but they have banned the listings of pets for sale however you can list it in the pets section and add an adoption fee good luck but don't expect much of a profit it will probably be more work on your part than its worth Neopets Wal-Mart Gaia Online Commodore International Poker jargon Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation Temasek Holdings UK Singles Chart Gross domestic product Capitalism Craigslist Tesco Amazon.com Money Commodity Insurance Monetary policy Cigarette Short selling Capital accumulation Productive and unproductive labour Donald Trump Best Buy Citigroup Inventory Privatization Gold standard Animal Crossing Gold as an investment Property (ownership right) Credit card Fish and chips Tax Dot-com Economy of India Mergers and acquisitions Supermarket Discus (fish) Anarchism and capitalism Bank MapleStory Externality United Artists Retailer Internet fraud Public good Investment bank Loss leader $ale of the Century Law of value Neighbours Our Gang Surplus value Pop Art: Pet Shop Boys - The Hits Security (finance) Electronic commerce RuneScape skills Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pet store Supply and demand Gift economy Jennifer Lopez Warner Bros.
