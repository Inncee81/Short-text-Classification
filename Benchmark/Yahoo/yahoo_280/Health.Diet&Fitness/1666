to lose weight is it best to have a warrior mentality to keep the fat off and be healthy long term no in my own opinion all the warrior mentality invites is a reason to grow tired of a rigid routine and eventually give up on it i think that the best move is to incorporate any dietary changes into your lifestyle you should embrace dietary changes because you want to not because you think you should in other words seek out dishes that are healthy but also pleasurable rather than tasteless foods that you have to choke down believe me in this day and age they aren't hard to come by i recommend cooking light magazine for one source in addition you can find shows on food network dedicated to preparing delicious but healthy meals in the end this is what really matters you will never be able to maintain a diet that doesn't also give you pleasure that's against human nature btw to me the most important diet accessory is exercise exercise enough and you'll be able to take more liberties with your diet Veganism Food Dietary fiber Folic acid Vegetarianism Atkins Nutritional Approach Anorexia nervosa Kashrut Prostate cancer Obesity Omega-3 fatty acid Nutrition Low-carbohydrate diet Weight training Milk Bodybuilding Super Size Me Egg (food) Coeliac disease Vitamin C Coronary heart disease Hypoglycemia Weight loss Vitamin Raw food diet Fugu Recipe Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Hamster Cuisine of the Southern United States Organic food Tomato Healthy eating Urinary incontinence Jewish cuisine French fries Acorn Addiction Chronic fatigue syndrome Adjustable gastric band Cheese Calorie restriction Fecal incontinence Hamburger Domesticated turkey Ramen MyPyramid Sant Thakar Singh Human height Macrobiotic diet Hypertension Osteoarthritis South Beach diet 613 mitzvot Theory of conduct Vegetarianism and religion Tooth Fancy rat Watermelon Equine conformation Water Brain Colorectal cancer Natural health Insulin Domestic rabbit Food guide pyramid Dietary supplement Sauerkraut Guinea pig Fast food Soybean Halaal Peruvian cuisine Sugar substitute Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eating Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cuisine of Denmark Nicomachean Ethics Cereal Taboo food and drink Sant Mat Cuisine of Malaysia Foodborne illness Rice Vegetarian nutrition Tea Bread Constipation Anemia Simone Weil Cajun
