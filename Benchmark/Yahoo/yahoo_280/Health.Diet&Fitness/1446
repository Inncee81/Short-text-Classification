how good of a weight loss plan do you think eating no sugar goods is i guess i've never really been a sugar head anyway but wondered what it would be like if i cut out pop candy cakes deserts basically anything more than iced tea barely sweetened and an occasional cup of coffee every now and then other than that i've always drank plenty of water and stay flushed and hydrated i usually eat only once during the night though is that really as bad as they say i work mid and so i wake up to late to eat breakfast and come home too late to eat at a decent time my schedule is all messed up let me know what you guys think not a very structured diet but it's better than not trying at all right hey thats great keep up the good work cutting sugar out of your diet is an extremely good way to lose weight you don't have to cut it out you know everything in moderation just dont gourge on it like some people do my mom whos diabetic cut out sugar from her diet and only uses it occasionaly and she lot a lot of weight in a shorter ammount of time i've also read that you should lessen your sugar intake not just for reducing but for your health as well there are many fruits that contain natural sugars which are very good for you apples bannanas blueberries etc etc fruit juice i suggest cool quenchers that stuff is sooooo good cheap too and has less sugar than usual juice brands is a great alternative to pop i've stopped drinking pop infact i haven't had it for over a year it's ok to have an occasional glass though if you really need it i've read on many websites about how its best to cut pop out especially when trying to lose weight diet pop contains aspartame which is a horrible excuse for sugar so try to avoid it real sugar is actually healthier people think honey is a good alternative to sugar and that is true but if you're looking at calories and sucrose they rank at pretty much the same iced tea has a surprisngly large ammount of sugar in it but if you drink it in moderation it certainly won't effect your weight loss the key to weight loss is things exercise eat balanced meals try to include all the food groups with healthy snacks thrown in raw fruit and veggies are great for snacks so is yogurt cheese cerial granola even crispy minis and try to get attequite sleep which i know must be hard cause you work so often it may take a while but you'll soon see and feel the results good luck and i wish you all the best also i hear that eating late at night is a myth that you'll gain weight but it does make sence as to why you would something about how your body takes a while to digest and absorb your foods nutrients and when you sleep your bodys digestion and metabolism slow down i did some research and found this website hope it helps http www goaskalice columbia edu html Dieting Healthy eating Sugar Fecal incontinence Hypoglycemia Milk Sugar substitute Chocolate Coffee Obesity Tooth Tea Hamster Food Sucralose Cuisine of the Philippines Folic acid Vegetarianism Low-carbohydrate diet Aspartame Alcoholic beverage Dietary fiber Ice cream Breastfeeding Raw food diet Insulin Cuisine of Denmark Sucrose Binge eating disorder Stomach cancer Diabetes mellitus Anorexia nervosa Tocopherol Vitamin C Weight training Cheese Sleep Crohn's disease Bodybuilding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tea (meal) Adjustable gastric band German cuisine French cuisine Jewish cuisine Japanese cuisine Egg (food) Hyperglycemia Gatorade Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Fasting Dairy Honey McDonald's Apple South Beach diet Cuisine of Argentina Word of Wisdom Calorie restriction Meal The Coca-Cola Company Cider Alzheimer's disease Caffeine Yoghurt Cuisine of Singapore Shit Diet soda In-N-Out Burger Glycogen storage disease type I Diarrhea Pancake Food guide pyramid Beer Prostate cancer Hamburger Sugar beet Wine Soy milk Water Cake Weight loss Bread Super Size Me Sugarcane Pomegranate Poker jargon Roman eating and drinking
