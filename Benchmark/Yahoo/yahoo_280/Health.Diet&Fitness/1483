how much protein i weight train and do cardio regularly and have a good schedule and all that stuff but my question is i know that you're supposed to take gram of protein for every pound of body weight you are but is that just on days you do weights is there a formula for how much to take on days you don't do weights or do you just take that amount everyday regardless thanks you want to eat the same thing on days your life weights as well on your rest days the only thing you skip is your immediate post workout snack if you take one like for me on days i don't lift weights i won't have a whey protein shake on days your resting your body is still rebuilding so it still needs just as many nutrients as on days you are lifting Bodybuilding Weight training Dieting Mass Pound Milk Veganism Tocopherol Coeliac disease Adjustable gastric band Atkins Nutritional Approach Soybean Protein Guinea pig Slim Fast Dairy Healthy eating Nutrient Weight Weightlifting Binge eating disorder The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Exercise Raw food diet Sumo Obesity Explosive material Cell (biology) Nutrition Vitamin C Breastfeeding Protein-energy malnutrition Babe Ruth Motility Life Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Cooking weights and measures Body type (exercise) The nature of God in Western theology Sugar substitute Anorexia nervosa Spider Boxing training Social rule Triathlon Illegal drug trade Boxing Eye Sugar beet Acorn Energy Signal transduction Hypoglycemia Vegetarian nutrition Experiment Atomic mass Insulin Satchel Paige Skateboarding trick Polymer Food Fancy rat Diarrhea Chair Mixed martial arts Billboard Hot 100 Units of measurement Muscle Andrew Dice Clay Bonnie J.
