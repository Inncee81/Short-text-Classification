what happened to my self esteem last year i was bigger than i have ever been and i was not my athletic self yet i was happier more carefree more selfesteem and i felt sexy now that i am the weight all girls wish to be and i am in better running shape than ever i cant seem to stop looking in the mirror watching every little thing that goes in my mouth i cant enjoy a dinner and drinks without feeling terrible about it i cant be intimate with my boyfriend because i dont feel sexy what happened why do i feel this way last year you were just being yourself you were focused on the real you you are more than just matter and energy you are a living breathing human being capable of joy anger sadness and rebellion but somewhere along the way you got sidetracked all of us desire pleasure and peace of mind and soul you just thought you could control how and when you got that by making yourself into some perfect ideal and when you lost a little weight you felt on top of the world your self esteem soared why because a few ounces of phospholipids in your thighs got converted to energy producing compounds great reason to feel worth something but it's so easy it's so predictable let's do it again what goes up must come down when you were in control you were happy when you weren't in control i e the energy molecules in your body went back into the fat cells where they belonged then you felt terrible you must be the worst person alive you can't even turn oxygen into carbon dioxide without screwing it up you you you you defective bionic machine you no wonder you're miserable give it up you're not a number ticking off the scale isn't going to make you happy so throw it away you're better than that remember a time when you were in love with life you couldn't be all you wanted to be all the time but darnit you learned from those mistakes you made limeade when the world gave you lemons and you squirted it smack in the devil's eye seriously throw the scale away it's not doing you any good and as a side note malnutrition will totally kill your sex drive and give you anxiety depression to boot your body is designed to maintain itself well as long as you feed it properly Shaggy dog story Carbon dioxide Biochemistry Happiness Explosive material Theory of conduct Pitaten Friends Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Sin City Equine conformation About a Boy The Amber Spyglass Dead Like Me W.
