how to lose about pounds every day i havent been eating much every day mostly only one thing every day it has been days now and im starting to use a bike like excerising tool and also a walking running tool too if i use it for just about minutes every day and eat only once or twice a day how many puonds will i loose in just weeks total thanks for you answers ok first you have to know that you just can't lose pounds a day you can fall for those stupid gimmicks and fad diets out there but they don't work diets also don't work you'll lose weight for a bit then you'll put it all back on plus some extra and that's really bad for you losing weight and keeping it off is a commitment don't starve yourself because firstly it's unhealthy secondly you get more fat and thirdly you get even more fat because you're most likely to rebound with your appetite and suddenly eat a lot while your metabolism is low because you were starving yourself which will of course result in gaining weight dramatically to keep your metabolism up and running exercise before breakfast this'll kick start your metabolism and also eat a big healthy breakfast drink a lot of water throughout the day as well as this also keeps the metabolism going instead of going for chips go for something else like pretzels if you hate drinking just water for the whole day you could add a bit of flavoured water to your diet swimming is good as it uses every muscle in your body you could also go out and play some sort of sport with your friends or maybe i dunno climb a mountain lol but most importantly make it fun so it's not boring tell you what else is boring cardio high intensity interval training is much better that means instead of exercising at one same steady pace for ages do short big bursts every seconds to minutes take it easy and good luck Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Weight training Bodybuilding Exercise Marathon (sport) Binge eating disorder Triathlon Anorexia nervosa Super Size Me Social rule Tocopherol Insulin Chocolate Little Britain Nutrition Diving Folic acid Low-carbohydrate diet First aid Hypoglycemia Mountaineering Diabetes mellitus Shaggy dog story Bicycle Hamster Milk Bread Piccolo Junior Saga Mountain bike Babe Ruth Water About a Boy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Domestic rabbit Body type (exercise) Weight loss Water polo Aerial (dance move) Conker's Bad Fur Day Professional wrestling slang Veganism Running Kyle Broflovski Coconut crab Coronary heart disease Glossary of climbing terms Shit Norway national football team Breastfeeding Insulin resistance Prostate cancer Clinical depression Sugar substitute Margarine New York Giants EastEnders Chinese food therapy Poker jargon Egg (food) Fancy rat Cleveland Browns Extreme Programming Bubble Bobble Jumpstart 3rd Grade Ron and Fez Tasmanian Devil Puberty Guinea pig Urinary incontinence Theory of conduct South Park Hiberno-English Vegeta Drowning Muscle Jackass: The Movie Gray Wolf Blood (computer game) FoxTrot Camp Lazlo Bacon Shark American Black Bear
