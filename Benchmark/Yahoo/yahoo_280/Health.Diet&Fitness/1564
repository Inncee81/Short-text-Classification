going vegan i have a friend who switched recently to a vegan diet and i was wondering if this is healthy because it seems to me that eliminating meat and dairy would be harmful especially when i see the number of vitamins she takes in order to attempt to makeup for what she doesn't eat in her diet as a matter of fact a vegan diet can be far more healthy than a carnivore diet if you know what you are doing taking a lot of vitamins can be potentially dangerous and your friends should get in touch with a good nutritionist to make sure she isn't taking too much of something dairy and meat products are commonly linked to obesity osteoporosis prostate cancer and many other health problems but don't take my word for it if you are interested in learning more about vegan diets i would recommend reading diet for a new america it can be found at borders b n or on amazon bottom line is as i said in the beginning it is not unhealthy as long as she is educated on what she is doing Veganism Vegetarianism Milk Nutrition Dieting Raw food diet Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Prostate cancer Food guide pyramid Vegetarian nutrition Tocopherol Healthy eating Food Vitamin C Folic acid Coronary heart disease Domestic rabbit Vitamin D Coeliac disease Cyanocobalamin Soybean Kashrut Guinea pig Low-carbohydrate diet Breastfeeding Omega-3 fatty acid Paleolithic diet Super Size Me Osteoporosis Natural Hygiene Cheese Binge eating disorder Hamster Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Trans fat Organic food Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Dietary fiber Dairy Crohn's disease Vitamin Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Tofu Animal rights Ferret Carnivore Vegetarian cuisine Dog Pet skunk Stomach cancer Ramen Vegetarianism and religion MyPyramid Peter Singer Dietary supplement Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Hamburger Meat analogue Soy milk Chronic fatigue syndrome Addiction Hypertension Fruitarianism Fecal incontinence Factory farming Retinol Junk food Rickets Theory of conduct Cat Taboo food and drink Cat food Cirrhosis Masturbation Coca-Cola Adjustable gastric band Antioxidant Lifestyle diseases (alternative medicine) Traditional Chinese medicine Colorectal cancer Kosher foods Chocolate McDonald's South Beach diet Human height Oily fish Malnutrition Tomato Soft drink Chicken Genetically modified food
