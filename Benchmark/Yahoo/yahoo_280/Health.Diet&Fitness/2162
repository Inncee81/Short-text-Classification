fat in one day i was just wondering if you can get fatter in just one day like where you can notice on your stomach i exercise everyday and eat healthy but yesterday i didn't get to exercise a lot only minutes of walking and i ate more than usual now today even though i went back to my normal routine i look fatter like i gained weight back in my stomach sometimes i get paranoid about that and when i ask people what they think they say im wrong i'm also recovering from an eating disorder so my body image is kinda screwed up so is it possible to gain fat back in just one day or am i just being paranoid your stomach expands when you eat and if you a person who is generally slender this may show to the naked eye after eating and you may appear fatter often you see people in movies on tv undoing their top pants button or belt after eating the joke being that their pants are now too tight because their stomach expanded from eating the average person burns calories per day and it is only calories that you did not burn which can possibly converted to fat so the only way you could put on fat weight in one day would be to eat an overwhelming number of calories while exerting aboslutely no energy like laying in bed all day even then the weight you put on would be minimal at best keep in mind that your weight fluctuates naturally throughout the day you could weigh pounds in the morning and then get on the scale and it says pounds in the afternoon this is part of the body's natural function this is why it is wise to only weigh yourself once a week as a day to day measurement of your weight does not give you an accurate depiction of your weight gain or loss Dieting Anorexia nervosa Atkins Nutritional Approach Super Size Me Weight training Weight loss Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Thermoregulation Clinical depression Garfield Adjustable gastric band Calorie Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Weight Mass Tocopherol Pound Exercise Mattress Hyperglycemia Piccolo Junior Saga Body mass index Calorie restriction Homer Simpson Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Bodybuilding 613 mitzvot Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Invader Zim Temperature Nutrition Equine conformation Omega-3 fatty acid Psychosis Gravity Ton Binge eating disorder Aerial (dance move) Little Britain Milk Veganism Muscle Internal ballistics South Beach diet Weight Watchers Dialysis Russian joke Gastric bypass surgery Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Hydrogen economy Social rule Professional wrestling throws Life extension Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Normal distribution Boxing Body image Explosive material Tightlacing Babe Ruth Osteoarthritis Brown Bear Macular degeneration Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) USS Waters (DD-115) Nuclear fusion Autopsy USS Yorktown (CV-10) Characters of Naruto Jackass: The Movie Treehouse of Horror XV USS Indianapolis (CA-35) Anchor Comanche American Black Bear Magnetic resonance imaging Shen Gong Wu Hamburger The Contender (television series) Healthy eating Egg (food) Carbon dioxide Gastroparesis Galileo spacecraft Paul Is Dead Kidney Trans fat Eating disorder
