weight lifting ok first thing first do not pay attention to my avatar it is my mom's im a year old dude in athletics and i lift heavy weights all the time mostly on bench and the other day i was lifting too much but i was trying to push myself and i did what i was shooting for as far as the reps and the weighs go but after i got up i was light headded and i had a terrible pain in the back of my neck on the right side and it lingered there for about weeks it didnt hurt when i was just sittin around but when i lifted anything bent over to tie my shoes or even sneazed it would come back what did i do the reason im asking is because i think i did it again only this time its in my lower back on the left side its bad enough to where it got really close to sending me to my knees a little while ago it feels almost like pluracy or something but its not sounds to me like you just strained yourself dude you should take it easy for a few days Weight training Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling attacks Casualty lifting Chair Piledriver (professional wrestling) Weightlifting Powerlifting 1957 World Series Dog training Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Suplex Diving Babe Ruth Skateboarding trick Powerbomb Swingout Spanking Trapping Doom enemies Badminton Stone Cold Steve Austin Piano Hogtie bondage Shaggy dog story Breastfeeding Sport rowing Battles of Lexington and Concord Anchor Backstroke Sperm Whale Sailing Blink-182 Snooker Fast bowling Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Helicopter The Marshall Mathers LP Flight controls Repetitive strain injury Horse gait Volleyball Backbreaker Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Doug Boxing Autopsy Glossary of partner dance terms Neckbreaker M16 (rifle) Dieting Marching band Internal ballistics The Shining (film) Bicycle Mixed martial arts Lawn mower Piccolo Junior Saga Charleston (dance move) High-heeled shoe The Caves of Androzani Glossary of climbing terms Clean and jerk Billboard Hot 100 Eddie Guerrero Horizontal bar Tank Ben Johnson (athlete) Oasis (band) Recumbent bicycle Battlebots Table tennis The Amber Spyglass Breaststroke Pinball Carpal tunnel syndrome Cindy Sheehan Parade (military) Operation Market Garden Denis Law Jackass: The Movie Pole vault Harp Tiger I Bench press Swept wing Sport utility vehicle Golf club (equipment) Rope Jazz dance moves Car handling Jean Grey Tenshinhan Contortion Front crawl Back injury
