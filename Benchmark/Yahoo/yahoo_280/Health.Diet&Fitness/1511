fast food and im ashamed so basically i never really have a chance to eat so im always stopping at a fast food place what are some fast alternatives that i could go eat at or pick something up thanks much try preparing your own food ahead of time get the minute cookbook or a crockpot and the fix it and forget about it cookbook fast foods typically are loaded with salt and fats plus you never eat your fruits and veggies unless you're conscious about it and order the fruit instead of the fries the biggest problem is the empty calories that soda has even diet sodas are not good for you every day very acidic and has nothing good in it except the water which is countered by the other ingredients if you must do the fast food try getting the milk instead of the soda fruit instead of the fries i tend to order the big kids meal at mcdonalds subway has the option of substituting the chips with raisins or apples and i believe you can also subsitute the drink at least they have those options but try to just prepare your own foods ahead of time so that you can make a quick stop home to eat good luck Hamburger Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Bread Veganism Food Fast food Ramen In-N-Out Burger Tofu French fries French cuisine Fish and chips Cuisine of the Southern United States Soft drink Chocolate Dieting Egg (food) Jewish cuisine Healthy eating Cuisine of Malaysia Tooth Fasting Vinegar Hypoglycemia Peruvian cuisine Super Size Me Cuisine of the Philippines Vegetarian cuisine Cheese Polish cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Cuisine of Africa Snack food Biscuit Pizza Japanese cuisine Ice cream Sauerkraut Pancake Potato Junk food Recipe German cuisine Coffee Hamster 613 mitzvot Cuisine of Brazil Low-carbohydrate diet Happy Meal Fast-food restaurant Trans fat The Coca-Cola Company Breastfeeding Chinese cuisine Milkshake Milk Curry Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Argentina Apple Kashrut Porridge Salmon Drink Organic food Korean cuisine Food preservation Apple pie Soy milk Rice pudding Kosher foods Sandwich Soul food Hot dog British cuisine Nutrition Roman eating and drinking Street food Mayonnaise Irish cuisine Hydrochloric acid Dietary fiber Anorexia nervosa Olive oil Obesity Restaurant Soup Swedish cuisine Chopsticks Sushi
