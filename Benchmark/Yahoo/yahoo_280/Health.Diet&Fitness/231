a question for dieticians and nutritionists or anybody with a degree of knowlegde in the field i eat at least portions of fruit a day i have two slices of pineapple and two oranges as a general rule daily the other portions vary part one of the question what are the long term benefits of eating pineapple and orange and part citric acid has been proven an efficient agent in the breakdown of grease and fat hence why it's used in many cleaning agents does it also work in the same way within the body i have noticed a difference in my general health and in my weight i'm not talking drastic change in weight but i feel and look slimmer i am convinced that citric acid helps break down the fatty deposits within my body organic acids in varying percentages exist in all fruits and vegetables in many foods the acid exists in minute percentages in none of them is the percentage of acid very great they have a very pleasing flavor and are relished by everyone a few of these the most common ones are as follow citric acid is found in oranges lemons limes grapefruit tangerines qumquats pineapples pomegranates tomatoes citrons quinces gooseberries raspberries strawberries currants cranberries and many others either as an acid or else combined with alkaline salts forming citrates citric acid is absorbed from the digestive tract and after being decomposed in the body is eliminated by the kidneys as sodium carbonate citric acid is one of a series of compounds involved in the physiological oxidation of stored fats not digestive food eaten fats proteins and carbohydrates to carbon dioxide and water krebs cycle the process by which complex food is broken down into simple compounds by chemical processes fats are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids proteins into amino acids and starch into glucose chemical digestion depends on enzymes secreted by cells lining the alimentary canal or by cells in the pancreas chemical digestion is aided by chewing which physically breaks down large chunks of food into smaller pieces this is sometimes called mechanical digestion fat digestion is accelerated by bile secreted by the liver bile is stored in the gall bladder until needed in the small intestine where it emulsifies fat increasing the surface area on which enzymes can act as all first year chemistry students learn when you combine a fat with an acid the fat turns into soap a classic saponification reaction answer to part long term benefits answer to part citrus fruits and juices are a known natural source of dietary citrate of all the citrus juices lemon juice appears to have the highest concentration of citrate therefore lemonade therapy has been proposed as a potential treatment for patients with hypocitraturia we retrospectively evaluated the impact of long term lemonade therapy citric acid on urinary metabolic parameters and stone formation in patients with hypocitraturic nephrolithiasis do not worry about the above problems because it is the treatment that answers you first question here they found no adverse effects to this treatment even after months these patients had been consumming far greater amounts of citric acid from lemons than you are eating at present here we have a treatment that actually has medical benefits in long term usage here are the other vitamins and minerals found in an orange pineapple orange the good this food is very low in saturated fat cholesterol and sodium it is also a good source of thiamin folate and potassium and a very good source of dietary fiber and vitamin c the bad a large portion of the calories in this food come from sugars pineapple the good this food is very low in saturated fat cholesterol and sodium it is also a good source of dietary fiber thiamin vitamin b and copper and a very good source of vitamin c and manganese the bad a large portion of the calories in this food come from sugars the body is very good at regulating our consumtion of most of the vitamins and minerals that we consume there are some though that become toxic taken in high levels but thats anouther question
