has anyone tried the xenical capsule i love them they do work but like any weight loss method you do have to work with them they prevent the body absorbing about of your daily fat intake this fat comes out when you go to the loo it's bright orange oil you poo out there are problems if you eat really high fat food you don't always get a choice about when that oil gets poo'ed out so if you eat a huge bag of crisps and mcdonalds you can expect to 'oil yourself' minutes later in the early days i ate croissants then oilled myself in the restaurant it was my own fault the second problem is that people get over confident xenical can only take of your fat intake people get cocky and eat loads thinking 'xenical will take care of it' it won't it'll only ever take if you don't watch what you eat on xenical you can still gain weight personally i love xenical but i did take the time to learn how to use it best for me xxx Obesity Dieting Tocopherol Orlistat Atkins Nutritional Approach Anorexia nervosa Veganism Insulin Milk Hypoglycemia Nutrition Breakfast Low-carbohydrate diet Folic acid Super Size Me Fast food Breastfeeding Chocolate Omega-3 fatty acid Fecal incontinence Fasting Vitamin Binge eating disorder Diabetes mellitus Prostate cancer 613 mitzvot Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hyperglycemia Jet engine Vegetarianism Protein-energy malnutrition Diarrhea Urinary incontinence Sugar substitute Weight loss Fat French fries Weight training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shit Ron and Fez Food guide pyramid Turbocharger Oily fish Convair B-36 Water Coronary heart disease Guinea pig Protein Raw food diet French cuisine Bodybuilding Equine conformation Tofu Trans fat Cuisine of Denmark Olive oil Hamster Carbon dioxide Stomach cancer South Beach diet Boxing training Tooth Pig (zodiac) Fancy rat Cholesterol Sumo Margarine Carburetor Vegeta Gastric bypass surgery Fish and chips Dialysis Egg (food) Magnesium Healthy eating Antioxidant Food preservation Phoebe Buffay's songs Clinical depression Hydrogen economy Potassium Little Britain Bacon Glycogen storage disease type I Jewish cuisine Microwave oven Cystic fibrosis Alzheimer's disease Vitamin D Hamburger Dioxin Korban Adipose tissue Peanut Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Vitamin C
