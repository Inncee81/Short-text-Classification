dumbbell vs barbell bench press i don't own a barbell so i use dumbbells bench press what's da diff is da efficiency diff do dumbbells make u progress slower would i be able lift more w a barbell here s everything you need to know from someone who uses both and uses both often i m telling you this from years of personal experience and the research studies i ve read that confirmed everything that already seemed true to me first of all you will lift more using a barbell than you will with dumbbells on the bench press this is because dumbbells are a balancing act and require the use of what is known as stabilizers basically many smaller muscles that are involved in coordination balance and control using a barbell takes this out of the equation and allows you to drive up more weight because it s less about balance and more about raw power they are both absolutely necessary in developing a strong chest and a big one dumbbells will not make you progress slower but you may find that one exercise yields better results for you for me dumbbells actually do though i use both for optimal results otherwise i ll stop gaining another factor is that dumbbells because they are usually kept closer to the body due to balance issues will put more pressure on your shoulders and are arguably more effective for developing stronger front deltoids they also allow you to move in a natural range of motion since your hands are not locked into one position this makes dumbbells better for your rotator cuffs the root of many a shoulder injury and are overall a safer bet for this reason strength you gain from these exercises will crossover meaning when you make progress with dumbbells your barbell bench press will go up as well and vice versa they are codependent and you need to do both to get the most out of your workouts when i stop gaining strength after a few weeks of solid barbell benching i ll go to dumbbells and the gains will start coming again you need to rotate these and not get too stubborn about your favorite exercises always experiment you won t regret that since you don t own a barbell don t sweat it too much no pun intended you ll make gains just play around with different form i e try keeping the dumbbells closer to your body to hit those shoulders and then do some sets with your arms farther from your body to hit your pecs more directly throw in some flys like the other guy suggested and you ll make progress dumbbells are great and i ve probably used them more than the barbell in all of my training most guys gravitate towards the barbell bench press but they are missing out on a truly effective alternative just keep it up eat well get enough sleep and you ll have nothing to worry about hope some of this helps you out feel free to ask if something was confusing or if you have other questions and good luck Equine conformation Bench press Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds General relativity Obedience training Volleyball Poker jargon Dumbbell Diving Explosive material Suplex Gravity Black hole Skateboarding trick Swimming Mass Fast bowling Speed of light Car handling Tide Human position Swingout American football strategy Boxing Urinary incontinence Terminal ballistics Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Baroque chess Internal ballistics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Weightlifting Squat (exercise) Earring Helicopter Baseball Mixed martial arts Hard disk Physics Dieting Stopping power Humerus M16 (rifle) Bodybuilding Clinical depression Motorcycle Alexander Technique Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Atkins Nutritional Approach Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Professional wrestling attacks Fixed-wing aircraft The Contender (television series) Time travel Electric motor Tank Organic farming Traumatic brain injury Tai Chi Chuan Wind turbine Weightlessness Rugby union positions Tenshinhan Paragliding Kasparov versus The World Glossary of partner dance terms Contredanse Geodesy Chair Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Luminiferous aether Craps Bike lane debate Butterfly stroke Heinkel He 112 Glossary of climbing terms Spanking Breaststroke Gliding Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Password Vehicular cycling Balance disorder First flying machine Professional wrestling aerial techniques RISC Parachuting Welding Jet engine
