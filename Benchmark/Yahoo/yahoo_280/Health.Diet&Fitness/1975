help i ate so much today after week of dieting did i mess up the story is that for whole week i have been dieting and exercising really hard i managed to lose upto lbs by the th day but later on in the day today i over ate a lot of food my question is if i exercised and stuck with my diet all the other days of the week will i gain some lbs back because i screwed up on just day tomorrow morning will i see a difference in my weight kc no not at all oh you fell off your diet for one day but so what it's not a bad thing under these circumstances and you probably won't see much of a difference in your weight tomorrow now may i ask a question since this isn't im you can't say no can you do i conclude aright by believing that you are in just a little bit of psychological danger here i mean you seem just a bit well desperate about all this that i am a little concerned i think that you are dieting for the wrong reason whatever it is you see you're not relaxed and happy about having lost weight instead you're worried that you might not have lost enough or that you're going to gain back a little of the weight you've already lost as if that's going to be dangerous or fatal it isn't the sun will rise tomorrow and you can put yourself back on the proper eating plan and proceed as if you never fell off the wagon at all when it comes to the proper diet there's always tomorrow so don't worry about it ok so let's talk weight loss pounds in days is not a lot of real weight it's mostly water so you can expect it to fluctuate a bit from day to day and not be a steady downhill slope in weight loss aesop was right slow and steady wins the race you will have lost a pound or maybe two of weight that won't come back when you have a glass of water but that's all right weight loss and weight control is not a sprint it's a marathon and like a marathon it takes discipilne and patience you know that marathoners have been known to stumble and fall and get up and finish the race you can too i hope that you're doing this to be healthy and not to be thin i hope that you are exercising to become fit and not to be thin be gentle with yourself and lose weight slowly an steadily how are you eating are you eating from all the food groups are you taking time to enjoy your meals are you joking with the others at the table with you are you relaxed knowing that you're becoming more healthy and that your life is going to be better because of the good that you are doing yourself take it easy kc your weight is not your life the reading on your scale is not the tale of your worth you will lose weight and along the way the occasional party off your diet is simply like a vacation have fun when you do it knowing that tomorrow you'll be back on the diet but today you had fun you'll be fine Dieting Social rule Anorexia nervosa Marathon (sport) Garfield Equine conformation Mountaineering Super Size Me Breastfeeding Adjustable gastric band Obesity Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Insulin Fancy rat Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Binge eating disorder Hamster Prostate cancer 2000 Australian Grand Prix Professional wrestling slang Goodness and value theory The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Pitaten Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Poker jargon The Ashlee Simpson Show Spanish verbs Bodybuilding Famine Calvin and Hobbes Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Pound Singlish Paragliding Weight loss Norway national football team South Beach diet Human height Low-carbohydrate diet Coeliac disease Cleveland Browns Discordianism Seabiscuit Glossary of climbing terms The Apprentice 2 Blood (computer game) Bread Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism New York Giants Piccolo Junior Saga Terri Schiavo The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe New York Jets Babe Ruth EastEnders Radio controlled airplane Fecal incontinence The Smoking Room Extreme Programming Inflation Car handling Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Urinary incontinence Hey Jude Hypoglycemia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Diabetes mellitus Kodocha Stomach cancer Weight Watchers Confidence trick Tooth Folic acid Aikido Coffee Kashrut Motorcycle History of Test cricket (to 1883) RuneScape economy Microeconomics
