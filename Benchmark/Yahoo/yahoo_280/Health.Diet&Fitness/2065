questions about weight loss i recently started to watch what i eat and ride my bike to try and lose weight having had twins last year i have or sizes i need to lose to get back to normal i just started and already can see a few improvements although there's still a loooong ways to go but here's the problem for some reason i'm seeing growth in arm muscle although no toning really at all and it's causing some stretch marks on the under side of my arm i'm not trying to gain muscle there at all my arms were in my mind too big before anyway because i naturally have invisible muscle there it's there it's just not toned looking i'm a bit unsure how to lose the weight i want and tone my legs and stomach again i ride my bike daily and i do crunches without encouraging growth in my arms advice the arm muscle growth might just be from using your arms more on your bike but that really sounds strange cause i'm sure you're not doing enough to get serious bulk sometimes when you first start exercising things like that will happen before you start dropping the weight you might want to vary your routine by doing some jogging or speed walking i think that your best option though would be to find a group activity that you think it fun possibly kick boxing or palates you get an intense aerobic workout and it helps to keep you motivated Equine conformation Exercise Triathlon Bicycle Urinary incontinence Swimming Muscle Dieting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Running Aerobic exercise Recumbent bicycle Social rule Aikido Jackass: The Movie Insulin Shen Gong Wu Milton H.
