gastric bypass surgery this lady i used to work for her neice just got it and lost all of her extra weight in a matter of months is it a good or a bad way to lose extra weight so you mean that somebody who just needs to lose lbs should just do it the traditional way right this is just my personal opinion i wouldn't have a surgery for stetic purposes because any surgery implies some risk that are not worth to take in mexico there is this famous singer who got a liposuction and had some problems during surgery and was in coma for some time and even now she cannot sing anymore and does not show in public since she lost a lot of her functionality she is still in rehab and will be for the rest of her life and maybe the worst thing is that she was not really fat you can loose weigth by getting better feed habits and making some exercise besides you show that to your children that things are not easy to get you have to make some effort to get them Gastric bypass surgery Obesity Hypoglycemia Adjustable gastric band Gastroesophageal reflux disease Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Atkins Nutritional Approach John Forsythe Intersex surgery Stomach cancer Weight loss Anne Rice Insulin Darryl Strawberry The Ashlee Simpson Show Traumatic brain injury Goodness and value theory Weight training Equine conformation Theodicy Red Hot Chili Peppers Plastic surgery Jennifer Lopez Dieting Social rule Education in Portugal Fecal incontinence 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Terri Schiavo Adipose tissue Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Prostate cancer Spina bifida Cryptorchidism Infantilism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ethics Pound Diabetes mellitus Osteoarthritis Poker jargon Gastroparesis Rush Limbaugh Extreme Programming Childbirth Stroke Family Guy Psychosurgery Meat Loaf Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Intellectual property Anorexia nervosa Money History of intersex surgery Stewie Griffin Quicksort Weight Binge eating disorder Oral contraceptive In the Heat of the Night (TV) Medicine Luck Tammy Wynette Michele Lee Breast implant Richard Feynman Nicole Richie Jean Grey Clinical depression Tocopherol Peter Griffin Time Out of Mind Stuttering Whose Line Is It Anyway?
