im yr male ' and lbs and was told to get on whey protein so i play baseball and soccer and am in pretty good shape i went to a camp and the trainer told me to get on whey protein will it affect my time on my sprints they told me to use it as a meal replacement or before or after workouts i dont want it to mess up my mile time or my sprint times what kind of whey protein should i take and when can it be a meal replacement well protein is simply food for your muscles the trainer was basically telling you that to make sure your muscles had adequate food so they can grow and function as they need the only way to increase the time on your sprints is to exercise those muscles as i'm sure you know and protein is good to feed those muscles as they work it is not safe to use them as a meal replacement nor are protein supplements intended as a meal replacement it should say that right on the container in fact some people advocate that as a way to feed the muscles while starving the body but that doesn't work when your body is starved of certain nutrients it will take them from whatever reserves you have typically fat but if you don't have enough fat your body may actually take it from your muscles from what you listed it doesn't sound like you have too much fat so i would be careful about having a full meal of just protein once in a while should be fine if needed and after workouts as a snack is good protein won't mess up your track times at all as long as you work the muscles and use the energy that the protein gives you as far as the brand i can tell you what our customers order most often but the most important thing is to get it from a good quality company and make sure you like the taste that's the determining factor in what kind of protein powder that someone will use some taste horrible some taste great see if you can try a sample of any kind before you buy a large amount of it my advice from personal experience i would definitely advise against using it as a meal replacement though Weight training Bodybuilding Milk Dieting Protein Veganism Hypoglycemia Nutrition Atkins Nutritional Approach Anorexia nervosa Dairy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Diabetes mellitus Tocopherol Nutrient Equine conformation Cheese Obesity Creatine Prostate cancer Puberty Vegetarianism Brewery Stomach cancer Cancer Fasting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Biochemistry Multiple sclerosis Acorn Gastroesophageal reflux disease Triathlon Action potential Organic food Osteoarthritis Brain Coronary heart disease Surimi Organic farming Coeliac disease Parkinson's disease Soybean Growth hormone treatment Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Chronic fatigue syndrome Cell (biology) Tofu Signal transduction Monosodium glutamate Human height Fancy rat Hamster Peanut Lac operon Growth hormone Chicken Biodiesel Fecal incontinence Soy protein Egg (food) Marathon (sport) Theory of conduct Alcohol fuel Omega-3 fatty acid Water Swimming Growth hormone deficiency Potassium Sexual differentiation Supply and demand Healthy eating Muscle Food Super Size Me Peanut butter Tyrannosaurus rex Traumatic brain injury Sewage treatment Japanese tea ceremony Meal Microeconomics Flour Life extension Calorie Ferret
