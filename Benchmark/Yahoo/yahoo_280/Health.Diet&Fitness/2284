this may sound odd but does tylenol really do this some one said that ibuprofen makes you loose weight then some else else mentioned that tylenol did the same exact thing if you take three after one meal a day usually dinner now i'm not stupid so first off i would never overdose like that and second of all i'm not an idiot and would never even think about using tylenol to loose weight but i was just wondering are these people insane or are they actually telling the truth ok with all the money companies make with weight loss products don't you think that any study that showed weight loss from an over the counter product would show this to the press tylenol and others that make these products would be the first ones to tell the world since they could make tons more money and money is the name of the game Paracetamol Rush Limbaugh Tylenol Treehouse of Horror V Johnson & Johnson Garfield 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders Craps Hiberno-English Fiddler on the Roof Game show Dieting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Social rule American Idiot Dorothea Puente Carpal tunnel syndrome Johnny Tapia Wayne Gretzky Blackadder Ren and Stimpy Time Out of Mind Genericized trademark Major League Baseball television contracts Laura Schlessinger Tablet Insurance Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Weight training Conspiracy (TNG episode) Dilbert The Apprentice 2 Blackjack Atkins Nutritional Approach Passenger car Anne Rice Wal-Mart Boots Group The Wheezer Bros.
