is this bad or good for a diet i wnet grocery shopping w my aunt and uncle the other day and we got lots of fruits and veggies since then i have had breakfast cereal reeses puffs which i know isnt the best for you but it is only calories a bowl w milk lunch watermelon dinner pizza rolls which is about calories snacks watermelon and i drank water and the new danactive drinks for your immune system but also i want to do better in dieting but i dont know exactly what t eat w the foods i have now i have only sanwhich stuff whole wheat bread turkey and ham and munster pepper jack cheese pixxa rolls beef and cheese tequitos and bean and beef burritos this is the stuff my aunt buys and trust me i have talked to her about buying healthy stuff and she will buy liek a couple oranges and sandwhich stuff and is like thats it but i also have peaches and apricots cherries and carrots so how to i have a good diet that works w only these foods and i want to lose about lb's soon and i need to now some specific exercises i should do and i will only drink water so any suggestions thanks a bunch geri is correct about the watermelon i'm glad to see that your searching for foods and an intake plan that you can do that is low if calories however it sounds as if the majority of the foods purchased are manufactured foods these are considered energy taking foods because they are pre processed what this means is that your body doens't need to break them down this takes away from your bodies ability to absorb nutrient from the foods you need to focus on foods that you can make at home raw or unprocessed foods allow the body to work to break them down this is why we have a digestive system the process of digesting gives the body the nutrients it needs to burn fat and create energy during the digestive process your body will burn calories so stay away from processed foods as much as possible now you need to get your body on a natural schedule the breakfast is fine personally i'm addicted to frosted flakes lol but you need to eat a small palm sized meal every hours so hrs later eat small fruit or veggies then it'll be lunch time eat a small meal mixed with protiens and carbs not just watermelon hrs later eat your watermelon then that'll take you through dinner again small palm sized don't worry about the carbs blah blah blah just make sure it's balanced then again hrs later before pm snack foods that are low in fat raw or prepared at home are generally considered energy foods a proper diet is of the battle for fat loss good luck let me know if you need anything else Milk French cuisine Veganism Cuisine of Denmark German cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Vegetarianism Nutrition Hamburger Low-carbohydrate diet Jewish cuisine Meal MRE Cuisine of the Philippines Raw food diet Omega-3 fatty acid Japanese cuisine Roman eating and drinking Cuisine of Argentina Snack food Cuisine of the Southern United States Organic food Tofu South Beach diet Bodybuilding Alcoholic beverage McDonald's Chocolate Bread Hamster Korean cuisine Little Britain Dietary fiber Pizza Food preservation Domesticated turkey Breastfeeding Tocopherol Watermelon Fecal incontinence Breakfast cereal Cuisine of Brazil Vegetarian cuisine Ramen Tea Super Size Me Kosher foods Vitamin C Ice cream Hypoglycemia Food guide pyramid Rice pudding Protein Cuisine of Malaysia Swedish cuisine Bengali cuisine Tooth Cheese Porridge Dairy Cuisine of Turkey Fasting Anorexia nervosa Crohn's disease Diarrhea Gatorade Kit Kat Fanta Sandwich Insulin Soul food British cuisine Fancy rat Peruvian cuisine Egg (food) Sewage treatment Cassava Cha chaan teng Cuisine of Singapore Pancake Yoghurt Cereal Soy protein Trans fat Weight training Peanut Adjustable gastric band Genericized trademark
