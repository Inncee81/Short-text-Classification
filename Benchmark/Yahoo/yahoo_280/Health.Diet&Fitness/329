workout question s this is kinda awkward but i want to get in shape for the school year but have no clue how i try to do push ups every day but stopped at i play golf and go to the driving range every other day i like to run but for some reason i don't want to get off my lazy butt and sprint across the neighborhood i wiegh my thighs are flimsy i'd say they're fat but i'm not fat i hope meaning they're bulky you'd never guess with jeans on and when i sit down they 'expand' so they look even bigger my calfs are firm when i stand up but when i sit they look like hanging fat my butt isn't exactly perfect my arms have meat not much but they are noticable hanging down and the upper arms are meaty oh and i don't eat often and when i do i can control how much i consume thanks i'll be in three weeks and i'm ' well overall theres no magic trick other than to get off your can and work out for one at your age i'd say join a sport or something that will keep you active all the time and you wont have a choice once you're started but doing pushups isnt going to do a whole lot you should aim to get an hour of cardio every day or at least most days going to the driving range doesnt exactly get your heart rate up how old are you is pretty skinny so unless you're really short you're certainly not fat anyhow try to eat small amounts every few hours which will keep your metabolism going and you'll burn more calories and more fat try to eat lots of fruit and veggies and dont eat things with saturated fats and trans fats also dont drink soda that can add a lot of weight really easily as far as a workout go running load up your mp player and go man up your pushups to or over time crank out some sit ups lift some weights and if you dont have access to weights just use something heavy that you have at home trust me once you've forced yourself to do it a few times you'll feel a lot better and you'll want to do it all the time dont worry about size just yet just tone up then you can add size after even if you add size if you're not getting rid of the fat on your body you wont see definition in the muscle you can do it man added yeah if you're ' and i'd recommend alternating your workout routine throughout the week do days of working out upper body then lower body etc with little weight doing lots of reps and take a day off then do days of less reps with more weight you'll tone up and add size that way and keep in mind that you're young so you're not done growing between the time i was and my frame filled out a lot my shoulders got broader and i put on more muscle mass but it was just my growing into adulthood it wasnt really workout related so dont worry man you might naturally bulk up over the next few years on your own Dieting Equine conformation Atkins Nutritional Approach Bodybuilding Aerial (dance move) Anorexia nervosa Milk Swimming Social rule Professional wrestling throws Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Internal ballistics Veganism Urinary incontinence Professional wrestling holds Tyrannosaurus rex Low-carbohydrate diet Bacon Exercise Professional wrestling attacks Strap-on dildo Jackass: The Movie Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Obesity Super Size Me Hypoglycemia Vegetarianism Car handling Recumbent bicycle Bass guitar Milton H.
