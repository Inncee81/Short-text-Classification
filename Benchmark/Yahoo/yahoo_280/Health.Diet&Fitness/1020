electrolites where hey how can i get electrolites i am afraid of becoming dehydrated i know i am in danger of it but don't want to go into why at the moment i drink at least oz of water a day and can up that but what about electrolytes where can i get them fairly naturally the only thing i know of is gatorade etc but i don't need the sugar any advice when i said i don't need the sugar that's because i'm trying to lose weight i am in some possible danger of electolite imbalance and dehydration i try to drink enough water but thought i needed electrolites too thank for the good info silverbullet i'm gonna leave this up a little longer just to see if anyone else has any info i do drink orange juice every day as well as eating bananas usually at least one a day so maybe i'm okay i also eat some other fruits grapes apples i need to figure out how to get more salt maybe cuz well i don't usually eat salt or salty foods sodium and potassium are the main concerns if you can't figure out how to get sodium you're beyond help wink wink bananas are a good source of potassium the reason gatorade et al are the default suggestions is that the most common causes of dehydration are vigorous exercise in the heat and diarrhea in both cases a little extra sugar is a benefit rather than a liability the sugars are there primarily because they facilitate quicker transport of the water through the intestinal wall unless you have other problems oz of plain water is nowhere near enough to get you into hyponatremia so electrolytes shouldn't be an issue tom check your pedialyte label again or get the bifocals checked there's plenty of sugar in it in fact the ingredient list is very similar to gatorade its highly unlikely you're short of sodium unless your diet is very atypical there is tons of it in processed foods and anything you get at a restaurant generally coming up short of sodium requires some combination of hours of extreme exercise in hot weather extreme amounts of plain water intake and unusually high sodium content in your sweat i'm assuming you're not in that category because if you were the small amount of sugar in gatorade would not be a factor for more information than you can possibly want on hydration see link below Gatorade Diarrhea Electrolyte Sodium chloride Hyperthermia Potassium Rehydration Hypoglycemia Dieting Alcoholic beverage Marathon (sport) Milk Hiking Bodybuilding Food Chocolate Edible salt Food preservation Nuclear power Vitamin C Tooth Aspartame Atkins Nutritional Approach Protein-energy malnutrition Ramen Dietary fiber Diabetes mellitus Sugar substitute Wine Rum Soft drink Beer Action potential Foodborne illness Healthy eating Veganism Laxative Weight training Aluminium Water intoxication Crohn's disease Folic acid Insulin Vegetarianism Microeconomics Banana Alcohol Bread Desert Uranium Hypertension Coffee Colorectal cancer Salt Portland cement Ammonia Organic food Cuisine of Brazil Stomach cancer Sugar beet Fugu Cannabis cultivation Magnesium Ice cream Water (molecule) Survival skills Biochemistry Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sewage treatment Kashrut Clinical depression Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Diabetic ketoacidosis Omega-3 fatty acid Breakfast Sugar Sodium Fuel cell Dialysis Anorexia nervosa Explosive material Hyponatremia Kosher foods Cuisine of the Southern United States Commodity markets Breastfeeding Electrolysis Cuisine of the Philippines Obesity
