where did it go i am years old and feet tall exactly and pounds as of monday last year i was inch shorter and pounds lighter but i honestly don't know where all of the weight went all of my jeans fit me from last year and i don't think i look much bigger i know i gained muscle in my legs but pounds worth i know the scale could have been a little bit off and this year when they weighed me i had clothes on while last year i didn't i was weighed on a scale in gym in april at pounds but i'm assuming that was off because i didn't gain pounds in less than months i'm confused oh and i'm not upset about this weight gain i was underweight and now i checked my bmi and i am on the smaller side of normal so i am not upset just confused i think you're confused at the fact that the weight you gained this year is coming from the fact that you have more muscle mass and that you grew taller when you're growing don't forget that your bone mass and organs hav to increase as well maybe thats where the pounds are coming from Body mass index Weight Equine conformation Human height Mass Obesity English unit Dieting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Largest organism Muscle Anorexia nervosa M16 (rifle) Childbirth Weighing scale Tyrannosaurus rex Physical examination History of measurement Pound U.S. customary units Robert Pershing Wadlow Growth hormone treatment Triathlon Farthing (coin) Ostrich Hydrogen economy Passenger car Physical attractiveness Mixed martial arts Milton H.
