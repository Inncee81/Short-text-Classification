do you like germans and why i was always wondering about this as an austrian girl i've been living in the states for many years now and all the people here have been so nice and kind to me always i can olny say positive things so far but what do american people really think of germans and why and do you have any german friends i am american and i like germans and of course austrians i have known several germans and they were all incredibly nice people who were always willing to help me or a friend i can't speak for all germans but the ones i knew were all very educated intelligent and understanding people most of all they had a great sense of humor which was really fun actually i speak some german and am thinking of getting a minor in the german language i have nothing against germany i like their culture especially their musical and literary heritage although i have no prejudice against germans i know for a fact that some americans do i think it is a shame that one of my german teachers a woman who was almost nice to a fault was treated with disrespect by the head of the language department and a coworker because she was german yes the comment they made was german specific that is wrong disappointing and only showed their ignorance on another note last year a friend of mine who is mexican went to berlin for a month to attend a language school she told me she felt very safe there and that everybody was helpful and nice to her i agree with sam s a large amount of the germans who are alive today had nothing to do with wwii and i think it's sad that they feel so much self hatred just because they're german and dwell on it feeling self hatred for things you had nothing to do with is not a healthy or happy way to go about life Negima Asperger syndrome Transactional analysis Pitaten Reality Social rule Infantilism Theodor Adorno Novel Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Ranma __ characters Homophobia Rudolf Steiner Cultural relativism Austria Alcoholics Anonymous Abortion debate One Piece minor characters Invader Zim Current teachings of Prem Rawat Nancy Witcher Astor Friends The Apprentice 2 W.I.T.C.H.
