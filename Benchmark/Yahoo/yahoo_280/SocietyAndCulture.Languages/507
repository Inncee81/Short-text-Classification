german and others exactly how easy is it to learn german for an native english speaker and can anyone reccomend another language after i start learning german i am minoring in german at the university and i find it pretty easy it's supposed to be one of the harder languages but i don't struggle with it at all if you have a good teacher and pay attention you'll be speaking it in no time i would suggest learning danish or dutch after you learn german i actually learned some danish before i studied german and danish is close to english and german so you'll know both of those which will help a lot you could also learn icelandic norwegian or swedish instead of danish the major dialects of norwegian are very close to danish and swedish is a little less close to danish but i heard that it's still mutually intelligible with danish icelandic hasn't changed much in the past years and it is supposed to work similarly to modern german but i don't know because out of all those languages i have recommended for you i have studied danish and just a little bit of dutch i've also studied italian and spanish and those would be easy for you too especially if you've got german or some other foreign language behind you already Danish language German language Swedish language Old Norse language Mutually intelligible languages Norwegian language Germanic languages Non-native pronunciations of English North Germanic languages Scandinavia Latin alphabet Languages in the United States Finnish language Dialect Inflection Multilingual Afrikaans Dutch language Esperanto as an international language Proto-Germanic language Chinese language Grammatical gender Icelandic language Propaedeutic value of Esperanto English language French language Standard Swedish T-V distinction Guttural R Old English language Glottal stop Denmark Diacritic English as an additional language Mandatory Swedish Borough Russian language Family name Occitan language Danish people Elf Heavy metal umlaut African American Vernacular English Iceland Norn language The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as international phenomenon Norway national football team Esperanto Spanish verbs Quotation mark Spelling reform Interlingua Frisian language Shibboleth Runic alphabet Dictionary Scanian (linguistics) Finland-Swedish Tone (linguistics) Rasmus Christian Rask Translation Faroese language M__ori language Historical linguistics Ligature (typography) Stuttering Korean language Regional language International Phonetic Alphabet Alphabets derived from the Latin Spanish language Indo-European languages Family name affixes Standard language Roma people Speech synthesis Hindi Swiss German Languages in the United Kingdom European languages Phoneme Sami people Education in Romania Gymnasium (Denmark) Language family Language Milton H.
