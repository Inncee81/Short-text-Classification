irish does anyone speak it only of people in ireland speak their native language and i find it appauling i agree that it is redundant but people who live in ireland should be able to speak it its sickening and i give kudos to those who take the time to learn it thanks for your feedback oh and the second person who answered yea it is known as gaelic elsewhere but here its just plain irish i'm a native speaker of irish and i never had the difficulty of having to learning it nancy i understand it is a difficult language to learn for english speakers but then english is also extremely difficult to learn properly for speakers of other languages i know because i didn't start learning english until i began attending school the spelling system in english is chaotic in the first place it is different from every other language take a simple woird such as make in any other language that would be pronounced like mack eh in the second place there is very little consistency in the spelling try pronouncing through tough rough though trough bough so the difficulty in irish isn't the spelling which is nearly completely consistent within the spelling rules of irish not within the spelling rulkes of english as regards whether people should learn irish i'm biased and i think it's a beautiful language and i think it's far more expressive than english and i believe that's the only good reason for learning it people who want to learn it because they think they should as an expression of their heritage may do so of course but i don't believe that's a reason to exhort others to have to do the same so there's nothing appalling about the fact that so few speak it it's a wonder the language exists at all considering the way it has been disadvantaged historically also nancy whether or not you think it's a redundant language isn't the point you don't have to learn it if you don't want to do so and it's none of your business if people like me do speak it and expect to deal with state business in that language as a result certainly i should not suffer any disadvantage as a result of anybody thinking it's redundant as regards the statistic f speaking irish it's actually less than who actually speak irish on a daily basis as a working language i'm one of those and i can't claim any kudos for it i was just born in those circumstances Irish language Esperanto as an international language Hiberno-English Greek language English language Non-native pronunciations of English Chinese language Scottish Gaelic language Dutch language Goidelic languages African American Vernacular English Multilingual Australian English Northern Ireland Bulgarian language Second language acquisition Phoneme Dyslexia English plural British Isles Manx language Pleonasm Celt Finnish language German language English as an additional language SAT Wolof language Pinyin English spelling Hungarian language Singlish Philosophy of language Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Family name New Zealand English French language Junior Certificate Newfoundland English Ulster Scots language American English Spanish language Appeal History of Ireland Logic Russian language Writing system Italian language New York-New Jersey English Shit Cornish language Constitution of Ireland Korean language Hearing impairment Standard Mandarin Theory of conduct Parliament of the United Kingdom Esperanto grammar Entropy English as a lingua franca for Europe Cognitive science Indonesian language Czech language Languages in the United Kingdom International English Gaelic football Danish language Japanese language United Kingdom Anglosphere Ido Welsh language English grammar Hong Kong English Regional accents of English speakers Shall and will Sexual orientation Cantonese (linguistics) Slovak language Swahili language Contract Culture of Ireland Republic of Ireland Policy Debate President of Ireland Occitan language Esperanto Urdu
