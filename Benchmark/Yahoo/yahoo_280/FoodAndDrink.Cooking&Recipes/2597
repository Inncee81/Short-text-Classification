does anyone a good recipe for pasta sauce i just picked tons of fresh tomatoes from the garden and want to try making homemade pasta sauce most of the recipes i've seen only mention canned tin tomatoes which are probably easier to work with i've heard different things i should do crush tomatoes by hand peel skins off puree heat before crushing etc but i'm unsure of what methods are best thanks the best way to peel tomatoes is to dip them in boiling water for about seconds then place them straight into some icy water stops them from cooking plus they're much easier to handle in terms of the best and most simple pasta sauce i go for diced onions cooked in generous servings of extra virgin olive oil until they're translucent the onions are optional but the rest isn't next add some roughly chopped garlic and your peeled tomatoes and mush them up a bit to cook more evenly to give more depth to the flavour slosh in some red wine and or a little balsamic vinegar too much balsamic can kill it though at this point and simmer for minutes at a minimum on a low heat in my opinion even longer is better as more flavours come out depending on the ripeness and flavour of your tomatoes you may want to add some sugar my preference is brown as it has less of an edge but white works fine as well and as necessary make sure you stir the sauce while it's simmering to avoid catching and if required add some boiling water if it seems to be drying out a bit when you serve it up go for your preferred pasta salted and al dente of course and shave some good quality parmesan cheese over the top i think it really comes down to your ingredients at the end of the day so use the best you can find for the best tasting result last but not least if you know how to bottle things you could use your end result as a base for other pasta sauces Cajun cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Denmark Ketchup MRE French fries French cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Pizza Barbecue Hot dog Peruvian cuisine Curry Jewish cuisine Ramen Food preservation German cuisine Salad Hamburger Fish and chips Chicken soup Mayonnaise Risotto Fish sauce Cha chaan teng Russian cuisine Bread Catalan cuisine Sauce Cheese Vinegar D__ner kebab Rum Cuisine of Greece Coffee Kraft Dinner Soy sauce Soul food Korean cuisine Bacon Cincinnati chili Italian cuisine Tea Garlic Breakfast Cuisine of Singapore Idli B__chamel sauce Recipe Gazpacho Stock (food) Gumbo Dim sum Roman eating and drinking Potato Cuisine of Malaysia Pot Noodle Cuisine of Argentina Dumpling Bagel Potato chips Tomato Haggis Sichuan Pepper Hot pot Ice cream Fondue Yoghurt Oregano Couscous Vegetarianism Cuisine of Laos Culinary mustard Nabemono Wine Chocolate Cookware and bakeware Beef noodle soup Spaghetti Pottery Basic taste Halva Bolognese sauce Jiaozi Sulfuric acid Hummus Basil
