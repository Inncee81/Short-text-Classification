change baking temps and times i know you have to change your temps and baking times when you're cooking in a high altitude does anybody know if you have to change these if you're baking below sea level i don't know for sure i tried looking online and i don't see any adjustments so i guess you don't have to change anything when i bake i usually just have to add a tiny bit more flour to things like cookies quick breads bake up great but i have trouble getting yeast breads to rise i live at around ft in albuquerque nm if anything you might need less flour or need to allow longer bake time becuause it takes longer for water to boil where you are i'd try adjusting your bake time first and if you have poor results try adjusting the flour Bread Brewery Dumpling Flour Sourdough Baking Pancake Pizza Muffin Biscuit Cookie Yeast (baking) Experiment Soul food XML Pumpernickel bread Carbon dioxide Jewish cuisine German cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Naan Japanese cuisine Soy protein Cookware and bakeware Puff pastry Russian cuisine Pretzel Alcoholic beverage Tortilla White bread Breadmaker Wheat Rice pudding Roux Rum Folic acid Pasta Irish breakfast Egg (food) Cake Cajun cuisine Electrophysiology Coeliac disease Spacecraft propulsion Glacier Yeast Hot dog Slow cooker Bengali cuisine Pillsbury British cuisine Sandwich Baking powder Carburetor Fried chicken Stollen Pudding SHA hash functions Ramen Sea level Yakitate!!
