can you bake bacon wrapped filet's all the recipes i've found are for broiling or grilling i don't have a grill and i'm not good at broiling which would leave oven baking is this possible if so how long and at what temp thanks baking tends to toughen the filets as opposed to grilling or broiling which sear the outside and leave the inside juicy if you're going to bake the filets you might try pan searing the outside first then baking them until done i'm guessing here but i'd say you probably want the oven pretty hot say or so Hot dog Pizza Bacon Cooking Steak Barbecue Japanese cuisine Bread Kebab Hamburger Pancake Cooking on a campfire Baking Sandwich Cuisine of Denmark Cookware and bakeware Muffin Slow cooker Pita German cuisine Grilling Domesticated turkey Bagel Wok Irish breakfast Full English breakfast Baked beans Jewish cuisine Baked Alaska Cookie Cuisine of Laos D__ner kebab Breadmaker MRE Dim sum Naan Cuisine of Vietnam Oyster Baklava Cajun cuisine Grilled cheese sandwich Welsh rabbit Target Corporation Green tea Hansel and Gretel Souffl__ Rice pudding Cheesecake Baking powder Chicago-style pizza McDonald's Pumpernickel bread Kosher foods Searing Shanghai cuisine Meatball Soul food Hell's Kitchen (television) French fries Waffle Cuisine of Thailand Cuisine of New England Korean cuisine Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Souvlaki Kraft Dinner Ice cream Hot pot Bengali cuisine Pasta Bento Egg (food) Cake Tofu Mummy Biscuit Cuisine of Turkey Steak n Shake The Midnight Sun Dundas Square Fried chicken Lisa the Vegetarian Filet lace Jiaozi Cuisine of the Philippines XML Cuisine of South Africa Glutinous rice Mooncake Fried dough foods Taco Haggis Lancashire Hotpot Pavlova Maple syrup Albert Fish Spam (Monty Python) Stove Grill
