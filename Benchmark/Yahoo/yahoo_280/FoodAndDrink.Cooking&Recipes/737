best way to freeze corn on the cob after its been schucked directions for freezing corn on the cob ingredients and equipment fresh corn on the cob any quantity i figure ears per serving large pot of boiling water vacuum food sealer or ziploc type freezer bags the freezer bag version is heavier and protects better against freezer burn large bowls one filled with cold water and ice sharp knife large spoon ideal ear ripe but not bloated the kernels are still tender easily punctured with your fingernail and the juice is milky white yellow or bicolor types are all fine instructions step get yer corn start with fresh corn on the cob as fresh as you can get if there is a delay between harvesting and freezing put it in the refrigerator or put ice on it the sugars break down quickly at room temperature step husk the corn husk the corn and pick off as much of the silk as you can a soft vegetable brush is the fastest and easiest way to get the remaining silk off just don't be too rough with it step get the pots ready get the pot off boiling water ready about filled and a large bowl with ice and cold water step blanch the corn all fruits and vegetables contain enzymes that over time break down the destroy nutrients and change the color flavor and texture of food during frozen storage corn requires a brief heat treatment called blanching in boiling water or steam to destroy the enzymes before freezing blanching times generally vary from one to minutes depending on the vegetable the duration should be just long enough to stop the action of the enzymes begin counting the blanching time as soon as you place the corn in the boiling water cover the kettle and boil at a high temperature for the required length of time you may use the same blanching water several times up to be sure to add more hot water from the tap from time to time to keep the water level at the required height blanching time varies depending on the type of frozen corn you are making cut whole kernel cream style or corn on the cob blanching times for freezing the corn depend upon the size of the corn cobs since the heat must penetrate blanching times for corn on the cob small ears inches or less in diameter minutes medium ears to inches in diameter minutes and large ears over inches in diameter minutes step cool the corn cool corn immediately in ice water drain the corn thoroughly after vegetables are blanched cool them quickly to prevent overcooking plunge the corn into a large quantity of ice cold water i keep adding more ice to it a good rule of thumb cool for the same amount of time as the blanch step for instance if you blanch sweet corn for minutes then cool in ice water for minutes drain thoroughly step bag the corn i love the foodsavers see this page for more information with their vacuum sealing i am not paid by them but these things really work if you don't have one ziploc bags work too but it is hard to get as much air out of the bags remove the air to prevent drying and freezer burn a vacuum sealed foodsaver bag is on top at left and a hand sealed ziploc bag below it you can see how the foodsaver really sucks out all the air so the corn won't dry out or get freezer burn that means the food inside will last many times longer i've been using them and their predecessor in the marketplace seal a meal for many years if you're interested here's where you can get one if you choose not to vacuum seal you can almost accomplish the same thing by wrapping each ear with saran wrap then put in the ziplock bag saran is an excellent barrier to air and the corn will be garden fresh for months one person wrote to tell me that she uses a straw and seals the ziploc around the straw to suck the air out of the bag then pinches the straw and quickly removes it while pressing the seal it works fairly well but i'll stick to the foodsaver since the bags are microwaveable and much thicker than a ziploc bag even the ziploc freezer bags step label the bags at least put the date on them so you can eat the older ones first with clear bags it is pretty obvious what it is sharpie marking pens work well on plastic and won't rub off step done pop them into the freezer on the quick freeze shelf if you have one later when you are ready to serve the corn it just takes about or minutes in the microwave from frozen or or minutes in a pot of boiling water it doesn't need to be cooked just heated up tips harvest early in the morning especially if the weather is hot to get peak flavor harvest the corn at its peak maturity milky fluid in the kernels kernels tender and not bloated immature corn is watery when cooked and over ripe corn is chewy and doughy process promptly after harvesting or keep cooled in the fridge or with ice until then questions and answers q i followed your freezing corn on the cob directions but even after drying it with paper towels there is still enough water coming out of the corn that my vacuum food sealer can't seal the bag any ideas a yup just pop the corn into the freeze in an ordinary ziploc bag for about an hour that will freeze and water droplets that are left on the corn then take it out put it in your vacuum bag and vacuum seal it q i froze corn on the cob as per your instructions but when i unthawed and cooked some it was mushy how do i cook it not sure if i should cook it frozen or thaw first and how long to cook or heat a that's an inherent problem with frozen corn on the cob but it is better with some varieties than others silver queen and many se varieties have soft kernels the super sweets tend to have much firmer kernels that hold up better when frozen be careful not over cook the corn when blanching too stick to the recommended times and get the corn into ice water right afterwards then when you reheat it just put it into boiling water straight from the freezer you'll want to cook it for the least time it takes to get it hot which is normally about minutes any overcooking either before freezing or when you are ready to eat it will make it more mushy Hot dog Cereal Wood Fire fighting Tamale Pottery Soft drink Tomato Gramophone record Onion Chopsticks Slow cooker Dim sum Pizza
