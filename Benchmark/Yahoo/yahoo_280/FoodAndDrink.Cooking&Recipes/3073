important on the master cleanse can u sub the cheyenne pepper for curry powder i really need to know k good thing i looked up master cleanse before i fired off an answer i'm not sure curry powder will have the same effect in the digestive tract as cayenne powder cayenne is in curry powder but at a much smaller dose than what probably goes in master cleanse the flavor would be quite different as well and at the amount of curry powder you'd need to add to get the cayenne dose even close i think the taste would be rather nasty though i'm thinking the taste of a diet of cayenne maple syrup and lemon juice probably already isn't so good though and this is only my personal opinion fad diets that purport the ability to cure the worlds ills rarely actually do use caution in any tonic diet Chile pepper Cajun cuisine Curry Vitamin C Chocolate Tea Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Sugar Aspartame Coffee Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nutrition Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Coca-Cola Company Soft drink Brewery Citric acid Dietary fiber Nutmeg Cuisine of Denmark Tobacco Cuisine of Malaysia Folic acid Stomach cancer Hypoglycemia Patent medicine Bloody Mary (cocktail) New Coke Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Africa Dr Pepper Monosodium glutamate Dieting Capsicum Lemonade Cuisine of India Coca-Cola Soy milk Peruvian cuisine Common cold Diet soda Cancer Omega-3 fatty acid Fanta Raw food diet Chewing gum Cuisine of Thailand Maple syrup Rum Cantonese cuisine Celery Yarrow Pancake Atkins Nutritional Approach Alzheimer's disease Bread Kit Kat Fenugreek Wine Sprite (soft drink) Chicken soup Ramen Cuisine of the Southern United States Chili con carne Tofu Sucralose Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.
