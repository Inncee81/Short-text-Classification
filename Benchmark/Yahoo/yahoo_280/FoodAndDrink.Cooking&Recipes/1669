i have a recipe for cheese cake which calls for white butter can someone tell me what that is please white butter is regular butter without the colouring added for cheesecake the main reason you would use white butter is to keep the cheesecake a nice white color the recipe probably also calls for white vanilla extract so if you don't mind having your cheesecake having an ecru color instead of white use regular butter depending on your recipe if the cheesecake is baked or unbaked you can even get away with using uncolored margarine the hard stuff not the soft margarine as for the difference between salted and unsalted depends on personal taste and requirement if you are on a salt restricted diet then by all means go for the unsalted butter if not the salted butter will work fine Margarine Chocolate Cheesecake Cake Tofu Jewish cuisine Butter Soul food Hot dog Recipe Dairy Cold Stone Creamery Pancake Peanut butter Cheese Heath bar Cuisine of Brazil Risotto Cuisine of the Philippines Kit Kat Cuisine of Denmark Halva Pizza Bagel French cuisine Flour Cocoa Chili con carne Baking powder Bacon Oreo French fries Trans fat Japanese cuisine Rum Pottery Breakfast Meat analogue Cookie Vegetarian cuisine Alfredo Biscuit Potato Baking British cuisine Ice cream Egg (food) German cuisine Ketchup Cajun cuisine Microeconomics Kraft Dinner Coffee Sandwich Cookware and bakeware Tea Color Girl Scout cookies Veganism Baklava Rice pudding Ramen Strawberry Shortcake Jelly Belly Paint Oatmeal Vanilla Potassium Peruvian cuisine French toast Christmas tree Milk Red velvet cake Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Fish sauce Muffin B__chamel sauce Soup Mexican cuisine Potato chips Vegetarianism Gumbo Edible salt Croissant Stollen Mooncake McDonald's Yoplait Ricotta cheese Wine In-N-Out Burger Cider Apple pie Diet Coke Bengali cuisine Glycerin Fish and chips Roman eating and drinking Honey
