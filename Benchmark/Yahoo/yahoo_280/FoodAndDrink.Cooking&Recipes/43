tonight i went to a bbq and there was kebabs on skewers with veg i ate the first bit of chicken at the end and then when i looked at the other pieces they were not cooked all the way through now i am worried that that first bit i had wasn't properly cooked and will make me ill it was just one cube and was cooked on the outside but im not sure how cooked on the inside it was now i had that bit of meat hours ago if i will be affected how ill will it make me and how long for the symptoms to come out not to be a downer but the incubation period for samonella the likey suspect from under cooked poultry is to hours and the infectious dose is a mere to cells i'd guess that the smaller the dose the longer it'd take to reproduce enough to cause symptoms that said you're probably fine even if the chicken was really undercooked it might seem to you to be undercooked even if it was actually in a safe temperature range it'd still have to be carrying the bacteria for it to make you ill relax and have a stiff drink the alcohol will kill the bugs i completely made that up but at least you'll get a drink Foodborne illness Escherichia coli O157:H7 Common cold Food Vitamin C French cuisine Toxoplasmosis Pneumonia Chicken Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Bipolar disorder Japanese cuisine Rocky Mountain spotted fever Domesticated turkey Omega-3 fatty acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Guinea pig Kebab D__ner kebab Cuisine of Malaysia Paracetamol British cuisine Caffeine Hypoglycemia Stock (food) Iron Veganism Rabies Allergy Barbecue Cancer Poison Anthrax Stroke Asthma Chronic fatigue syndrome Hamburger Fugu Tofu Cuisine of Singapore Hyperthermia Chicken soup Korean cuisine Coffee Taboo food and drink Cantonese cuisine First aid Virus MRE Cooking Singaporean measures against avian influenza Antiretroviral drug Russian cuisine Avian influenza Yoghurt Alcoholism Compost Ebola Decompression sickness McDonald's Campylobacteriosis Fancy rat Nutrition Infectious mononucleosis Cannabis (drug) Satay Chocolate Diabetes mellitus Healthy eating Dead Like Me Spanish flu Species RuneScape quests Taenia saginata Factory farming Ulcerative colitis Cuisine of Brazil Group A streptococcal infection Bacteria Lyme disease Smallpox Vampire Cuisine of Denmark Soup Herpes simplex virus Traumatic incident reduction Cuisine of the Philippines Multiple sclerosis Pork Bengali cuisine Cheese Sauerkraut Food preservation Comanche Crohn's disease Chopsticks
