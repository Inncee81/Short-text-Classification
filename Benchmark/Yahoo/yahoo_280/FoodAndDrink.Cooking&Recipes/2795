how do i cook this big piece of meat my dear husband bought pieces of meat to cook on the grill one was top sirloin steak it said on the package and the other said top round roast i dont think he meant to get diffrent ones but how the heck can i cook a roast on the bbq will it taste okay what do i do the best way to cook a roast slowly on a spit imagine a tender juicy beef roast slowly roasted over a low fire when you slice it into paper thin slices the juices run out onto the cutting board the flavor fantastic the color a perfect pink usually people think of oven roasting when it comes to roasts whether pork or beef no wonder they re called roasts the problem with oven roasting is that your roast can dry out and cook unevenly try putting it on your rotisserie over a low fire next time heat whether you are using charcoal or gas the secret is the perfecting roasting temperature now i would love to tell you just how many coals to light or the right setting for your burners but i can t that depends on your grill you want a low heat meaning you can hold you hand where the roast will be sitting for the count of three and no less you ll want it a little cooler if you keep the lid down the whole time keep the temperature low but if you want to get the surface of the meat seared and get that great crust to form start out on a high temperature for about minutes then reduce it if you re using charcoal bank the coals close to the meat for about minutes then pull them back away from the roast threading now the hardest part about putting a whole roast on a rotisserie is getting the spit through the meat the first step is taking a good look at your roast you ll want it as evenly balanced on the spit as you can get it you need to skewer the roast lengthwise through the longest part of the meat while still getting it as centered as possible once you know where the spit will enter and exit the roast take something long and sharp to make a hole from each end a fillet knife works well then drive the spit through the roast and clamp it down tight with the forks make sure you ve got it firmly secure there are a few other options out there if you re serious about rotisserie cooking the e z que rotisserie system is basically a large basket you can set a roast in no threading onto a long metal skewer the real advantage to something like this besides the fact that it is easy to use is that on a traditional rotisserie kit the metal rod gets hot and cooks the meat from the inside drying it out more i really recommend this product but either way rotisserie is the way to go with roasts seasoning you can season your roast however you want a good dry rub works best since the turning action of a rotisserie helps hold in moisture you don t need to worry about marinating or basting though you can if you wish i like to keep seasonings simple because it lets the flavor of the meat stand out more a simple sprinkling of salt and pepper works great gravy lastly use a drip pan to catch the flavor of the meat as it cooks not only does this keep your grill clean but gives you the makings for great gravy to keep the drippings from drying out and burning add water to the drip pan you will need to keep an eye on it so that the water doesn t all boil away if you time it right you ll practically have perfect gravy without much effort the drippings from the meat combined with the seasonings of your rub slowly roasted together are truly fantastic carving once you have the roast of the rotisserie let it rest for about minutes covered loosely with foil now you are ready to carve i prefer very thin slices piled high it makes for a great presentation and keeps the meat tender to eat since it s so thin once you ve tried a rotisserie roast you won t want to go back to the oven ever again Jewish cuisine Ramen Roast beef Knife Cantonese cuisine Steak Tofu Kitchen Pizza Hot dog Pottery Stove Chili con carne French fries Brewery Domesticated turkey Cheese Grilling Drill bit German cuisine Campfire Kebab Explosive material Thermal power station Dim sum Aerial (dance move) Bong Cuisine of the Southern United States Sandwich Cooking Plastic Cuisine of Brazil Japanese tea ceremony Sushi Diving suit Spark plug Potato Cuisine of Laos Carbon dioxide In-N-Out Burger Casting Tobacco Wok Mattress Carburetor Cooking on a campfire Poker jargon Peanut butter Tea Satay Food preservation Fire extinguisher Risotto Fish and chips Hot pot Korean cuisine Cuisine of Africa Microwave oven Oyster Cuisine of Singapore Solar power Aluminium Charcoal Incandescent light bulb Titanium Instant coffee Peruvian cuisine Grill Beef Heat Chocolate Sugar beet Oxy-fuel welding and cutting M16 (rifle) Rum Ham Steel Screw
