blackberry smoothie recipes i just picked some fresh blachberries and i want to make them into a smoothie any ideas for a smoothie recipe i aiming for health and flavor this will take a little while to prepare but it will be so worth it in a sauce pan add c both sugar and water and about cups of berries let this simmer until the sugar is totally disolved most of the berries should have burst at this point now i don't do this all the time but if i am serving this for brunch and guests i will strain the berry sugar mixture through a fine sieve or cheese cloth i don't do this for just the family though and nobody complains i actually prefer the texture once the mixture has cooled put it in a freezer bag and let it freeze until solid once this is done take the bag out and break it up slightly you don't want it to be mush just chunks that are about sq add this to your blender with no fat vanilla yogurt believe me it actually is better with this full fat tends to be really heavy generally it's about of a large container of yogurt start with of the container and add as much yogurt as you like if i have it i will add a little lemon or orange zest to the mixture if i am serving at a bruch i will generally put the yogurt in the freezer and let it get almost frozen it just let's the smoothie stay cool a little longer while i serve don't tell the husband or kid but i actually add a fibersure to it as well they still haven't figured out Yoghurt Ice cream Tofu Coffee Tea Milkshake Cuisine of Denmark Milk Dairy Breakfast Bread Yoplait Food preservation Cheese Mayonnaise Brewery Cajun cuisine Soy protein Rum Cantonese cuisine French fries Bagel Cheesecake Cuisine of Brazil Fish sauce Chocolate Gatorade Cuisine of the Southern United States Ham Apple pie Vegetarian cuisine Russian cuisine Peruvian cuisine In-N-Out Burger Food Sauerkraut Kit Kat Freezing Quake III Arena Pizza Muesli McDonald's Sushi Jam Pancake Jewish cuisine Idli Cuisine of the Philippines Fanta Soup Rice pudding Sake Barbecue Recipe Domesticated turkey Cold Stone Creamery Sherbet Honey Gelato Hamburger Ketchup Horehound Cuisine of Turkey French toast Soft drink Hot dog Chicken soup Beer Bengali cuisine Daiquiri Dairy product Cuisine of Laos Avocado Vinegar Pop-Tarts Cincinnati chili Vegetarianism Roux Maple syrup Wine making Turkish Delight Turkish coffee Orange Julius Genericized trademark Organic food Japanese tea ceremony Soul food German cuisine
