recommend farfalle bow ties fusilli corkscrews penne ziti rotelle wagon wheels macaroni or small shells cook the pasta in a gallon of boiling water seasoned with tablespoons of salt that's right tablespoons until just tender drain but do not rinse the pasta instead dump it onto a large lipped cookie sheet to cool and dry don't worry if the pasta sticks together the dressing will break it up step prepare pounds of key ingredients these are the salad's major add ins cooked and raw vegetables poultry seafood canned beans and mild cheeses for example some need little or no preparation before going into the salad others can be cooked in the pot of water along with the pasta still others are best sauteed or grilled choose at least major flavorings it's good to let one ingredient lead for

thick bell peppers cored seeded and cut into bite size strips options for other major add ins canned beans drained and rinsed chicken breasts grilled sauteed or steamed and cut crosswise into thin bite size strips italian sausage steam sauteed and sliced thin on a slight bias cooked lobster cooked and peeled shrimp canned tuna drained mild cheeses e g mozzarella cheddar swiss monterey jack cut into inch cubes crabmeat pasteurized lump picked over for shell ham sliced inch thick and cut into bite size strips step choose intense flavors stronger tasting than the major add ins these ingredients should be used more sparingly pick at least one representative from this category but feel free to use two or three roasted peppers pine nuts and feta cheese for example will give the salad a mediterranean feel if making an asian style salad stick to nuts and seeds options in most cases add about cup unless otherwise noted feta crumbled parmesan shaved with a vegetable peeler goat cheese crumbled capers drained cup olives pitted and coarsely chopped peperoncini drained and thinly sliced roasted peppers cut into strips sun dried tomatoes packed in oil cut into small dice bacon fried and crumbled ounces prosciutto ounces thinly sliced cut into small dice smoked salmon ounces thinly sliced then cut into thin strips other smoked fish and shellfish are possibilities as well pine nuts toasted roasted cashews coarsely chopped roasted or honey roasted peanuts coarsely chopped toasted sesame seeds cup sunflower seeds step add onions and herbs no matter what else is in your pasta salad always add three large green onions sliced or half of a small red onion diced the types of onions are completely interchangeable although i tend to use green onions for asian style salads then mince tablespoons fresh herbs and or grate teaspoons orange or lemon zest the peel minus the bitter white pith for asian style pasta salads consider cilantro basil and or the citrus zests dill and mint are usually compatible with creamy style salads because rosemary and tarragon are such strong flavors use just tablespoon of either herb combined with tablespoons of minced parsley and if you're ever in doubt about which herbs to use you'll never go wrong with good ol' chopped fresh parsley step make a dressing whether you prepare one of the following dressings or choose another you'll need cup to coat the salad the key is to make sure the dressing is thick and emulsified otherwise the pasta absorbs the vinegar while the oil clings in droplets to the pasta's surface stick with milder rice wine vinegar or lemon juice balsamic vinegar while flavorful turns the pasta an unattractive brown and stronger vinegars make bright green vegetables drab each of these recipes makes about cup you can prepare the ingredients in advance but toss the salad and dressing only minutes before serving
