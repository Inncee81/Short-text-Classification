extra large muffin tops i just want to know if i need to add another ingredient to my recipies because ive tried making the muffin tops extra big like they do in stores but if i had more of the mixture the edges burn and they look flat not puffy and pretty can you help please thanks in advance baking powder is usually the leavening ingredient which makes the muffins rise try an experiment make your usual recipe and scoop out muffins add teaspoon more baking powder and do more muffins another tsp and more another tsp and more bake as you normally do and see if you get the results you want with your normal recipe you could try turning the oven down and baking a little longer this would allow the muffins to puff up a bit more before setting up i once saw a special baking pan just for making muffin tops it was like a very shallow muffin pan i know that's not what you are looking for but thought i'd add it anyway whatever you do remember that muffin batter must not be over mixed just stir until all the ingredients are moistened too much mixing will make the muffins dense and heavy not light and flufffy Bread Muffin Pizza Pancake Baking powder Idli Bagel Cookware and bakeware Flour Cake Japanese cuisine Chocolate Pita Rice pudding English muffin Baking Haggis Cookie Gumbo Soy protein Carbon dioxide Japanese tea ceremony Cooking weights and measures Dosa Recipe Tofu Breadmaker Brewery Breakfast Barbecue Chili con carne Kosher foods Mayonnaise Cajun cuisine Baked Alaska Drill bit Cuisine of Denmark Hot dog Naan Puff pastry Jewish cuisine Vinegar Curry Black powder Cheesecake Milkshake Medical prescription Kraft Dinner Cuisine of the Philippines Martini cocktail Risotto Cooking Dal Meatball Ceramics Cantonese cuisine XML Bengali cuisine Opportunity rover Cocaine Toothpaste Pie Wok Internal ballistics Potato chips Casting Sourdough Cocoa Sushi Plastic Coffee Green tea Paint Baklava Maple syrup Turkish coffee Potato pancakes Softball Illegal drug trade French cuisine French fries Vegetarian cuisine Toffee Laundry detergent Mai Tai Cuisine of India French toast Trisodium phosphate Halva Souffl__ Meatloaf Hamburger Gunpowder Fried dough foods Poker jargon Tea
