what's the best easiest way to get the skin off of raw chicken i've attempted to cook chicken once in my life and it wasn't a pleasent experience lol is there an easy way to get the skin off before prep wow so many great responses thanks guys in response to buying the skinless chicken i almost did today but the prices were almost double what i paid for the chicken with skin i think it's just this store because i don't remember such a dramatic price difference where i used to live but thank you for the advice i'll have to do some price comparison shopping in the future jean m you cracked me up i loved your response p ack my mistake jean m i didn't want you to think i was being rude to you by saying i laughed at your answer i must've misread the name alice c thanks for the suggestion of parboiling i'd heard this before and heard it worked great but i'm so new to the cooking thing that i'm afraid i'll muck it up because it is slippery get a good grip on it using a paper towel to hold it so it will not slip and grip a piece of skin with the other hand holding some paper towel too this is especially good with skinning the drumstick which will bare itself down to the shank then you just chop off the end and the skin on it because it is a slippery tug of war if you don't The Ashlee Simpson Show Poker jargon Chopsticks Milton H.
