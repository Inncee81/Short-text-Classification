mailing cupcakes my boyfriend is deploying to iraq soon and i haven't the faintest idea of how to mail cupcakes that will survive and not go to crud lol believe me i have endured my fair share of deployments with my dad brother friends etc i just never tried to send baked goods does anyone know how to keep them 'fresh' hi i'm in iraq right now and honestly i wouldn't send cupcakes its degrees here and we don't always get our mail in good time so by the time he gets them the heat will have made them go off or he might not get them till a month after you send them its best to send those things during the winter months when its cool my family just sends me pre packaged stuff and i still appreciate it as i'm sure he will too we just like getting mail no matter what it is Simple Simpson Cruising (maritime) Care Bears Theodore Kaczynski George W.
