ughhhh baked potato how do u make a baked potato i really just want knowhow long and what tempature a medium one or a whole recipie would b great thanx i love crispy skinned baked potatoes and if you do too here is how you make them this recipe is for a large potato so you will have to decrease the baking time by a few minutes for a small or medium one heat your oven to degrees wash and dry the potato then poke it a few times with a fork don't wrap it in foil just lay it on the rack in the oven and bake it for about minutes or until it feels a little soft when you squeeze it with a hot pad on your hand of course if you are in a hurry you can bake it in the microwave for about minutes while you are heating the oven then pop it in the heated oven for about to minutes and you get a potato with that yummy crispy skin if you like the seasoned baked potatoes you get at restaurants before you throw it in the oven just rub shortening all over it and sprinkle with salt pepper garlic powder and whatever seasonings suit your fancy this makes the skins so yummy my kids will even eat them baking at a high heat is the secret because it makes the skin crispy and the inside comes out nice and fluffy good luck and i hope this helps Bread Pizza French fries Potato chips Baking Cuisine of the Philippines Cookware and bakeware Pancake Jewish cuisine Wok Bagel Potato Hot dog Japanese cuisine Cantonese cuisine Rice pudding Peking Duck Barbecue Haggis Cake Microwave oven Dumpling Cuisine of Brazil Soul food Cookie German cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Curry Cajun cuisine Bengali cuisine Upholstery Chili con carne Pasta Fecal incontinence Cooking on a campfire Sandwich Chocolate Kraft Dinner Gumbo Korean cuisine Timon and Pumbaa Souffl__ In-N-Out Burger Maple syrup Printed circuit board Domesticated turkey Baked Alaska Egg (food) Roast beef Cocoa Roman eating and drinking Botulism Casting Hamburger Ramen Baking powder Cocaine Potato pancakes Sterilization (microbiology) Waffle Toast Internal ballistics Pie Fish and chips Muffin Chile pepper Breakfast Agar plate McDonald's Full English breakfast Peruvian cuisine Manicure Bong Transformer Slow cooker Doughnut Diving suit Meatball Mantou Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Food Cha chaan teng Kitchen Taco Cremation Acne Soup Mango Pottery
