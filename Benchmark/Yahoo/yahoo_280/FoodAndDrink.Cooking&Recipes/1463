theres something wrong with my curry please help i put potato onions and some corn then i put the curry powder and let it thicken it smelled perfect but when i tasted it i was thinking to throw it away so i put sugar to cut out the bitterness and it got even weirder why is it like this can i even fix it this is my first time cooking curry the reason why your curry is bitter is because the curry is 'raw' when its thrown into the pot you need to saute the curry in oil on a low heat setting for about a minute or two just to 'cook' the curry slightly before you put anything else into the pot the bitterness of the curry is because the spices are not toasted before they are crushed and made into curry powder so you need to cook it before its used just to get rid of the bitterness hope this helps its what i do and i make curry on a weekly basis because im west indian Curry Bengali cuisine Cuisine of Denmark French fries Japanese cuisine Chili con carne Cantonese cuisine German cuisine Idli Cuisine of Singapore Tea Pizza Cuisine of Ethiopia Halva Coffee Cuisine of Africa Jewish cuisine Coriander Cuisine of Malaysia Hot dog Chile pepper Bread Cuisine of Brazil Rum Gumbo Peruvian cuisine Nabemono Cajun cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Roux Patna Ramen Barbecue Porridge Kelantan Cookware and bakeware Breakfast Plantain Nutmeg Cuisine of Thailand Dosa Cumin Russian cuisine Explosive material Chowder Food preservation Recipe Fenugreek Sushi Chocolate Sugar Hot pot Haggis Garlic Internal ballistics Cheese Pot Noodle Cooking oil Cuisine of Cambodia Sichuan Pepper Fish and chips Marmite Hamburger Cocoa MRE Chaaru Red Dwarf characters Iron Bowl Risotto In-N-Out Burger Poker jargon Soul food Onion Battle of Agincourt Satay Dumpling Irish stew Korean cuisine Udon Dairy Roman eating and drinking Rice Handloading Cuisine of India Basic taste Mango Cajun Starch Cookie Brewery D__ner kebab Flour Cuisine of Laos Caribbean Chinese cuisine Potato chips Snooker Salad
