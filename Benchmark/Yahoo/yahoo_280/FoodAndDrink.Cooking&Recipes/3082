frying eggs i am really bad at frying eggs i usually either add a ton of oil to fry them so they wont stick or a little oil and then they do stick is there like an amount of oil that isn't too greasy but wont make the eggs stick to the pan yes i do coat the pan if that matters i use about a half tablespoon of butter instead of oil and never have the eggs stick to the pan Mayonnaise Tofu Peanut butter Bread Pizza Pancake Bacon Breakfast Stir frying French fries Potato pancakes French toast Chili con carne Recipe Teflon Full English breakfast Cookie Sandwich Deep frying Jewish cuisine Cookware and bakeware Hot dog Tempera Dosa Fried egg Risotto Wok Tortilla Scrambled eggs Fried chicken Ramen Greasy spoon Cuisine of Brazil Roux Margarine Bearnaise sauce Motor oil Olive oil Maple syrup Cantonese cuisine Rice Paint Plastic Halva Oreo Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of the Southern United States Coffee Butter Bengali cuisine Ice cream Cooking weights and measures Barbecue Egg (food) Omega-3 fatty acid Fried rice Porridge Japanese cuisine Eggs Benedict Pizza Hut Fried dough foods Cuisine of Singapore German cuisine Kebab Homestar Runner Roast beef RuneScape economy Idli Cast iron Chicken Paella McDonald's Cuisine of Canada In-N-Out Burger Veganism Coal Heinkel He 100 Toast Futurama (TV series - season 4) Dairy Soul food Chewing gum Cake Egg (biology) Theory of conduct Peanut Cuisine of Denmark Lecithin Puff pastry Cha chaan teng Trans fat Plantain Wiener schnitzel Doughnut Tilapia Domesticated turkey Manual transmission Emulsion Bra (Dragon Ball) Irish cuisine
