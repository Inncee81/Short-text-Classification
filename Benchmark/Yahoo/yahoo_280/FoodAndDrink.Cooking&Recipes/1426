does aluminum foil really taint the flavor of food or is this a rumor in reference to baking aluminum foil typically has a dull and a shiny side which occurs during the manufacturing of the material typically neither side is significantly better than the other for the general purposes of cooking wrapping covering or lining processes when preparing or storing foods however since there is a dull and a shiny side and since the shiny side is a better reflector of heat or cold it may be of some value to use each side accordingly when cooking or storing foods it is simply that the difference in value is very small and probably not noticable that said since the shiny side of foil will reflect heat better wrap foods to be stored in refrigerated conditions with the shiny side out so warmer temperatures are reflected away and kept out of the wrapped food similarly if an item is being cooked it may slow some of the cooking process only slightly if the shiny side is on the outside of the item resulting in the heat being reflected or if you want wrapped foods to remain warm wrap the food with the dull side out so the heat reflects off the shiny side and back into the food Aluminium foil Mylar Aluminium Wok Bread Solar power Welding Barbecue Tofu Cooking Food preservation Kitchen Ice cream Urban heat island Bong Chocolate Laserdisc Slow cooker Printed circuit board Coffee Cooking on a campfire Spark plug Methamphetamine Knife Sushi Cuisine of Denmark Soldering Tin Microwave oven Foodborne illness Fast bowling Carbon dioxide Portable stove Botulism Plastic Stereoscopy Kosher foods Organic food Refrigerator Brewery Thermal power station Solar box cooker Puff pastry Renewable energy Pottery Heat Pebble bed reactor Lighting Casting Thermoregulation Gramophone record Uranium Items in the Metroid series Explosive material Air conditioning Gas metal arc welding Stirling engine Global climate model Korean cuisine Glass Japanese cuisine Acetic acid Disc brake Canoe Apollo Command/Service Module Fish and chips Dairy Rice cooker Food Domesticated turkey Violin Temperature Global warming and agriculture Electrical wiring Hypothermia Sewage treatment Bagel Sausage French cuisine Climate of the United Kingdom Ramen Cajun cuisine Climate change E85 Sauerkraut Bento Phase (matter) Butter Transistor Tea Cuisine of Africa Clothing Baking Headlight El Ni__o Iron
