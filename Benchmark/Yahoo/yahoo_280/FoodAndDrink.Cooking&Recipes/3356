closed contact grills they worth it i been thinking about buying one like a goerge forman grill do they work as good as all the hype i hate infomercials but have been told they work great i seen recipes in cookboks lately opinions please they do work but as somebody who has cooked professionally on and off for over years i'd rather fire up the charcoal grill however closed contact grills do what they say they cook on both sides at the same time and grease does flow away from the item being prepared and there are quick i own one and have used it but all it really does is collect dust what bothers me about closed contact grills is the end result doesn't look as appealing the food doesn't taste as good the food typically comes out very dry with the exception of cooking on both sides you get the same results on a charcoal grill but the food looks better tastes infinitely better and if you are patient comes off the grill moist and mouth watering webber manufactures a couple of spacing saving electric and charcoal grills but if you don't have the room for or just don't want to purchase one then a closed contact grill is just fine i'm not pushing webber over any other brand of grill i just have experience with webber there are many quality grills on the market i would just research them and then make my decision Kitchen Carbon dioxide Grill Dundas Square Korean cuisine Tofu Rum Hamburger Cuisine of Laos Tobacco Grilling Ramen Cuisine of Malaysia Cooking Japanese cuisine D__ner kebab Cigarette Hot dog RuneScape quests Chocolate Bread Rice In-N-Out Burger Satay FoxTrot Solar cell Explosive material Idli Charcoal Recipe Cuisine of Thailand Food Shark Chili con carne German cuisine Solar power Fast-food restaurant Internal ballistics Plastic Diablo II: Lord of Destruction MRE Hydrogen economy Semiconductor device Asado Stove Cooking on a campfire Little Britain Incandescent light bulb Mayonnaise Slow cooker Paracetamol Dairy Pottery Bengali cuisine Inflation Breakfast Cuisine of Brazil Campfire Kebab Sushi Muffin Organic food Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark McDonald's Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Volleyball Pizza Rocket fuel Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cuisine of the Philippines Upholstery Globalization Curry The Smoking Room The Amazing Race Fountain Cajun cuisine The Star Wars Holiday Special Chopsticks BMW Black pepper Fugu Cigar Economics Electrophysiology Renewable energy Equine conformation Electronic commerce Commodity Lisa the Vegetarian Edsel Microeconomics Thermal power station French cuisine Drawing Sewage treatment Spanish cuisine Piccolo Junior Saga
