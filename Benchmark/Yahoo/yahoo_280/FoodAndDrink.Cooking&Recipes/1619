which ramen soup brand do you think is better nissin or maruchan i personally can't stand the nissin brand it not as soft as maruchan's and the soup mix tastes a little off anyone know why costco changed to nissin or is that just in az my mom bought and made nissin brand top ramen and no one noticed it was a different brand untill we ate it tastes way different i can stand it but i have eaten much less ramen lately that is untill we got the real stuff someone aksed this a while ago so i tested them both i luckily had both lying around nissin's noodles are firmer this is a matter of preference i suppose as both are well within tolerance for a normal person however their powder tastes more powdery maruchan filled my kitchen with a delightful scent almost immediately i love their spicy and creamy chicken flavors the aroma is wonderful to me and the flavor is much richer without seeming richer to the stomach i dont know what costco did with their brands maruchan is still readily available everywhere i shop Japanese cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Tofu Russian cuisine Cheese Chili con carne Bengali cuisine Soba German cuisine Mattress Tobacco Coriander Chocolate Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Laos Cuisine of Denmark American Chinese cuisine Beer Cuisine of Singapore Peruvian cuisine Jewish cuisine Kelantan Breakfast Ginger MRE Bread Street food Rum Gumbo Cuisine of Thailand Inca Kola Saimin Fast-food restaurant Cuisine of Brazil Curry Yerba mate Brewery McDonald's Wine Yoghurt Essential oil Campbell Soup Company Laksa Sake Cuisine of Cambodia Cajun cuisine Pizza Polish cuisine Hot pot Chinese cuisine Coffee Cha chaan teng Microeconomics Cuisine of Africa Beef noodle soup Mountain Dew Hot dog Iron Chef America Udon Chicken Taiwanese cuisine Sichuan Pepper New Coke Shanghai cuisine Barbecue Vegetarian cuisine Pancake Alka-Seltzer Joke Miso The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Oreo Croquet (food) Cigar Ginger ale Tea Cannabis (drug) Fish and chips Sugar substitute Black pepper Monofloral honey Avocado Oolong Domestic goat Potato Sushi Food Sauerkraut Chinese food therapy Ice cream Bulk vending Chaaru Mayonnaise Satay
