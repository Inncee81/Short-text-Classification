chicken fat chicken fat we all know that chicken soup is good for you we eat it when we're sick does anybody know why is it because of the chicken fat or something else i heard that chicken fat is very good for you before i heard it i always took the fat off when i made a chicken soup because i am trying to be on a low fat diet but then if there is not fat in the soup what is the point of it or maybe i can just leave the fat in it for sure it would have a much better flavor with the fat in it so does anybody know the answer thanks i think it is healthier and safer if you boil the chicken with the skin on therefore extracting the fat also but skimming the oil or taking the fat that solidifies after refrigerating the broth does not diminish the powers of a good chicken soup Ramen Chicken soup Soup Jewish cuisine Egg (food) Pork rind Stock (food) Milk Russian cuisine Margarine Joke Cuisine of the Philippines Japanese cuisine Food preservation Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Laos Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of the Southern United States Sauerkraut Gumbo Soy protein Omega-3 fatty acid Vegetarian cuisine Hot pot Chocolate Essential oil Vitamin C Food Roux Campbell Soup Company Korean cuisine Olive oil Domesticated turkey Veganism British cuisine Insulin Miso soup Consomm__ Ice cream Dumpling Chinese food therapy Atkins Nutritional Approach Bak kut teh Trans fat Dieting Peruvian cuisine German cuisine Butter Soul food Tocopherol Dairy Bacon Chaaru Cheese Cuisine of Greece Chicken Cajun cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Minestrone Vegetarianism South Beach diet McDonald's Gelatin Cuisine of Singapore American Chinese cuisine Comanche Menudo (soup) Miso Low-carbohydrate diet Soy milk Risotto Cooking oil Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bengali cuisine Peking Duck Tlingit Acorn Tamale Curry Cajun Soap Mayonnaise Food processing Soba Fried chicken Nabemono Bone marrow Tomato Breakfast Garfield Hamburger Yoghurt Hell's Kitchen (television) Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Cuisine of Cambodia
