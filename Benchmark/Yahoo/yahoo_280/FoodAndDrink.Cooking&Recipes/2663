cookies so a few years back i had some cookies at the arch in saint louis and they were called oatmeal scotch or soemthing like that they were so yummy so my question is has anyone heard of these cookies before and does anyone have a recipe for them thanks so much since you didn't mention the cookies as having butterscotch morsels in them i suspect that it was a plain oatmeal cookie where the sugar was caramelized before it was incorporated into the cookie dough i sometimes do this w my peanut butter cookies and my tea cakes a type of sugar cookie it's a nice change of taste Cookie Girl Scout cookies Chocolate Cold Stone Creamery Bread Oatmeal Pancake Vegetarian cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Biscuit Bagel Rum Oreo Mooncake Tofu Alice B.
