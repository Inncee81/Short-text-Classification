just a plain old tomato sauce base from actual tomatos instead of canned ones no olive oil no tons of seasonings all i wanna know is how to reduce plain normal tomatos out of the produce section down to a sauce i'm sure i'll need some sort of mild binder but this seemingly simple task is leaving me completely dumbfounded and it's driving me freaking crazy help it is best ot use vine ripened tomatoes as opposed to store bought variety the riper the better drop tomatoes in boiling water for a minute or two then submerge in ice warer this makes the skins remove easily halve the tomatoe core it and seed it chop into small pieces and drop in to large heavy bottom sauce pan add just a touch of oil to keep from sticking and some salt bring mixture to a boil and remove scum as it developes on top of the pot tomatoes will cook apart and at that point you can blend or mill the sauce to remove any ramaining seeds cook at a simmer uncovered until water cooks out to desired thickness it could take as much as to hrs and expect volume to decrease by half a low slow simmer just bubbling will keep it from scorching and you may need to decrease the heat as it thickens good luck and enjoy Tofu Hot dog Chili con carne Coffee Cookware and bakeware Brewery Japanese cuisine Cantonese cuisine Idli Cajun cuisine Stock (food) Ketchup Tomato Cuisine of the Philippines French cuisine Pizza Peruvian cuisine Chicken soup Pasta Bread Textile manufacturing Carbon dioxide Food preservation Ice cream Sugar beet Cincinnati chili Ramen Curry Gumbo Bong Halva Dumpling Roux Soap Cuisine of Singapore Jewish cuisine Hamburger Rice Drill bit In-N-Out Burger Soy sauce MRE French fries Water (molecule) Poker jargon Pot Noodle Knife Thermal power station Hot pot Bagel Dairy Decompression sickness Tea Pizza Hut Portable stove Motor oil Consomm__ Salad Wok Rum Solvent Cha chaan teng Pottery Petroleum Internal ballistics Korean cuisine Common bean Chicago-style pizza Bacon Casting Soup Diving suit Ocean thermal energy conversion Apple Perfume Fossil fuel power plant Boiling point Maple syrup Breakfast Phase (matter) Leather Anchor Heinkel He 100 Fishing Tobacco
