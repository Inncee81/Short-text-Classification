how do i make a nice omelette whenever i try to make them they're almost burnt underneath but the top is still all soggy i can't flip them because of this soggyness is my gas up too high how do i make them so they're nice thanks i'm at my wits end as i've tried everything use a standard non stick medium skillet spray a very light coat of pam or other cooking spray over the whole pan let the pan warm to a medium low heat like on a scale of i am usually a butter fan but i don't recommend it for this you need very light even greasing that won't pool or burn in a bowl add a bit of milk to your three eggs i don't know how to explain how much milk because i forgot to measure it i guess about a quarter of a cup it's an eyeball thing two heavy pours or gloop gloop i know some people leave it out but i believe the milk is the st key to a perfect omelet editor's note after two years i finally measured it's two tablespoons also i am revising my statement that milk is necessary i have been experimenting with both ways since posting this tutorial and i will grudgingly admit that a perfect omelet can be made with just beaten egg be sure to whisk them thoroughly and be sure to pour into a pre heated pan the egg is more eggy and not as fluffy but they set up faster and more evenly so make it a matter of personal taste add some seasoning to taste i like a little salt and fresh ground pepper and a hit of tony's whisk the eggs pour the egg mixture in the skillet and swish it around so that a fine layer of egg sticks to the side of the pan you might want to click on the swish pic at left to see the closeup do this by picking up the skillet and rotating it slightly this is swish and it is the nd key to the perfect omelet leave the egg mixture alone for a few minutes to allow it to cook and set up you will know the egg has cooked enough to proceed when the egg whites have actually turned white you can see the white chunks in the picture while the egg cooks take a minute to make sure your fillings are mise en place anything you like can go into an omelet in my opinion some sort of cheese is necessary because it makes the omelet hold nicely and then vegetables and meats are great additions today i've grabbed some diced turkey fresh mushrooms shredded cheddar and a slice of swiss i wish i had some chives but it's no big deal other good fillings ham jack cheese smoked salmon bell peppers crumbled bacon proscuitto spinach when the egg is about cooked solid it is time for the second swish whatever liquid mixture is left in the skillet swirl it around the edges again to make the crispy edge layer thicker swish is wait for it the rd key to the perfect omelet let the omelet continue to cook until the crispy thin egg edge starts to pull away from the pan click at far left for the closeup this is when to add your fillings put your fillings in the omelet on one side only in a half moon shape i try to put the fillings on the opposite side from where the crispy edge started to pull away since that side will probably be easiest to fold over leave a little room around the circumference so the fillings don't spill out the edges should really be pulling away from the pan now take your fork and run the tines around the outside edge of the omelet to make sure the egg layer has not stuck then you can use your thumb and forefinger to grab the empty side of the omelet and fold it over the fillings be gentle the egg layer is delicate you don't want to tear it get your plate out while you let the folded omelet sit for about seconds take a spatula and run it under the omelet to make sure it is not stuck to the pan get ready for the slide angle the skillet over your plate and slide the omelet should slip nicely out of the pan and onto the plate if you like you can use the spatula underneath to coax it yay nb if you look underneath you should see that both sides of the omelet are evenly browned and not burned my omelet today was little too browned for my personal preference but that's because i was taking pictures while i cooked if you follow my guidelines yours should turn out a little lighter which is perfect ta da you are now an omelet maker extraordinaire now emeril or whoever would probably garnish this with fresh fennel i hate fennel or some sauce or some other green stuff but if you are just making lunch for yourself like i did you don't need all that crap if you were serving this as a meal i would say whip up some sort of potatoes or maybe a bagel with a shmear and you are set Hot dog Jewish cuisine Japanese tea ceremony
