which cut of meat should i make i wanna make a roast tonight and i won't finish it for sure i want to use the leftovers to make a couple of sandwiches throughout the week i've never cooked a roast before so i don't know which piece of meat to use please advise if you don't mind spending the money a sirloin tip roast is great for sandwiches the next day and the day after that my favorite way is to take a sirloin tip roast and cut slits all around the top and stuff each slit with a sliver of fresh garlic season with salt and pepper and i prefer to smoke it in the smoker for hours but it can be done in the oven and you end up with ecellent roast beef for sandwiches can't go wrong with sirloin tip man now i'm hungry what times dinner Barbecue Cuisine of Denmark Domesticated turkey Jewish cuisine Chili con carne Roast beef Italian beef German cuisine Cantonese cuisine Bacon Beef Hamburger Sandwich French fries Peanut butter D__ner kebab Pizza Bengali cuisine Soul food Peking Duck Ramen Roman eating and drinking Steak Cuisine of the Southern United States Cajun cuisine Breakfast Hot dog Cuisine of Africa Coffee Bread Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Turkey Chicken French cuisine Chicken soup Cuisine of Malaysia In-N-Out Burger Ham Cuisine of Argentina Sauce Bagel Korean cuisine Stock (food) Friends British cuisine Kitchen Cookware and bakeware Sausage Sunday roast Polish cuisine Corned beef Steak n Shake Tamale Russian cuisine Idli TV dinner Cuisine of Brazil Feijoada Cha chaan teng Tofu Meatball Cuisine of Laos Horse meat Guinea pig Pork chop Shark Dim sum Gyros Asado Burger Vegetarian cuisine Dumpling Rice pudding Potato Sushi Pickling Grilling Campfire Bong Cuisine of Vietnam Satay Peruvian cuisine Albert Fish Gustavus Franklin Swift Nabemono Australian cuisine Tea (meal) Fast-food restaurant Ukrainian cuisine Culture of Turkey Peanut Phoebe Buffay's songs Kebab Grilled cheese sandwich Salad Haggis Refrigerator car Cincinnati chili Food preservation
