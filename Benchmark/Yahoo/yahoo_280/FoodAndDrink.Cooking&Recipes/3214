making breads and pastry dishes hello i have not made any breads since i was at catering college thirty years ago and my pastry is only average are their any chefs patissiers out there who can give me hints to get started again i will be baking in a domestic setting initially electric oven gas hob thanks as a professional chef foggie you already know the compositions and proportions for the foundation pastes all too well so we'll just pass over those swiftly in silence anytime you need reminding of some of the more way out ones' compositions just rattle my cage and they will be winging their way to you post haste coming back to pastry after a break can be very frustrating because we all suffer from a particularly infuriating condition that m roux once called 'having lost your hands' pastry making technique is above all sensory feedback through your hands as you work the pastes and at first though you know from past experience that you should be registering things nothing seems to be happening and pastes you have made a thousand times before seem to fall to ashes on the board in front of you and you seem powerless to do anything about it the good news is that this passes after a little time and a lot of paste making have the family brace themselves for a deluge of tartlets and pasties pies and cro tes for a while gg which you keep doing completely by hand to get your 'feel' back each time you reach the stage when a paste type feels right for your hands again change the formula to make it shorter and thus harder to control and again run through a few iterations of making it that way until that too feels right again etc the critical point of failure of almost any paste except choux is the d trempe the moment of gathering by the addition of ice cold sic water too much and you've just made glue too little and if you don't correct the situation perfectly at a single stroke by adding just one more shot of water immediately you'll have overworked it and bootleather will result after baking pastry is cruel like that g first of all get to know your flour different gluten levels will give a very different d trempe use ice cold water use a known measure like tbs add the water and work the d trempe with your remaining hand simultaneously you want the mass to be in movement as the water strikes and you want the water to strike at the outer edge so you can see what's happening watch like a hawk and keep things moving the d trempe will spread inwards and the moment you feel it sticking to your hand at the centre you'll know you've got enough a minute maybe two at most is what this should take if it doesn't add another shot reduce the vigour of your working hand let a minute elapse as you work then repeat if you still don't have a d trempe now you should be worried if it now gathers you're ok if not declare the batch a failure but now methodically keep adding single measures until you do get the result that will give you a baseline requirement for the type of flour you're using bin the result or bake as dog biscuit and start again wild birds squirrels love it raw too once you've got the feel and eye for your d trempe back transfer the process to your mixing machine remembering to chill your mixing bowl beater before you start and now you do exactly the same but with only your eye for control feed the water in at the edge of the bowl for visual control and repeat the process the use of a tbs for a measure is just to get a benchmark volume of water for your type of flour i use a small jug always the same one and heaven help anyone else trying to use it gg and the d trempe is done by a single flick of my wrist of the hand holding the jug that'll give me a full d trempe in one probably out of times what seems a frivolous way of achieving exactness is ruled by the physical feedback from my wrist which is much more explicitly defined to me than any manipulation of several spoonsful could ever do hope this helps and welcome back to the wondrous world of flour excuse length describing otherwise simple actions just 'uses up words' like nobody's business Flour Extreme Programming Electrophysiology RuneScape quests XML Fast bowling Puff pastry Experiment Mouse (computing) Compiler optimization CPU cache Dairy Ice hockey Mixed martial arts Jewish cuisine Jet engine Out-of-body experience Volleyball Tide Table tennis Time travel Thermal power station Coffee Brewery Time Out of Mind Redundant array of independent disks Digital circuit Tea Diving Shaggy dog story Milton H.
