anyone out there have a really good dessert recipe that they're just dying to tell somebody oh my goodness all of these recipes are sounding so delicious thank you all there is this type of pudding and i can tell you how to make it it is so scrumptious okay you need to have a lot of jelly packets different flavours you need to make a vanilla cake and you need vannila or mango flavoured ice cream you also need a large dessert bowl any type of juice is nice too you first make a layer of jelly in the bowl and then wait for it to set though meanwhile you can make the cake then once the jellly is ready you can cut the cake it should be the same shape as the bowl but that doesn't matter much as a fairly thin layer maybe about inches or three but it has to fill the bowl covering the jelly you then pour some juice over the cake so that the cake can get soaked in it and it will become nice and soft you then make another layer of jelly on top or you can put a layer of ice cream if you do make an exta layer of jelly then you put the ice cream after you then wait for the ice cream and everything to set and after you make two flavours of jelly or more and you cut them into cubes once they are set and place them on top of the ice cream instead of the jelly cubes you can put any other decoration i hope you enjoy all my friends did Tofu Pancake Cake Cuisine of the Philippines Japanese cuisine Dim sum Baked Alaska Mooncake Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Denmark German cuisine Coffee Yoghurt Apple pie Cuisine of Singapore Jewish cuisine Bread Apple Jelly Belly Cookie Chocolate Breakfast Cheesecake Cider Jelly Korean cuisine Mango Mochi Rice pudding Doughnut Turkish Delight French cuisine Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Bengali cuisine French toast Custard Peruvian cuisine Pizza Swedish cuisine Sherbet Fried dough foods Naples Baklava Pea soup Risotto Jaffa cake Tapioca Vanilla Date Palm Polish cuisine Butter Martini cocktail Textile manufacturing Garden Strawberry Codename: Kids Next Door Pavlova Confectionery Beer Cuisine of Turkey Barbecue Potato pancakes Vegetarian cuisine Cocoa Sampling (music) Dairy GunBound Roman eating and drinking Pasta Sugarcane Glacier Cuisine of Argentina Christmas tree Mattress Birthday Sushi Bong Gelato Soup Japanese tea ceremony Flour Food Idli Yoplait Gelatin Milkshake Bacon Cuisine of the Southern United States Little Britain Campfire Gelatin dessert Culture of Argentina Casting
