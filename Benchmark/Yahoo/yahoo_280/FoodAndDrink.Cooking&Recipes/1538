drying egg noodles i've been letting them dry for about hours now recomended time in recipe but they aren't completely dry how do i know when they're ready should they be as dry as the noodles that come in the box from the store no they are done if you followed the recipe they should be stiffer than when you hung them to dry but not so stiff they crumble when you handle them edit if you are not making these for immediate use the others are correct they need to be very dry nearly as dry as packaged noodles unless you are going to freeze them my advice was for partially drying noodles before making chicken noodle soup or whatever bert Ramen Soup Cantonese cuisine Chicken soup Tofu Russian cuisine Pot Noodle Cuisine of Malaysia Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Laos Cuisine of Thailand Pasta Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Singapore German cuisine Polish cuisine Cuisine of Cambodia Recipe Curry MRE Sichuan Pepper Chicken Soba Korean cuisine Pancake Vegetarian cuisine Cuisine of Vietnam Jewish cuisine Hokkien mee Blood plasma Fishing Dim sum Beef noodle soup Once Upon a Time in America Food preservation Cuisine of Brazil American Chinese cuisine Laksa Chocolate Ice cream Cuisine of Austria Saimin Kraft Dinner Mantou Carbon dioxide Pizza Couscous Cha chaan teng Breakfast Barbecue Gumbo Bengali cuisine Seitan Canadian Chinese cuisine Taiwanese cuisine Egg (food) Cuisine of Denmark Chinese food therapy Tlingit Campbell Soup Company Nabemono Polyethylene terephthalate Risotto Ph___ British cuisine Instant coffee Hamburger Salad Pea soup Car handling Udon Mung bean Shanghai cuisine Chili con carne Kuching Seinfeld Miso soup Sushi Mayonnaise Tea Diving suit Tobacco Street food XML Chinatown Jiaozi Cajun cuisine Windows XP Apple pie Angling Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Software testing Coffee Domesticated turkey Tamale Soy protein Minestrone Taboo food and drink
