i defrosted some meat last night and accidentally left it out over night cook it or through it out if it is ground up meat toss it out usually if it is a tight fiber meat such as steak or roast check it for temp if even slightly cool it is likely okay why is it okay because the bacteria is on the surface and not mixed throughout a rather unique but largly unknown pratice is to kill the surface bacteria with rubbing isopropyl alcohol rub the meat well with the alcohol after a few minutes after coating the meat with the alcohol rinse it well under cold water this will increase your meats safety i said it was unique but it is very effective also smelling will help determine degree of contamination keep in mind for the first hours very little bacterial growth occurred as the meat was too cold after this the growth rate increases proportionately with the temperature if it does not stink have a really slimy surface or bad aroma it is likely okay but you should now refer it and cook asap good luck e Escherichia coli O157:H7 Halitosis Temperature Tofu Ethanol Food preservation Bacteria Domesticated turkey Coffee Sewage treatment Water purification Disinfection Bacon Common cold Food Cheese Agar plate Carnivorous plant E85 Motor oil Hamburger Brewery Water Slow cooker Yoghurt Thermoregulation Barbecue Renewable energy Crohn's disease Houseplant Water (molecule) Sauerkraut Hyperthermia Beer Copper extraction Drowning Cuisine of Denmark Fire extinguisher Tea Body piercing Sodium hypochlorite Soy protein Russian cuisine Urban heat island Heat Iron Hypothermia Toxoplasmosis Diseases of the honeybee Tooth enamel Boiling Dental caries Compost Sake Effects of global warming Decompression sickness Refrigerator Ozone Cuisine of the Philippines Bong Cookware and bakeware Severe weather terminology (United States) Egg (food) Dairy Sterilization (microbiology) Hydrogen peroxide Polyethylene terephthalate Cooking Internal ballistics Fermentation Dry cleaning Healthy eating Anthrax Mattress Incandescent light bulb Halaal Tooth French cuisine Alcohol fuel Avalanche Stock (food) Explosive material Roman eating and drinking Sulfur Wok Diving cylinder Wood Chili con carne Fire fighting Friction Jewish cuisine Acetic acid Isopropyl alcohol Air Florida Flight 90 Vegetarianism Peanut butter Veganism
