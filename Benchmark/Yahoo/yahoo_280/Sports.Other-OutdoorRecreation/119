black powder velocity i just bought a caliber black powder pistol and i am trying to find the ballistics on it i know that its hard to get an accurate ballistics chart built on one of these guns since so many factors can alter its over all effectiveness i am just looking for an average fps on the ball any help would be great oh i also tried chronographing the gun but until i get my loads down accurately i cant set the chronograph out far enough to get and accurate fps on the ball without shooting the machine any help would be great c j barrel length inches bullet weight is unknown the ball is in diameter the powder charge is grains of fffp pyrodex eelevvenn the gun is an uberti cal navy revolver i need the ballistics because its something i want to know i have ballistics on all my other guns its just something that i find to be a good piece of mind i ordered the gun i didnt buy it at a retailer to measure velocity in fps we would need to know bullet weight powder charge and barrel length just to name a few things my suggestion to you is get a dixie gunworks catalog and they have the various velocities recorded on charts for different types of firearms calibers and powder charges it's one of the best sources of information out there for black powder that would be my best answer for you Firearm Cartridge (firearms) Terminal ballistics Internal ballistics Carbine Shotgun Caliber .22 Long Rifle .357 SIG Handloading Suppressor M16 (rifle) Rifle Springfield 1903 rifle Machine gun Wildcat cartridge External ballistics 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Revolver M60 machine gun Bullet Assault rifle .303 British Krag-J__rgensen Shell (projectile) Ammunition Airsoft Colt Single Action Army handgun Air gun Kammerlader Mauser Beretta 92F/FS Rimfire Gun barrel M1 Carbine Pistol Flintlock Cannon .22 WMR M1911 Sniper .45 GAP .30-06 Springfield Gunpowder Stopping power Artillery Shotgun shell 9 mm Luger M82 (rifle) Jericho 941 Sniper rifle M240 .50 BMG .45 ACP 10 mm Auto .44 Magnum 7.62 x 39 mm Jarmann M1884 .30 Carbine Heckler & Koch MP5 Paintball marker Webley and Scott Gauge (bore diameter) .22 Long Marathon (computer game) Five-seveN .17 HMR Mortar (weapon) Mouse (computing) Cowboy action shooting Varmint rifle Heckler & Koch G3 Repeating rifle .40 S&W Black powder M4 Carbine Medium machine gun Heckler & Koch USP Ballistics Personal weapon Anti-tank rifle Gatling gun Federal assault weapons ban FN P90 M61 Vulcan Drill bit Counter-Strike Smokeless powder M242 Colt Commando 5.7 x 28 mm Gun safety XM8 rifle M2 machine gun
