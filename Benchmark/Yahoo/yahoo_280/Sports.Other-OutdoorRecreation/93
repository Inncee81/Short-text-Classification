how do i straighten out my moving ollies whenever i do an ollie while moving the tail of my skateboard swings around clockwise i'm goofy footed and does a i land the ollie fine but i come to a complete stop since i land sideways any help with fixing this your body is just doing what it would naturally in this case that seems to be a problem as cliche as it sounds the trick to it is concentrate on exactly what you feet have to do and when to do it i do alot of freestyle and technical trick and i know this helps me there could be another problem though it could be the position of your back foot because if it is more behind you it could cause slight rotation another possibility is that when you jump and pop the tail one of your feet could go higher than the other and cause this cause you to turn a final though would be that your front foot in the air influences the directioning of the board allthough how high you ollie also influences this if you ollie high like in the feet area the board has more force and sticks to your feet better so you land nice and even rather than a low ollie which has been known shift due to lack of control hope this helps Skateboarding trick Skateboarding Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Skateboard Helicopter Snowboarding Kitesurfing Volleyball Flight controls Windsurfing Glossary of ballet terms Figure skating Professional wrestling throws Motorcycle Violin Diving Double bass Backstroke Professional wrestling holds Snowboard Glossary of partner dance terms Car handling Autogyro Professional wrestling aerial techniques GunZ The Duel Front crawl Circle (dance move) Manual transmission Suplex Carburetor BMX Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Tide Planetary orbit Dressage Professional wrestling attacks Pole vault Rotation Ski Cheerleading Swimming Glossary of climbing terms Contredanse Contract bridge Rodney Mullen Balboa (dance) Drill bit Boxing Precession Chess strategy and tactics Marching band Taikyoku shogi Lead and follow (dance) Lindy Basic Magnus effect Axel jump Tenjiku shogi Hard disk Mouse (computing) Motocross BASE jumping Fast bowling Alternative hip hop Ko shogi Parachuting Stall (flight) Bubble Bobble Decompression sickness Horse gait Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Cyclone Devil sticks Fixed-wing aircraft Dai dai shogi Glossary of nautical terms Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Dai shogi Wind Maka dai dai shogi Dog agility Musical Canine Freestyle Skiing Moon Vowel Anatomical terms of location Glossary of American football Charleston (dance move) Breaststroke Yorker Non-native pronunciations of English High jump Fischer Random Chess Floppy disk Teamo Supremo Toe loop jump Tai shogi Horse
