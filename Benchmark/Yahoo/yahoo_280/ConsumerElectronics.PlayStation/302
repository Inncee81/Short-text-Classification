just bought a ps ps owners your opinion i just got a new redesigned silver thin ps and i've read that it can get warm after playing it a long time have the malfunctions from previous models of the ps been corrected how long can this new model stay on without damaging the harddrive i'm not going to keep it on for a whole day or anything but do you have any input on the system's durability based on its small size and tendency to warm up while playing thanx st of all the ps doesn't have a hard drive so you don't have to worry about that the ps uses of course uses the memory cards to save game data ndly i had a ps ever since they came out in or whatever year that was and the ps doesn't over heat the only problems with ps 's were that if you constantly went from game to dvd to cd a lot you could wear out the laser that reads the discs and disc read error would come up don't worrk about it heating up i had the old boxy version and the slim version and overheating was never an issue take care Hard disk Floppy disk DVD Compact disc Atari 8-bit family CD-R USB flash drive Commodore 64 Sega Dreamcast Nintendo GameCube IPod Gramophone record Laserdisc Booting Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple II family Xbox 360 Atari ST Laser PlayStation 3 Nintendo Blu-ray Disc Digital recording AmigaOS Aluminium The Sims 2 Nintendo Revolution Trusted computing DualDisc Surveillance Handheld game console Drill bit PlayStation Portable Password (video games) System/36 MiniDisc Debugging Advanced Squad Leader Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore DOS Animal Crossing Computer Computer hardware Knoppix Modchip Yu-Gi-Oh!
