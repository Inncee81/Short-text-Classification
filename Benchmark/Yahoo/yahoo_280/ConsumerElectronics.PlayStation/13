playstation games i've been looking for some other ps games to buy but i'm not sure which ones to buy the only other ps games that i have even considered buying is armored core or ninja gaiden sigma i don't really know anything about these games i've heard that ninja gaiden sigma is a pretty tough game and i love hard games and i know that in armored core you pilot these huge robots but what else about these games next month i know that i'm getting lair and heavenly sword but should i purchase ninja gaiden sigma or amored core or should i wait until lair and heavenly sword come out if you are satisfied with the games you have and can stand to wait another month then just wait for lair and heavenly sword if you need something to hold you over until then download the demos of both and see wich one you like better for yourself a note on the demos the armored core demo is from and early build of the game stupid isn't it so it isn't the final product but it will give you a tast of what it is like the further your completion of the ninja gaiden sigma demo the more money you will get to start with in the actual game very important as the game is brutally tough whatever you chose to do though you won't be disappointed Super Robot Wars Ninja Gaiden Ninja PlayStation 3 Final Fantasy XI Onimusha Ryu Hayabusa Seiken Densetsu Gradius Armored Core Video game music Boss (video games) Legend of Mana Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Codename: Kids Next Door Vanilla Ninja Monster Rancher monsters Poker jargon Hatake Kakashi Zero (Mega Man) Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Tekken characters Konami Code Mega Man X8 Sub-Zero Computer role-playing game Mecha Shredder (TMNT) Mega Man X (game) Power Rangers: Ninja Storm Resident Evil Xbox Quake III Arena Ganbare Goemon TotalGaming.net Nintendo Baseball Stars Champions of Norrath Fire Emblem GunZ The Duel Lightsaber Game development Nintendo Revolution Shaggy dog story Naruto ninja ranks Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Xbox 360 Half-Life Devil May Cry Metal Gear Solid The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask AdventureQuest Zerg Daikatana Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Diablo (computer game) MMORPG Characters of Naruto GunBound Mega Man X (character) Tokusatsu PlayStation 2 Horizons: Empire of Istaria Wheel of Fortune MegaMan Battle Network Craps Final Fantasy IV Advance Wars: Dual Strike First-person shooter Darius (arcade game) Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 The Legend of Zelda series Beowulf Mega Man X Taki (Soul Calibur) Mega Man X4 Dead or Alive (video game) Science fiction on television Shit Bob and George Babylon 5 IBM PC compatible Serious Sam Nintendo Power Beast Wars Warez Halo 2 Mithril Star Wars: Battlefront II Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening The Beatles bootlegs EXpanded MultiPlayer Gran Turismo (game) Nine Inch Nails The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Zones of EverQuest Transformers: Robots in Disguise Dragon Ball Z Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara
