problems with my tv while playing ps i just bought a insignia lcd hdtv from best buy i understand this is one of those you get what you pay for tv's but still i dont think that legitimizes my problem i bought an hdmi cable for the picture quality is absolutely amazing the only problem i have is the sound the only game i've played on it and the only one i own is elder scrolls oblivion as i said the picture comes in great but the sound is almost like the speakers are blown it sounds like an explosion everytime someone hits me in the game then i tried it with the standard component cables and the sound was fine can someone help me with this any sort of help will be appreciated thanks ahead of time it sounds to me like it could be one of two things either the tv you bought has a faulty hdmi port or the wire is defective my suggestion go back to the store where you bought the hdmi cable and have them excahnge it for another one if you get home and you still have the same problem than it's probably the hdmi port on the tv another thing i would suggest you doing is checking the audio setup on your tv through the tv's setup menu also check the audio setup on your ps to make sure it's setup to use hdmi as the audio output hope this helps and good luck Television SCART Home cinema High-Definition Multimedia Interface Loudspeaker Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Nintendo Entertainment System Oscilloscope Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Dreamcast Laserdisc High-definition television PlayStation 3 IPod Sound recording Xbox 360 Digital Visual Interface RCA connector Xbox Nintendo DS Super Nintendo Entertainment System Atari 8-bit family Audiophile Musical Instrument Digital Interface GSM services PlayStation Portable Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Liquid crystal display Amstrad CPC Cable television High fidelity Windows XP Universal Serial Bus Digital television Sound Blaster IBM PC compatible Satellite television Shit Modem Blu-ray Disc ZX Spectrum Digital photography System/36 Poker jargon Bass guitar Disc jockey TurboGrafx 16 Nintendo Revolution USS Tunny (SS-282) Gross domestic product ATSC Surround sound Warez Speech recognition PC Engine Game Boy 1080p Sega Saturn Hard disk 1957 World Series D-subminiature Sound card Federal Standard 1037C System/34 Transformer Sega The Amazing Race ATI Technologies Commodore 64 Danger Hiptop Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Copy protection Screenshot History of computer and video games MP3 Minor characters in Morrowind Inflation DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Video game music Digital audio broadcasting DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution NeXT DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Decibel Pornography Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Digital Theatre System Amiga Ethernet Embedded system RS-232 British Sky Broadcasting Movie projector Infantilism
