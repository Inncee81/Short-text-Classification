does your ps really damage plasma screen tvs my mom hates it when i play my ps out in the living with the plasma tv she just want us to play it either in my room or the cheep tv in the guest room not even in her room i know i kept asking my mom why and the only reason that i think is unreasonable is that ps or any kind of video games console damages the plasma screen can you please give me a truthful answer but also ones that i can prove her wrong and play in the living room again the plasma is huge its sooo awsome in the old days when you play video games you risk the chance of burn in images this was especially true when you play games on a projection screen the image sticks on the screen and there's no way to remove it games like pac man on the atari usually left images on the screen because the maze never changes with the current technology there is a very slim chance of any burn in images basically the tv should shift the images a little bit at a time to prevent the image from burning as long as you don't leave the screen on pause for a long period of time or leave the game unattended for a long time there's a very slim chance that you'll get burn in images with today's games the game world never really stays the same so it's hard for any image to burn onto the screen Atari 2600 Handheld game console Video game console Blood (computer game) Computer role-playing game Pac-Man Halo 2 Atari ST Xbox 360 Game show MAME Intellivision Bally Astrocade Cyberspace Cathode ray tube Plasma display The Late Show with David Letterman Floppy disk Nintendo Liquid crystal display television Ms. Pac-Man Nintendo GameCube Bubble Bobble Game controller Tag PlayStation 3 Prostate cancer Ra (board game) Blue screen of death Super Mario Bros.
