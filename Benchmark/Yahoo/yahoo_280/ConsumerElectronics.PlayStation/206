ps problem when im on the internet with my ps and want to download files it says ''please insert storage media at save destination'' what the hell is happening and is there anything i can do like connect it to the pc or something please help thank you right now the only way to download those files is to put it on an external usb drive external hdd etc and then copy it from there to your ps there are very few sites that you can directly download files on to your ps this is probably for security reasons but it really doesn't make sense it will probably be changed in a future update the internet browser has gotten more refined and quicker every update so it is only a matter of time Windows XP PlayStation Portable Mozilla Firefox IPod Computer virus Modchip Macromedia Flash USB flash drive ITunes File system Trusted computing PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Digital photography Mozilla Thunderbird Floppy disk History of Microsoft Windows Gmail Steam (content delivery) Digital rights management Streaming media Uploading and downloading Spyware Rootkit Internet Explorer GIF Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Object Desktop Hard disk Kazaa Opera (web browser) GameFAQs Blue screen of death Universal Serial Bus Enterprise content management Mandriva Linux Digital audio player Cascading Style Sheets Virtual memory PNG Domain Name System File Transfer Protocol Download manager Flash memory EMule PlayStation 3 E-mail Knoppix Internet File sharing Web crawler Sharp Zaurus Macintosh Finder Commodore 64 Danger Hiptop Web page Windows Vista IMac AmigaOS Forth programming language Cache TiVo Bluetooth Memory Stick Computer Computer security Skype Freenet Malware America Online USB mass storage device class CPU cache Microsoft Windows Nintendo Revolution Copy protection DVD Emacs Tungsten Handheld Internet fraud Online music store Peer-to-peer World Wide Web Computer forensics MDAC Mozilla Application Suite Common Unix Printing System Novell NetWare Linux Wget MiniDisc Friend-to-friend Windows Me Mouse (computing) Windows Server 2003 Google MAME Creative Zen Ebook
