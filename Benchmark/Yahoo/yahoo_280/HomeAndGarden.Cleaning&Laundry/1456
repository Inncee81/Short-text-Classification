what is the best detergent for washing clothes and why i use liquid tide and it seems to gray things and the colors are dull it sounds like you have hard water there are water softeners you can add to your wash like calgon for instance or borax you can also add cup baking soda to any wash there are some detergents that claim they work well in hard water you can always try one of those i happen to use all free and clear because of my allergies but when i have a hard water problem i sometimes have to wash my whites with c baking soda and c bleach add to your bleach reservoir in your washing machine or follow label directions if you don't have a bleach reservoir i don't recommend using bleach often it will eventually break down the fabric and make it yellow borax also tends to break down fabric so i wouldn't use it too often either i've used all these methods and the bleach and baking soda combination works best where i live everyone's water is different you may find that another of my ideas works best on your particular problem Laundry detergent Dishwasher Textile manufacturing Detergent Vinegar Hydrogen peroxide Sodium percarbonate Sodium Soap Sodium hydroxide Sodium carbonate Bread Menstrual cup Borax Urticaria Plastic Dry cleaning Wood pulp Dishwashing Hard water Phosphorus Glass Carbon dioxide Casting Tooth enamel Boron Glycerin Chlorine Tea Condom Hair coloring Tide Multiple chemical sensitivity Upholstery Tattoo Soap bubble Jute Brewery E-6 process Champagne (beverage) Eczema Weaving Ice cream Cookware and bakeware Lake Laundry Procter & Gamble Bleach Gilding Dairy Ecco the Dolphin Fecal incontinence White bread Leblanc process Flour Linux Hydroponics Sugarcane Coffee Hebburn Cocaine XML Egg (food) Extreme Programming Bulk vending Henkel Experiment Siphon Illegal drug trade Titanium Tooth E number Fuzzy logic Theory of conduct Water Wood Color Wheat Pepper spray Technicolor Coir Sulfuric acid Chocolate Paint Sulfur Mattress Ultramarine Alcoholics Anonymous Textile Felt Potassium hydroxide Reservoir Dogs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diving Textile manufacturing terminology
