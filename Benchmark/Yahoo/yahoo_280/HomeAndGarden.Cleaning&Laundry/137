getting rid of wet carpet smell my roommate used a rug doctor to clean the carpet she is a complete cleaning novice and did it while i was at work she sprayed to much of the cleaning liquid and left us with slightly damp carpet it now smells i have been spraying it with febreeze but it doesn't seem to be helping too much i was planning a dinner for some friends on friday night but it's just embarrassing is there anyway i can at least minimize the smell by then throw some borax on the carpet it will do two things absorb the odor and kill any mold mildew spores that are festering in the damp carpet i would position some large fans to dry the carpet out as well because the padding under the carpet staying wet will inevitably start mold growing leave the borax on there as long as you can and once the carpet is dry vacuum it up it won't damage the fiber or the color either Carpet Upholstery Urinary incontinence Vacuum cleaner Carbon fiber Diseases of the honeybee Fecal incontinence Casting Glass Mushroom hunting Hemp Toxic mold Fire fighting Textile manufacturing Sterilization (microbiology) Mario series enemies Bedbug Cellulose acetate Gilding Air pollution Compost Bong Phoebe Buffay's songs Dry cleaning Thermal power station Comfrey Polyurethane Japanese toilet Mattress Tag Menstrual cup Plastic Motorcycle Hamster Concrete Pottery Fire extinguisher Vermicompost Polyethylene terephthalate Death Valley National Park Wheat Rei Ayanami Diode Magical objects in Harry Potter Bicycle Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Hydrogen peroxide Jute The Young Ones (TV series) Toilet humour Straw-bale construction Swamp cooler Ozone Tofu Garden Strawberry Pok__mon Abilities Haloalkane Coconut crab Ron and Fez Spotted Skunk Jam (TV series) Air conditioning Fiberglass Desert Dial M for Murder Phoebe Halliwell Social rule Coir Vanilla Printed circuit board Plaster Electrostatic precipitator Home repair Genericized trademark Basement Xanadu House Common cold Hat Irrigation The Suffering (game) Jackass: The Movie Boron Ultimate Spider-Man Brewery Instant coffee Moss Psoriasis 2004 World Series Glossary of firefighting equipment Toilet paper Cat Vacuum tube Vacuum Anthrax Seismic retrofit Sugar Roomba Strategic bombing Cigar
