does the fabric conditioner enter the machine on the rinse cycle my machine's been taking it before the rinse cycle and my clothes are hard so i've had to do a main wash and let it run thru until the spin and then i restart it on rinse with the fabric cond and then spin it's an old machine but we're renting yeah i've been putting it in the right compartment but it's taking the conditioner too early during the wash stage so i now have to let the wash go all the way thru and then when it's stopped i add the condition to the right part and then put it on rinse and spin unfortunately our landlords told us when we moved in that we would have to buy a new machine and take it with us when we move because they don't want to pay for repairs or replacement it's in our contract so we might end up buying a new one but it works for now because i know how it operates lol if you use a downy ball you won't have to run back to the washer to catch the rinse cycle you put the downy ball containing fabric softener in at the beginning of the wash cycle and when the first spin cycle stops the action releases the fabric softener from the downy ball so it dispensed just in time for the rinse cycle so simple the downy balls cost about or less than Textile manufacturing Dishwasher Dry cleaning Fast bowling Procter & Gamble CPU design RISC Electrophysiology Laws of cricket Digital circuit Volleyball Laundry detergent Fossil fuel power plant Dairy Aerial (dance move) Tag Football (soccer) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Rugby union Soap Upholstery Wheel of Fortune Laundry Embedded system Pinball Tire CPU cache Sento Thermal power station IPod Four square Lathe Types of bowlers in cricket Glossary of American football Detergent Cray-1 Billiards Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Hybrid vehicle Hard water Winning Streak Fabrication (metal) English cricket team Tenshinhan Skateboarding trick Battle of Plattsburgh Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sewing machine Classic RISC pipeline The Price Is Right Charles O.
