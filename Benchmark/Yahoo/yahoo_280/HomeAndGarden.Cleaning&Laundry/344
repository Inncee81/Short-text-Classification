can you remove a week old soda stain it's a white carpet and my favorite drink coca cola vanilla is this permanent and if so can you not let my roomates know about this hello the previous poster had great ideas i am going to add a great product that i've used repeatedly over the years for removing stains in carpets such as motor oil and wine and these stains were on wool carpets that were very light in color it's called spot shot i've tried two of their carpet cleaners the one in the blue silver and orange spray can seems to work the best they make another one which has a orange and yellow bottle which did not seem to work as well as their regular version in my humble opinion i've heard though cannot say for sure personally that resolve'' sets stains spot shot has saved me more times than i can say do not over saturate the area with the product follow the directions on the can and it should work for you it may at least really lighten the area i've found it's best to avoid that area of the carpet after cleaning till it's totally dry otherwise you'll be adding more dirt to the area yes i've done that before too and ended up starting over again good luck priscilla o'kelly wilkinson pdra cwc sanctuary design portland maine http www myspace com sanctuarydesignportland Carpet Upholstery Tag Coca-Cola Diet soda Laundry detergent Bong The Coca-Cola Company Vinegar Wine Fanta Logo Mattress Basement Plastic Paint Champagne (beverage) Wok Chocolate Color theory St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque) Staining (biology) Port wine Textile manufacturing Quake III Arena Mario series enemies Cocaine Diet Coke Dr Pepper In-N-Out Burger Billiards Weaving Bedbug Roomba Mountain Dew Tooth Hydrogen peroxide Indianapolis 500 Lionel Corporation Meriones unguiculatus World Wide Web Kosher foods Coffee 7 Up Textile manufacturing terminology Soldering Dodge Charger The Young Ones (TV series) Color Veganism Mid-levels Drill bit Glass Carbonated water Rose Genericized trademark Bubble Bobble Oreo Dry cleaning Illegal drug trade New Coke Heinkel He 100 Snooker Moonshine OK Soda Wool Stained glass Drag racing Reservoir Dogs Fluorescent lamp Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.
