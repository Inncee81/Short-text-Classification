what is the best way to remove a red wine stain from a light color carpet so far i have tried blotting with white wine sprinkle with salt a household carpet stain remover some of the stain has gone but it's still very noticeable why don't you try a professional cleaner to come in costs about to do an average size room if that don't get rid of it then replace your carpet i suggest you buy the new polypropolane carpets made out of recycled plastic bottles its fantastic i have just had it put all over my house because i have two small children and you know what the carpet is cream and no matter what you spill on it it never stains honestly you can even pour bleach on it and nothing will happen to it trust me i have removed a few stains since it has been down and it's just as thick and plush as any other carpet out there no compromise for quality Upholstery Champagne (beverage) Plastic Mattress Coffee Laundry detergent Glass Vacuum cleaner Port wine Wine Vinegar Sodium hypochlorite Basement Cuisine of Denmark Wine making Bong Water purification Carbonated water Drill bit Dairy Photographic film Bottle Tooth enamel Radon Casting Lycopene Bread Rum Textile manufacturing terminology Shoe Leather Port-wine stain Bleach Photography Stained glass Sulfur Sushi Hamster Bedbug Christmas tree Kitchen Violin The Adventure of the Second Stain Tea Sea-Monkey Melanin Staining (biology) Cocoa Ammonia Dishwashing Polyethylene terephthalate Gram staining Cork (material) Xanadu House Malignant melanoma Maple syrup Wool Soy sauce Agarose gel electrophoresis Nalgene Hemp Cider Muslim ibn Aqeel Technicolor St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque) Ethidium bromide Bulk vending Visual cortex German wine Alcoholic beverage Sewage treatment Tofu Monopoly (game) Lapis lazuli Wine bottle Bromine Textile Typewriter Birthmark Compact fluorescent lamp Cruising (maritime) Liam Gallagher Lionel Corporation My Little Pony Recycling of PET Bottles Roomba The Shining (film) Pancake Recycling Ketchup Tag Menstrual cup Big Brother UK series 6 M16 (rifle) Ice cream Campfire
