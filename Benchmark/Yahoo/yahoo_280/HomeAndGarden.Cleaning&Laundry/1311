how can i get melted crayons out of my car seats stain my little sister left crayons in my car and it melted all over the seats how can i get out the stain i'm still thinking about this one too my kids did the same thing i'm thinking of trying dissolve it or goo gone both are supposed to remove crayon i've had good success with the dissolve it on walls but have never tried it on the velour fabric my deats are gray so chances of discoloration from the chemical are less than if the seats were a dark color another possibility is to take paper towels or the brown paper bags and a hot iron lay the paper over the crayon and iron until hot the heat melts the crayon and the paper absorbs the wax use new sections of the paper or new paper until no more wax is absorbed by the paper the only problem may be that the color from the crayon will be left in the fabric and the heat will set the color i haven't tried the iron because the crayon i have on my seats is red and blue lastly you might scrape off what you can and then use the dissolve it or one of the waterless hand cleaners to remove more the waterless hand cleaners are designed to break down oils so they might work i would test any chemical in an inconspicuous spot before using on the seat Casting Plastic Crayola Staining (biology) Opportunity rover Sulfuric acid Shroud of Turin Fire fighting Sulfur Upholstery Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Turquoise Manicure Glass Motor oil Bong Steel Gilding Batik Drawing Iron Pebble bed reactor Soldering Welding Coffee Ski wax Oxygen Paint Metallurgy Tooth enamel Charles Goodyear Airbag Mushroom hunting Pysanka Tattoo Silicon Laser hair removal Technetium Wok Towel Paper towel Agar plate Drill bit Aluminium Textile manufacturing terminology Carbon MS-06 Zaku II Solar power Carbon dioxide Drag racing Powder metallurgy Explosive material Dodge Charger Aes Sedai Osmium Dry cleaning Fossil fuel power plant Charcoal Chromium Toilet paper Incandescent light bulb Fire Wood Weaving Bacon Cast iron Lighting Copper Cold fusion Thermal power station Fire extinguisher M&M's Prussian blue Magnesium Leather Water Sodium Cocaine Hydrochloric acid Iron(III) chloride Sewage treatment Printmaking Pottery Mattress Dice Acetic acid Billboard Hot 100 Cross-country skiing Plutonium Nuclear fission Diseases of the honeybee Palladium Color Beryllium Zinc Color blindness Fusion power
