my micro fiber couches are looking terrible how do i clean them there are a few places one my couches where my one year old daughter has rubbed her cookies and then places where she will put her mouth and it leaves a ring on them i have tried to use the resolve cleaner and i think it made it worst i have tried to rub it out with water and it will take the cookie or what not away but it leaves like a water mark ring it is driving me crazy to look at them so any advise would be so great thanks any and every website that offers info on cleaning microfiber says the same thing use a clean white towel and water they also frequently mention using denatured alcohol mixed with water especially for ink coffee etc in my experience cleaning houses the trick is to get a fairly stiff scrub brush after the water used to clean is dry use the scrub brush in circles on the area it usually removes the remaining water marks as for the cookie stains i would make a dilute mix of mild dishsoap and water and go at the stains with that scrub brush then dab at it with the towel and plain water and repeat as above take care not to use much soap or it will be hard to get out with a little one if you haven't already i'd look into scotchguarding good luck Upholstery Manicure Sento Hand washing Customs and etiquette of Japan Bong Gilding Cast iron Tattoo Ethanol Mattress Violin Dishwashing Menstrual cup Dialysis Soap Microfiber Soldering Brewery Vinegar Brush Wood Vacuum cleaner Sauna Towel Washing machine Paint Fecal incontinence Hamster Tooth Hydrogen peroxide Body piercing Glycerin 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shoe polish Genericized trademark Dry cleaning Car washing techniques Wound Lionel Corporation Wok Japanese toilet Weaving Hyperthermia Textile manufacturing Halitosis Hashish First aid Chocolate Pottery Flour Staining (biology) Sharon Tate Laundry Hat The Shining (film) Woodworking American and British English differences Cookie Sulfuric acid Oral hygiene Sodium hypochlorite Professional wrestling slang Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tea Laundry detergent Shaggy dog story Scarification Neopets Acne Diving suit Joseph of Arimathea The Legend of Zelda series races Soy protein Inkjet printer Brazing Knife Car wash Gay bathhouse Tooth enamel Paper Strap-on dildo Coffee The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Printmaking Japanese tea ceremony Canary Yarrow Alcoholic beverage Drill bit Drag racing Breastfeeding Justification (theology) Isopropyl alcohol Leaf Plastic Poodle Typewriter American Psycho Common cold
