dyson vacuume question i have bene looking at the dyson vacummes for pet hair was wondering if anyone knew what the difference between these models are dc animal dc animal dc animal dc animal has anyone used any of these is the dc better than the rest of the models or do they all prety much do the same job thanks for any input the short answer is it depends on what you are looking for all of the animal vacuums are purple in color and come with a year warranty a carpet cleaning kit a mini turbine head and a low reach floor tool the dc animal has root cyclone technology a reversible wand and the standard airflow tools the airwatts suction power for a dc is airwatts the weight is lbs the motor wattage how much electricity the vacuum uses is amps the bin capacity is gallon the cord length is ft and the maximum reach is ft the dc also has root cyclone technology but has a quick draw telescope reach a wide large debris channel and the standard airflow tools the airwatts for a dc is airwatts the weight is lbs the motor wattage is amps the bin capacity is gallons the cord length is ft and the maximum reach is ft the dc is the identical twin of the dc with one exception instead of wheels at the rear of the machine the machine is maneuverable via a large ball with rubber treads on it the ball technology on the dc allows you to maneuver the vacuum easily around furniture near corners and tight spots you are able to control the direction of the machine with little to no effort the airwatts for a dc is airwatts the weight is lbs the motor wattage is amps the bin capacity is gallons the cord length is ft and the maximum reach is ft the dc also has level root cyclone technology which is more efficient than the root cyclone technology the dc has a quick draw telescope reach a belt driven motorized brush bar direct drive and the standard airflow tools the airwatts for a dc is airwatts the weight is lbs the motor wattage is amps the bin capacity is gallons the cord length is ft and the maximum reach is ft the dc is black with purple and steel grey accents they all do pretty much the same job but i would select either the dc or dc as the best value for your money Dodge Neon Electric motor Jet engine Dyson (appliances) Car handling TGV IPod Motorcycle Carburetor Fuel injection Dairy Combine harvester Phonograph Elevator Radio controlled airplane Solar power Radio controlled car Lawn mower Hard disk Mercedes-Benz A-Class Mouse (computing) Porsche 911 Helicopter Rail terminology Fan (implement) Thermal power station Floppy disk Bicycle lighting Bass guitar Fossil fuel power plant De Lorean DMC-12 Lincoln LS Incandescent light bulb Tire Computer DVD Stairway Toyota Prius Bong Dassault Mirage III Manifold vacuum Automobile Universal Serial Bus Internal ballistics Transistor Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Wind turbine Lighting Tropical cyclone Bicycle Collapse of the World Trade Center Volkswagen Golf Airsoft Internal combustion engine Steam engine T-64 Tank Combine (Half-Life 2) Mitsubishi 3000GT Equine conformation Vickers Valiant Hybrid vehicle Diode Wayne Corporation Mountain bike P-61 Black Widow Operational amplifier M16 (rifle) Fixed-wing aircraft Battery electric vehicle Stryker Items in the Metroid series Drill bit Laser engraving NASCAR E85 Vacuum Hydrogen economy M60 machine gun Glossary of firefighting equipment Billiards Mooney M20 Biodiesel Dodge Charger Textile manufacturing GunBound Normal distribution Energy development Water turbine Sport utility vehicle Upholstery Solar cell History of perpetual motion machines
