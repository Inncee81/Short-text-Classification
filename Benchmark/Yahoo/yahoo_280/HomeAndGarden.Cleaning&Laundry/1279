is it normal to do laundry every other day we're a family of and it can be very depressing i've a family of we do it twice a week midweek for clothes and weekend for linens and clothes you might want to use your towels for more than one day if you hang them up promptly and let them dry you can get up to a week out of them same with bed linens it is actually depressing to do laundry so many times and not efficient because you're not doing full loads but you're taking all of the time energy with a half washer and half dryer load another trick i'll bet there are people in your family who put perfectly clean clothes in the hamper because they decided not to wear it and it was easier to put in the hamper than fold back up hey i've got kids i know what i'm talking about what i did for weeks was keep track of what they wore and then put the non dirty stuff back in their drawer without washing it it was a bit rank from being in with the clean clothes and they were warned that mom wouldn't wash clean clothes twice whether they were in the hamper or not Washing machine Textile manufacturing Diaper Upholstery Laundry Hey Jude Social rule Hemp Sento Linen Laundromat Textile manufacturing terminology Menstrual cup Japanese tea ceremony Dry cleaning Mattress Characters in the Smurfs South Park Bedbug Washboard Clothing About a Boy Menstrual cycle Urticaria Tattoo The Family from One End Street Sewage treatment Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Empire Burlesque Hey Arnold!
