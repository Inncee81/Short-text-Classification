what is the best way when washing towells to keep them soft i find my towells seem to lose their softness after a few washes even though i use a fabric softener fabric softener may make for soft towels but they lose a huge amont of their absorbency adding fabric softner to the wash cycle or in the dryer is like waxing your towels also too many washer 'rinse' cycles don't adequately rinse towels try putting a few freshly washed towels back into the washer add water and agitate the load for a minute or two likely you'll find a fair amount of detergent foam on the water's surface try washing your towels by putting them through a normal wash cycle w laundry detergent then after the load is allegedly lol done reset the washer to put 'em through a second full cycle without detergent and no fabric softener instead add cups of white vinegar to the first wash cycle after the load is done dry your towels without adding a fabric softener sheet they'll be fluffy and absorbent and really clean washed like this your towels will last longer smell better and do a much better job of both absorbing water and drying on the towel rack than when normally washed hope this helps tx griff Laundry detergent Dishwasher Upholstery Dry cleaning Textile manufacturing Detergent Manicure Car washing techniques Menstrual cup Mattress Casting Soap Sento Laundry Vinegar Diaper Procter & Gamble Plastic Sauna Urticaria Hard water Hand washing Menstrual cycle Wok Motor oil Citric acid Dairy Sewage treatment Hat Carbon dioxide Western blot Seismic retrofit Hydrogen peroxide Thermal power station Japanese toilet Sodium hydroxide Fecal incontinence Rice Textile manufacturing terminology Fossil fuel power plant Tofu Cheese Weaving Sodium hypochlorite Soap bubble RISC Toilet Eczema Dialysis Water Tide Industrial wastewater treatment Laundromat Halitosis Batik Glass Electrophysiology Coffee CPU design Paper towel Sanitary towel Water purification Mouth ulcer Sodium carbonate Tattoo Phosphorus Internal ballistics Sushi Massage Diving suit Gilding Instant coffee Solar cell Textile Feet washing Vulvovaginal health Shaving Ironing Polyethylene terephthalate Glossary of firefighting equipment Yerba mate Contact lens Strap-on dildo Steel Climbing equipment Disc brake Psoriasis Fluoride therapy Cast iron Top-bar hive Sulfur
