am i being a paranoid idiot or not my parents like to buy a lot of used clothes and i don't i think its nasty to buy them but my parents are like they wont hurt you when they find something they want and its used they could care less the problem is they wash them in our washing machine which is the same one that i also use to put my underwear towels and washcloths in i dont like the idea of putting my personal garments in there where they put their used clothes i am afraid of catching some serious std or something they never seem to think of this but i do what are your opinions am i right or am i just being a paranoid idiot this is odd but in our culture not unheard of by any means 'clean' is an illusion for example our bodies create dead skin our beds are filled with microscopic creatures that live of this skin if the clothes have been washed then they are as sterile as anything else in the house i wear second hand clothes myself there is virtually no disease known to man that will withstand soap and water it sound odd but that's why we use soap to kill bacteria rest assured your health is not at risk merely by sharing a washing machine as for the 'idiot' part of the question it wouldn't hurt for you to read up on some fun facts regarding household germs it might put things in perspective the dishrag sitting in your sink is times more lethal than any clothes that your parents have washed in that machine your toilet water probably has less bacteria than a drinking fountain at school and the list goes on Japanese toilet Fecal incontinence Menstrual cup Hygiene Sexually-transmitted infection Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Escherichia coli O157:H7 Diaper Undergarment Social rule Sauna Changeroom Transmission (medicine) Gay bathhouse Hand washing Body piercing Clothing Textile manufacturing Swimming Toilet Dairy Dialysis Common cold Hard water Tuberculosis Washroom Pneumonia Customs and etiquette of Japan Medicine Upholstery Swimming pool Diving Washing machine Bacteria Japanese tea ceremony Nocturnal emission About a Boy 613 mitzvot Bidet Theory of conduct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Soul Soap Calvin and Hobbes Acne Feet washing Montgomery Burns Urinary incontinence Jackass: The Movie Medical analysis of circumcision Foodborne illness Tooth enamel Psoriasis Vampire Macbeth Laundry Baptism Jock itch Human sexual behavior Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion debate Certified Nursing Assistant Shaggy dog story Cleanser Fugu Characters in the Smurfs Bleeding Futurama (TV series - season 2) Scabies Agar plate Cruising (maritime) Professional wrestling match types Immortality Dry cleaning Ayyavazhi mythology Fountain Eczema Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Milton H.
