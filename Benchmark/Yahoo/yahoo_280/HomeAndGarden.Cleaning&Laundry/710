glue marks on canvas pumps anyway to remove it this can be tough so i would suggest getting some tweezers and pulling off any loose pieces and then trying a paste made of white vinegar and baking soda the porous baking soda will act as an exfoliant and the vinegar will hopefully break down the glue with its acidity the only thing is that there may be a stain left on the canvas even after you get the glue off if they were inexpensive and you can buy another pair without breaking the bank then just get rid of them hope this helps Vinegar Bread Acetic acid Sodium hydroxide Carbon dioxide Glass Carboxylic acid Ramen Upholstery Toffee Dairy Fish and chips Mouth ulcer Cello Baking powder Poker jargon Cocaine Plastic Weathering Barbecue Bulk vending Tire Harp World War Three (Doctor Who) Flour Psoriasis Carbonated water Professional wrestling slang Solvent Printed circuit board Soul food Menstrual cup Textile manufacturing Acne Alum Chocolate Laundry detergent Cookware and bakeware Cleopatra VII of Egypt Guitar Potato Bicycle frame Toilet humour Brewery Casting Piccolo Junior Saga Ceramics Full line vending Knife Surrealist techniques Nail (anatomy) Textile manufacturing terminology Hydrochloric acid Kodocha Cuisine of Denmark Bacteria Babe Ruth The Last Supper (Leonardo) Passover Illegal drug trade Biscuit Nasal irrigation Cocoa Canvas Internal ballistics Tooth Hydrogen peroxide Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Pickling Coca-Cola Manifold Hydroponics Tooth enamel Sodium acetate Cheese Wood Sodium Pottery Collage Kayak Monosodium glutamate Sugar substitute French fries Bokken Food additive Great Teacher Onizuka Spidey Super Stories Bong Fermentation Soda lime Jewish cuisine Conker Tea Hair conditioner Sushi Skunk Sulfuric acid Charcoal Water purification Conker's Bad Fur Day
