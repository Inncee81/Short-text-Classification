help how do i remove red candle wax from linoleum uh oh that's not good i'm thinking you've probably already tried the obvious scraping and melting techniques if you have a real deep stain and you're desperate to get it removed and out of sight maybe you could try a steel wool pad or brillo because if you've already removed the surface wax and you can still see the red you might have to scrape away at the actual linoleum to make it go away all this depends on how big the stain and where it is located middle of floor edge of room corner etc and whether this floor is attached to a place you own or rent for instance if you are owner wal mart has some really cute rugs good luck Casting Mattress Carpet Knife Seismic retrofit Glass Drill bit Brillo Pad Wok Top-bar hive Weaving Surrealist techniques Wax Printed circuit board Tire Cross-country skiing Christmas tree Upholstery Shroud of Turin Soldering Dice Wallpaper group Valles Marineris Funeral of Pope John Paul II Textile manufacturing terminology Wood finishing Ski Plastic Paint Oceanic trench Textile manufacturing Wax play Pysanka Staines Woodworking Dundas Square Glossary of climbing terms Professional wrestling match types Iron Linoleum Dye Gilding Histology Katana Mnemonic Steel Disc brake Palace of Westminster Staining (biology) Clarinet Welding Lighting Beeswax Alkane Stainless steel Livestock Oil platform Seal (device) Care Bears The Adventures of Pete & Pete Candle Fast bowling Out of Gas Gramophone record Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Japanese tea ceremony Western concert flute Cultural Revolution Maxilla Diamond enhancement Sword making Prostitution in Germany Motor oil Pittsburgh Steelers Trademark Charles Goodyear Ski wax Tuberculosis Sand casting John Hancock Tower Leather Property (ownership right) Wood carving Rent (musical) Linen Chatsworth House Law of value Dance Dance Revolution Bloodstain pattern analysis Repouss__ and chasing Tattoo Abstraction Brazing Magical objects in Harry Potter Property tax Ultraviolet Out-of-body experience Naval mine Shaggy dog story Petroleum
