how do i get my shoes to stop smelling so bad a few weeks ago i bought some black leathery k swiss shoes and a few days ago they started smelling like a cat peed in them i dont have a cat so im not sure why it smells like that ive tried all kinds of things to get the smell out ive constantly sprayed them with febreeze and that just made it smell like flowers and cat piss ive put pet oder remover powder in them and that didnt help ive filled up some panty hose with kitty litter and stuffed that in them and it isnt really helping i really need to know how to get the smell out and i dont want to buy new shoes start with your feet most people don't realize that it is the bacteria from sweat on your feet that cause the odor so wash your feet with deoderant soap in the shower use either a spray or powder deoderant on your feet and in your shoes wear socks and try to choose all natural fiber like cotton or the specialty manmade fibers that wick away moisture from sweat try to purchase footwear that is real leather not synthetic manmade material because leather breathes and doesn't trap the odor as much as manmade material does now that your new shoes stink here is how to rid the shoes of that odor and you have several choices simplest buy a pair of odor eater shoe inserts works sometimes but takes time and sometimes changes the fit of the shoe because they take up space fill shoes with baking soda activated charcoal or talc powder when not in use this also works and a little faster but you have to empty them out and refill with regularity until the odor disappears it isn't a one time wonder because it took time for the shoes to smell and it now will take time to remove it lysol antibacterial spray for fabrics is about the fastest way to remove offensive odors and won't ruin the shoes nor the insoles spray the insides almost to the saturation point and let dry or if you need them in a hurry hit it with a blow dryer Shoe Sock Foot odor Skunk Plastic Mattress Toilet humour Textile manufacturing Fecal incontinence Menstrual cycle Bong Upholstery Genericized trademark High-heeled shoe Cheese Leather Tofu Clothing Carbon dioxide Tire Urinary incontinence Ren and Stimpy Undergarment Cat Irish dance Polyethylene terephthalate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dry cleaning Sin City Odor Climbing equipment Pet skunk Textile manufacturing terminology Dairy Durian Jute Glossary of wildland fire terms Cannabis cultivation Diving suit Sauna Holes (book) Stocking Garfield Japanese tea ceremony Casting Shoe fetishism Land mine Bread Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape quests Sulfur Shaggy dog story Diseases of the honeybee Internal ballistics Phoebe Buffay's songs Footwear Glossary of firefighting equipment Pepper spray Hamster Vermicompost Discworld gods Bulk vending Deodorant Poker jargon Sonic the Hedgehog Chemical warfare Cocoa Homer Simpson Flatulence Social rule Foot Hemp Volleyball Strap-on dildo 1957 World Series Bubble Bobble Spotted Skunk Acetic acid Drag racing Eric Cartman Combine (Half-Life 2) Basic English Burial Dietary fiber Hydrogen sulfide Shotgun Soy protein Rebreather Compost Concrete Fire extinguisher Ranma __ characters Sento Ed, Edd n Eddy Badminton Blood (computer game)
