how do i get mold off my wood furniture i just found a great pair of antique kitchen chairs in storage they are wood with a light finish and will be really nice once i clean them up a bit they do not need to be refinished problem one of the chairs has some mold on it it's not bad just a few patches on the legs but i don't know how to get it off i'm afraid to use bleach which might damage the original old finish vinegar maybe will that do anything thanks in advance for your help a paste of borax and water will kill the spores and won't damage either the wood nor the finish Vinegar Casting Kitchen Chair Plastic Upholstery Furniture Hydrogen peroxide Polyurethane Drill bit Woodworking Disinfection Hamster Ozone Borax Tire Norway national football team Air pollution Plaster Strap-on dildo Spider Home repair Brewery Tutankhamun Screw Wood Natural Selection (computer game) Ham Professional wrestling slang Coral reef Tiger Woods Myxobolus cerebralis Gilding Shellac Toxic mold Diving Bullet Dairy Foodborne illness Menstrual cup Cuisine of Denmark Plywood Textile manufacturing Wheat Rachel Whiteread Spore (game) Fecal incontinence Diseases of the honeybee Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tattoo Eddie Guerrero Alien vs. Predator (film) Brush Slime mould Dinghy Food preservation Buffer overflow Renewable energy Acetic acid Paper Molding (decorative) Sodium hypochlorite Dishwasher Age of Empires Zerg Green Party candidates, 2004 Canadian federal election Boron Wood carving Computer virus Bleach (manga) Michael Thonet Door Acorn Water purification Sodium perborate Architecture of the California missions Max Payne Rise of Nations Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Wario Moss The Amazing Race Joker (comics) Poker jargon Harness racing Sushi Dishwashing Michael Jackson Citric acid Mission San Juan Capistrano Stove Blood Simple Breath of Fire III Bedbug Rayman Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Compact disc M16 (rifle) Sodium borohydride
