cleaned kitchen counters with comet left it too long now looks yellow ok so im a bit retarded my kitchen has cheap off white counter tops and i put comet over them added a little water to make it paste like and was going to leave it for a few minutes and completely forgot about it til the next morning i cleaned it off and the counters look a little yellow now its not really really bad but its kind of annoying does anyone know how to make it back to normal i didnt scratch it and its not bad enough to need them to be replaced if you didnt see them before you wouldnt think anything is wrong with them ive cleaned it now with regular cleaner thanks and it looks a bit better so im hoping that between that and a couple days it will be better i would carefully pour bleach onto the counter let it set for a couple of seconds and then clean up with a damp cloth not sponge do not rinse just wipe up and rinse the cloth out a couple of times but don't put water on the counter do this every day once a day it should speed up the process of getting your counter back to normal i use bleach on a cloth at least times a week to keep my counters clean and sanitary Menstrual cup Textile manufacturing Dishwashing Car washing techniques Bread Pump It Up Billiards Social rule Dry cleaning Hydrogen peroxide Brewery Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Dishwasher Wok Menstrual cycle Quotation mark Dairy Domestic water system Bubble Bobble Sento Halitosis Page replacement algorithms Gameplay of StarCraft Contact lens Soap Deep Impact (space mission) Mouth ulcer Upholstery Kitchen Hemp Vinegar Hamster Oscilloscope Blood (computer game) Washing machine Snooker Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sinclair ZX81 Strap-on dildo Niddah Sodium hypochlorite First aid New York Giants Flag of India Printmaking Beatmania IIDX Kosher foods AMD 613 mitzvot Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Vacuum cleaner Futurama (TV series - season 5) Counter-Strike Rebreather Japanese tea ceremony Tattoo Theory of conduct Urticaria Armored Core The Family from One End Street Jennifer Lopez Mattress STS-51-L World War Three (Doctor Who) Major League Baseball television contracts MTV2 Chinese tea culture Laundry detergent The Amazing Race Traffic light Computer virus EIA-708 Hey Jude Changeroom Casting Toyota Prius Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Justification (theology) CPU cache Team Fortress Classic Psychiatric hospital TGV Hatake Kakashi Swingout Gramophone record Cleveland Browns Pok__mon types Counter Amateur telescope making 2000 Australian Grand Prix Detergent Wario Netfilter/iptables Weaving Wood pulp Seismometer Weight training Diving suit
