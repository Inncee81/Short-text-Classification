is it ok to wash my dry clean only comforter i have the same question i did a search on yahoo answers and online there seems to be a lot of disagreement is it expensive have sentimental value or not easily replaced if you said yes then maybe you should dry clean it if not some people have safely washed their dry clean only comforters a woman who said she used to work testing appliances said use a high setting because the water evaporating cools the dryer but cautioned not to overdry and cautioned that if you do not dry it properly and throughly you can get a musty smell and clumping another caution is if the comforter is polyester because it melts at medium and high heats some people say you can use the gentle cycle cold water and line dry lay it flat to dry i do this with the few dry clean only clothes and curtains i have and it works fine but a comforter is much thicker and would seem to pose a problem drying and what about the stitches it is too large to go in a lingerie bag and then into the washer but do not line dry it if the area you live in is humid some people say you can put it in the dryer too but that you need to use a low setting note laundry mat commercial dryers are often more powerful home dry cleaning kit makers say not to use them it seems a home setting of low is not equal to a laundrymat commercial one or the kit makers just do not want the liability i am concerned it would cause shrinking especially given my comforter seems to have a dry clean only fabric on the top the pretty part one would see looking at the bed and a washable fabric on the bottom part that faces the matress some say they have successfully used home dry cleaning kits i have read up on that before when i was trying to find a solution to the dry clean only comforter you have to use the bag they come with which is not large enough for queen and king size comforters they say you must use the bag for it to work and caution against just placing the clothes in the dryer they say do not use their kits as a replacement for dry cleaning they are to be used to freshen your clothes maybe the comforter manufacturers do not want the liability so they say dry clean only that way if you mess it up when you wash it then you pay the bill instead of them i thought of this but then was reading and a poster said they read about this before see Mattress Washing machine Dry cleaning Air conditioning Autonomous building Sento Textile manufacturing Coffee Dairy Laundry Strap-on dildo Menstrual cup Toilet Brewery Nuclear power Asbestos Sauna Plastic Japanese tea ceremony Soap Jute Water Hydrogen peroxide Japanese toilet Dishwasher Diving suit Welding Bong Social rule Kitchen Hamster Condom Fiberglass Opportunity rover Cruising (maritime) Instant coffee Hard disk Genericized trademark Carbon dioxide Thermal power station Diaper Cannabis cultivation Drill bit Corset Drainage Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Ironing Gas metal arc welding Hot air balloon Fossil fuel power plant Solar power Motor oil Illegal drug trade Changeroom Climate of the United Kingdom Carburetor Top-bar hive Basement Toyota Prius Seismic retrofit Glass Ocean thermal energy conversion Bedbug Bicycle Electric motor Swamp cooler Fire extinguisher Dialysis Violin Undergarment Paint Incandescent light bulb Explosive material Avalanche Irrigation IPod Nuclear reactor Car washing techniques CPU design Energy development Kimono Sewage treatment Transformer DVD Professional wrestling match types Home repair Microeconomics Alcohol fuel Collecting fossils Chocolate
