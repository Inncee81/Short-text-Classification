carpet stains we just recently moved into a house and the carpet is stained really bad and i'm not sure with what and i'm not sure what else i can do about it i already tryed oxy carpet cleaner backing soda and wool carpet cleaner replacing the carpet is not an option since we are renting and the agency told us it was steam cleaned before we moved in any advice i think some might be paint stains but like i said i don't know what they are they are mostly red and pink and i got one that is brown almost looks like a rust color thanks i clean carpets and houses for a living and i can tell you if they have already steamed cleaned the carpets then there is nothing you can do the carpet is stained beyond cleaning if you purchased the house then you could rip it up your renting so its the landlords problem not yours make sure you take pics or video of the carpet and the house so when you leave you wont be stuck with a new carpet replacement bill my best advice would be to buy throw rugs and cover the stains Mario series enemies Mattress Roomba Tag Staining (biology) Plastic Hat Vacuum cleaner Wool The Young Ones (TV series) Home repair Textile manufacturing terminology Upholstery The Adventure of the Second Stain Billiards Chatsworth House Wound Chair Monopoly (game) Berkshire Hathaway Lionel Corporation Bong Aladdin (1992 film) Bulk vending Lahore Persian rug Stained glass Ankara Laundry detergent Animal Crossing Table saw Vinegar Union Pacific Railroad Emerson College Hydrogen peroxide Public housing Contact lens Surveillance Weaving Reservoir Dogs Paint IPod Apartment Advertising Oakland Raiders Renting Magical objects in Harry Potter Swindon Palace of Westminster Phil Collins Wok Oasis (band) Drill bit Textile Diamond Bus models used in New York City Transit The Human Stain Rose Kirby Cleanliness The Shining (film) Thrash metal The Amazing Race The Sonics Mario Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Housing cooperative The Hoover Company Christmas tree Carburetor Dial M for Murder Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
