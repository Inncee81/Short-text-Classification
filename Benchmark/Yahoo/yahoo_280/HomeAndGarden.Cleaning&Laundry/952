burning wire smell i have recently had my washer act up it has been having the water let out on the floor we have used it reguardless because we cant afford to go to a laundry mat today after i started a load i smelt a burning wire smell i am very sure it is from the washer i unpluged it and all but i still smell it what do i do and no mean comments please or you will be reported i can understand not being able to afford things been there myself but i am afraid you are going to have to get a repair man in to look at it don't use it until then because you can make it more expensive to repair by burning up the motor or you can see if goodwill or the salvation army has one to replace it call around the burning wire smell will take a long time to go away even though you unplugged it no one can tell you how to fix it from here good luck Cruising (maritime) Washing machine Welding Mattress Spark plug Trademark Tank Ester Electric motor Social rule Seismic retrofit Japanese tea ceremony Hydrogen peroxide Elevator Smelt Pebble bed reactor Laundry Shit Bicycle Bolted joint Chainmail Home repair Ammunition Professional wrestling match types Toronto Subway and RT Knife Electrical generator Climbing equipment IPod Fuel injection Sydney Riot of 1879 Sulfur Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Shakira Radio controlled airplane Switch 21 July 2005 London bombings Plumbing fixture Clinker (boat building) Vostok 1 Naval mine Autonomous building Sodium hypochlorite Ethernet Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Arc welding Cable television Aluminium 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Laundromat Bryan Adams Trench warfare Mutual fund Rigging Atomism Oh Mercy E85 Trent Reznor Ozone Tire Traumatic incident reduction Kitchen Nirvana (band) 10,000 Maniacs Toyota Prius Oscilloscope Wonderland (McFly album) Suspension bridge Microeconomics Glossary of climbing terms Wire wrap Submarine Ammonia Justification (theology) Nicky Wire Predestination Oxygen sensor Rammstein Model aircraft Clothing USS West Virginia (BB-48) Mashina Vremeni Eric Clapton Cliff Richard Red Dwarf characters RuneScape skills Firefighter Hydrogen vehicle Bicycle lighting AFI 100 Years series Extreme Programming Ford Mustang Wealth Modchip Hydraulic machinery Ferry Corsten Arcade cabinet Emergency preparedness Laundry detergent Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)
