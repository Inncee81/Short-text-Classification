is it possible to remove screen printing from fabric a while back i had some hockey jerseys customized at a local hockey shop they did great work on the customization and it looks great all except for the fact that they also added a large screen print of the shop logo on the bottom hem of the jerseys i was soooo pissed but for some reason i didn't do anything about it at the time i figured as time passed it wouldn't bother me but now it bugs me more than ever i'd like to remove the screen printing but i don't want to risk ruining the jersey is there anything that i can do to remedy this situation thanks in advance for any help o i don't think there is but i have a couple shirts that have screen printing on them and when i wash them i wash them inside out so that the screen printing doesn't come off i would try washing them a couple times the right side out in warm water good luck Sento Textile manufacturing Poker jargon Upholstery Sega Saturn Eaton's Dry cleaning New Jersey Devils Atari 8-bit family Menstrual cup Los Angeles Kings Textile manufacturing terminology Piccolo Junior Saga Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Euphemism Extreme Programming Electrophysiology Ra (board game) Nuclear power Customs and etiquette of Japan Screen-printing Movie projector Surveillance Animal Crossing You Don't Know Jack Star Wars: Galaxies Solar cell Port Coquitlam, British Columbia Copy protection Brassiere System/36 Filling station Bonus Stage Dundas Square Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Blonde on Blonde Prostate cancer Playoff Windows XP Dairy Hard disk Singlish Sydney Riot of 1879 Ice hockey Gaia Online Trademark Drug test Printed circuit board Atari ST Friends Japanese toilet Tefillin Printmaking Cascading Style Sheets PostScript Blue screen of death Sinclair ZX81 Debugging Clothing Yu-Gi-Oh!
