how do i remove links out of my metal watch strap you can easily do that at home hun the links are connected with metal pins a lot of times you will have arrows on the inside of the watch strap which tell you in what direction the pins have to be removed if it doesn't have arrows it should work either way just take something thin like a bent paperclip or a nail to push the pin out you can just push it out a bit and then remove it completely with plyers remove as many links as needed and then re connect the loose ends with one of the pins you have removed but don't try too hard if it doesn't work that way take it to the jewelers and have them do it Floppy disk Textile manufacturing Drill bit Strap-on dildo Archery Knife Katana Professional wrestling holds Seismic retrofit BS 1363 Nine Inch Nails Screw Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Professional wrestling match types Clinker (boat building) Eggerland series Casting Staple (fastener) Shackle RuneScape quests Universal Serial Bus Lathe Glossary of climbing terms Manicure Earring Equine conformation Upholstery Wrench Aerial (dance move) Atari 8-bit family Repouss__ and chasing Lock picking 2000 Australian Grand Prix Paperclip Handloading Woodworking Metalworking Internal ballistics Enigma machine Automatic teller machine Tire Motorcycle helmet Nail (engineering) English longbow Frogman Bow (weapon) Rail tracks Undergarment Cartridge (firearms) Pinball RS-232 Gag (BDSM) Coupling (railway) Pump It Up TIA-568A/B Royal Rumble Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fencing Stapler Strapping Young Lad Professional wrestling slang Snowboard M-209 Spark plug Parachute Martini-Henry Devin Townsend Motility Shoe Electric motor RuneScape skills Hand grenade Extreme Programming PlayStation 2 Guqin SCART Cross-country skiing The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Wire wrap The Devin Townsend Band Time Out of Mind Pin (device) Naval mine Vitreous enamel Delay line memory Chess strategy and tactics M60 machine gun Curling Modem Arrow of time Computer bus B-47 Stratojet Pottery Poker jargon Horse tack GLOCK MRAM Piccolo Junior Saga Land mine Mouse (computing)
