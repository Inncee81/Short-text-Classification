how do you get rid of a protein smell hey i spilled a protein shake on my carpet tried to clean it out twice but the stink still remains i m scaring my family with the smell thats coming out of my bedroom frankly when i forget that i spilled a protein shake sometimes i'm scared to go in the bedroom myself help don get some nature's miracle at the pet store like petco or petsmart spray it really well on the spill area you might even want to pour it on the area so it soaks into the carpet and gets down into the pad too this stuff contains enzymes that eat organic materials like urine and fecal matter so i'm sure it would work on your protein shake as it dries the smell may seem to get worse but once it is dry the smell should be gone if not then follow the directions on the bottle and apply it again only more thoroughly next time Hamster Tofu Russian joke Hydrogen peroxide Fancy rat Food preservation Protein Skunk Upholstery Natt__ Toilet humour Vermicompost Sulfur Sin City Bong Soy protein Fecal incontinence Cell (biology) Textile manufacturing Diseases of the honeybee Pet skunk Ammonia AFI 100 Years series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat Sake Semen Urine Ron and Fez Urinary incontinence Diaper Menstrual cup AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes Urinal Wheat beer Dairy Polyethylene terephthalate Homer Simpson Brewery Fire extinguisher Sterilization (microbiology) Sleeping with the Enemy (Simpsons episode) Genetic engineering Single certification Kitchen Hemp Compost Signal transduction Honeybee Molecular biology Shaggy dog story Enzyme Manure Schistosomiasis Diabetes mellitus Air pollution Genetics Guinea pig Vegetarianism Toilet paper Flatulence The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Origin of life Bedbug Menstrual cycle Vacuum cleaner Snake Coconut crab The Great Stink Deluge (mythology) PETCO Park Water Halitosis Feces Time Out of Mind Carpet Western blot Magical objects in Harry Potter Martini cocktail Gelatin Champagne (beverage) Virus Linus Pauling Recurring South Park characters Biochemistry Insulin Richard Chase Kosher foods Japanese toilet Episodes of Lost (Season 1) World War Three (Doctor Who) Basement Tlingit Fertilizer Plastic Ricin Homer vs. Dignity The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Casting Chair
