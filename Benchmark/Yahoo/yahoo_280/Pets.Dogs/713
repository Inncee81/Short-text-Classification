why couldn't yasmin stop saying her new dogs name when she was asked not to by the dog trainer now dexter is your average fun loving face licking dog so someone called yasmin bought a new dog and went to a trainer to learn how give it commands the trainer told to yasmin to call dexter over by saying come boy yasmin says come dexter the trainer says don t use his name just say come boy yasmin says ok dexter come boy the trainer getting mad says don t use the dog's name just say come boy yasmin says come boy then good boy dexter the trainer then makes yasmin do press ups the question is why couldn t yasmin stop saying dexter s name you sound like you're angry and maybe you're the trainer every trainer i ever heard making comments has stated that the dog's name should be used before each command you give this way the dog knows you mean for him her to listen as you are talking to him her and the following words will be a command for the dog if you don't say the name first the dog doesn't have any way to know you mean him her you might be talking to that other human next to you of on your cell phone and not to the dog also if there is more than one dog around this is the only way the dog knows which dog you are talking to i think this trainer has made a serious error using boy instead of the dog's name i also think that yasmin has probably watched training videos or been to other training and has been trained to use the dog's name Shaggy dog story Dog training The Ashlee Simpson Show Prank flash Pok__mon Live!
