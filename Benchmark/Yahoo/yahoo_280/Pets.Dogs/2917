dog owners my brother in law and me both got new dachshund basset mix puppies from the same litter there only about months old right now and were in the process of house breaking them my brother in law keeps his dog in a cage all day except to take it outside to go potty and then its right back in the cage the dog spends his entire day in the cage and has a chew toy or two to play with and his food and water are in there as well and then sleeps in a kennel carrier in his room he claims he training the dog not to go in the house and if i let him out to play with his brother he gets upset and yells at me for doing so i think its unfair to the dog and my brother in law is just being lazy am i justified in feeling that way this type of crate training is not training it is corporal punishment many a dog owner here thinks this is how to train it isn't training it is forcing a dog to stay confined and not mess in its environment to force an animal to hold itself isn't training i know that i will upset many but too bad i raised several litters of puppies and trained them before they left to go outside and they did they didn't need to be confined b c they were trained to let you know when they had to go and they continued this thereafter it takes time and effort something that many a dog owner doesn't get lock him in a crate and call yourself a dog trainer not it breeds defects in animals if confined for too long fear aggression wild behavior when finally let loose despair confinement doesn't rendered a healthy trained and adjusted animal the shelter's are full of animals who had lousy owners and trainers and then get blamed my dogs puppies were trained not tortured Housebreaking Dog Dog training Crate training Domestic rabbit Basset Hound Socialization Hamster Guinea pig Obedience training Mixed-breed dog Fox hunting Ferret Labrador Retriever Havanese Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Docking Belgian Shepherd Dog German Shepherd Dog Cat Dog agility Breed registry Garfield Dachshund Pok__mon Live!
