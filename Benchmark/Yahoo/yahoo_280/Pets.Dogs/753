itchy ears on a labrador my labrador seems to have itchy ears but i cant see anything there i've seen quite a few infected ears on labs and it looks nothing like them no redness or gunge or raised parts or anything but he scratches them a lot and grunts whilst he does this and i can hear possibly liquid moving around when he does it and he also shakes a lot you know when they're trying to get rid of the water etc but when theres no water on him it's more like to flap his ears can't be fleas because he hasnt got any and he's deflead regularly and cant be anything to do with worms etc ps cant be an infection it's probably yeast growing deep down where you can't see the grunge yet i would use rubbing alcohol in them to kill the yeast before it gets too serious Brewery Labrador Retriever Cat Ethanol Otitis externa Tattoo Earwax Yeast Bacteria Alcoholic beverage Dog Mosquito Itch Dandruff Snake Sake Common cold Hyperglycemia Ear Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Guinea pig Trichinosis Scabies Breastfeeding Dracunculiasis Kakapo Diarrhea Alcoholic proof Hemp Hearing impairment Wheat beer Beer Anthrax Honey Boric acid Chicken Champagne (beverage) Rum Heartworm Earring Erysipelas Red Hot Chili Peppers Treehouse of Horror IX Athlete's foot Brewing Wine making Stomach cancer Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Body piercing Gout Computer virus Fungus Folic acid Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Eczema Hyperthermia Cephalexin Opportunity rover Model organism The Star Wars Holiday Special Pet skunk Bread Distilled beverage Methamphetamine The Covenant Wine Yeast (baking) Characters in the Smurfs Dobermann Ale Comfrey Single malt Scotch The Itchy & Scratchy Show Coeliac disease Seborrhoeic dermatitis Acne Tetrapod Maize Fancy rat Newfoundland and Labrador Ministry of Mayhem Worms weapons and tools Death grunt Mycosis Geography of Canada Timeline of notable computer viruses and worms Itchy & Scratchy Land Ketoconazole Deluge (mythology) Myxobolus cerebralis Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador Computer worm Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alcohol Traumatic brain injury Inuktitut
