aggressive dogs at the dog park i took my adult female beautifully trained bernese mtn dog to a new dog park i opted not to bring the mos old pups until i knew the park better my girl did her normal ambling around eating blackberries off bushes with a small amount of socializing she's a people dog not a dog dog when we were heading out i stopped to talk to a friend both of us still watching our dogs when a woman came in with a rat terrier and a chi mix the rat terrier ran off to play the chi decided to worry at my girl barking snarling and lunging at her ankles my girl gave me the darn kids look i asked the owner to control her dog and she said its not like my dog can hurt yours we got into a discussion about the fact that not all dogs are as tolerant as mine all the while the chi is continuing i do not touch other people's dogs without permission because it leaves me at professional liability my girl lies down the dog worries at her head and my girl growlffffs big bark the chi owner freaked out about how she couldn't believe i had such a dangerous dog at the dog park at no point did my dog touch hers all she did was a big scary from the depths of h ll single bark the same bark she gave her own pups to warn them that's enough so what would you have done i would have given your dog a great big hug she sounds like a charmer with the patience of a saint my tibetan mastiffs are the same way big and with a bark that would shake the depths of h ll but they are such teddy bears people are for some reason afraid of big dogs and think little dogs can't hurt anything but my experience has been like yours the problem is the clueless owners that want to blame everything on somebody else and never take responsibility for their ill socialized and ill trained mutts i'd just about had it with dog parks until i found one near us that charges a small yearly fee you wouldn't believe the difference in the kinds of people that come to a paid park vs a free one that few dollars seems to eliminate a lot of irresponsible dog owners and we've had nothing but good experiences at this park and now it's the only one we go to if you don't have one near you consider opening one sorry for the grief wish i could give you better advice but people like that are best avoided if your dog had even nipped at hers you'd probably be facing a law suit right now take care Dog Pit bull Shaggy dog story Kodocha Theory of conduct American Pit Bull Terrier Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests Dog training Fancy rat Ferret Piccolo Junior Saga Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mixed-breed dog Social rule Boston Terrier Poker jargon Paintball The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Gray Wolf Hamster Carl Barks Humphrey Bogart The Emancipation of Mimi One Tree Hill (TV series) Grief Obedience training Our Gang Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Transactional analysis Reservoir Dogs Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Milton H.
