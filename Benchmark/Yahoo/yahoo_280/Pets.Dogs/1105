our puppie wee's inside after walks what to do we have a week old king charles spaniel puppy ellie we've been trying to house train her since we got her weeks ago but she doesn't seem to be getting the hint at all the problem is she doesn't just have accidents we take her out a lot and as soon as she comes in she does her buisiness inside its like she holds it in theres been times where we've taken her out for an hour and has been in the back garden for up to two hours playing then as soon as she enters the house she does it we've been rewarding her for doing it outside and saying 'no ' when we catch her inside but she's just not improving and just wags her tail when you tell her off she has puppy pads down but rarely uses them i know she is young but we thought she would have improved slightly over the last five weeks any tips to help us out thanks xxx thanks to everyone so far great advice we have been trying to keep her outside until she does her stuff but its just not practical always one day i was waiting two hours and she came back in a within minutes she'd done a wee and a poo my mum had her out hr minutes yesterday before she did one maybe we should take her out bring her in and take her back out again after a few minutes lol strange arn't they dogs x please please please don't ever rub a dog's nose in their mess not to say you have just bad edvice from others that's way wrong bad negative teaching from old school we want positive teaching that creats positive bonding don't tell her no when she pee's in side this only makes her think that what she's doing is wrong which is totaly natural to pee they don't understand your that what your trying to teach them is where she's doing it is wrong they can't distinguish the difference between the two remember house training is for us not them shame on us not them their just doing what's natural to emlinuate were in training of learning their clues of when they need to go the walk should be her reward when she goes pee out side think about it you take her out for a walk she does her thing and then the walk is over not much fun instead use the walk as her reward the potty pad's have pro's and con's they help to keep your house semi clean but the down fall is it tells the pup that it's okay to do their bussness inside mixed message take her out every hour on the hour when she pee's she can go for a walk and come back in and don't forget the treats when she pee's she needs the treats and praises each time like it's her first time every time you may need to cut a large piece from a soiled pad and place it out side on the ground where you'd like for her to pee this will allow her to smell her stuff and she'll get the idea tip when you take her out to her spot does she have a spot it should only be for eliminating only it's bussiness time and bussines time only don't simualte her in any way save that for when she pee's and save the play time later and in a different area her spot she may need a spot a place where she goes every time every day to do she thing she's small so she may only need a place that's x or smaller that way all her stuff is in one area she'll smell it it will simulate her and she'll go this too shall pass keep doing a great job Housebreaking Social rule Dog training Dog Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hey Jude Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Skateboarding trick Little Britain Toilet humour Ron and Fez The Inside Blonde on Blonde Aerial (dance move) Spot the Dog Fancy rat Piccolo Junior Saga Tag About a Boy Scooby-Doo Operation Market Garden Hamster The Apprentice 2 Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Conker's Bad Fur Day Volleyball Great Teacher Onizuka Salad Fingers Vegeta The Ashlee Simpson Show RuneScape locations Friends Fecal incontinence Shit Pitaten Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Diving Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Poker jargon Electrophysiology Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Death Gate Cycle Empire Burlesque Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Glossary of climbing terms One Tree Hill (TV series) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Coming of Age (TNG episode) Norway national football team Penis Richard Feynman Extreme Programming The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Goodness and value theory Blood on the Tracks Parachuting American football The Shining (film) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Gray Wolf CPU cache The Amber Spyglass Scenes from a Memory Ranma __ characters Russian joke Procrastination Menstrual cup Billboard Hot 100 2000 Australian Grand Prix Jeopardy!
