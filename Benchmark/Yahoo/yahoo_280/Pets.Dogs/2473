how do you train dogs to shake what's the technique i don't think we're taking him to obedience school anytime soon haha what's the technique i mean like to shake hands not to shake his body this is the technique we use at our shelter start this training indoors and then work out of doors after the dog has mastered the command and can shake to you immediately after each command call the dog by its name and show the dog a treat have the dog sit in front of you while the dog is sitting hold a treat over its nose with your left hand and with your right hand touch the back of the dog s right leg right at the wrist and say shake o when the dog lifts its paw even a fraction give it an acknowledgement cue such as yes thank you or excellent so the dog knows it did the right thing give the dog its treat pet it and give it lots of praise o clapping your hands together as applause and using verbal praise such as yay good dog or good shake are all acceptable o using the phrase good shake helps to reinforce the idea that coming to you on command is a good thing repeat until the dog is automatically lifting its right paw to shake your hand if the dog does the wrong thing don't give any reward just try again from the point where the dog last did what it was told keep this up over time until the dog has mastered the exercise to reinforce the learning of this command ask the dog to shake regularly throughout the day s routine every time the dog meets another person ask it to sit and shake hands as a form of greeting note it s best to teach dogs both the shake with the right paw and high five with the left paw commands if you don t teach the dog both commands it may get into the habit of demanding attention by forcing its shake paw on you and your guests all the time if you teach both commands and don t give the dog a treat until it offers the correct paw it will be less likely to be demanding and will instead wait for a command to either shake or high five Obedience training Shaggy dog story Dog agility Milton H.
