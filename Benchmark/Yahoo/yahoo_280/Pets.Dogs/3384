what are some issues and strategies for handling them with dogs living in a large city that is what problems do dogs dog owners encounter with city life due to the close proximity of large numbers of people what is the best way to avoid handle these problems for example strangers who think it's ok to run up to your dog flailing arms and squealing oh how cute and try to pet him andyrowndagin first i never said this happened to my dog second i never said how i would handle it if it did it is often helpful to read the question without making assumptions before answering my intention was to get input on a the types of problems encountered by dogs dog owners in large cities and b how people handle these problems you need to get a dog that doesn't need to run a lot unless you do a lot of jogging or heavy exercise where the dog can join you you need to be good at house training and give the dog some place if there's an emergency where the dog has to go pee or poop you have to be ready to pick up the poop when you walk your dog you have to walk your dog on a leash not let it run loose you have to exercise your dog regularly walking at least and this is good for you and your cardio status as well as good for the dog's health and emotional outlook most people don't squeal and flail arms when they say how cute if you don't want people to pet your dog you pull the dog close with the leash and state we don't let the dog think everyone can pet it or we prefer you not pet the dog but thank you for the compliment my response to people who want to pet my dogs really depends on how that person approaches i can tell who knows how to approach the dog and i can see the dog's comfort level and i choose different actions accordingly with children asking to pet is a requirement sudden actions squealing and flailing are discouraged and i tell them that these actions make the dog nervous Dog training Dog Dog agility Hamster Breastfeeding Domestic rabbit Social rule Aerial (dance move) Transactional analysis Human sexual behavior Havanese Scientology beliefs and practices Theodicy Theory of conduct Housebreaking Aphasia Pekingese Expert system MapleStory Motivation Falconry Running Fancy rat Ethics Pit bull Philosophy of language Coming of Age (TNG episode) Unreal Halting problem Cat Ferret German Shepherd Dog Swimming Abortion debate Surveillance Free will Altruism Garfield Fast bowling Second language acquisition Fecal incontinence American Pit Bull Terrier Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Milton H.
