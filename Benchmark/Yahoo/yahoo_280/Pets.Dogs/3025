i think the groomer hurt my dog yesterday i took my lb maltese to a groomer when i got there there were several other maltese waiting to get groomed so i figured it was an okay place well i picked her up and she was fine then this morning she won't even walk she is in so much pain she's only two so i know it's not because she's old the only other time she acted like this is when she fell off the couch and hurt her front legs i asked the groomer if she was good and she said yes she cooperated really nicely well that was obvisouly a lie because i bet she held her down to groom her i'm overly upset about this and she won't return my calls what should i do some years ago one of my maltese was hurt at a groomers the groomer offered to pay any vet bills and the bill was well over dollars buddy the pet required stitches in the corner under his front leg the groomer owner paid gladly when i gave her my vet's bill she also told me about the accident when i picked up my dog she offered to pay any vet bills she stated that she had spent time building a good reputation and wanted to keep it you don't say if the groomer is also the owner if not i would contact the owner if you find out that the dog has any serious damage also let your vet know where it happened when you take it in accidents can always happen and a reputable business will always back their work unfortunately the faster a dog is completed the more made by the end of each day groomers can limit accidents by taking the time required for each pet but accidents can occur even if groomed by the best sometimes a pet will make and unexpected move because of some distraction i hope your pet is ok and the vet gives you a good report on her Dog training Shaggy dog story Sydney Riot of 1879 Ferret Garfield Dog agility Futurama (TV series - season 5) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Humphrey Bogart Housebreaking Social rule Microchip implant (animal) Obedience training Knots Landing The Star Wars Holiday Special Dog Guinea pig Portuguese Water Dog Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Aerial (dance move) The Shining (film) The Pet Sounds Sessions Kim Possible Ocean's Twelve Equine conformation Pekingese Gambling Rabies Plame affair RuneScape quests Poker jargon The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) Pet Sounds Havanese Forrest Gump Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Operation Market Garden Etiquette German Shepherd Dog Life insurance Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Eddie Guerrero Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Road Rovers Pitaten Betting (poker) Sin City Satchel Paige Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Draw poker Mississippi John Hurt Reservoir Dogs Pittsburgh Steelers Jon Secada Piccolo Junior Saga Montreal Screwjob Traumatic incident reduction Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Deflation (economics) Smallville (Season 4) 2000 Australian Grand Prix 1957 World Series Hitchhiking The Apprentice 2 Insurance Cricket Bart Sells His Soul Anderson Cooper Docking Game show Los Angeles Dodgers Cincinnati Bengals Education in Australia Kill Bill Veterinarian The Inside Blue Peter AFI 100 Years series Professional wrestling attacks Cleveland Browns Skinny Dip Time Out of Mind The Contender (television series) Fancy rat Beetle in an Anthill Daylight saving time Spaceward, Ho!
