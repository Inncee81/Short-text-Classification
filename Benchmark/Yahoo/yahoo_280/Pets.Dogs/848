what's a good way to teach a puppy to bring a ball back to me after i throw it my month old chihuahua loves to run after a ball but when she gets to it she bites it but doesn't pick it up then she runs back to be without it i've tried pointing it out to her guriding her through it and everything but she doesn't do it what's a good method of teaching her the step she's missing and yes the ball is a perfect size for her i know she can pick it up easily thanks play with her with a ball on a string her drive dies once the ball stops no movement no need to chase put it on a string and keep it moving so that she'll want to grab the ball and carry it Volleyball Glossary of American football Tag Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Table tennis Dog training Aerial (dance move) Fast bowling American football Canadian football National Football League Lore Dodgeball 1957 World Series Swingout Piccolo Junior Saga Vegeta Super Bowl XXI Equine conformation Rugby union positions Shaggy dog story Billiards Rugby union New York Giants Textile manufacturing Softball Son Gohan Water polo Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Super Bowl IX Cleveland Browns Skateboarding trick Baseball Yao Ming Four square English cricket team Professional wrestling holds Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Escape from New York Snooker Batting (cricket) Winning Streak Professional wrestling throws Rugby league positions Tenshinhan Bedknobs and Broomsticks Mills Mess Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Team Fortress Classic 2005 English cricket season Glossary of partner dance terms Super Bowl XVIII Baseball Stars Super Bowl XXVII Laws of cricket Violin Eight ball Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Rugby league Australian rules football Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXVI Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Drill bit Golf Collision detection Super Bowl XXV Fielding (cricket) Baroque chess Skinny Puppy Mouse (computing) Three card monte Cincinnati Bengals Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kasparov versus The World Double bass Eddie Guerrero National Football League Line-out Baseball statistics Wide receiver Super Bowl X Super Bowl XXIV Ron Weasley Dog Touch football (rugby league) Super Bowl XXIII Good Morning, Vietnam History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) GunZ The Duel Sport Indianapolis 500 Marching band Derek Jeter Side pass (dance move) Glossary of ballet terms American football strategy 2004 American League Championship Series Crate training Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl III
