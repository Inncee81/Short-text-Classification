why does my dog snap at my new puppy over toys or beds but he always lets her eat first i'm confused my male puppy is mos old and my female puppy is wks old he won't share any of his toys or bones with her and every time she gets a toy he takes it from her even when i buy them identical toys bones or snacks and give him one first he will go hide his and then take hers i bought a fluffy pink bed and he takes it from her and lays in it even though he has three other beds of his own but when i tell them it is time to eat he just watches her eat or walks away and lets her eat first does anyone know why i thought the alpha dog always ate first also is it possible to teach him to share his toys i have tried telling him that this one is his and that one is hers it only works while i am watching them he will let her have it for a minute but if i walk away he will take it from her it's like he only plays nice when mom's watching he is probley a bit jelus and being domanant also in the wild young cubs are normaly allowed to eat with the altha's untill they get a bit older another important privilege concerns food when a large prey animal is brought down the alpha wolves control access to it they make sure they and their dependent cubs eat enough before their older offspring start feeding seriously Dog training Dog Spider Hamster Housebreaking Gray Wolf Lion Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Brown Bear Livestock Shark Fancy rat Garfield My Little Pony Tasmanian Devil Giant Panda Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Comanche Rugrats Hunting American Black Bear Kakapo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tarantula RuneScape quests Saki Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Guinea pig Vampire Tenshinhan Kodocha Puma Bat Liger Sears Holdings Corporation Dolphin Platypus Care Bears 101 Dalmatians: The Series Shaggy dog story Orca Coprophagia Invader Zim Fox hunting Sin City Socialization Jackass: The Movie Toy Story Pet skunk Milton H.
