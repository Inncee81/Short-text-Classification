i cant stop my mom from feeding our dogs human food ive already wrote a question like this a few days ago and everyone suggested that i warn her on how harmful human food is for dogs she only feeds them what we eat i also had suggestions to physically not let my mom feed our dogs this kind of food so i gave my mom information on the harms of only feeding your dog human food she just got two hamburgers from wendy's and when she came home she gave both our dogs a hamburger and i automatically took the hamburgers away and brought the dogs into my room and shut the door she just came in let them out and fed them the hamburgers it is rediculous i cant stop her and i know my dogs are going to die waaay earlier than they should i told her that even though she isnt meaning to she is killing our dogs she is too stubborn and i dont know what to do please help my mother is the same way her year old chihuahua is lbs yes that big he eats mcdonalds kfc toast w jam and butter dipped in coffee ect for years my brother and i explained to her argued with her tried to convince her i even had our family vet sit down and talk with her about willie's bad eating habits after he had an allergic reaction to human food he broke out in hives she wouldn't stop it wasn't until about months ago that willie's colon shut down he didn't go to the bathroom for two days and became deathly ill my mother called me at work in a panic she said willie's sick what do i do i called the vet and took him in asap out vet explained to my mom after they had to manually pump out willie's colon that due to his weight and improper eating habits he could die of toxic shock due to colon failure it took him nearly dying for her to put him on a balanced diet of vet approved foods this story may help but it might take a serious illness or incident like this to help make your mom understand there are certain fats and sugars in human foods that dog's stomachs are not made to digest properly as these are not foods that these animals eat in the wild and are not genetically predisposed to having the right compounds to digest this can cause allergic reactions colon failure and quick heavy weight gain in dogs which can have tragic effects Insulin Garfield Chocolate Food Hamburger Nutrition Dog Obesity Guinea pig Hamster Shaggy dog story Sin City Kodocha Cat Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Domestic rabbit Raw food diet Aspartame Vegetarianism Rocko's Modern Life Milk Vitamin C Fancy rat Allergy Ferret Crohn's disease Breakfast Atkins Nutritional Approach The Shining (film) Coffee Invader Zim Hypoglycemia Anorexia nervosa Treehouse of Horror V Flatulence Doug Kashrut Folic acid Weight training Omega-3 fatty acid The dozens Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fast-food restaurant Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Recurring South Park characters Tea Sewage treatment Brown Bear One Piece minor characters Tooth enamel Bread Dairy Joke The Ark in Space Ozone depletion Coeliac disease McDonald's God Emperor of Dune Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Foie gras Shark Dieting Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Super Size Me YuYu Hakusho Sugar substitute Hot dog Datalore (TNG episode) Eric Cartman Toilet humour Cancer Ozone hole Conker's Bad Fur Day Taboo food and drink RuneScape quests Sonic the Hedgehog Piccolo Junior Saga South Park Orca Animal testing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Veganism Terri Schiavo Pet skunk Foodborne illness Kakapo Kangaroo Chicken Tooth Colony in Space Multiple chemical sensitivity
