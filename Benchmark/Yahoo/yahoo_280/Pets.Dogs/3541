my dog runs and hides from me when i tell him let's go outside he started doing this after we boarded him what can i do so that he is not scared i agree don't say anything for a while here's what i would suggest get a really good treat like some cooked chicken or hotdog and put it in your hand walk by your dog and wave it right in front of his nose trust me this will get his attention as he begins to follow you quietly put on the leash and walk out the door once you are outside give him the treat do this enough times in a row and he'll be ok or if he hides before you can do this make a little trail of treats to the door and praise him all along the way then take a nice long walk or play with his favorite toy outside Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Obedience training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests Dog agility G-Man (Half-Life) Theory of conduct Tag Housebreaking Invader Zim Taikyoku shogi The Time Machine 1957 World Series Humphrey Bogart Comanche Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Guadalupe Mountains National Park Rosa Parks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Skateboarding trick Silent Night, Deadly Night Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sinfest Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Salad Fingers Reservoir Dogs The Star Wars Holiday Special The Empty Child The Dalek Invasion of Earth Kitesurfing The Shining (film) Jean Schmidt Steven Wright Milton H.
