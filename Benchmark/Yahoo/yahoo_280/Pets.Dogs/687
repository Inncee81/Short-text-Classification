poll do you own a popular breed a rare breed or a mixed breed i'm curious of the breakdown of what dogs people own on answers so here's my poll there are seven categories for dogs based on their popularity and if they're purebred write how many dogs in each category you own please put your poll answer at the top of your answer if you want to say more about your dogs please do so after the poll results for example most popular breed mixed breed with unknown history here we go there are seven categories most popular breed very popular breed slightly popular breed less well known breed rare breed mixed breed with known history mixed breed with unknown history the first four categories are defined below basically all akc breeds based on popularity and registration stats i've also added the american pit bull terrier since that's a popular breed without being akc registered it's in the same category as the amstaff rare breeds are any purebreds not listed if you have a mixed breed that you know what all its parents are use mixed breed with known history this is for accidental breedings and designer dogs for all other mixed breeds whose history is a guess use mixed breed with unknown history most popular breed australian shepherd basset hound beagle bichon frise boston terrier boxer brittany bulldog cavalier king charles spaniel chihuahua cocker spaniels collie
