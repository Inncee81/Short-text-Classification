is the only way to potty train a dog crate training is there any other way isnt it cruel to have the puppy locked up or will it get used to it also when do you stop using the crate altogether any other way to potty train a puppy so is the point of using the crate so the puppy will hold it untill you take him out and then in the end will get the point not to go inside oh i will crate train my puppy now i thought it meant leave the dog in there all day and only take it out for potty but more question when its in the crate at night how many times do i have to take it outside using a crate to potty train a puppy is a good idea and works for a few reasons a puppy is less likely to soil the place it sleeps so he will try to hold it when you take the pup outside to potty do it on a leash and stay with him when he potties give him at least three special treats and praise him always wait a couple of minutes more because sometimes poop comes minutes after pee this teaches the dog that he can score earn a jackpot of treats if he potties outside the treats need to be special if he is really young he should only be fed his kibble dog food except for food treats when he goes potty the result is the pup learning that the best place the only place to potty is outside where he gets lots of treats and praise if you take him out before and after meals and playtime and as soon as he gets out of the crate he won't have an opportunity to have an accident in the house using the crate makes potty training a positive experience for the puppy he is never scolded for eliminating and so you'll never need to worry about having a dog that pees in a corner because he knows you might yell at him for peeing it works very well and it does not mean locking the pup all day just when you can't be right with him to see if he starts to do any suspicious sniffing as long as you take him out often enough it shouldn't be a problem i think a month old pup can hold it for a couple of hours there is a chart about this online i used this method on my dog and the only pee accident we ever had was when he developed an infection which is perfectly understandable he never did in the house good luck ps play and fun in the yard should happen after the potty and you can try again before you go in potty in the yard before you go on a walk if the dog learns that playtime and walks start after potty is over they are going to go faster and get it over with dogs that learn the walk stops or outside time ends when they potty will hold it outside as long as they can a fact you will not like when you are trying to get the dog to go quickly so you can dash off to an appointment Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Obedience training Toilet humour Social rule Ron and Fez The Amazing Race Pitaten Ultima Online Taikyoku shogi $ale of the Century Scooby-Doo Toilet training Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Humphrey Bogart Tag Gray Wolf The Inside Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kibbutz Dairy Dog food Hamster The Fairly OddParents Professional wrestling match types Glossary of American football Kodocha 101 Dalmatians: The Series Futurama (TV series - season 5) Basset Hound Aphasia Eddie Guerrero Iditarod The Sims Goodness and value theory 2005 Iditarod Quill (film) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Joker's Wild Elimination communication Parachuting Wheel of Fortune About a Boy Theory of conduct The Contender (television series) Poker jargon Sick Puppy Family Feud The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Philosophy of language Elvis Presley Domestic rabbit The Shining (film) Piccolo Junior Saga Docking Swimming Our Gang Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 1957 World Series Paranoia Agent 2005 United States Grand Prix Animal Farm Prostate cancer The Apprentice 2 Time Crisis 3 Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Jeopardy!
