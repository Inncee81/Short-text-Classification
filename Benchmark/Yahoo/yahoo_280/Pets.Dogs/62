has anyone else heard this a few minutes ago on the news they said that they have come up with a great way for dogs to get back at michael vick for torturing and killing them they have now come out with the michael vick doggie chew toy and that all the procedes will go to the humane society i think it's a great idea just wanted to know if you heard and what you think lisa has posted the correct link to purchase one thank you lisa whatever happened til innocent til proven guilty i searched and i could not find anything saying he has been convicted if i am wrong please direct me to proof of his conviction i know it is not the popular these days to wait for a person to be convicted because everyone has already deemed him guilty but nobody except him the participants and maybe the lawyers know the whole story and all the evidence has not been presented so i think it is wrong of the hsus to benefit off his name when he has not been convicted of anything if he is convicted maybe that is a good way to help animals but right now it is wrong this case should not be tried in the press that is what we have court and justice systems for Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal Plame affair Miscarriage of justice 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Moore v.
