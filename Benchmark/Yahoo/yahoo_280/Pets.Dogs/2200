experienced dog owners question i am going to be moving back to school and have two small dogs with me and two roommates my dogs are excellent about going in their crates while i am gone and not making a peep while others are in the house one of my roommates offered to help take them out a few days a week because she said she has no class except for tuesdays and thursdays the only thing is i don't want them to cry each time someone comes into the door i want them to think that well if my mom isn't coming to get me then i will just sleep until she comes home i am afraid that if my other roommate starts helping they will get used to that and start to whine cry once they are crated and she is still in the apartment i apologize if this makes no sense but i have worked very hard to have my dogs not cry or whine while people are home and i am not they won't be alone for more than hours at a time am i just worried for no reason or should i allow her to help to those that have told me i have no business owning dogs and that that many hours alone is wrong how many of you have actual jobs if you are that ignorant in thinking that hours is a long time many people leave their animals alone for hours at a time because they have to go to work and guess what the animals are fine if they are given adequate exercise my dogs eat only the best food and have only the best care how dare you tell me that i am not treating them properly i take them on off leash walks on trails for at least an hour a day every single morning the second i am back from class they are taken out to potty and played with the normal amount is hours they are alone but i do have a few days where is the maximum when i have to go to work too that is nothing in all reality a dog has to sleep several hours a day at least grow up and take a look at your own pets before criticizing me about mine if your roommate uses the same corrections you already have established it may be ok if the dogs need her then i would give it a try but if they are just fine the way they are then i would leave it that way just tell her that you have worked really hard on training them what your fears are it is best not to change something that already works unless again you need her help Dog training Housebreaking Obedience training Shaggy dog story Ferret Dog Fancy rat Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Crate training Sin City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Sims The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Rent (musical) Social rule Theory of conduct Garfield Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Piccolo Junior Saga Phoebe Buffay's songs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Amazing Race Dog agility Animal rights Pok__mon Live!
