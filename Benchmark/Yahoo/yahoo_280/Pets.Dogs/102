what to do about scottish terrier male puppy aggression my fiance and me got a week old scotty pup male a week ago and he's been pretty good house training is coming along leash training and verbal commands are starting to work he'll sleep through the night and his separation anxiety barking crying has been minimalized to a few minutes or less we're crate training positively reinforcing with treats verbal praise and petting but he gets hyper aggressive sometimes we've been taking him on regular walks and giving him a few hours of exercise playtime a day but sometimes he'll race around the apartment growling and running at high speed he'll nip at you if you don't have a toy but usually calms down if you suppress him physically or distract him well enough with a toy we've been trying to break his biting tendency and have been replacing our furniture with more appropriate chew toys is this behavior typical for males should we let him get the energy out or is this a habit we should try to curb right away i have a month old scottish terrier male puppy his name is hurley what you are describing is typical play behavior for the scottish terrier breed my puppy has a lot of energy that is normal we walk him at least times a day and spend a lot of time playing with him after work throwing his favorite squeeky toy the ball etc he also has many toys which he plays with non stop we also try to take him to the dog park at least times a week so he can let out some energy i suggest taking your puppy to either the dog park or doggie daycare he needs to release a lot of energy and he wants to play and will let you know by running around and growling and biting you he's just being playful and for anyone who thinks he'll calm down after getting neutered that's ridiculous our puppy was neutered about weeks ago and there is no change in his playful behavior and we are happy about that scottish terriers are just playful puppies that need a lot of stimulation do not curb his running around that's how he plays our puppy hurley runs circles around the table everytime he comes near me he growls and please know this is only fun for him not aggressive behavior i'd be happy to answer any other questions you have as well scotties are such a wonderful breed Dog Housebreaking West Highland White Terrier Cat Nintendogs Ferret American Pit Bull Terrier Obedience training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hamster Border Terrier Fancy rat Dog show Pit bull Jack Russell Terrier Labrador Retriever Mixed-breed dog Milton H.
