am i wrong my fiance and i got into this arguement because i have a shih tzu male months which i dont allow anyone to feed him human food anyways my fiance wanted to feed him a little piece of grilled steak and i got upset i told him no and asked him to respect itwell he flipped and said since it was my dog im the one who is gonna feed and walk it and bathe and it so on because he dont want anything to do with him anymore im i wrong i mean all i asked was for him not to feed him human food and he said a little piece wont harm him but i just dont like the whole idea of him eating human good he says im too uptight about it and that i need to relax about it because every once a blue moon wont hurt him he says his step father feeds his lab a piece of steak every once in a while and shes fine but me i dont know i love my dog and wouldnt want anything to happen to him so i still dont like the whole idea of him eating human food would the piece of steak harm him what human foods wont harm my dog but would still be healthy enough for him to eat thanks in advance i would assume a greasy steak or any greasy foods is bad right or would grilled meat be ok for him no he isnt on a stritct diet due to medical purposes i suppose i do need to chill a little as someone on here said human food well lol i guess what you and i eat as far as cooked steak and such i do mix dry with wet food the whole turkey and rice and meat and chicken with his dry he said he would feel bad for the dog when he is cooking because the dog would beg my dog never begs when my mom cooks or any one here cooks the nhe says my mom cooks good but tried to say he is a better cook that really sorta aggravated me i told him i didnt care if he begged no means no my dog has tried to sniff and get his nose into things dont belong to him and i just say no no means no i mean seriously he has his own food no need to beg steak is ok he is right about that dogs are meat eaters just don't go overboard however rules and boundaries need to be established between you two about when to feed this dog and where dogs should not be fed from the dinner table this will lead to bad habits and in the end you will punish him when you should be punishing yourselves if your dog is on a strict diet for medical purposes then i would say get huffy good luck this may be good practice for you both when it's time to talk about babies remember dogs and children both require rules boundaries and limitation dog also require exercise discipline and affection in this order if you only give affection and no exercise or discipline you will end up with a monster trust me watch cesar milan on the national geographic channel and visit his website for more tips Theory of conduct RuneScape quests Hamburger Dog Breastfeeding Cuisine of Denmark Hamster Veganism Fecal incontinence Steak Fancy rat Cat Japanese cuisine Jennifer Lopez Escherichia coli O157:H7 Jewish cuisine Domestic rabbit Kitchen Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Egg (food) Social rule Cheesesteak Atkins Nutritional Approach Kodocha Taboo food and drink Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Vegetarianism Guinea pig Tlingit Cuisine of the Philippines Garfield Raw food diet Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Livestock Hot dog Chicken Barbecue Cuisine of the Southern United States Friends Atomic Kitten Food Boom Town (Doctor Who) Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Aztec Urinary incontinence Pitaten Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Shaggy dog story Bengali cuisine Humphrey Bogart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chili con carne Foie gras Little Britain Cuisine of Malaysia Jam (TV series) Korean cuisine Stomach cancer Fugu Bart Sells His Soul Avenue Q MRE The Ashlee Simpson Show Fast-food restaurant The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Treehouse of Horror V The Shining (film) Separation of church and state Rocko's Modern Life One Piece minor characters Theodicy Hip hop collaborations Cuisine of Laos Lisa the Vegetarian Martial art Obedience training Chinese cuisine Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
