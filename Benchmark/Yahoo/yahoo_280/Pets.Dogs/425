why is it that some women let their dogs be the alpha i've been seeing this woman and she lets her dog be the alpha and it annoys me to no end when he barks she says that he's talking to me i tell her that he's telling me that i'm tresspassing but she is in denial she says that he saved her from a rapist years ago and that he's an old dog i don't care because he bit me deep for the second time after i thought that i had his trust why are women like that why do some woman betray the commonsense assumption of human supremacy i have never allowed any of my dogs to be the alpha but if i were in a relation with a silly guy i'd be the alpha my dog the beta and the guy the omega and if the guy were not happy time for him to find a new pack Shaggy dog story Gray Wolf Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Alpha Phi Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Amber Spyglass Brian Griffin Projective transformation God Emperor of Dune The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Transformers: Energon The Evil of the Daleks Theory of conduct Alpha Centauri Quartic equation Angel Sanctuary The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Friends InuYasha (character) Dog training Omega Reservoir Dogs Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Doomsday argument W.
