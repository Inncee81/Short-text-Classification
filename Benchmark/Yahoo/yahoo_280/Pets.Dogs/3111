how common is tonsillitis in border collies my mickey has spates of coughing combined with a sore throat the vet prescribes amoycillin but never seems to pin point a problem the last time he done this coughing and gagging i sent him to have a camera down his throat as it seemed to get worse and worse but nothing was found apart from slightly inflamed tonsils we got antibiotics and again it cleared up but we are due to do our first agility test this weekend and i'm concerened that we may be asked to leave if he'sstill coughing gagging like he is no its not kennel cough have another dog and he is fine as are at least other dogs we socialise with no sneezing in any no temperature in any no other problems just the dry cough and occasional gag from my one dog i am in constant contact with my vet and i am going to ask him this friday when i go back down about tonsilitis i am just curious as to how common tonsillitis is in the collie as i know smaller dogs suffer more with it than the larger breeds you might consider a strep test if this is recurrent sore throat i have never seen any of the three vets at the clinic diagnose tonsillitis though so it must not be too common to diagnose it in dogs i do the computer data entry and i just haven't seen it come up on the record sheets they have me enter Group A streptococcal infection Common cold Infectious mononucleosis Pharyngitis Tonsil Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Asthma Upper respiratory tract infection Tuberculosis Lung cancer Dog agility Streptococcus Domestic rabbit Chronic fatigue syndrome Conjunctivitis Border Collie Fancy rat Radiation therapy Shetland Sheepdog Stomach cancer Psoriasis Jet engine Transmission (medicine) Cancer Medicine HIV Pertussis Equine conformation Hay fever Smooth Collie Mixed-breed dog Dog IgA nephropathy Gonorrhoea Cancer of the larynx Collision detection Gastroesophageal reflux disease Prostate cancer Hash table Rheumatic fever Cytomegalovirus Hepatitis C Bipolar disorder 1925 serum run to Nome Labrador Retriever Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Lyme disease Quicksort CPU cache Malignant melanoma Obedience training Working dog Guinea pig Sickle-cell disease Docking Belgian Shepherd Dog Drowning Microchip implant (animal) Carburetor Border Terrier Iditarod RS-232 Cystic fibrosis Gray Wolf Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Clinical depression Debugging Tonsillectomy Traumatic brain injury Breast cancer Crohn's disease Diphtheria Expert system Angel One (TNG episode) Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Eczema Shaggy dog story Stroke Atari 8-bit family German Shepherd Dog Influenza Medical analysis of circumcision Montgomery Burns Beagle USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Diabetes mellitus Mickey Mouse Breed registry Cerebellum Randomness Modem Syphilis Dog show Pet skunk Herpes simplex virus Cough medicine Aspartame
