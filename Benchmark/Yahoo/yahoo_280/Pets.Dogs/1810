why was my dog growling at my doll last night my boyfriend got my doll out of the attic she is the size of a three four year old and i only put her up there at the end of last year because my brother is terrified of dolls like her and my dad made said i had to so last night i cleaned her up and put her in my room ive had her since i was im now and im not going to play with her she just means a lot to me i sat her up to dry as i was going to bed i was reading my book and my dog yorkshire terrier looked at her and started growling but there were african women out side talking and their voices were kind of muffled and he doesn t really like it when he can hear people outside at night so i thought maybe it was cause of them but i looked around and he was viciously growling at her so i put her on my bed and he started shyly sniffing her and i moved her closer and her foot touched his face and he was terrified and jumped into the air so i put him on my lap and started stroking the doll so he knew it wasn t a wasn t a threat and he seemed ok he would go near her after that but he shares my room and so does she i really crapped myself because i though dogs could sense things weren t real and he has seen her before my other brother and my boyfriend said it s because she looks like a real human but my dog doesn t do it to real people so why would he growl at my doll like that i know this question sound retarded but now im curious thanks guys yeah my brother hates dolls he is young though lol hmm yeah ive seen cholds play o o im scared now hahaha so he is just confused basically but she was in my room all day and he only started as i got into bed no i was given this doll as a nd birthday present brand new dogs usually get frustrated and upset by things they can't make sense out of it's simply because she confused him like some dogs freak when you start sweeping they don't know what on earth your doing or why so they bark to let you know they aren't impressed or to let the broom know that they aren't scared even though they are it's a defense thing and as you said he seems ok now after realising she wasn't a threat to him Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Britain Milton H.
