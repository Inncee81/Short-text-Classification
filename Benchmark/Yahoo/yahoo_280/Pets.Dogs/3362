my dog keeps shaking her head so i know that sometimes when they shake their head frequently that they have an ear infection or something but she went to the dog beach yesterday and after that i flushed them out with this stuff the vet gave me but it said make sure to get it all out in case of ingestion and ever since the flush shes been shaking her head is there anything that can help her it makes me really nervous to see that she has a problem but i cant figure out what thanks so much the dog is suffering from some sort of irritation it could be mites infection or even a reaction to the salt water and sand it could also be the stuff you used to flush the ear has aggravated the situation i would take the dog back for another visit or at the very least call Dog Traumatic brain injury Psoriasis Mange Autoimmune diseases Guinea pig Cat M__ni__re___s disease Balance disorder Fancy rat Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Methamphetamine Body piercing Multiple sclerosis Hamster Rabies Coeliac disease Rosacea Sin City Urinary incontinence Rocky Mountain spotted fever Diving Swimming Havanese Hot dog Shaggy dog story Crohn's disease Herpes simplex virus Otitis externa Dog training Poliomyelitis Shar Pei Asthma Dobermann Chronic fatigue syndrome Combat stress reaction Vomiting Acetic acid Aspartame Common cold Stuttering Texas hold 'em Toilet paper Diarrhea Dither Gray Wolf Spyware Tobacco smoking Alcohol Radiation therapy Beagle Poker jargon Paracetamol Mixed-breed dog Syphilis Hyperglycemia Myxobolus cerebralis Spaniel Dog show The Caves of Androzani Fox hunting English Cocker Spaniel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cephalic disorder Heartworm Anxiety Sulfuric acid Callus Foodborne illness Solvent Pneumonia Bleeding Addison's disease Parkinson's disease Jennings Randolph Lake Draw (poker) Shock Hip fracture Labrador Retriever Potassium bromide Gout Invader Zim Medicine Hiccup English Springer Spaniel Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bacteria Homeopathy Insulin Otitis media Domestic rabbit Tooth enamel Diazepam Sewage treatment Water Toxoplasmosis Iodine Caffeine
