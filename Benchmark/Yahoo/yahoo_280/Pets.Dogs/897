dog aggression advice i sincerely hope that everyone who gives advice to others about dog aggression reads this it is great that we all try to help novice dog owners at this site that is wonderful there is one area however that i'd like you to think about dog aggression if someone asks a question about housebreaking their dog or about getting their dog to sit down etc and the person gets advice that doesn't work it's not a big deal dog still pees in the house so what clean it up dog aggression is an entirely different situation i actually shudder when i see some of the advice that people have give to others at this site i've been training dogs for numerous years and have worked with some of these types of dogs it is quite dangerous for me and for those involved if you get this wrong someone could get hurt or literally killed do what you want but unless you've handled these situations multiple times please think before you respond for those who do give advice why when people tell someone to see a behaviorist or trainer that's not an issue going in the right direction the that gets me going is when people start offering dominance advice fear aggressive dog all you need to do is start doing alpha rolls and that type of thing with those dogs and you potentially have a real issue on your hands we had a rott my breed for a long time in one of our classes that was abused by a cop first time dog owners when i first saw the dog i recommended that the dog be put down owners refused dog came to all classes muzzled others in the class knew the issue we eventually got the dog to trust humans again but it was difficult it becomes quite apparent here that people don't know the difference between people aggression fear aggression dog aggression etc these all need to be handled in different ways the techniques might be similar in some instances but you've got different issues you're dealing with prey drive versus aggress nine crimes that's the type of moronic reply that's the problem if you have no idea what you're talking about please go away you're going to hurt yourself good question i shudder too it's awful to see some of the advice on here i agree that the answer for cases of aggression should be to consult a professional the ccpdt and the iaabc are great resources and they appear to make it easy for anyone in the states to find a certified positive trainer and as far as other comments that i might make some of the causes of aggression are often right in front of us but we don't see them for example in a multiple dog household where there are fights taking all loose toys and chewies away is a great first step so is management preventing the dogs from having interaction until the situation can be assessed getting people's mind started in the right direction hey maybe i shouldn't be looming over my little dog and scooping him up when his ears are pinned and he looks 'frozen' is always a good idea and turning people on to the subtleties of canine body language turid rugaas is also a good start saying read a book is not useful advice what if someone with a fear aggressive dog happens upon cesar millan instead of jean donaldson not all books are equal the cm school teaches us that physical punishment is a ok positive trainers emma parsons karen pryor susan garrett bob bailey jean donaldson patricia mcconnell teach us to work through our dog's problems proactively without punishing the dog a far more valuable lesson Dog training Dog Social rule Housebreaking Obedience training Plame affair Gray Wolf Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
