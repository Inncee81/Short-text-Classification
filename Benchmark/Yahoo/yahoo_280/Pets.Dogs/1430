heart worms found in our dog today apbt breed my son took his dog a stray he found wks ago to the vet today and they found heart worms after a blood test vet said it would be to treat my question is does the treatment injections sold at the feed store work if he is treated what are his chances of being cured does anyone know anything about this vet says he is about years old he gave him a distemper and a rabies shot today also the treatment protocol depends on the severity of infection in less severe cases the dog is treated for four months with a heartworm preventive to kill any migrating heartworm larvae and to decrease the size of the female worms then an injection of melarsomine is given to kill the adult heartworms five weeks later the dog is treated with two more injections of the adulticide four months after the treatment the dog should be tested for heartworms using the antigen test some animals may need to undergo a second round of injections at that time it is recommended that dogs remain on a monthly heartworm preventive during the treatment in severe cases it may be necessary to use the adulticide before the four months of heartworm preventive are given regardless of which drug is used when the adult heartworms die they can obstruct blood vessels to the lungs these are called pulmonary embolisms if only a small part of the lung is involved there may be no clinical signs however if the vessels to a large portion of the lung or a small area of an already diseased lung are blocked severe signs may result these include fever cough coughing up blood and even heart failure because of the risk of these embolisms any dog being treated with an adulticide must be kept very quiet during treatment and for weeks thereafter in very severe infestations adult worms are removed from the heart surgically Pneumonia Stroke Schistosomiasis Asthma Lung cancer Cancer Pulmonary embolism Atrial septal defect Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tuberculosis Urinary incontinence Diabetes mellitus Shock Group A streptococcal infection AIDS Traumatic brain injury Prostate cancer Myocardial infarction Ascariasis Aspergillosis Intravenous therapy Multiple sclerosis Colorectal cancer Cystic fibrosis Hypertension Common cold Rocky Mountain spotted fever Bone marrow transplant Medicine Acne Aortic dissection Trichinosis Acute respiratory distress syndrome Atherosclerosis Pulmonary hypertension Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome First aid Sickle-cell disease Bronchitis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Lupus erythematosus Emphysema Malignant melanoma Blood pressure HIV test Anemia Hepatitis C Hip fracture Allergy Pet skunk Ehrlichiosis Cephalic disorder Diseases of the honeybee Ulcerative colitis Anthrax Hypoglycemia Cocaine Breast cancer Psoriasis Coronary heart disease Crohn's disease Folic acid HIV Growth hormone treatment Sleep apnea Mosquito Aneurysm Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Migraine Radiation therapy Chlorpromazine Obstetrics Diabetic retinopathy Insulin Cardiovascular disease Chagas disease Stem cell Bone fracture Cirrhosis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Fancy rat Baylisascaris Lethal injection Ferret Abortion Congestive heart failure Chronic fatigue syndrome Osteoporosis Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Syphilis
