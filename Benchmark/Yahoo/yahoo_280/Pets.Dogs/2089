how to stop the dog from using my hands as toys okay so my sister has a one year old yorkie and since he was a puppy i've played this little game with him in which i muff his hair and then kinda swing my hands around his head he makes attempts to bite them but i'm too quick it's cute cause he tries so hard okay no harm in the little game or whatever but now whenever i put my hands toward him he tries to bite them no matter is i'm ready to play or just trying to pet his head i've tried saying no kody don't bite me or i'm not playing right now but he won't listen my tone of voice is stern but he just wags his tail and keeps snapping at me even is i'm just sitting on the floor and my hand is resting he'll come by and nip at them it doesn't hurt or anything i just get tired of saliva on my hands is there anything i can do to break him out of the little game or teach him when it's over i hate to break it to you but this is all your fault you taught him this game and now he wants you to play it with him yorkies are very very energetic so you need to teach him that biting you is not what you want first kody is a dog he doesn't speak english nor does he truly understand what you are tring to say to him he does have a loose concept but he does not understand you second you have to break him of this game when he tries to nip at your hands get taller than him sit up straight and say no he does understand that if he tries it again you repeat the same actions but add a smack on the nose or butt doesn't have to be hard just enough to stun him and make him think he messed up most of all you have to remain consistent with this do not allow him to start the biting game again because clearly he doesn't know when to stop to keep a good play relationship with him you can offer him balls and chew toys for you and him to fight over this can always be a fun game with a yorkie Dog training Volleyball Aerial (dance move) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Kodocha Dog Vegeta Tenshinhan Snooker Shaggy dog story Non-native pronunciations of English Fast bowling Singlish 2000 Australian Grand Prix Yorkshire Terrier Swingout Textile manufacturing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Late Night with Conan O'Brien Table tennis American football strategy Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Housebreaking Diving Characters in the Smurfs Drill bit True Crime: Streets of LA The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Great Teacher Onizuka Social rule Past teachings of Prem Rawat Milton H.
