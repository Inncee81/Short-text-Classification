boxer pup was fully house trained at weeks of age by following simple housetraining tips like these from scottee meade housetraining is a universal problem with a simple solution these tips will help you train your puppy or older dog to eliminate outdoors good health is essential make sure your puppy or dog is healthy before undertaking housetraining intestinal parasites are the most common cause of inappropriate defecation bladder infections are a frequent cause of inappropriate urination if you suspect a bladder problem have a urine sample checked symptoms of bladder infection include frequent urination of small amounts unproductive straining or licking of private parts feed your puppy a good quality puppy food avoid over feeding or making sudden changes in his diet both can cause diarrhea another common problem arises when a dog has been given steroids to treat a bee sting or allergic reaction steroids usually increase the dog s water intake and urine output scheduling feed your puppy on a fairly regular schedule three times a day allow minutes for each meal and remove the leftovers after that time maintaining a feeding schedule helps predict output schedule your puppy s trips outdoors the average puppy needs frequent opportunities to eliminate start first thing in the morning with a trip outside as soon as your puppy awakens puppies feel the call of nature about every hour when they are awake and playing they need to go out soon after eating and after drinking water by the age of or weeks the average healthy puppy can sleep through the night if your puppy has an accident examine the schedule and make adjustments to prevent future accidents confinement one of the most valuable tools in housetraining is the dog crate intended to be used like a baby s playpen or crib the crate keeps the puppy safely confined when no one is available to supervise her crating prevents accidents for the normal puppy because her instinct to keep her nest clean is very strong crating also prevents her from destroying your treasured possessions while she is teething or injuring herself by chewing on or ingesting something harmful your puppy should be crated at night while you are asleep and any other time you cannot supervise his activities this includes times when you are on the phone or in the shower or doing anything that prevents you from paying full attention to your puppy he should have an opportunity to go outside every time you let him out of his crate training every time you take your puppy outside give her plenty of cues as you walk out the door with her say let s go outside take her to her spot and repeat your cue phrase as she is about to eliminate be sure to use a phrase that does not come up in every day conversation avoid cues such as be a good dog in favor of something more specific such as go when she goes praise her enthusiastically and reward her with a very small food treat right there on the spot after several repetitions of this routine your puppy will learn to eliminate on cue very useful in bad weather or strange places and learn that eliminating outside is more fruitful than eliminating inside after a week of this continue to praise the puppy every time she goes outside but reward with food on a more random basis in a couple of weeks you won t need the food reward at all accidents if you find an accident clean it up and consider adjusting your puppy s schedule to prevent another accident punishing your puppy only teaches him to be wary of you if you catch him in the act and punish or correct him he will learn to eliminate when you aren t looking which will defeat your training program if you should see your puppy circling as if he has to go gently remind him to go outside and help him get to his spot where he can earn praise and a reward accidents happen most frequently in the morning or evening when the puppy is out playing with the family it is easy to become so involved in an activity that you forget that the puppy hasn t been outside in an hour if this is the case find a way to remind yourself such as setting a kitchen timer or alarm clock patience unrealistic expectations are a frequent cause of problems in housetraining on average the bladder brain connection is not fully formed until the puppy is about months old if a young puppy does go to the door and ask to go out his need is immediate he must go out right away some dogs never learn to ask to go out while others learn quickly to go to the door and sit or bark or ring a bell some dogs learn to use a dog door easily and go out whenever they feel the urge the best way to ensure success is to stick to a schedule long enough for the puppy s body to adapt to it and get in the habit of eliminating at particular times neuter or spay if you are not planning to enter your dog in conformation competition neutering or spaying helps ensure successful housetraining neutered males still lift their legs but are less inclined to mark their territory including the priceless antique chair legs and the floor length drapes they are also less prone to certain cancers and prostate problems that can lead to accidents in older dogs unspayed females ovulate twice a year on average for several weeks before and during the heat cycle they are more prone to mark territory they are also more vulnerable to bladder problems that can lead to accidents paper training is not housetraining teaching your puppy to eliminate indoors on newspaper does not lead to success in housetraining dogs are place oriented and once taught to go in a particular place on a particular surface will continue to do so careless newspaper readers are liable to reach for a section they left on the floor only to find it has been used by the family dog if you must confine your puppy for more than six or eight hours at a time or if you live in a high rise apartment with a small dog consider using a litter box for your dog a plastic under the bed storage container lid removed filled with bark mulch will serve this purpose very well the mulch absorbs urine odors and smells and feels like outside you can confine your puppy in a small room such as a bathroom with a baby gate giving him enough room for a comfy bed his water dish and his mulch box this approach works well for young puppies and very elderly dogs with health problems and is less likely to interfere with your efforts to train your dog to eliminate outside best of luck Customs and etiquette of Japan Toilet humour Dairy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
