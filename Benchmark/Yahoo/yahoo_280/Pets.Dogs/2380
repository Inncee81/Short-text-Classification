can my puppy be poisoned from mold my month old pitbull puppy has explosive diarrhea i looked at his food which i keep in a cabinet and it has white mold in it i wasn't seeing it when i put in it his bowl but it was bad when i was looking down in the bag could this be poisoning him i'm hoping i can get an answer before i am able to call the vet in the morning he's not vomiting or dehydrated and he's acting normal his diarrhea is just awful he's a big boy so there's a ton of it highly unlikely mold is a normal part of the outdoors so your puppy is unlikely to be harmed to any great degree you know how abandoned dogs go through trash to get their food well your house probably isn't as bad as a garbage can i imagine that puppies are more sensitive to this though the puppies i've had in my life all of them got diarrhea at one point or another Dog Diarrhea Guinea pig Toilet humour Housebreaking Vomiting 101 Dalmatians: The Series Dehydration Plastic Fox hunting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Stomach cancer Sick Puppy Hamster Dustbin Animal testing Shaggy dog story Chocolate Socialization Beethoven (film) Dog training Fancy rat Atkins Nutritional Approach Classified information Theory of conduct Poison Ron and Fez Air pollution Poker jargon Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Tea Chemical warfare Domestic rabbit Canine parvovirus Static Shock Characters in the Smurfs Foodborne illness Sulfasalazine Food allergy Rotavirus GIR (Invader Zim) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Coeliac disease Norway national football team Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Skinny Puppy Charles Darwin's illness Casting "Weird Al" Yankovic Fecal incontinence Campylobacteriosis Milk Clifford's Puppy Days Nutrition Garfield Norwalk virus group Zoophilia Futurama (TV series - season 1) Docking Vitamin C W.I.T.C.H.
