puppy chews on bone on our clothes my mo old mixed puppy likes to chew her bones on our clothes i dont understand why i hear its her being dominate is that true everytime we giver her a treat or bone she goes straight to a piece of clothing sitting on the floor and lays on it and chews away our dog takes everything to her bed to chew toys bones toilet rolls anything that gets 'lost' that is the first place we look i don't think it is a dominance issue but more of where she feels comfortable and close to you her pack does she have her own bed she really does need her own space our dogs have always used their beds as a time out space even our babies knew that when the dog is in her bed she has to be left alone try sleeping with an old towel for a few days and then putting it in her bed this may do the trick in encouraging her to take her bones there just make sure there is nothing lying around for her to find instead Dog training Housebreaking Hamster Fancy rat Aerial (dance move) Dog Menstrual cup Crate training Topps The Shining (film) EastEnders Massage Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Customs and etiquette of Japan Professional wrestling match types Sento Mixed martial arts Milton H.
