english bulldog eye problem question i noticed about days ago that my english bulldogs left eye started to look droopy like he couldn't open it all the way i looked at it i couldn't see any trauma or cut to it a day later as i was looking at him he was look at me back the same left eye looked cocked eye like it was looking away as the other eye looked straight at me anyone know what that is or what may be going on eye conditions bulldogs are are prone to several eye conditions the most common is known as cherry eye or more properly called prolapse of the gland of the nictitans this appears as a red swollen mass appearing out of the inside corner of the eye the function of this gland is to make tear fluid the correct method for repairing this problem is to replace the gland back to its proper position keratitis sicca also known as dry eye results from not enough tear fluid production a dry eye often becomes infected and develops a black pigment across the cornea and can result in blindness if left untreated cyclosporine drops is the most commonly prescribed treatment opthalmologists believe that an increase in dry eye occurs when cherry eyes are cut out instead of repaired entropion ectropion is the rolling in rolling out of the upper and lower eyelids this is commonly an inherited problem the result is that hairs rub on the eyes and cause irritation resulting in corneal ulcers scratches these are best repaired surgically to correct the respective problem ectopic cilia dystichia are hairs that grow out from along the eyelid margins or from within the conjunctiva of the eye these can cause irritation and corneal ulcers these can be treated either with cryosurgery or laser surgery it is not uncommon to need several treatments to resolve the problem Eye Gonorrhoea Radiation therapy Cornea LASIK Contact lens Refractive surgery Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Traumatic brain injury Acne Cornea transplant Cancer Glaucoma Keratoconus Eye surgery Growth hormone treatment Photorefractive keratectomy Rabies Urinary incontinence Sj__gren's syndrome Aortic dissection Iris (anatomy) Hair Medicine Penis Welding Hemorrhoid Abortion Psoriasis Organ transplant Retinal detachment Ulcerative colitis Carpal tunnel syndrome Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Common cold Orthopedic surgery Tears Dog Multiple sclerosis Chalazion Face Pneumonia Acromegaly Ectopic pregnancy Tattoo Insulin Cat Crohn's disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Professional wrestling throws Chemotherapy Red eye (medicine) Dandruff Intraocular lens Ulcer Cardiac arrhythmia Carnivorous plant Intersex surgery Diarrhea Fecal incontinence Ophthalmology Mitral valve prolapse Cirrhosis Amblyopia Puberty Wound healing phases Dialysis Cephalic disorder Intravenous therapy Eyelid Stomach cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diabetic retinopathy Eye examination Folic acid Medical analysis of circumcision Acute respiratory distress syndrome Stroke Turner syndrome Brain tumor Hip fracture Cellulitis Guinea pig Scar Spina bifida Tocopherol Baldness treatments Coeliac disease Group A streptococcal infection Floater Graves-Basedow disease Blood Professional wrestling aerial techniques
