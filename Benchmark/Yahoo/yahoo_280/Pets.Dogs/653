i got a rat terrior puppy what should i expect any behavial stuff a six week old female rat terrior we are getting its shots so we don't need to worry bout that are there any other things i need to know about rat terrior puppies sorry about all the superior types talking down to you i had wonderful years with my rat terriers scarlet o'terrier and melanie whelps and i just went into it with good intentions crate training was successful with my two we were students at the time and when we were not home they snoozed in their comfortable crate and the minute we got home we took them outside and praised them when they eliminated outside in an appropriate spot i never leave a dog free to roam the house while all the humans are out if we are going to be gone long enough to necessitate a break i would have someone come in or use a kennel the one thing i woud have done differently would have been to attend better to their teeth when they were young they ate dry food but by the time they were aged they had to eat canned food because their teeth were bad this breed needs more cleaning scaling and toothbrushing than larger breeds they were good girls eager to please scarlet could not help herself around small trash cans she had to pull them over and scatter the contents so it was best she not roam the house unattended she was built thin like a greyhound even though she was only pounds she was so fast she almost caught a rabbit a couple of times melanie weighed the same and she just lived to be with me no matter if i was studying or doing laundry she would follow me and hang out if i barked at her she barked back i think they were happier because we had two they were littermates and they were together almost their entire years they were so small they were not any more trouble than one dog they were very healthy but i would recommend regular checkups sure it was a commitment but i found them to be loving and fun and not too high maintenance congratulations Dog training Dog Housebreaking Fancy rat Hamster American Pit Bull Terrier Tooth Labrador Retriever Mixed-breed dog Cairn Terrier Spice Girls Whippet Rat Terrier Jack Russell Terrier Domestic rabbit Crate training Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Fox hunting Garfield Yorkshire Terrier Cat Guinea pig Shetland Sheepdog Border Terrier American Kennel Club Neighbours Felis sapiens Dobermann Tenterfield Terrier German Shepherd Dog Terrier Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Textile manufacturing Keeshond Fox Terrier Toy dog Staffordshire Bull Terrier Bull Terrier Iditarod Miniature Fox Terrier Lady and the Tramp Airedale Terrier Breed standard Welsh Terrier Taboo food and drink Boston Terrier Alaskan husky Breed club Dachshund Maltese (dog) Cruising (maritime) Tooth enamel Basset Hound Skye Terrier Nutrition Chinchilla Minor Harry Potter Beasts Australian Silky Terrier Sin City Spidey Super Stories Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Theory of conduct The Family from One End Street Pit bull Philip J.
