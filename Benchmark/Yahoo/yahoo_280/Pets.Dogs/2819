i need another advice please okay my previous question was asking gow to housebreak a dog many people told me to use the crate method i have no idea how to do that and also one person told me to keep her in a crate till i got home well i still go to school and thats hours a day i dnt feel right to leave her in a crate for hours a day what should i do you have options crate her for hours or let her roam the house for hours first of all they'd really rather be in a crate confined to one area than to hve the 'run of the house' cause having all of that freedom and room can actually make a dog pretty nervous when you put her in the kennel before school make sure the last things you do before you walk out the door is get her to go potty and put her in her crate don't talk to her in a squeaky voice like 'i'm sorry i have to be gone for so long but i'll hurry home ' that makes them nervous too just be matter of fact sounding about it when you tell her goodbye you may have to practice that before you try it on her for real but here's the thing she needs a couple of toys she likes in with her first make sure the crate has a blanket in it so she's comfy also if you've noticed her with a 'special' toy put that in with her then this will be her favorite get a kong do you know what that is if not go to the doggy toy aisle at walmart or whereever you will see a kong it's made of super hard rubber so they can chew on it forever and not do much damage to it you'll see it has a little hole on one end and a big hole on the other end in that big hole put a couple of treats in it for her but ones that are big enough they won't fall out kind of shove themdown in there and when you leave she'll be busy playing with the kong trying to get the treats out if she doesn't respond to it at first put a bit of peanut butter inside of it so her tongue can get it and she'll get the hang of it good luck Dog training Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Theory of conduct Johnny 5 Strap-on dildo The Shining (film) RuneScape quests Garfield The Price Is Right Big Brother UK series 6 Kodocha Ed, Edd n Eddy Reservoir Dogs Milton H.
