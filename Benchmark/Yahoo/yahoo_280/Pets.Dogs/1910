how long does it usaully take for a puppy to learn and respond to his name i just came up with his name fiji he is two weeks old how long should it take oh and how should i go about teaching him his name should i just say it over and over or should i only say it once and awhile two weeks old wow dogs learn their names faster if you just talk to them a lot this also builds up their total vocabulary you don't have to say his name in every sentence just tell him what you're doing say it when you cradle him make up little songs and hums with his name in them tell him stories where he's the hero definitely definitely say his name when something good is going to happen when he's older that could be dinnertime or playtime conversely do not use his name when he's in trouble or for anything unpleasant like getting his nails trimmed at two weeks he's too young to really 'get' the call and response thing but once he leaves the nest and begins exploring you should be able to start him on that they have a strong following instinct right up until they're about three months old use this to get a great head start on the recall kneel sweet talk him and when he looks at you say his name when he comes say it a lot while you fuss over him say it every time you say good boy too by the time you start leash training him he should have it down but leashes and walks will be a new thing in themselves with all that goes on on a walk he may need reinforcement practice the recall with him dragging the leash behind him do it inside then outside in a quiet place then outside with distractions a hint if he runs off dogs usually look back over their shoulders to see if you're following them when your dog does this take off running in the other direction he'll think you've spotted something more exciting and come galloping after you to see what it is that's when encouraging the follower instinct really pays off pretty name btw Dog training Obedience training Housebreaking Dog Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scenes from a Memory Time Out of Mind Dog agility Humphrey Bogart The Death Gate Cycle Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests She Loves You 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Catcher in the Rye Singlish Billboard Hot 100 Horse The Lovely Bones Kodocha Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Sharon Tate Pitaten Paranoia Agent Hamster Spidey Super Stories The Pet Sounds Sessions About a Boy 1957 World Series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Extreme Programming Calvin and Hobbes Nine Inch Nails Pet Sounds Cliff Richard Back to the Future timeline Slow Train Coming The Shining (film) Marilyn Monroe Feral child Megan Griffin Scientology beliefs and practices Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Horse gait AFI 100 Years series Sailing Sex Pistols The Apprentice 2 Limp Bizkit Blonde on Blonde The Inside The Silence of the Lambs Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Nintendogs Traumatic incident reduction Breastfeeding The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sin City Chinglish Karl Rove Spot the Dog The Body (Short Story) Aladdin (1992 film) Francis Bacon (painter) Otello Dog collar G-Man (Half-Life) Buddy Guy Ben Johnson (athlete) Piccolo Junior Saga The Ashlee Simpson Show Ayrton Senna Theory of conduct Neckbreaker Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Boards of Canada K' Computer-assisted language learning Musical Canine Freestyle Professional wrestling holds Datalore (TNG episode) Contredanse Kitesurfing Alan Arnett McLeod Glossary of partner dance terms Airplane!
