why are you here in yahoo dogs just curious as to why some of you are here how did you find yahoo dogs do you think you help people or do you think it's a game i'm here because after years of showing and breeding golden's i felt i had some experiences and help to offer other folks ok let me add more to my question what makes you keep coming back never did i think i would get so may responces i'm at a lost for word to express how impressed i am with all of them some times the simplest question can open up a wondeful door to let everyone see and learn many things i feel like a student and you all are my teaches i learn something new here every day something i didn't know thay's why i come back that's why i answer questions thank you all so very much i saw a link one time for yahoo answers the question was from nacy pelosi yea right probably one of her aides on nuclear power i teach chemistry and we were on nuclear chem so i entered the site and thought it was fabulous at first it took me a few weeks to realize there were categories and that i could switch between them i should really work on my reading skills eh i saw dogs and entered simply because i was curious what kinds of questions would there be what kind of environment would it be what kind of answers would there be i found a lot of questions about things that i have dealt with directly with my dogs am i an expert no not by any means everyday i learn something new about what works with my dogs and what doesn't every day on every walk i deem it training time after reading answers from a lot of you dp dobie shepherdgirl darlyn goldengal i realize that i am in the minority i have found that a lot of people on yahoo answers want a quick fix it's fast food mentality for their dogs my dog pees in the house how do i fix it as if there is some magical conversation you could have with your dog to simply explain why they aren't supposed to be in the house i have learned over the years with my dogs that training never ends they are like kids in order to foster a behaviour in dog or child there must be reinforcement of some kind let's not argue over which please i got a dog and from day one i never wanted to be the kind of owner that had an obnoxious ill mannered spoiled brat of a dog but it is work through reading countless books dealing with my dogs pit mixes watching a variety of shows cesar it's me or the dog and so on going to obedience classes with a trainer she has shown shelties and dobies and trains police dogs i feel that i do have some knowledge of things and simply what to share what has and has not worked for me after reading countless i want to breed my cutsie wootsie mutt with my neighbor's ten times bigger bulldog while i was always a proponent of it and after seeing the utube video on pet over population don't watch it unless you want to be so enraged or bawling your head off i am now a huge proponent of spaying and neutering your pets if more people did this alas i am attempting to either preach to the choir or wasting my breathe on ignorant uneducated people then pet overpopulation would not be an issue so fun frustration and help is why i am here Obedience training Dog training Dog Philosophy of language Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Milton H.
