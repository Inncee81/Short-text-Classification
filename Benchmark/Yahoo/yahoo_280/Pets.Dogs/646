does anyone have a newfoundland i currently have no pets but i have had two past dogs my last one was a golden black lab mix and was a great companion i think i am interterested because newfies remind me of my last dog and i have heard they are very loving i am prepared to be a dog person and am not worried about the shedding or exercising i am just interested in your opininions i do that is my bronze newfie pup next to my saint bernard pup newfoundlands are great dogs not only do i own one but i foster a few yearly helped whelp several litters and will be welcoming another newf into our family in the next few months i will glady give you my two cents about this wonderful breed i work with and am a member of the newfoundland club of new england http www newfclubne org index php my close friend is a breeder and has been for years i have helped her whelp many litters and have recently began key word to learn the in and out of showing and hope to show alongside my friend newfs are awesome dogs i really cannot say enough good things about them however they have many health issues genetic and do not have a long life expectancy because of their size like any large breed they also need to go to obediance classes because of their size and strengh and the breed tends to be difficult to train i also tell people you absolutely need a sense of humor when you own a newfie not only do they love to get dirty love to get wet and drool but they will also push your buttons to see how far they can get you to go they are very intelligent so they can be challneging to train instead of just listening to the command you give they actually think about it before doing it so you need a patient and firm hand the key is being consistant and establishing pack roles from early on also like any large breed more expensive to feed more expensive vet bills more expensive flea tick and heartworm prevention and more exercise a few of my foster newfies are on two heartworm preventatives and two flea tick topicals a month because of their size it really adds up and quick the only advice i can give you is to find your local newfoundland breed club and go to different events see as many newfoundlandcs as you can talk to as many owners as you can and please do a lot of research to find a responsible and reputable breeder ask a ton of questions ask for references and actually call educate yourself you would hate to purchase a newfie puppy from a mill broker backyard breeder and end up having to pay for hip surgery by the age of one i have seen this time and time again with this breed at my work the breed is notorious for hip and elbow dysplasia make sure the breeder is affliated with the akc and the newfoundland club of america they are quite strict with breeder regulations go to the link i supplied you with lots of info good luck in your search here are some useful websites http www ncanewfs org education pdfs looking for a puppy pdf http www dogbreedinfo com newfoundland htm http en wikipedia org wiki newfoundland dog http www ncanewfs org index shtml http www canismajor com dog newf html http www akc org breeds newfoundland index cfm note nedra aww your babies must be beautful my first dog was a gp i miss him everyday he lived to be give your dogs a hug from me Mixed-breed dog Labrador Retriever Newfoundland (dog) German Shepherd Dog Golden Retriever Obedience training Keeshond American Pit Bull Terrier Cat Docking Havanese American Kennel Club Domestic rabbit Basset Hound Pet skunk Border Collie Dog training Belgian Shepherd Dog Dog breed Uniform Resource Locator Gray Wolf Dobermann Newfie Puppy mill English Springer Spaniel Heartworm Hip dysplasia Whippet Guinea pig Ferret Fancy rat Dog agility World Wide Web Breed registry Microsoft Horse Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Working dog German Shorthaired Pointer HyperText Transfer Protocol Jack Russell Terrier Housebreaking Newfoundland Agriculture Autism Social rule Fox hunting Infantilism Hip hop culture Australian Shepherd American Eskimo Dog Border Terrier Wikipedia Alaskan Malamute Tibetan Mastiff EastEnders Mattress Beagle Nintendogs Bernese Mountain Dog Garfield Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Legal research Ajax (programming) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Toy Fox Terrier Domain Name System Royal Assent Joke Phishing Hip hop collaborations The Ashlee Simpson Show Pit bull Wal-Mart BitTorrent Tick Linked list Rat Terrier RuneScape quests Finnish Spitz Spyware Aphasia Schutzhund Biodiesel B3ta Hearing impairment Scooby-Doo Web page
