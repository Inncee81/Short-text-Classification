can dogs be taught to not like one color in specific red i've been thinking about teaching my dog not to like the color red for some personal reasons and his own safety is there some way to teach my german shepherd x collie mix to not like red and favor the color blue even if dogs might see in black and white i heard they can see blue and if they see in black and white all colors must not look the same some must be darker than others i know it works because my friend taught her dogs to despise the color red on anything and my guy friend's dog hated the color blue so much if he dropped something blue like a blue bandana the dog would immediately step on it and tear it to shreds can someone tell me how to do the same i'm a veterinarian i think you can but what do i know i started yesterday but i really think they can only do black gray and white Dog Blue German Shepherd Dog Color theory Border Collie Dobermann Color Mixed-breed dog Australian Shepherd Iris (anatomy) Aes Sedai Roan (color) Wassily Kandinsky Dragon Booster Eye color Iditarod Collie Judo CMYK color model Color space Fancy rat Paul Is Dead Color Graphics Adapter Smooth Collie Primary color Piet Mondrian Heterochromia Hair color Veterinarian Double Dragon Gray Wolf Koi Light-emitting diode Black Hot dog White Reservoir Dogs Formula One regulations Garnet Labrador Retriever Gamut Political colour Tai shogi Satchel Paige Sega Saturn Melanin Color printing NWo Shetland Sheepdog Korea Jindo Dog Red Technicolor Willie Nelson African American Cheetah Steven Wright Black (people) Vehicle registration plate 2005 Iditarod Australian Cattle Dog Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Food coloring Docking Rei Ayanami Crow Chicago Cubs Redneck Chicago White Sox White (people) RGB color model Herding dog Super Mario Bros. 2 Taikyoku shogi CIE 1931 color space Obedience training Qualia YUV Eric Cartman Racing flags Paleoclimatology Sesshomaru Rose The Adventures of Tintin Airedale Terrier Working dog Pysanka Australian Kelpie School bus SMPTE color bars Power Rangers Gray (horse) James McNeill Whistler Dai dai shogi Atari 8-bit family The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) German car number plates Keeshond Tenjiku shogi
