my month old mix is in heat its about time i am and i have always wanted to raise puppies i just never had the time i have been waiting since i adopted her to have puppies i noticed she was in heat this morning so i put her in my neighbors backyard with his male german shephard she is a small dog maybe pounds how many pups can i expect to have her first time and what should be my asking price for my pups i have never done this before if the german shephard is such a bad idea my other neighbor has a doberman i could put her in with i really hope she doesnt have any complications because i cannot afford vet bills or vaccines i may spay her if there is any moola left over from the pups my grandfather said that after they are born instead of giving them vaccines i should get them chewing tobacco to rid them of worms does this actually work you should not mix your smaller dog with a large breed the puppies will be too big for her to give birth too and you may end up having to have surgery to get the pups out because your dog is a mix and you are mating her with another different breed it would be hard for you to ask for any amount of money if she is already pregnant i would just stick to finding your puppies a good home Dog training Dog Guinea pig Dobermann Pet skunk Gray Wolf Hamster Docking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Golden Retriever Cat Nerpa Great Dane Rabies Ferret Taikyoku shogi Puppy mill Socialization Poker jargon Babe Ruth Garfield American Pit Bull Terrier Philip J.
