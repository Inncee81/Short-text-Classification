what is the best way to stop a min pin from barking he is still only a puppy weeks so i'm not going to put any kind of collar on him barking is a perfectly natural dog behavior birds sing frogs croak and a dog barks whines and howls if you have a dog you better expect some barking whining or howling it is unrealistic and unfair to think you can train your dog to stop barking altogether however you your neighbors and your dog will all be much happier if the barking is under control dogs who are socially isolated or confined for long periods without supervised exercise need some outlet for their pent up energy a dog who is left alone all day is likely to take up barking as a hobby because no one is there to control him in no time at all barking becomes an enjoyable habit and for many dogs once they start barking they tend to continue barking for the sheer fun of it your dog may be barking excessively because you unintentionally trained her to do so poochie speaks and you obey woof and you open the door to let puppy out woof and you open it again to let her in woof and she gets a treat woof for a tummy rub you get the picture your dog has learned to get attention through barking it is easy to fall into this trap because the very nature of barking gets your attention for the same reason it is easy to forget to praise and reward your dog when she is not barking the first step in obtaining peace and quiet is to realize that lots of barking is caused by the dog being lonely bored frustrated or frightened these are all situations that you can help to alleviate a well exercised happy dog is more likely to sleep all day while you are not home spend time playing with training and exercising your dog obedience training is great mental exercise thinking is a tiring activity for dogs as it is for humans most dogs really enjoy a rapid paced exciting game of come here sit heel sit heel down stay come here for hugs a massage a celebration of praise and treats don't allow training to be a boring tedious routine if your dog lives in the back yard most of the time she probably needs social exercise she needs walks around the neighborhood so she can investigate all the sounds and smells that tantalize her while she is in the yard bring her into the house when you are home she needs to feel that she is part of your family having a large yard is not equal to having a well exercised dog you may see your dog dashing madly around your yard but he is not exercising he is doing the doggy equivalent of pacing fidgeting or other human forms of nervous activity provide your dog with fun things with which to occupy himself such as a digging pit or special chew toys dogs are social animals they need friends and companionship take your dog to the same dog park daily or weekly and let her make doggy friends dogs romping around and playing together tire rapidly and will sleep happily while recovering from the good hardy play session Dog Obedience training Housebreaking Carl Barks Cat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 101 Dalmatians: The Series Humphrey Bogart Bark (dog) Traumatic incident reduction The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Crate training Alaskan husky The Apprentice 2 Marching band Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
