my dog was house trained but now not so much my month old heeler will just go and pee in the kitchen then ask to be taken out to finish her business of course when i catch her in the act i scold her and give her a little tap on the nose then carry her outside the problem is that she was very well trained before i mean i never had a concern that she would go in the house anyone know why this is happening and how to change it i used to crate her at night but since she was trained to well i would leave to door to her crate open at night she would sleep in it with no accidents but now she pees in the kitchen at night but not only at night she does it all the time i really think she just wants to pee all over my new floor lol maybe she doent like the color first off throughly clean all areas soiled with an enzyme cleaner not an ordinary household cleaner so the dog isn't drawn back to resoil it and restart potty training over whenever the dog is in the house and not crated put a body harness and leash on the dog tie end of leash to your belt wherever you go the dog goes when you see the dog start to signal sniff circle scratch that it's got to go than run the dog out to where you want it to go praise reward immediately and use a command word consistently when the dog shows it's learned to go outside consistently by dragging you to the outside than you can undo the leash from your belt keep the leash on the dog still and keep an eye on it whenever it is in the house and not crated so if it starts to make an accident you can grab the leash and run it outside once it is going outside with no attempted accidents for at least a week than you can take the leash off the most common mistake in potty training is giving the dog freedom to roam the house without supervision where the human doesn't see the dog signal it needs to go Dog training Housebreaking Crate training Obedience training Aerial (dance move) Ferret Futurama (TV series - season 5) Dog Cat Dog agility Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling match types Kitesurfing Drill bit 2005 Iditarod Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling holds RuneScape quests Jam (TV series) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kitchen Humphrey Bogart City of Heroes Pitaten StarCraft: Uprising Piccolo Junior Saga 24 Hours of Le Mans Paranoia Agent Tenshinhan Fancy rat Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Drag racing Dilbert Eastern Illinois University Glossary of American football Apollo 8 Winning Streak Phoebe Halliwell Alan Arnett McLeod Signs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Indianapolis 500 The Canine Mutiny Kurt Angle The Death Gate Cycle Leash Toilet The Shining (film) Fiddler on the Roof Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Professional wrestling aerial techniques Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Fox hunting Cerberus Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Beer Hall Putsch Tag Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Ben Johnson (athlete) Vacuum cleaner The Amber Spyglass The Human Stain Swingout Parachuting InuYasha (character) Scuba set Charles Peace Heinkel He 112 Animal communication Smallville (Season 4) Mattress Shawn Michaels Diving Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Boy Scouts of America Leon White Horse Frogman Dog show The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Dog collar Strap-on dildo The Brady Bunch Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Combine (Half-Life 2) Breaker Morant Hell's Kitchen (television) Pug Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Poker jargon The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Formula One regulations Sumo Escape from New York Cheating in poker
