i wan't a dog but my dad won't let me hey guys i've always wanted a dog all my life and when i went to secondary school my mum promised me one but i am going on holiday soon so i really want a dog after that or next year there is this really cute dog yorkshire terrier which is quite cheap and is in my town thing where i live but the thing is my dad dosen't want a dog and i just want to let him know that he won't have to do the work and stuff but what i am excited about is that my nan and grandad have a dog so we are looking after the dog for nearly a month so i hope i can persuade him but has anyone got any sentsible answers to persuade my dad thanks x hey its really hard to change your dads mind but when you have your nan and grandads dog for a month he might begin to love having a little dog around the house and when the dog goes he might want another one just tell him that there are other people in the house who would do the work and it wouldnt be him half the time but you also need to think about going to work and school in the daytime who would be there for that dog to feed it would there always be someone apart from you who would be prepared after a long hard day to walk this dog dogs are a lot of money and time but i am sure they are worth all of it Hey Jude Game show Shaggy dog story The Adventures of Pete & Pete Time Out of Mind Social rule Billboard Hot 100 Obi-Wan Kenobi Doug EastEnders Garfield Dog Ren and Stimpy Dog training About a Boy W.
