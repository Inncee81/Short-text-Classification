i just found out what the gov't did to shephards in iraq did you know i work at an animal shelter and a few of the girls keep up with government stuff the us government actually brought over over german shephards to iraq and used them as mine sniffing dogs and bomb dogs they put them out on mine fields to see if they'd get blown up as if that wasen't enough they took the remaining dogs lined them up and shot them to death because they didn't want them coming back to america i feel so bad about this my boyfriend is in the navy and i do try to support him but with stuff like this behind our backs i'm just not happy about it i teared up when they told me this did anybody else know about it they hid it well i'm not sure if it is true i sort of want to know that's just what they told me and i really hated to think it was true i'm not trying to be a snotty political type person i'm just concerned that's all do you realize how expensive one trained military dog is they spend thousands of dollars on one trained dog even an untrained working gsd with the potential to be a sentry or detection dog costs over a thousand dollars unfortunately mine and bomb detection is a dangerous line of work for humans and dogs alike some dogs do die or become so badly injured that the military's best option is to put them down but they are not shooting dogs that are worth thousands of dollars or blowing them up for fun i don't know where the girls got this information but i am certain that it is not true and that someone is just trying to stir up anti government sentiments not that they should need a rumor like that there are plenty of true things for the public to be upset about war dogs were not brought home from vietnam and there was a lot of public criticism and that was in an era where the troops had even fewer opportunities to communicate with loved ones back in the states but even in vietnam most of the dogs were turned over to vietnamese handlers rather than being put down dog handlers form a very close bond with their dogs if the government was needlessly destroying these dogs you bet we'd hear about it Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Schutzhund German Shepherd Dog Naval mine YuYu Hakusho Pitaten U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program The Amber Spyglass Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Shaggy dog story Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Land mine Sin City StarCraft: Uprising G-Man (Half-Life) Jane Fonda Avenue Q Kodocha Dog training The Lovely Bones The Inside Cosmic Era list of characters Good Morning, Vietnam Vegeta EastEnders Babe Ruth Sesshomaru Blood on the Tracks U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Strategic bombing Knots Landing Trench warfare The Death Gate Cycle The Dalek Invasion of Earth Jennifer Lopez Obedience training Chinese Civil War Second Battle of the Atlantic Miss Saigon Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 Anti-aircraft warfare About a Boy Military history of the United States Working dog The Critic Pacifism Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Characters of Lost Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ranma __ characters Blood (computer game) Attack on Pearl Harbor Anderson Cooper God Emperor of Dune First Battle of the Atlantic Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Social rule The Invisibles Plame affair Time Out of Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Rent (musical) Iraq War Paranoia Agent Yom Kippur War Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War Theory of conduct Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II K' John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Weapons of mass destruction Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Hip hop collaborations Bomb disposal USS Hancock (CV-19) Make money fast Police dog Military of the United States Dog agility W.I.T.C.H.
