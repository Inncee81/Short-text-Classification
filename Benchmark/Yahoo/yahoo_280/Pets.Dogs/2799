my male dog does not like new female puppy hi we have a male dog that hates all other dogs if he sees one outside he barks and trys to get out thru the window i think it's physiological as he's been attacked twice by other dogs he is fine with the cats and has been ok with kittens we well the missus has now brought home a young puppy and the dog is going for her all the time any advice on how we can help them get along age that's the only solution in most cases when the puppy grows up it'll either calm down or the older dog will put it in it's place sometimes though the female younger dog will take charge though but that doesn't happen until much later i lived with a female whippit and a male cocker and the whippit is the dominant one just because she has more energy but the male isn't exactly comphortable with it he'll put her in line if it's necesary you dog's will form a bond just from living together and knowing the same commands don't stress too much this early just keep them seperated if it gets out of hand and don't yell at them they just get angrier at the other dog if you do Dog Dog training Housebreaking Socialization Crate training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ranma __ characters Lady and the Tramp Vegeta The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Shaggy dog story Dean Koontz Traumatic incident reduction Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Skinny Puppy YuYu Hakusho Ron Weasley Reservoir Dogs Piccolo Junior Saga Kim Possible Ron and Fez Clifford's Puppy Days Rottweiler Pet store Daria Gray Wolf Beethoven (film) The Marshall Mathers LP Morphology (linguistics) W.I.T.C.H.
