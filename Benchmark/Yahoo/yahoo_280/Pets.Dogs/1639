is it right to shove a puppy's face in poop and hit him i have a month puppy and is it ok when house trainning him to shove his face in the poop or pee and spank him while saying no or bad dog is it pet abuse or is it an actual efficent way to make him understand not to do that in the house i have a month puppy and is it ok when house trainning him to shove his face in the poop or pee and spank him while saying no or bad dog is it pet abuse or is it an actual efficent way to make him understand not to do that in the house just wanted to make clear i don't or have never done that but some people tell me to do it but i chose not to and instead ask once again i have not hit or mistreated my puppy in anyway just wanted some advice since i too did not believe it was the proper way to go about things that's why i am asking and listening instead of just doing it i have never hit or yelled at my puppy surely you must not be serious if you are serious about correctly effectively and humanely housebreaking your puppy what you describe is not the way it my eyes that is abusive and if you want your dog to fear you that's a good way to ensure that happens what you describe is what was in vogue for housebreaking puppies about years ago but now the best way to train a dog is with positive reinforcement if you want to really housetrain your puppy get your puppy a crate the right sized crate for your dog now the puppy should be able to stand up and turn around in it keep your puppy in the crate and it will whine or cry or alert you in some way when it needs to go out but you should take your dog outside especially when it is this age every minutes stay with your dog and when it pees or poops praise it like a crazy person very excitedly tell him yes good puppy and immediately give him a treat this will teach your puppy that he is being rewarded for doing something right and pleasing you all dogs want to please their people and when you give him a treat and praise him you are telling him that he is pleasing you if your puppy hasn't gone potty within minutes bring him back inside and back into his crate take him out again minutes later and repeat what you did earlier but do not punish him by yelling at him or telling him he is a bad dog if he doesn't potty if he has an accident in the house do not yell at him but clean up his mistake when he is not in the room when your puppy is out of the crate you can tether him to you with his leash and when you see him walking in circles or sniffing the floor immediately pick him up and take him outside and tell him go hurry up or go potty what ever key word you would like to use another thing you can do is tie some bells around your door and show your puppy how to touch them with his paws or nose which shows him how to alert you that he needs to go potty outside and each time you go outside with him make sure he touches the bells in some way feed your puppy at the same times every day so that you can begin to regulate his toileting behavior also monitor the amount of water he drinks and remember that puppies have very small bladders and have to urinate very frequently if you see that your puppy has had a drink of water take him right outside again and remember that what goes in has to come out within a very short period of time your puppy will know to alert you when he needs to go outside and will know that he has to potty outside and not in the house i got my puppy when he was weeks old and used this method to housetrain him he was housetrained within weeks and has only had the rare accident in the house the only time to yell no at your puppy is when you actually catch him in the act of having an accident inside and when that happens then immediately in a stern voice say no pick him up and take him outside and tell him to go potty outside spanking is abusive whether it's done to a human or an animal and is certainly not an effective way to create love trust or obedience if you spank your puppy at some point in time he will bite you so please don't yell at or spank your dog you want to create a special friendship and a long standing friendship wih your puppy treat your dog the way you'd treat your best friend you want your puppy to love respect and trust you not fear you love and enjoy your puppy and have great times together good luck with your puppy
