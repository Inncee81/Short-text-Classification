leaving dogs home alone what do you think so say someones at work all day for like hrs do you think its cruel to leave a dog home alone i'm not getting one or anything but just wondered what other people thought if u think its fine wot kind is gd to be left alone easy to house break and train and stuff hey i don't think it's mean at all but you have to show your dog that it's ok to be home alone and that you are not leaving him her for good and that you'll be back i have pom's my oldest is almost and my youngest is months and i'm almost home all day and night but i don't pay mind to them i let them have a good time and play with one another and walk them times a day that way if i do have things to do and have to step out i know that they have been walked and fed and they are not anxious and chewing on my couch dogs do that when they are bored teething anxiety etc so walking really helps them plus i think it's good when i do leave them for hours or so we don't get board of one another just like ppl get bored of one another lol so in conclusion i don't think it's mean at all people leave their dongs at home all the time just make sure you leave them with everything that they need like water chewy bone or something and pee pee pads toys and they will be happy and fine while you are gone Dog training Steven Wright The Star Wars Holiday Special Dog Lady Bouvier's Lover 1957 World Series Hey Jude The Apprentice 2 Social rule The McGuire Sisters Shaggy dog story Customs and etiquette of Japan The Ashlee Simpson Show Fancy rat USS Sea Dog (SS-401) The Cure Aerial (dance move) Hamster AFI 100 Years series Billboard Hot 100 The Catcher in the Rye Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Vladimir Peter Tytla Care Bears Toilet humour The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Shining (film) I Want to Hold Your Hand Babe Ruth Rich Mullins The Inside Cliff Richard Little Britain El Chavo del Ocho Who Shot Mr. Burns?
