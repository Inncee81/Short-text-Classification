did you know that pedigree dog food bought out nutro dog food and did you know that pedigree supports anti hunting and fishing by the way what do you think of hunting and fishing pedigree also supports lots of other things some good like dog shows and some bad like the california bill the links below have some more info if you like what do you think about all this http forum akccoonhounds org viewtopic php p sid ad b dac dc c c http www neapolitan org content view yes some of us are pretty upset about it i know talk was of boycotting the shows restaurants hotels and such in california and the eukanuba and pedigree championship and pedigree does westminster kc but i don't think it went far this is an on going 'drama ' seriously they say two things you never want to watch being made are sausages and laws maybe we just had to get to this point to have something that recognizes that hobby breeders are not the problem while at the same time trying to do something to control the dog and cat populations sure there are a lot of things you could say against the approach it creates more bureaucracy infringes people's rights unenforceable doesn't hit the commercial for profit puppy mills or brokers hard enough does not stop the mexican border from bringing over smuggled pets would actually encourage smuggled pets the whole thing is a mess only the responsible people will be paying the licenses while the others continue to do what they have been ignoring not paying dumping dogs because of fees etc scan through these sites you may have them already http www naiaonline org http www petpac net well the calif vet med association cvma after much protest from veterinarians withdrew their support and went to neutral http www petpac net ab disaster please note this will come up again january i received this response from senator jeff denham in response to my letter of opposition to ab i like this guy his district includes areas of san benito county and monterey county in a message dated a m pacific daylight time senator denham outreach senate ca gov writes july thank you for contacting me in opposition to assembly bill which would require the mandatory spaying neutering of cats and dogs to combat the overpopulation of stray animals i appreciate having the opportunity to respond to my constituents and their concerns ab has been put on hold until january this bill would tax responsible pet owners in order to enforce laws against irresponsible pet owners the hodge podge of registries allowed under this bill will lead to frustration and confusion for those responsible pet owners ab is a one size fits all program which does not work for each unique community since the number of dogs received by shelters has been cut in half and the number of dogs euthanized has declined by roughly seventy five percent currently local efforts to address pet over population are working while there is definitely room for improvement i don t see the radical approach of ab as the answer it is for these reasons that i will vote against this measure should it come before me again thank you for taking time to inform me of your views sincerely jeff denham senator th district i was so happy to read ab was shelved even tho temporarily from http www petconnection com blog california's mandatory spay neuter bill pulled by author for lack of votes july http www petconnection com blog flash californiaa mandatory spa y neuter bill to be shelved is there any way we could work on outlawing this sort of legislation or requiring it to be approved by a governing body such as akc cfa etc before being allowed to move forward this is an idea i've been mulling over for the last couple of weeks perhaps the list goddesses will permit us all to throw some suggestions out here and see where it goes we all know these anti pet bills are not going to stop even if ab does not pass next year there will be more one after the other in california and other states i have heard levine on radio and this am at the capital he says he wants input from breeders then give it to him he refused before my thought would be that every akc breed club and performance club designate a committee to propose legislation that will not suffocate the rights of responsible breeders if you think about it that would be a big voice other organizations that rely on purebred dogs could also be included i am proposing all clubs in all states yes monumental but also think of the members in numbers these club committees will represent in every state meetings could be held through a for responsible breeders legislation or committee group internet emails with legislative suggestions and voting the first thing is to get these committees set up and this is something we as individual members would have to approach our breed performance club board and make the request when i sent an email and fax in opposition to ab i represented me person i voiced my opinions and made suggestions at the same time when a club committee sends their proposed responsible breeder legislation in a letter they are representing every member in that club and the numbers will represent those members now we are talking monumental support for what we want i would hope the cat fancy would be on board as well responsible breeders are not the over population euthanasia shelter dog problem we know that this is something the supporters of this bill do not or will not understand give levine what we want with enough strength in a bill that will give them some of what they want i say some of because as long as the anti pet rights groups have the funding we will have to continue fighting each and every bill that is proposed and we may not win any with these committees set up they could if necessary continue to fight any anti pet legislation that will adversely affect responsible dog breeders thoughts many months ago when levine first introduced the bill and thought he would get it passed as a slam dunk quite a few people approached him but he wouldn't have anything to do with them now that he's on the ropes he's crying to the media that we won't work with him he is saying he wants to talk to us he's proven himself to be so arrogant opportunistic untrustworthy a liar and totally ignorant of animals that most of the people who were willing to work with him months ago are no longer willing to do so www cahealthypets com http www cahealthypets com word is that he levine is in his final term in his current office he plans a run of the senate after this he needs a vehicle to ride in on and he's looking to this as one of his vehicles to address the problems that people view as problems it's a politically correct stand save the poor animals in the shelter they should never get there wouldn't if we had msn we all know that it's hogwash but the general public believes the crap they are fed i heard on tonight's news that one local shelter will be offering free s n for pitbulls via a grant until the grant runs out they say about of the shelter dogs are pitt mixes of some type the shelter expressed disapointment that ab didn't pass but are moving on something they feel will be of benefit as they see it in the community we all need to stay vigilant and be part of the solution through education be proactive Cyprus dispute Government of Maryland Mixed-breed dog
