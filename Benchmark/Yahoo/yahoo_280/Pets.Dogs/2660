should i change his food hi there i've been feeding my month old bichon on hills science plan since he was weeks i know lots of people don't like it but he's always eaten it so i stuck with it now he's gone off it even if i mix in some chicken or gravy he just eats a little then leaves the rest should i persevere or change his food if so what to could it just be hot weather that's causing him not to eat much i'm in uk the most likely reason is that you are feeding him too much he should still be on the puppy mini puppy till he is twelve months old you should not have added anything else to his diet as it is likely to make him fussy if he has known nothing but hills since you had him he can not expect something new as dogs do not realise there is a choice of flavours or makes i would suggest that you feed him twice a day with hills alone and give him just five minutes in which to eat anything not eaten should be removed till next feed time if he is still playfull and active you dont need to worry he will eat when hungary Livestock MRE Chicken Breastfeeding Bread Domesticated turkey Cuisine of the Philippines Ramen French fries Taboo food and drink McDonald's Bengali cuisine Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Tofu Kodocha Vegetarianism Chocolate Botulism Korean cuisine Garfield Gregorian calendar Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of the Southern United States Atkins Nutritional Approach Little Shop of Horrors Curry Sandwich Fancy rat Buddhist cuisine Genetically modified food Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Malaysia Dairy Hamster Dog Little Britain Socialization Binge eating disorder Domestic rabbit Kitten Capercaillie Egg (food) Folic acid Healthy eating Natural Hygiene Boom Town (Doctor Who) Fish and chips Orca Veganism Insulin Trailer Park Boys Tooth Vegetarianism and religion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Novelty (locomotive) Maize Dieting Guinea pig Pot Noodle Soul food Elephant Obesity Nutrition RuneScape quests Omega-3 fatty acid Giant Panda Iditarod Hot dog Cuisine of Thailand Havanese Garlic Customs and etiquette of Japan Emotions (album) Tasmanian Devil Brewery Peruvian cuisine Cheese Housebreaking Street food Dim sum Albatross Frog Environmental vegetarianism Dog training John the Baptist Jewish cuisine Gypsy moth 2005 Iditarod Popeye Chopsticks Beetle Mid-Autumn Festival Super Size Me Ant Therion (band) Electrophysiology Skinny Puppy Tea
