toy fox terrier likes to dig and bury rawhide in my couch what else can i provide him with indoors to satisfy his need to dig and bury sometimes he hides it under the couch but i don't think he's happy with that because usually he walks around with the bone crying and whining and only puts it under the couch as a last resort please share any ideas that you may have that will simulate his natural need for this type of activity thanks in advance maybe a pile of blankets or towels rags my jrt used to do that but he would give up and just stick it in a shoe or my closet or some other place that it shouldn't be lol Jack Russell Terrier Comanche Fox Terrier Terrier Atlas Comics (1950s) Land mine The Shining (film) The Inside RuneScape quests The Cure Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Rawhide Homer vs. Dignity Frankie Laine Olduwan Co-Dependent's Day Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cannabis cultivation Papa's Got a Brand New Badge Minstrel show Customs and etiquette of Japan Phoebe Buffay's songs Who Shot Mr. Burns?
