dog walking when there are people around my shih tzu gracie is the most friendly dog on the block no matter what if a person comes in her eyesight she fastens her pace starts wagging her tail like crazy and won't stop if i try to make her still go where i walk she just runs in the direction of where the person is she has a harness so it doesn't choke her when she dose this but i think i'm more like abusing her just trying to get her to walk with me normally i'l just pick her up turn around the corner and set her down that used to work now it really doesn't do anything but when a person passes by and pets her she gets very exited and when they walk away she dose the same thing she normally walks right along side of me but she has trouble being a bit too friendly with other people she only dose this at walks yet at petstores and dog parks she doesn't really pay attention to people any help on keeping her at my side when other people are around try not letting people pet her if she pulls and pulls and gets to go meet the people and get petted then she got what she wanted and it reinforces the behavior next time you are out and you see someone the instant she starts to rush forward turn and walk in the other direction keep going until she gives up and comes with you then turn back towards the person again if she rushes forward again you turn around again if you keep doing this she will learn that pulling not getting to meet people then when she's walking nicely you allow her to meet the person it'll take a long time to get there you might consider using a collar instead of a harness you don't have to use a choke or pinch collar though they would certainly help it's just that a harness is usually not useful for anything but making a dog more comfortable when it pulls except of course for dogs with skinny heads that slip their collars you can use just her regular collar it will make it more uncomfortable for her to pull and she will come with you faster also use treats and every time she turns away from the people and comes with you give her a treat don't feel like you're abusing you dog remember she's the one rushing out to the end of the leash and pulling it doesn't bother her a bit that's why you need to make it bother her mentally by showing her it is not the way to get what she wants good luck Dog training Equine conformation Dog collar Aerial (dance move) Social rule Contredanse Milton H.
