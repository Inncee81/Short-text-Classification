why is my dog being so mean my dog is now about years old and recently he started growling at me every time i touch him or go near him sometimes and sometimes he fine with it but he never does it to my fiance i am the one home with him all day and the one who gets him in trouble when he does something wrong or licks his hotspots could that be why he is being mean to me or is it old age what can i do to control it i dont think he will bite but he will nibble and let me know to leave him alone hes on aspirin a day because he is developing arthritis but i dont think it is a pain issue because when he is in pain he reacts differently plus he wont growl at my fiance you right i think hes is old and thinks he is in charge they are not supposed to lick the 'hot spots' it keeps it moist and adds bacteria to it it needs to stay dry and close up i know my rottie gets grumpy even will growl when he's ailing she has arthritis in her legs so i respect thgis give her aspirin give attention when she's receptive i look at her as i do myself honoring the time she needs to herself especially when shes in pain Dog training Aspirin Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug COX-2 inhibitor Osteoarthritis Rofecoxib 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Arthritis Hypnosis Oral sex Psoriasis Social rule Cat Licking County, Ohio EastEnders Snooker Anal sex Equine conformation Erogenous zone Sulfasalazine James Lick Reiter's syndrome Asthma Leptospirosis Visa (document) Captain Beefheart Laws of cricket Billboard Hot 100 Milton H.
