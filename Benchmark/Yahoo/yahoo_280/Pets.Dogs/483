house training problem our puppy is just now months old and she still has accidents inside most of the problem stems from the fact that the dog gets too distracted outside when we take her out she knows that outside is where she needs to use the bathroom and she is rewarded everytime she go to the bathroom outside but she usually never gets around to pooping or peeing outside i know she has to go but she would much rather run around eat mulch watch birds etc how do i keep her attention on what she needs to be doing just for clarification she is always on a leash and i have to remind her constantly about what we are outside to do and she pretty much just ignores me she also has a broken leg so i am not allowed to walk her ive had and loved dogs my whole life make sure no one is confusing your dog with rewards and punishment that are inconsistent or long after shes messed the floor ive had two dogs that would hide behind things or you had to look the other way because they didn't like to be watched lol Dog training Housebreaking Ron Weasley Dog Toilet humour Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Fecal incontinence RuneScape quests Obedience training Groo the Wanderer Garfield Falconry The Shining (film) Crate training Basset Hound Humphrey Bogart Havanese Hamster The Death Gate Cycle Fancy rat Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Socialization Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Paranoia Agent Pulp Fiction Procrastination Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Jayne Mansfield The Brady Bunch Poker jargon Dog collar The Family from One End Street The Lovely Bones Sailing Futurama (TV series - season 5) Escape from New York Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Night of the Creeps Japanese toilet EastEnders Grammatical aspect Mnemonic Keeshond Billboard Hot 100 Eddie Guerrero Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Combine (Half-Life 2) Ives Manufacturing Company Ron and Fez Porridge (TV) Theory of conduct Professional wrestling match types American Psycho Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind A Course In Miracles The dozens 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mark Calaway Kodocha Survivor (novel) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Summa Theologiae Comanche Seabiscuit Nintendogs 101 Dalmatians: The Series Saw II The Inside Negima Dilbert The Smoking Room Friends Donkey Kong's Animal Buddies Make money fast Sluggy Freelance Fancy Crane Phaedo Rocko's Modern Life StarCraft: Uprising The Star Wars Holiday Special Pet skunk Columbine High School massacre The Apprentice 2 Characters of Lost Immortality Francis Bacon (painter) The Cure Milton H.
