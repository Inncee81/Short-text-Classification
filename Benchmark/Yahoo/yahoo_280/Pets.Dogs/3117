my month old puppy just died i just got this little guy a month ago he had all his shots he was just fine happy playful just like any other puppy yesterday i noticed he wasnt feeling well he slept all day long and didnt eat one bit when i tried to take him outside to use the bathroom he could barely walk and he fell to his side and peed while he was laying on the ground i took him inside made him eat gave him a bath after that he was fine again still a little slow but he was playing with me and he was fine this morning before i went to work i took him outside and then put him in the bathroom like i normally do then i went to work i had the maintenance people come to look at my toilet while i was at work today and they had my landlord call and tell me that the puppy is laying on his side there's vomit everywhere they think he's dead i sent my friend over to look and see because i just figured he was still a little weak from yesterday but she said it was true he's dead i don't understand what happened and now i'm wondering should i go tell the lady i got him from what should i do what could it have been okay im reading what everyone is saying to those who are like dont get another one animal abuser fyi i have other dogs that ive had since they were babies and they're just fine why did i leave him alone because i have to work to pay for all those puppy bills the bathroom i make sure to clear the floor of everything there are no cleaning supplies under the sink theyre in the kitchen so i doubt it was that also taking him to the vet i doubt there was a vet opened at pm and like i said after i fed him he was fine still a bit slow but playing and everything so no i am not an animal abuser so screw you please don't listen to some of these horrible things that some of these people are saying it is not your fault that your puppy died it sounds to me like he might have had parvo my friend adopted a puppy from a shelter and the people said that he had all of his shots too but he did not and he had parvo he had the same symptoms that your puppy had call the people that you got him from and tell them what happened because there might be a lot of dogs that could have been infected i'm sorry for your loss candice Toilet humour Housebreaking The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Paul Is Dead Social rule Pet skunk Dog training Socialization Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Skinny Puppy Humphrey Bogart Fecal incontinence Dog Jon Secada Equine conformation Toilet Brian Griffin Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Richard Chase Garfield Time Out of Mind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Rabies The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Cat Cliff Richard The Beatles discography The Time Machine Guinea pig AFI 100 Years series The Amber Spyglass YuYu Hakusho Euphemism Dance of the Vampires Jackass: The Movie Bathroom Singlish Paranoia Agent Theory of conduct Trainspotting (novel) Fancy rat First aid Sento Sant Thakar Singh Vomiting The Fairly OddParents Sin City Japanese toilet Futurama (TV series - season 5) Knots Landing The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Stomach cancer Lady and the Tramp Charles Darwin's illness Marilyn Monroe Ron Weasley Little Britain Washroom RuneScape quests The Lovely Bones Syphon Filter Eastern Illinois University Blonde on Blonde Breastfeeding 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Futurama (TV series - season 2) Kitchen 101 Dalmatians: The Series Hey Jude Fox hunting Vernon Schillinger Phoebe Buffay's songs Pitaten The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Radio Yerevan Ranma __ characters The Family from One End Street Mattress Hamster Days of our Lives The Ashlee Simpson Show Current teachings of Prem Rawat Spanish verbs Milton H.
