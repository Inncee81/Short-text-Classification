i have an month old puppy who bites constantly how can i get her to stop her teeth are sharp and it hurts is she just teething or what she is a havaneese by the way we do we give her bones she has chew toys she always pulls my socks off and chews on them haha but somehow she still prefers to bite on fingers and i don't know if it's just teething because sometimes she will be laying on the couch and all of the sudden she will look at you bark for a couple minutes and then start biting i tried the spray bottle thing but that didn't work because she liked it the thing is she's a really well behaved dog she listens when we tell her to sit lay down stay roll over etc and she hardly ever has any accidents the only problem we're having with her is the biting anytime she bites we give her a bone tell her no and put her in her room but it's not working that well my puppy was like that i would take his snout and hold it shut and say no no use a low voice stearn but not yelling don't use a lot of words just say stop look disappointed in him then give him one of his toys to chew on and give him praise obviously the squirtring the water isn't working try until you find something that works for instance my puppy was quicker than me he would run out the door and run to the dirty dumpster and eat discusting things i tried all kinds of things finally i realized he hated sudden loud noises so the doors to the dumpster are metal i gave the door a quick hard kick and my dog will never even walk that way it worked the first time try frying pan tops or something that makes a loud noise you and others in the family need to carry whatever you are using in order to be consistant sometimes it just takes time and patience i also if my puppy nibbled on my toes and it hurt alitltle i would pretend to cry and said owie the dog is smart enough to not want to do that again i do have times when he and i play rough and he knows when i raise my hand and say no and turn my face away he knows it is time to stop wild play Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Piccolo Junior Saga She Loves You Housebreaking The Inside Social rule Kodocha Professional wrestling holds Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield Little Britain Kim Possible The Legend of Zelda series enemies Trailer Park Boys Buddy Guy Muslim ibn Aqeel Jackass: The Movie One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Breastfeeding Tag The Fairly OddParents Characters in the Smurfs Shark Russian joke The Shining (film) Fancy rat Hansel und Gretel Sin City Equine conformation The Death Gate Cycle Skateboarding trick Basic English The Amber Spyglass Squidward Tentacles Hamster Ferret 2000 Australian Grand Prix Highway 61 Revisited Philip J.
