my dog has a huge lump from a tick bite what should i do i have never seen a real tick before until today i was petting my dog and noticed what looked like a flat mole on her ear at first i thought it was something cancerous since it had a huge inflammed bump underneath it i tugged a little at the mole and when it came off i noticed little tiny legs wriggling i freaked and threw it on the floor i have been reading that when you remove a tick you have to remove the head as well i'm not sure if the head and its claws are still on my dogs ear there is still a bump there i cleaned the area like i would with a wound what else should i do is it normal for a dog to have a bump after a tick bite is this a problem serious enough to take to the vet thanks for the answers in advance please no snarky rude remarks or comments if you are not sure you got the head out you need to watch this carefully and if it is still swollen and infected looking by monday take your dog to a vet i assume you cleaned the area and put some antibiotic ointment on it if that doesn't do it please get your dog to a vet asap ticks can leave nasty wounds or spread diseases it doesn't usually come to that but any infected tick site needs vetting by the way monthly applications of advantix on the back of his neck will repel ticks Tick Dog Tattoo Rocky Mountain spotted fever Fancy rat Eczema Aerial (dance move) Psoriasis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Domestic rabbit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rabies Guinea pig First aid Pet skunk Sin City Garfield Dog training Professional wrestling holds Prostate cancer Professional wrestling throws Mosquito Ferret Hearing impairment Tularemia Cat Labrador Retriever Equine conformation Skin Codename: Kids Next Door Happy Tree Friends Creatures in Bionicle Conspiracy (TNG episode) The Dalek Invasion of Earth The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Piccolo Junior Saga Tuberculosis Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Cellulitis Vampire Group A streptococcal infection Heartworm Diving Keloid Drill bit Ehrlichiosis Tasmanian Devil Veterinarian Computer virus The Tick Docking Malignant melanoma Radiation therapy Social rule Dialysis Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Snake Bubonic plague Traumatic brain injury Cancer of the larynx Rottweiler Livestock Beagle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Jackass: The Movie Theory of conduct Diarrhea It's All Gone Pete Tong StarCraft: Uprising Montgomery Burns Pug Turner syndrome Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Otitis externa Futurama (TV series - season 5) Ron Weasley Dobermann Peter Griffin Monkeypox Sabretooth (comics) Chicken Planck units Lung cancer Gonorrhoea Spidey Super Stories InuYasha (character) Tooth enamel Wound Hip fracture Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Vegeta Textile manufacturing Gray Wolf Tobacco smoking
