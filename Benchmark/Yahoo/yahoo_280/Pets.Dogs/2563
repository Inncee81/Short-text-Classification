has anyone had a dog that ingested a large amount of raisins my german shepherd jumped up onto my counter last night and ate almost and entire bag of raisinettes pound he has never done anything like that before he is in the vet hospital right now under observation vomiting has been induced and has been given charcoal he is going to be there for days receiving iv fluids they are monitoring him for kidney failure i knew raisins were no good but i didn't realize it could cause a medical emergency i called the vet because i was most concerned about the chocolate he ate he is pounds has anyone ever had this happen was your dog ok i also wanted to let people know who may not have known that raisins can kill a dog i am devestated and beside myself i also called poison control they weren't concerned as much about the chocolated as they were about the raisins it's not just raisins grapes too thank you everyone for your support the vet just called his bloodwork is normal right now the kidneys can fail hours after ingestion hours down so far so good i am so sorry this happened to your dog my sister lost her beloved yellow lab last september because he got a hold of lbs of fresh grapes and ate them she did everything she could to try to save him he went into kidney failure and we took him to a hospital that did not have dialysis equipment so we had to look all over the state for someone with a heart to lend us an oxygen tank so that we could bring him to a hospital that could do the dialysis an emt who was working at a hospital in boston was kind enough to bring us two tanks the vet said he would die if we tried to take him without the oxygen the dialysis cost about ten thousand and she put it in a credit card without thinking twice we all wanted haydn to get better unfortunately before we brought him to the hospital he was vomitting so much that he aspirated some fluids and caught aspiration pneumonia he went into a coma and died we were devastated i am not telling this story to scare you on the contrary i am telling you this because if we knew that grapes were dangerous we would have brought him to the hospital much sooner while he was still not showing signs of being sick and he might have had a higher chance of survival it seems that you caught it in time to induce vomitting and that is great news haydn had plenty of time to digest all the grapes he had eaten thank god they were actually raisinettes you probably would not even get worried had they been just regular raisins i really believe that he will be ok and wish you all tthe best needless to say raisins and grapes are now forbidden in my house stay strong juliana Dialysis Diabetes mellitus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Paracetamol Pneumonia Ambulance Chocolate Radiation poisoning Traumatic brain injury First aid Foodborne illness Emergency Medical Services Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stroke Yellow fever Fancy rat Kidney Dog 613 mitzvot Euthanasia STS-51-L Suicide methods One Tree Hill (TV series) Insulin Poker jargon Juliana of the Netherlands Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Neighbours National Kidney Foundation Singapore Apollo 8 EastEnders Hypoglycemia Grape Poison Potato Smallpox Myocardial infarction Botulism Fasting Garfield Shaggy dog story Folic acid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nuclear warfare Second Battle of El Alamein StarCraft: Uprising 21 July 2005 London bombings Characters of Naruto Days of our Lives Medicine Birth control Diabetic nephropathy Ebola Fugu Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Food Ferret Prostate cancer Coffee Thermal power station Anorexia nervosa Humphrey Bogart Coma Theory of conduct Brown Bear Dehydration Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses 2005 Kashmir earthquake Saturday Night Live Atkins Nutritional Approach YuYu Hakusho Pitaten Crohn's disease Organ transplant One Piece minor characters Spidey Super Stories Ayyavazhi mythology Altitude sickness Urinary incontinence South Park Abortion debate Anemia Decompression sickness Spider Scuba set The Inside Osama bin Laden Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Apollo 13 Big Brother (USA TV series) Mental Health Act 1983 Space disaster
