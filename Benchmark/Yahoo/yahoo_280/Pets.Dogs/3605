hyperactive dog baby disaster i have a year old doberman pinscher and she's really big about lbs she's a very lovable dog but she's very hyper whenever people come over she jumps around and runs in circles and now i have a baby and he's not crawling now but in a few months he will be and i'm afraid that our dog might end up hurting our son accidentally by being so hyper even when my husband and i take her for walks she still comes home and runs around and because we're in arizona and it's summer time it's too hot to take her out to the park and let her run all of her energy out any suggestions i think if i were you i would try some serious training with your dog your dog should be taught that being so rambunctious in the house is not appropriate behavior dobermans are very intelligent so i know if you correct this behavior every time she does it she will eventually learn to stop it start working with her now hopefully before your son starts crawling she will do just fine around himwhen she is around your son now does she seem to know that he is a baby tries to be gentle around him i know my dobies sense that they are different from adults do very well around babies as i said dobies are very smart they will amaze you what they will pick up how fast they learn when my granddaughter lived with us was crawling around starting to walk i had four dobermans in the house they all would simply go the other way when she was crawling or simply walk up to her give her a kiss good luck just work with her she'll be the dog you want her to be edit you will not need a crate if you train her if you start crateing her never have before she will think she is being treated differently since this baby came along may become very jealous i have had dobermans over years i have never owned a crate all you need is time patience be willing to train your dobie Dobermann Dog training Housebreaking Diving Dog agility Obedience training Piccolo Junior Saga Dog Sonic the Hedgehog Schutzhund Kodocha Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Care Bears Swimming Mental retardation Super Sonic Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Neighbours Balto (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Crash Bandicoot 1957 World Series Quake III Arena The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear Satchel Paige Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Babe Ruth Milton H.
