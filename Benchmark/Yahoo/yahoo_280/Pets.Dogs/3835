dog trainers owners what method of dog training has worked best for you hi i own a week old doberman boy i've recently enrolled him in obedience classes and even though he is obviously the most hyper dog in the class he is easily the smartest however his disobedience that has caused me to enroll him in school in the first place biting barking ignoring commands the works i've brought this to the attention of our trainer who continues to press the method of cruelty free dog training this basically means that when the dog bites us we don't hit him but show him that we are hurt and walk away dog training along the lines of culture clash for all you trainers out there if you will my question is is this the best method my pup still seems to be agressive and my trainer has basically said no to any sort of doberman training that i've read about in dobie books she says dogs needing alpha leaders is false please knowledgable dog owners trainers for an independant breed like the dobie what should i do how should i train him believe it or not i think you are on the right track using punishment with this dog might give you an immediate response but in the long run it can backfire on you as the dog gets older and wiser the punishments may have to increase and at some point in time the dog will get tired of it and possibly bite emma parsons click to calm is a great author on positive ways to deal with aggression i've heard her speak on this topic and it really makes sense yes you puppy should never be allowed to bite be bossy etc if the biting does not stop when you say ouch and turn away you may have to remove yourself or the puppy immediately from the situation put him in the crate he does have a crate doesn't he when he calms down he comes out there should be no rough play for now no tug of war no pulling etc feed him supper kibble from your hand one piece at a time with no shark teeth allowed he gets the food only when he takes it nicely begin by using an open hand the nothing in life is free gives him the idea that he has to do something in order to get what he wants you are the only one who can give him what he wants thus you become the leader he can't eat play go outside etc unless you let him you cannot allow him to get what he wants when he wants it he only gets a positive reward when he does what you ask he is fast approaching the teenage stage and will need to continue with his training you have to work on this every day you must be consistent every day and every member of the family has to be part of the team it may take longer to do this and definitely requires more patience but the result will be a dog that responds to you when asked and is less likely to be agressive in the long run one last thought neutering will help eliminate the hormone rage and allow him to pay better attention to you rather than worrying about his territory or other dogs Dog Housebreaking Dobermann Theory of conduct Socrates Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ferret Schutzhund Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Simone Weil Shark Breastfeeding Guinea pig Taikyoku shogi Baseball German Shepherd Dog CPU cache Fast bowling God Emperor of Dune Apology (Plato) Extreme Programming The Death Gate Cycle Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist GunZ The Duel Drill bit Cat Crate training Hamster Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Fox hunting Tag Equilibrium (2002 film) Martial art Kasparov versus The World Scientology beliefs and practices Expert system Poker jargon Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Fancy rat The Apprentice 2 Volleyball Ranma __ characters Pok__mon Trading Card Game Orca Pit bull Little Britain Vegeta Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shetland Sheepdog Second language acquisition Domestic rabbit Swimming Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kitesurfing Ben Johnson (athlete) Education in the People's Republic of China The Inside Horse Livestock Tenshinhan Brian Griffin Pet skunk Gray Wolf Philosophical skepticism Ludwig Wittgenstein Prisoner's dilemma Plame affair Pok__mon Abilities Garfield Pok__mon Live!
