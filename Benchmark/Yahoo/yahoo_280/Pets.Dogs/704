pawing for attention need help detering my pet to paw and bark for attention have tried ignoring him it seems to work as he gets very frustrated but i can't deal with his sharp nails clawing at me times before he stops have employed the spray bottle technique for barking but not sure if i should use this for pawing have tried correcting him but this has really helped none which is why i tried the ignoring technique i would say he paws first and if that doesn't work resorts to barking he is a dobie so he will get big and i am sure those paws will hurt alot more he is a mo pup by the way yes i have tried physical correction by grabbing his collar sitting him and firmly saying no have tried pinning him down and grabbing his snout for a few seconds until he calms down none of these seem to be working or am i not doing it effectively as for attention he gets alot out of the day he usually spends the whole day with me unless i crate him when i leave the house for a few hours is there any other dominance things i can do to infer alphaism in me i do pin techniques eat first lead him in walks i don't believe not enough exercise is the problem i give him plenty he's just wants attention sometimes and is going about the wrong way to get it koeler don't quite understand your post the breeder i got the doberman was not most knowledgeable i will probably not do business with them again how can i solve this problem i am a first time dog owner i know the doberman was probably not the best choice but i love my dobie have you tried an actual physical correction have you tried putting the dog in a crate when you want to be left alone despite what you will be told here that attention seeking behavior he is now exhibiting is a sign of dominance that will get worse as he matures nip the problem now that he is young Dog training Dog Housebreaking Dobermann Cat Shaggy dog story Gray Wolf Garfield Philosophy of language Domestic violence Milton H.
