can a cocker spaniel inpregnate a chihuahua please help im afraid my spaniel impregnated my chi i have had both of them since they were pups and this is the first time i have ever seen my chihuahua in heat and my cocker spaniel constantly smelling her its been up to the point where we have to separate them but im afraid that in one of the times they were together the cocker might have gotten on my chi but he is a bit bigger than her so im not sure if thats possible though it can happen since a cocker is bigger than a chihuahua i can guarantee you that your chihuahua will not be able to deliver such large puppies and will probably die if she tries the puppies will be way too large for her to pass this is a very dangerous situation and you need to get your chihuahua to a vet asap find out if she is pregnant and take the proper action to save her life chihuahuas are known to have difficult pregnancies even when they are bred with another chihuahua i hope for the sake of your chihuahua that she is not pregnant good luck Dog English Cocker Spaniel American Cocker Spaniel Mixed-breed dog Nintendogs English Springer Spaniel Spaniel Pregnancy Eddie Guerrero Chihuahua (dog) Guinea pig Chihuahua Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Papillon (dog) Golden Retriever Cockapoo Toy dog Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Joe Cocker Housebreaking Abortion debate Dog training Lady and the Tramp Welsh Springer Spaniel Roe v.
