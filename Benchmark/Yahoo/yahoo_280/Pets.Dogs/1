my dog ate trash yesterday is he okay i brought him to the park and one of the trashcans were knocked over before i knew it he ran from me and started to dig into the trash i don't know how much he ate but this morning he threw up about times he didn't eat or drink for a while but now he's eating and drinking normally he kinda looks weak and frail right now but that might just be becasue of the barfing do you think he'll be okay he's a very large golden retriever it costs alot of money to get a emergency check up and i was wondering if he ate those stuff last night wouldn't he already be dead if he ate something really bad thanks well now he's wagging his tail and kind of playful like he usually is but what if its like a small battery so he doesn't feel sick if he doesn't show any signs of sickness do you think theres still anything to worry about how on earth do you expect us to make a decision about whether your dog is dying or not we cannot see him therefore we cannot assess his status take the dog to the vet if you cannot afford to take the dog to the vet you cannot afford the dog be responsible another note about responsibility if your dog is not adequately trained to come on command despite tasty garbage he should not be offleash Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Time Out of Mind Sin City Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Conker's Bad Fur Day Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans The Marshall Mathers LP Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters of Lost Garfield Futurama (TV series - season 5) Avenue Q Joke Lou Gehrig Steven Wright Dog Humphrey Bogart Trailer Park Boys Futurama (TV series - season 2) Brian Griffin Marilyn Monroe Hey Jude GIR (Invader Zim) Satchel Paige Characters of Naruto Dustbin Vomiting Iditarod Johnny 5 Social rule Grandview, U.S.A.
