how would i get my month old puppy to bark my puppy has a problem with barkin other dogs bark at him all he does is puts his head down an cries i don't think your problem is that your dog won't bark in fact i think trying to get your dog to bark at the other dogs might harm him psychologically remember that he's still a baby puppies go through various stages so just be cool whatever he's feeling and don't push him to be braver than he wants what would really help is if he has some puppy play dates either puppies or older dogs who are smart enough to be gentle with a puppy this will give him a chance to play with other dogs and help him better understand how to relate to dogs check with your vet that he's had all his shots so he's safe to go out and play with other dogs it'd be best if you could play in your yard or someone else's yard if this isn't possible you might want to consider a local dog park a lot of times they have sections for smaller or younger dogs there's always a risk for dog parks so consider the risks and make your own informed decision by romping with other dogs he'll learn important dog social skills which i'd suspect he's lacking don't hover let the dogs be dogs but also don't let the other dogs maul him maul meaning where the other dog gets on top of him in play and won't let him up for some time we're trying to help him exert his confidence and having a dog who's constantly dominating him in play won't help it's also not great manners for the other dog some play mauling is fine but constant is a bit excessive never drag him or otherwise force him towards anything he's afraid of this will make the fear worse you as his owner should act confident if he trusts you this should help at least some maybe very small amount of his fear Dog Dog training Housebreaking Kim Possible Socialization Beethoven (film) Poker jargon Zoophilia Stuttering Social rule Crate training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Betting (poker) Swimming Traumatic incident reduction Breastfeeding Labrador Retriever Nintendogs Border Terrier Scientology beliefs and practices Fox hunting Ferret The Smoking Room Milton H.
