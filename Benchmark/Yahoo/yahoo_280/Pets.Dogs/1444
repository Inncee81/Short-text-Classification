need help training my new dog to give me signs he needs to go outdoors i recently took in a stray beagle who was outside at work always trying to get food near the picnic area i really enjoy having him but he just relieves himself wherever he feels like it number and i been trying to get as much information about beagles as i can and i have read they are harder to train then most dogs how can i teach him to bark or scratch the door or something when he needs to go outside i should mention he is probably about a year old please help if you can i adopted a year old pit bull a few months ago and she was not potty trained first get him on a schedule like am food then minutes later potty outside am outside to go potty pm food then minutes later potty outside pm outside to go potty pm outside to go potty pm food then minutes later potty outside pm outside to go potty pm outside to go potty it doesn't have to be that exactly but that is what i did with my dog when i first got her every time she went potty outside we had a mini party in the back yard she got tons of praise for going potty outside and everytime before we went out the door to go potty i made her sit i didn't mean to do this but after a while she started sitting by the door on her own to let me know she wanted to go outside you could maybe teach him to 'speak' at the door before you guys go outside and he might learn to do that to let you know anytime he goes potty in the house and you didn't actually see him do it just ignore it if you punish him for it after the fact he is just going to get confused not knowing exactly what you are punishing him for if you catch him in the act immediately interupt him and tell him 'no' and take him directly outside if he finishes going potty outside tons of praise if you are having a hard time catching him in the act try planning an entire weekend around potty training keep him on a leash right by your side that way he is always in your site if he decides he wants to go potty inside crate training really helped potty train my dog and also to keep her safe from chewing on dangerous objects while we weren't home she only needed the crate for about months until she learned all of the house rules i have had her for about months now and she is fully potty trained doesn't chew on anything and can stay at home for up to hours if ever needed though very unlikely and be completely fine good luck with your new dog he is lucky you found him Housebreaking Dog training Crate training Toilet humour Dog agility Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Jumpstart 3rd Grade Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Daredevil Avenue Q Ben Johnson (athlete) Traumatic incident reduction The Death Gate Cycle Toilet Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Aerial (dance move) Poker jargon The Sims Feral child Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pitaten Ferret Scientology beliefs and practices Charles Darwin's education Humphrey Bogart Avalanche Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Singlish Daylight saving time Edward Gibbon Wakefield Indianapolis 500 Hobo Toilet training Carl Barks The Critic Disgaea: Hour of Darkness Tenshinhan Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Ty Cobb Winning Streak EastEnders Time Out of Mind Mojave people Blonde on Blonde Big Brother (USA TV series) Grace Cossington Smith The Star Wars Holiday Special Animal testing Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga The Inside The Brady Bunch Apollo 8 W.
