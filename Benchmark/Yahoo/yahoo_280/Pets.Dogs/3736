how do i catch a stray puppy i have to kick a puppy out of my garden everyday i want to catch him and return him to the owner because he has tags well if you noticed that he had tags then you shouldn't have kicked him away he won't want to get close to you because your always scaring him away just try leaving some food out and some water soon he will probably come to you more often when he is hungry and when he gets close enough get a leash and clip it on then call an animal place that can find the owners or you could also just call them now and have them set up a trap and come back when he is in it Tag Dog training Trapping Housebreaking Pittsburgh Steelers Aerial (dance move) Glossary of American football Falconry Rugby union Skinny Puppy Garfield Eddie Guerrero Dog Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers One Hundred and One Dalmatians Kurt Angle New York Giants Super Bowl XXXVIII Obedience training Nintendogs Cat WrestleMania XX Socialization Lady and the Tramp Basset Hound The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Super Bowl XVIII Shawn Michaels The Dalek Invasion of Earth The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Cincinnati Bengals Water polo Tenshinhan Super Bowl XXIX Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXXI Animal euthanasia Canadian football Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XIII Front crawl Professional wrestling holds Lance Storm Labrador Retriever Spot the Dog Leash Super Bowl XXV Dog collar Charleston (dance move) Breed registry Super Bowl XXIII Adam Copeland Super Bowl XXXVI Ferret Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling match types Super Bowl XI Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Tlingit Ron and Fez Super Bowl XXXIV Gray Wolf Baseball National Football League Lore My Little Pony Swingout Cleveland Browns Sean Waltman Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXVI Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Full Metal Panic?
