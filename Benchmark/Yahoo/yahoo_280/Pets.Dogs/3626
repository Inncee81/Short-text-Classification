how do you teach a boxer at age of mths to roll over on to its back and then all the way over i think the trick to this trick is finding a place where your dog naturally would want to roll over so instead of trying to teach this on a cold time floor start on a rug with a blanket on it or a bed you can lure the behavior by showing him a treat and then having him follow it with his nose when your dog's in a down put the treat in front of his nose and then circle it back around the back of his head resist the temptation to push your dog into position let him do it himself repeat gradually fade the use of the treat after you've rewarded this many times then you cans tart to make your hand motion smaller when the behavior looks like a good roll over then you can start to tell your dog what it's called have fun Dog training Aerial (dance move) Skateboarding trick Swingout Dog agility Professional wrestling throws Backstroke Professional wrestling holds Obedience training Milton H.
