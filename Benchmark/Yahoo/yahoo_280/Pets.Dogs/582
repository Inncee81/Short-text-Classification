how can i break my dogs from sleeping in bed with me i never let my daughter sleep in bed with me anyways i have dogs german sheppard rottiweiler mix male and female they fight over who gets in the bed with me not only that they have their own pet beds and they still try to get in bed with me i have put their beds in the hallway and shut my bedroom door then its whiny time scratch at the door and i can't sleep so then its bring the beds back in and then one of them is back in my queen size bed with me and my ' hubby please any suggestions do not answer this question if you do not have dogs if you answer this in a rude or inhumane way i will report you to yahoo serious answers only my dog used to sleep with me every night and i had to change her mind about that and give her a special bed that was all hers this actually is the easy one to answer first of all dogs and kids should never be on the bed unless invited it's just good and polite ways of being in a family so i will be so happy to help you you first need to claim the bed work with one dog at a time actually start with claiming your bedroom have them out in the hall you stand in the doorway they have to sit quietly until you invite them in you go in first pack leaders are always first you can lead one at a time by holding a collar if they have one stand in front of the bed and say to your dog no in a calm voice or shhh or whatever little noise you want to make to get it's attention then have them go to their bed say in a fun voice as something they would want to do go in your bed it may take a few times and they may jump up on the bed you quietly give them a nudge or again use the collar don't pull or push them down they have to be the ones going down because you told them to go down now sit on your bed again they will want to come on it you say no or shhh or go or whatever and then lay on it and keep repeating no and go to your bed in a firm calm not frustrated voice it's just normal they want to sleep with you because in the wild all of the pack sleeps together so you have to convince them that they sleep in their bed you can't let them on it one day and then off the next you have to be very consistent with this one person can't let them on and then the other says not to at least for awhile if you see them in your bed every single time you have to make them not be on your bed and have them go to their beds my dog now loves her bed and doesn't even want to sleep with me anymore Shaggy dog story Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Avenue Q Milton H.
