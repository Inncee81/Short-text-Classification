chow i had of my female chihuahuas lbs walking around the block on leashes around am a chow came running at us growling and snarling the girls ran behind my feet yelping and squawking i bent over to push the chow back while saying no sit no the owner came chasing the dog yelling thor no i had never let go of the leashes on my dogs so i had the chow's collar in my right hand and the girl's leashes in my left holding them both apart my chis were as far away as they could run on leash the other dog bit my arm but not badly the owner was grabbing the dog and hitting it with a stick and all the time my dogs were screaming and the other dog was snarling as i look back now i wonder if i could have handled it better it happened so fast i didn't see the dog until my dogs started to scream it was a lot bigger than my dogs maybe lbs but it was a male would it have hurt them at all if i had just left it alone she should have had it leashed but she didn't know anyone was out that early so she had it off leash my dogs weren't injured i didn't call ac on them they are older and live on the next corner with this dog as i look back it would have been better if everyone was calmer usually male and female dogs don't fight if i had seen it coming earlier before my dogs started screaming i could have probably backed it down but i didn't see it as it was i just grabbed it by the neck on the collar and started yelling sit while my dogs raised a huge racket and screamed it didn't hurt us just nipped a bit when i grabbed it and snarled a lot my dogs are tiny so they scream when they see a big dog coming at them she should have had it on a leash but she wasn't expecting anyone to be around that early i don't know that much about chows never had one but i have seen them at the vet's office when i have been in working i know they euthanize them at the shelter just like they do pits and rotties instead of offering them to the public they must be a meaner breed when something like this happens people react out of instinct you handled it better than i would have i wouldn't want to take the chance to see if thor would have harmed your chi's all it would take is one bite from thor to kill a chi i think you handled it appropriately Dog training Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reservoir Dogs Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling aerial techniques Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling match types Obedience training Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Tai Chi Chuan Dog agility Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Professional wrestling attacks King Piccolo Saga Ferret Professional wrestling holds Garfield Professional wrestling throws Swingout Powerbomb The Shining (film) Kung Fu Hustle Characters of Lost Tenshinhan Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pet skunk Leash Cat The Marshall Mathers LP Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers GunBound Skateboarding trick The Inside Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Thor (Marvel Comics) Characters in the Smurfs Conspiracy (TNG episode) Gray Wolf Fatality Trapping Stephen Chow Beta Ray Bill Sin City Indianapolis 500 Pit bull Invader Zim Diving Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
