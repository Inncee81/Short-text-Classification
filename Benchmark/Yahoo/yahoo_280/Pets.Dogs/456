please help my dog is soo shy okay my dog chunk is a malti poo he is years old and we have had him for year and months chunk is sooo shy like he is always timid and scared and he always runs and hides in my moms bed upstairs when you call him he rarely comes but he will come as long as tuff is right by his side this has got me sooo puzzled like i've tried training him but he hates it and i'm scared that i'm just making his timid ness worse i got him at mckees a local pet store who is extremely good and we got him when he was weeks old so he didnt get abused please help i am so utterly and sadly confused this kind of reminds me of really shy little kids when they are like under the age of or even they can be really shy but they grow out of it in the years to come this is partly because their confidence has grown and they are more sure of themselves so maybe all your puppy needs is time to grow out of it you might try to play with your other dog tuff in front of chunk maybe chunk will see how much fun it is and want to join in you might want to take the two of them on walks together too i wouldn't make any threatening movements or anything like that that would scare chunk because i think that he needs to trust the people in the house and be comfortable with them in all situations before he can become less shy around other things that are unfamiliar Socialization Dog training Housebreaking Humphrey Bogart Dog Hamster Milton H.
