are great pyrs slow learners i try to teach my pup not to bite but he still does and he's almost months old i never let him bite in the first place it's play biting but it won't be cute once he's a dog i tell him no barking or whining but he still does he did learn the other commands quick or should i lay off a bit because he's young and not expect him to learn to not bite or bark overnight i've had him for almost two weeks four months old is a very mouthy stage for any dog this is quite normal two weeks is not a very long time to expect even a genius puppy to learn good manners it's good that you recognize the need to stop this behavior now the best way to teach a puppy not to bite is to pretend like it really really hurts even if they just barely touch you when you feel teeth you go ow jerk away your arm or whatever he mouthed turn away from the dog and ignore him this is how puppies learn bite inhibition from their litter mates if they're playing and they get a little too rough their playmate yelps and stops playing then they know they were too rough and they are more gentle next time until they forget then it happens again and they learn eventually once he calms down you can start playing again but if he nips again same thing ow and stop playing same thing with barking and whining if he's doing it for attention that is if your dog wants attention and barks or whines to get it make sure that barking and whining give him the opposite of what he wants ignore him every time if his behavior is too insistent to ignore it calmly lead him to another room the bathroom is a good choice and close the door and leave him on his own for a couple of minutes when he comes out if he's quiet he gets to play or be petted or get a treat or toy if he barks again you put him away again if he whines from behind the door you have to ignore it until he's quiet only when he's quiet can he come out if his whining is really persistent or gets worse the longer he's in there you may have to teach him a quiet command when he's whining open the door a little say no or quiet then close it usually that will startle the dog just long enough that he's quiet for a few seconds quickly before he whines again open the door and praise him and let him out to play i hope this helps even if you don't use these methods whatever you do just be consistent and don't give up even a month old puppy can learn to sit being young doesn't mean you should wait until he's older it just means you have to make training sessions shorter and more fun than you would with an adult good luck Housebreaking Dog Obedience training Social rule Kodocha Socialization Shaggy dog story Sin City Guinea pig Milton H.
