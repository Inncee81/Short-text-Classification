i feel like such an awful mom i work hour days days a week from am pm my husband 'usually' goes into work at or and gets off at our two pugs are in their crate whenever no one is home because they cannot be trusted by themselves since they are barely a year old and still in puppy stage of chewing everything up i hate crating but we have to do it since they cannot be outside it's too hot my question is how long do you crate your dogs for when you are away at work and how much time do you devote to your dogs when you get home how do you have time for all of it the second i get home i play with the dogs for about hrs and then my husband gets home and we eat supper then it's time for bed i just feel bad that i cannot play with them more on my days off i don't even go anywhere because i want the dogs to be out of the crate all day you might say they like the crate but not my dogs they literally scream when they are in there i feel soo bad they do sleep with us they are not in the crate during the night the only reason they are crated is because they chew walls trim floors etc if left alone you sound like a really nice person first it's not a bad thing to crate your dogs it's very smart they can't get into trouble and you don't have to deal with that when you come home as far as how long can you crate them shorter is better but you can only do what you can do maybe you can get a neighbor or friend or a doggie service to come over and let them stretch their legs for a little while during the day what i would suggest you do with them when you're home is to give them a job this would give them something to think about and would tire themselves out more than even playing with them would what i mean is you should teach them to do things not just the usual commands like sit heel down but really fun things like freestyle dance agility or tricks like opening and closing doors and stuff like that there are several books you can get to help you with this a good source is http www dogwise com and just search under tricks or dancing with your dog or agility you probably want to know about clicker training as well since that would be the fastest and kindest way to get them to understand what you are trying to teach them try karen pryor's books also at dogwise or amazon you can probably also find someone in the yellow pages near you that can help you teach your dog some tricks or freestyle dancing or even dog agility dogs really like to show off and please you and you'll all be having fun and not feeling guilty about things at all good luck Dog training Housebreaking Mojave people Obedience training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Avenue Q Ron and Fez Dog agility Shaggy dog story Dog Late Night with Conan O'Brien The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Fairly OddParents Schutzhund Crate training Kodocha Havanese The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Knots Landing Jennifer Lopez Musical Canine Freestyle Aerial (dance move) One Tree Hill (TV series) Garfield Hip hop rivalries Tupac Shakur Dean Koontz The Ashlee Simpson Show AFI 100 Years series Shit Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Parachuting The Adventures of Pete & Pete Great Teacher Onizuka Magic (illusion) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Invader Zim Spidey Super Stories Rocko's Modern Life RuneScape quests Clicker training Ranma __ characters Beavis and Butt-head Nintendogs Sin City Meat Loaf Characters in the Smurfs Customs and etiquette of Japan Saturday Night Live MTV2 Equine conformation Pump It Up Spot the Dog Parkour Scientology beliefs and practices Martial art Milton H.
