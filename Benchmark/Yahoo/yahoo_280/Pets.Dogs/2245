how do i stop my female dog from humping me i have a month old female beagle that has been fixed she has been humping my leg almost as soon as i got her home its worse at night and she now has been trying to hump everything i have done everything i can think of that would help like giving her a toy firmly saying no and pushing her down swatting her on the butt and telling her no calming her down and petting her none of these things have worked some times it gets worse and she becomes more aggressive to attatch herself to me there has to be something else that can be done help she is already fixed and yes its that irritating when you can't cross the room without having her attatched to my leg lol she is trying to test her dominance gently knock her down look her right in the eye and say no in a stern voice Dog Dog training Shaggy dog story Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Silence of the Lambs Sin City Late Night with Conan O'Brien Milton H.
