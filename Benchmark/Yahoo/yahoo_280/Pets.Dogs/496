crate trainers when can you let the dog out of cage at night i have a year old beagle that we still cannot let out of his cage at nights or while we are gone or we come home wake up to poop and pee all over the house how old until he will stop this we just recently got him neutered not sure if that made a difference we started crate training at around months of age about a week after we brought him home so he is totally crate trained and is ok out of the crate if we are home doesn't have any accidents if we are home he gets plenty of exercise having a wk old kitten to chase and and yr old human boys to chase and walk him one woman had mentioned to me at around a year old they could let the dog out all day like i said before he is fine during the day when we are paying attention to him it's like he gets upset or jealous that we are sleeping and not there and so he does stuff like that thanks for suggestions so far to precious how do i know he's going if i'm not there uh the pile of pee on the hardwood floor we bought him from a breeder that breeds beagles only he gets fed in the morning and in the morning only but he prefers to snack on the food throughout the day water is always available though through the day my trainer friend recommends starting to leave your dog loose when not home at yrs old start in hours increments is your dog free fed many dogs with access to food all the time also poop all the time pick up his water hours b bedtime and go outside with him was he a petstore dog or from a byb they are often impossible to housebreak as they are used to living in filth and do not care about being clean i had a female minpin who peed and pooped in her crate until she was yrs old at age she started being clean until then she got almost daily baths as she pooped then painted herself and the crate btw you also have to think of what your dog was originally bred for hounds are bred to live outside in large packs and hunt bunnies so they were bred to get along with lots of dogs but since they lived outside in large pens being clean was not a priority Housebreaking Dog Cat Domestic rabbit Dog training Hamster Ferret Guinea pig RuneScape quests Crate training Basset Hound Kitten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Toilet humour Shaggy dog story Dachshund Fancy rat Livestock Pet skunk Beagle Dog intelligence Fox hunting Eddie Guerrero Gray Wolf Chicken Italian Greyhound Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Canary Kakapo Social rule Irish Wolfhound USS Sea Dog (SS-401) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Customs and etiquette of Japan Fecal incontinence Alaskan husky Rabbit Francis Bacon (painter) Milk Nintendogs Diazepam Jack Russell Terrier Dairy Working dog Urinary incontinence Animal testing Toilet Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Pok__mon Live!
