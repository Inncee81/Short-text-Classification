what would you do buying a puppy i have paid a dollar down payment for a yorkie puppy and will pay the remaining on delivery he was supposed to be available around july th or so at about weeks old i have bought my previous dog from these people and he will be driven in from the next state on the th they emailed me to say that they were going on vacation and would email me when they returned on the th well i ended up emailing them on the nd to ask what was up they said that they would likely be having someone drive them here on the weekend of the eleventh this is almost three weeks since the expected date another member of their extended family has a litter of ready yorkies here in the next town they all work together and drive the puppies back and forth they cost a bit more but will be younger when i get them i am afraid this puppy that is 'supposed' to be coming will already have habits and memories of these people when i want to be his first memory what would you do i am wondering if i should ask to get one of the local younger puppies instead at the lower price since they are not delivering me a young puppy as expected should i just wait til the eleventh do you think he will already be attatched to these people and have their habits am i overreacting well if you bail you will probably lose your deposit call them back and tell them you need a firm delivery date or else you want your deposit back since the delivery date is now more thaan weeks past what was promised and now they are pushing it to weeks get a commitment from them i don't think the delay will have a major effect on the training and habits of your dog if you had a good experience with this breeder previously Internet fraud Dog training Health insurance Dog Bond Karl Rove Rational pricing Skinny Puppy Breed registry Labrador Retriever Dobermann Monetary policy Futures contract Economy of Russia Supply and demand ITV Inflation Plame affair Microeconomics Yorkshire Terrier Short selling Shaggy dog story Puppy mill Publicly funded medicine Hiawatha Line Annuity Leasing Socialization Euro Gold standard Canadian and American health care systems compared Screenplay Nintendogs E-mail UK Singles Chart Direct marketing MMORPG Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Service economy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Estoppel Deflation (economics) IBM PC compatible FairTax Taxation in the United States Dog breeding Minimum wage Eddie Guerrero Broadband Internet access Havanese Commodity markets Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Call centre Outsourcing United States Postal Service The Apprentice 2 National Football League Search engine optimization Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Wal-Mart Paul Martin Docking Ron and Fez Cricket Black-Scholes Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Hyperinflation My Little Pony Tax Arbitrage Sick Puppy Scooby-Doo Oil depletion Security (finance) Tobacco smoking Unemployment benefit Saturday Night Live Milton H.
