can my beagles make it this far i have two beagles mother and daughter the mother is years old and the daughter is the daughter is slightly overweight she has been spoiled by my mother but we are looking to take care of that i want to bring them on longer walks perhaps a mile but i don't want to strain them since they are sort of getting on and since the younger one has weight problems is a mile too far for them to go should i look out for any symptoms to tell me they can't make it any farther bring water with you for the dogs start out slowly and take your lead from the dog s behavior when they seem winded and tired then stop the walk slowly their fitness levels will come up and they ll be able to walk much further my boston terrier walks up to six miles a day without a bit of problem and his legs are much shorter than a beagle s i just have to watch him for over heating and make sure he has plenty of water watch them for signs of over heating heavy panting pale gums sitting down and refusing to walk if they start to get too hot find some shade and give them a drink and take a break First aid Dog Beagle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Swingout Milton H.
