why does my puppy eat my backyard when i take zion outside he makes a game out of eating everything he can get his hands on i constantly follow him around pulling the following from his mouth twigs weeds nectarine seeds nectarines that have fallen and been smashed dried grass grass mud piles rocks etc the first thing i do when i take him out is feed him and i don't let him leave until the food is all gone then i give him a rawhide stick hoping that it will feed his need to chew he loved them the first day and now he seems to only want to put in his mouth what i have to take away everytime he puts something bad in his mouth i say no zion then i take it and replace it with his rawhide or a toy i even try to play with him throw a ball or a rope and if he's really into whatever he's eating he wont go after the toy his bowels urine look fine and he drinks eats normally what's going on with my lil pup how do i get him to stop this potentially dangerous habit my dogs eat sticks and mulch now the puppy has started eating the tree the vet said they need more fiber in a joking way of course but he said it was perfectly fine they eat grass when their tummies hurt and fruit out of trees is ok just not grapes off the vine it can make them sick Hamster Peach Dog training Fecal incontinence Garfield Jackass: The Movie Elephant Comanche Shaggy dog story Tobacco Dog One Tree Hill (TV series) Book of Isaiah Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hemp Guinea pig 1957 World Series Toilet humour 613 mitzvot Fancy rat Fruit tree propagation Tooth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Housebreaking Goat John the Baptist Happy Tree Friends Bamboo Aerial (dance move) Ron and Fez Tag Kodocha Flax Baseball Campfire Snake RuneScape quests Grape Care Bears Frankie Laine Tennis Wine Professional wrestling slang Blood (computer game) Sick Puppy Spidey Super Stories Compost Chewing gum Breastfeeding Maize Food Textile manufacturing Golf The Adventures of Pete & Pete Korean cuisine Yarrow Tooth enamel Aztec Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Naruto jutsu Peanut Durian Rawhide Shark Fruit Domestic rabbit Hazing Kangaroo Pikmin Taboo food and drink Ferret Poker jargon Hip hop collaborations Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Apple Mojave people Richard Chase Sorghum Weebl and Bob Cat Coprophagia American Alligator Toy Chocolate Agriculture The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Viva La Bam Hera Cricket Gray Wolf Roman eating and drinking Plastic Adam and Eve Professional wrestling match types Mulch RuneScape skills Customs and etiquette of Japan Sin City Botany
