is hycodan ever used for pain management in post op puppies my pups were just spayed neutered the vet prescribed torbagesic x daily but everything i've read indicates it's only good for an hour or two before pain returns i have hycodan left over from another dog and i wondered if i might be able to split the mg tab in or for better pain management in my suffering pups any words of wisdom out there well hydrocodone isn't really ever used for pain managements in animals it's usually used as a cough suppressant i would advise against using it as a way of pain management for just spayed animals if you notice your animal acting too painful especially if it was neutered and not spayed you will want to call the vet immediately because there could be a secondary infection setting in most animals actually aren't in extensive amounts of pain most fully recover in approximately a week waiting two weeks before they return to full activity levels i've never actually used torbagesic we usually send home metacam rimadyl or deramaxx Guinea pig Dog Ferret Domestic rabbit Housebreaking Sterilization (surgical procedure) Dog training Pet skunk Cat Kitten Fancy rat Chronic fatigue syndrome Lung cancer Castration Dialysis Great Dane Docking Scientology beliefs and practices Prostate cancer Coyote Rush Limbaugh Group A streptococcal infection Traumatic brain injury Gray Wolf Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic incident reduction Breastfeeding Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Bulgarian language Common cold Milton H.
