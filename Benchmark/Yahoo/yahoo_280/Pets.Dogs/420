question about sickness in westie i have a month old westie just bought him home about days ago i noticed that he started bleeding from his backside the breeder gave me albron to treat it for two weeks she said it was coccilo i have noticed a couple of other things he will run around wildly for about minute my lab calms him down by putting his paw on him but it's like someone lit a fire under him he won't really eat or drink that much today when i took him out he pooped one little drop of blood he also rubs his head on the floor in the house and in the grass is he leavnig his scent he whines sometimes but he stops when i come and see him we also crate him at night i wondering if all this is from the stress of being in a new evironment any ideas we go to the vet on tuesday monday he will updated shots thanks to both of your for your answers great dane lady what do i do if i can't get a sample right now he isnt' eating much but i will see what tomorrow brings maybe he will poop a little so i can get a sample the blood could also be from hook worm so it is good that you are going to the vet be sure to take a fresh stool sample as for shots they should not be given to an unhealthy animal i know that the vets do it all the time but it is really stressful to the animals immune system and if they are sick the immune system has enough to do as for rubbing his head on the ground that could be an ear infection Guinea pig Cat Stomach cancer Dog Housebreaking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Marathon (sport) Domestic rabbit 2004 American League Championship Series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hedgehog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fancy rat Sampling (music) Shaggy dog story Yarrow Computer virus YuYu Hakusho Urinary incontinence EastEnders HIV test Childbirth Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Dog training Dialysis Diarrhea First aid Ferret Common cold Vomiting Psoriasis Ship naming and launching Medicine Radiation poisoning Mosquito Hamster Feces The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Garfield Tattoo New York Giants Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Inception of Darwin's theory Coprophagia Toilet humour Elephant The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Aerial (dance move) Ebola Memorial Stadium, Clemson Schistosomiasis Salad Fingers Mattress Little Britain Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Inside Anthrax AIDS Francis Bacon (painter) Lycanthropy AIDS reappraisal Chronic fatigue syndrome Leukemia Time Out of Mind Breastfeeding Insulin UK Singles Chart 613 mitzvot Static Shock Saturday Night Live Sin City Syphon Filter Muslim ibn Aqeel Planet of the Daleks Chicken H5N1 Hiberno-English Dobermann Menstrual cycle The Time Machine Soap opera Gray Wolf Second Battle of El Alamein Boom Town (Doctor Who) STS-59 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Docking Captain Thunderbolt Lucille Ball Cancer Eric Bischoff Vitamin C Kashrut Leon White ECW One Night Stand Hip hop rivalries Sola fide
