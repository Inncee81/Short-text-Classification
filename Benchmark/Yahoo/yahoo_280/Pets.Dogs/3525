pomeranian question well i got a pom and he just doesn't seem to warm up to me i have never had this kind of a problem we are now thinking of selling him every time i try and get close to him he runs i take him out and once he does his bussiness i try to bring him in and again he runs away any suggestions on what i can do mufukin i agree i dont think he likes me and that's cause i treat him really good once i pick him up he is totally fine of course i have problems even trying to pick him up first how long have you had your pom have you really given him a chance to get use to you his new surroundings do you know anything about his past was he abused these are things you have to take into consideration don't force yourself just let it come naturally as the owner of a recently rescued pom i adopted valentino back in feburary see profile for pic this is now august and he is now just getting to where he is comfortable i have worked with him everyday and will continue to work with him as i have no idea of his past but whatever it was it was not a happy one and i am bound and determine to make things different for him he is still skittish at time and if there is an unfamiliar sound or noise he still runs and hides under my bed when that happens i go and assure him everything is okay but if we are just sitting around he is the most lovable dog ever so basically what i am tell you give your little guy time never yell or raise your voice to them and whenever they are scared or frightened reassurance in time goes a long long way pom's are fun i have and would not trade them for the world all three sleep with my husband and i and believe it or not valentino himself has slept right between my husband and i from the first day we brought him home and if all else fail or you just feel it is too big of a responsibility find someone who will be willing to work with our little guy to help him over his insecurities good luck Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct EastEnders The Fairly OddParents Dog training Pitaten Pomeranian (dog) Milton H.
