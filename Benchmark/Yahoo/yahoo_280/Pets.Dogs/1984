re when to put a dog to sleep thank you thanks to everyone who answered my question it helped put my mind at ease i had pretty much already made the decision but was looking for an out i took him today to be put to sleep worst day of my life but at least bo's happy now i canceled my afternoon appointments at work and spent the day with him we went to subway where i got the double meat and had them put it in a bag we went to hang out in the field behind the vet and he had his turkey and some water about the only things he'd take in then he got enough energy to make the walk into the office and i think he knew it was time the walk took forever cause he could barely move and i think he was showing me that he didn't want to leave even though we both knew it was best he calmly walked into the room and took his place on the blanket and was so calm the vet did his thing and i sat with him and balled my eyes out for half an hour i only wish you all could have known him he was so cool best dog in the world oh gosh i didn't see your previous question but this post brought years to my eyes i'm so sorry for your loss i know how you feel as do many of the others who have had to put a dog to sleep i personally have to say good bye to four dogs in my life and it doesn't get easier the second third or fourth time around sigh it sounds like you made bo's last day very happy and got to spend some wonderful quality time with him also i know it's easy for me say but not easy to do but try and remember the happy times and the wonderful memories you shared with him bo will forever in your heart i'm adding some links where you can place a free memorial and some links that may help you through your grieving process best wishes to you i'm sure bo will be waiting for you at the rainbow bridge rest in peace bo knowing that you were and will always be loved Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Contender (television series) EastEnders Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 1957 World Series Dog training Care Bears The Amber Spyglass Milton H.
