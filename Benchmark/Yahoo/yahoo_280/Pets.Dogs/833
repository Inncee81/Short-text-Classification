lonely and looking to adopt a pet for companionship i've been a stay at home for about a year now and while i love my girls and i love being home with them i also can't help feeling a little bit isolated and lonely i'd like to adopt a dog to add to the family but my husband thinks this will only increase my workload and responsibility but will not help with the feelings of loneliness opinions just want to add that i have had and love dogs dogs are a little extra work but once you get them trained and into a routine they are easy to deal with and such great company i have dogs and let me tell you i never feel lonely dogs are so loving and giving and if you are having a bad day a dog is all you need to make you feel better my advice is to adopt an older dog that is already house trained and that will take away most of the work it will be past the chewing stage and everything i adopted a dog at years old and she never had an accident in the house or chewed on anything so that could be the solution to your hubby's argument a well trained dog is no trouble at all and they are actually very good at keeping kids entertained not only are they good company for you but they are good company for the kids i love that i can send my nieces out into my yard with the dogs and not worry because if anyone they don't know gets near they bark their heads off all families need a dog Dog training Social rule Dead Like Me The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Dog Obedience training The Emancipation of Mimi Companion dog The Critic Golden Retriever Kangaroo Humphrey Bogart The Fairly OddParents Cliff Richard Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q The Lovely Bones Friends Theory of conduct Our Gang One Tree Hill (TV series) Tina Turner Pet Sounds Zoophilia About a Boy Crate training Phoebe Halliwell Shaggy dog story Housebreaking EastEnders A Day in the Life Laura Schlessinger Knots Landing Hamster Doug Philip J.
