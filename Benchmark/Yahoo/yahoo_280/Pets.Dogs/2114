my dog just got spayed and a hernia fixed today should i hold off on the food and water for now she drank some water and threw it all back up she hasn't eaten since yesterday i'm worried that her being hungry is gonna make her feel worse but i'm also afraid that if she eats that also might make her feel worse what should i do i'd be giving her water the last thing you want is for her to get dehydrated if she threw it up last time maybe it was just too soon after the anesthetic or maybe she drank it too fast but don't withhold water from her as for food you can offer her some but leave it up to her if she wants to eat or not most dogs do not want to eat the day of surgery while they're still feeling the anesthetic Fecal incontinence Fasting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 613 mitzvot Binge eating disorder Dehydration Cat Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Hyperthermia Kodocha The Smoking Room Singlish Shaggy dog story Diarrhea AFI 100 Years series Characters in the Smurfs Slow Train Coming Social rule Marathon (sport) Make money fast Anesthesia Dieting Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Garfield Dental caries Jon Secada Dog Piccolo Junior Saga Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Soft drink The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Wall Street Gastric bypass surgery Super Size Me "Weird Al" Yankovic Roman eating and drinking Hot dog Backpacking (wilderness) Cocaine Lent Obesity Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Theory of conduct Domestic rabbit Meal Milton H.
