things to do help my dog i have a dog named jake and he is a shelter dog i got him years ago and now he is probably my best friend in the whole world hes like my son but i was wondering if you could give me some tips on caring for him raising him or any other helpful info i take him to vet for regular check ups and he has all his shots and i give him his heart worm as sheduled and he's neutered he weighs pounds and could lose some weight and im working on that when i got him from the shelter they said he was a terrier mix but he looks alot like a lab any ideas on what else he looks like here are pics of him as a puppy i havent got anything recent thanks link http i photobucket com albums e mottern jpg dog jpg http i photobucket com albums e mottern img jpg thanks things to do to help my dog i also walk him every day hes been sleeping in my bed every night since ive had him and he is very well trained when it comes to going to the bathroom he always goes to the door and he will wait on me to get home to let him out he is a all around great dog thanks for all the replies awww first of all i wanna say he is precious haha well it sounds like you're doing a great job taking care of him especially with the love you have for him i love animals i've had many dogs and i also volunteer at an animal shelter and have learned alot more about animals buy him lots of toys you want him to be happy but don't spoil him buy him treats so when he is good like train him to do tricks it takes time but it is definitely possible like children dogs need discipline no don't hit him but you can yell or put him in time out lol as crazy as that sounds it's effective another thing that works is just a squirt of water this is for when he misbehaves bathe him at least once a month and give him a good flea and tick medecine that will keep all that away make sure he is up to date on his shots especially rabies heartgaurd and parvo this is really going around in dogs trust me take him to the vet for a check up twice a year to be safe take him for walks in the park it's good that he socializes with other people as well as dogs they love the comany and the exercise feed him at least times a day i suggest feeding him either science diet iams or even purina dry food is the best canned food once a week won't hurt they love it i hope that he is an inside dog my dog loves being either beside my bed while i sleep or on my bed oh yes and always walk him on a leash it's so important oh and getting him micro chipped will be an excellent idea most shelters now are offering it for as little as it sounds like you're doing a great job so you don't have to worry just enjoy your dog they are like our children and it's our job to make them happy Dog Dog training Garfield The Shining (film) Cat Social rule Shaggy dog story Ferret Fancy rat Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guinea pig The Fairly OddParents Socialization Avenue Q Care Bears The Ashlee Simpson Show Sin City Nintendogs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Spidey Super Stories Humphrey Bogart The Apprentice 2 One Tree Hill (TV series) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Breastfeeding Bon Jovi First aid Housebreaking Columbine High School massacre Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Toilet humour Domestic rabbit Philip J.
