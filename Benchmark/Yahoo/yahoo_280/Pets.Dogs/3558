looking to adopt a pug what do most pounds rescues find desirable in an adopter i want to make sure myself hubby and our home are ready before we begin any adoption process please help me out i have chosen a pug because after weeks of research i have found they are the most compatable breed with our lifestyle they don't seem to shead as much they are comfortable living in an apartment sqft as long as they have a couple walks a day and they tend to not be as noisey as other breeds if you have any more advice it would be greatly appreciated i want to do this right o thank you one big detail i forgot we don't have allergies and we don't have kids nor do we plan on having them for quite a while maybe years from now i'm looking for a pug that is years one that is already house trained plus we're putting a doggy door that leads to our patio in case we're not home to take him out i would hate for him to have an accident but i understand that they do happen occasionally this is why we're looking for one that's a little older i understand that they're a little difficult to housetrain and i'm afraid i wouldn't be able to train them properly i think it would be more bennificial for all parties involved if our little furry friend were a little older i am into dog rescue and so i know what the rescues look for but i don't think this is a good place for that kind of advice because i think there are some people reading this that may not be a good home for a dog pugs really do shed a lot and can have a lot of health problems other than that they are great pets you sound like you would make a great home for a pet Dog Pug Keeshond Nintendogs Infantilism Housebreaking Hamster Humphrey Bogart Greyhound Domestic rabbit Cat Theory of conduct West Highland White Terrier Mixed-breed dog Shaggy dog story Dobermann Breastfeeding American Eskimo Dog American Pit Bull Terrier Havanese Friends The Critic Reservoir Dogs Kim Possible IBM PC compatible Pekingese Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Brady Bunch Snoop Dogg Companion dog Zoophilia Garfield The Pet Sounds Sessions AFI 100 Years series The Emancipation of Mimi German Shepherd Dog Philosophy of language Time Out of Mind Recurring South Park characters EastEnders Babe Ruth Rescue group The Evil Queen/Christine Slevil-Lewis-White (The 10th Kingdom) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Equine conformation Eddie Guerrero Golden Retriever Strap-on dildo Korea Jindo Dog Steven Wright Pet skunk Obedience training Happiness Ferret Perl Moe Szyslak House Mouse Alcoholics Anonymous Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an English Springer Spaniel Make money fast Pet Sounds Health insurance Working dog RuneScape quests Chronic fatigue syndrome About a Boy Domestication Dilbert Aphasia Animal shelter Tibetan Mastiff Alaskan husky Scientology beliefs and practices Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Catcher in the Rye Neighbours Vegeta Condom Diving Dead Like Me Shetland Sheepdog Chinglish Milton H.
