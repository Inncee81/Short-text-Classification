how do i get my puppy to sleep in her own bed i have a bed for my week old chihuahua but she doesn't sleep in it and quickly tries to leave when we place her on it in stead she tries to sleep on my bed which makes her whine and cry during the night since she tries to go on to the bed how should i get her to sleep on her own bed how about putting her bed inside a crate that is just her size it will make her feel safe being in a confined little area rather than being able to 'roam around' a great big area like your room that's scary to alot of small dogs plus she's less likely to go potty in her crate kennel rather than if she can have the run of your room she will get to where she loves the crate and that will be her 'getaway' when she's scared maybe alot of people around she's tired and wants to be alone etc like i said just make sure it's small for her size and not one that's made for a bigger dog so she feels comfy and safe good luck Crate training Housebreaking Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City EastEnders Mattress Shaggy dog story Nintendogs Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Characters in the Smurfs Care Bears The Fairly OddParents Dog Dog agility The Tracey Ullman Show shorts The Big Sleep Chihuahua (dog) Avenue Q Hamster Great Teacher Onizuka Bed (furniture) The Death Gate Cycle The Catcher in the Rye Otello Toy dog Invader Zim Big Brother UK series 6 Scooby-Doo The Shining (film) Lady and the Tramp Sleeping with the Enemy (Simpsons episode) Vampire Mixed-breed dog The Time Machine Dog breed Professional wrestling match types Bon Jovi Ren and Stimpy Pug Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ed, Edd n Eddy Dean Koontz The Cure The Lovely Bones Big Brother (Australian TV series) Insomnia Charly Garc__a RuneScape quests Sleeping car Sento The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Tag Hobo Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Smoking Room The Amber Spyglass Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) W.I.T.C.H.
