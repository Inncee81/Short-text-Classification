tips on bonding with a dog i really want my dog to stay with me sleep in my room and greet me but if i get my dog in the middle of the school year since i wont be home im worried that my dog would become cold to me or might become closer to my mom who stays at home most of the day im at school from any tips on preventing this and helping my dog become really close to me especially since ive heard that the puppy years are the most important i'm at school months out of the year but my dog still prefers me to my parents i play with her more than my parents do i get down in the floor and rough house with her play fetch and just will sit in the floor and hold her because she loves to cuddle i also make sure to still be a disciplinarian i constantly reinforce that i am her superior and there are plenty of games that help that we have a low porch that's easy to jump on and off of so we'll rough house and i'll shove her off of the porch and not let her up there i'm the one that tells her no most of the time and reprimands her i'm the one that has trained her to sit stay give me high five hold treats on her nose i make sure that she never eats before we're done eating i also give her fewer treats that my mom does so don't think that giving a dog tons of treats is going to make it love you more always make sure that you are alpha with her and she will always greet you follow you and sleep in your room dogs stay next to the one in charge a dog's affection isn't bought by how much time is spent with her but the quality of the time spent with her be the one to feed her play with her take her on walks and anything else she enjoys but still be in charge or she won't respect you i know it sounds weird but respect is very important from your dog oh and in response to a previous answer don't carry the puppy make the puppy walk unless you've taken it out and now the puppy is too tired to walk make it walk so it burns energy because a hyper dog is one that will get into trouble also it's just annoying to have a dog begging to picked up and carried when the once pound puppy is now a pound dog the best time to try and train a dog is after a walk or something that has tired it out a little and has burned off the excess puppy energy Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Little Britain Housebreaking Aerial (dance move) Garfield Social rule Domestic rabbit Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Customs and etiquette of Japan One Tree Hill (TV series) Poker jargon Rosa Parks Skinny Puppy Fancy rat RuneScape quests Tag The Inside Volleyball Cat The Time Machine Welding English grammar Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kodocha Guinea pig Billboard Hot 100 Treehouse of Horror V Common cold Pitaten Philip J.
