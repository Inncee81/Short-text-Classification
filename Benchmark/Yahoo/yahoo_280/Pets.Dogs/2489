how do u stop puppies form begging for food the first thing is to never give them any food from the table leftover's second when it's time to eat whether you are at you table in the kitchen or in the living room watching a program and eating you need to tell the pups dogs to go lay down you can crate your dogs while you eat or have people over for dinner or leave it when you do leave it that is a command that can be used when walking you see something that the dog may pick up and when you're coming up to it the dog has the smell you say leave it and the dog passes that object of interest it takes time and practice and this is something you can do with treats to teach them not to pick up or eat anything they find put the treat on the floor and as you're saying leave it cover it with your foot or hand when they obey give them a treat with the other hand it's all a process of learning if you give them table food the best thing i can suggest is baby carrots it's good for their breathe you may need to start with small bits and eventually they'll take the entire carrot the only table food our dogs get are raw carrots they know that name and all of their treats are called biscuits i hope this helped either way they'll get the message of what you expect out of them i hope this helps Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obedience training Kitchen Hamster Japanese tea ceremony The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Social rule Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Roman eating and drinking The Star Wars Holiday Special Customs and etiquette of Japan Chinese New Year Carrot Jewish cuisine Past teachings of Prem Rawat English grammar Milton H.
