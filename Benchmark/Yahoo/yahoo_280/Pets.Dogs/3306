my dog hurt its leg we woke up this morning and she was fine and i basically carried her around all day but i put her down and she was limping we felt both her legs and they feel exactly the same so it doesnt feel broken she never yelped and was fine last night nvm its alright now she was 'faking' it i guess it was like a hour thing perhaps her leg just fell asleep like ours can do if she's not crying or acting like it's hurt except for limping i wouldn't worry about it i would check her pad bottom of her paw just to make sure there's no sticker in it i think she'll be just fine Jon Secada Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Limp Bizkit Mississippi John Hurt Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Oh My Goddess!
