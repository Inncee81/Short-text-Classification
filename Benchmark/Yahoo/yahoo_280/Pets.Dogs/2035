my parents only feed my dogs gourmet meals help like okay at dinner time my mom might cook chicken pasta and green beans she serves everyone in our family and then gets out two bowls the ones we eat out of and fills them up to the top with the exact same thing that we eat she will put the bowls on the ground and let our two dogs chow down one of our dogs is and the other is only months old my mom is spoiling our dogs they won't even eat their dog food anymore because they are addicted to human food oh and everynight my dad gives them about a spoonfull of peanut butter it is getting out of control our four year old dog is getting really fat they get exercise but this food is completley unhealthy for dogs and im sure can kill them down the road i've tried telling my parents my dad is kind of on my side but he isn't really in charge of what my mom feeds them so it doesnt matter but how can i stop my mom from feeding them our food and how can i get our dogs to eat their food thanks in advance wow thankyou guys so much heres another detail though we have their own dog bowls and dry dog food we leave out full bowls all the time i occasionally see them eating it but they arent into it usually dogs go nuts over their dog food but our dogs just kind of nibble at it food is food as long as they get sufficient protein fat and a smattering of good carbohydrates along with enough variety to get their nutrients dogs can eat food even if it is human food fresh food is good even for dogs feeding them too much food or food that is full of sugar highly processed food too much indigestible corn wheat and problem foods like onions can be a problem feeding them fresh food freshly prepared is a good thing try and get your mom to go down on the rations and make sure nothing is heavily spiced or full of anything toxic to dogs they would be better off if she divided their portion before she adds any spices meant for human consumption i would leave out most or all of things like pasta and bread plus the peanut butter and leave in the meat and vegetables in the 'wild' dogs would be scavengers and would be eating everything from road kill to cat poop each meal does not have to be 'nutritionally balanced' just as each of our meals does not have to be it is the balance over time and the results that matter consider kibble you take meat grains and vegetables or rough approximations of these of unknown quality and freshness and then chop mix cook at high temperatures add chemicals like preservatives add food coloring and nutrients extrude cut and spray with oil for palatability without food coloring kibble would be grey and without oil on the outside kibble would not be appealing to dogs consider home cooked meals you take meat grains and vegetables of known freshness and quality and then you chop them cook them and serve what is the difference you can always add a doggy vitamin if you are worried about nutritional inadequacy you should definitely be worried about the portions but not about the freshness Cajun cuisine Milk Cuisine of Denmark Food preservation Nutrition Curry Coffee Soul food German cuisine Peruvian cuisine Hot dog Cuisine of Malaysia Cantonese cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Omega-3 fatty acid Egg (food) Domesticated turkey Dog food Ramen French cuisine Cuisine of Africa Hamburger Organic food Acorn Healthy eating Cat Pasta Korean cuisine Chocolate Chicken Cuisine of the Philippines Cereal Raw food diet Hamster Cheese Cuisine of Brazil Fancy rat Folic acid Dog Chicken soup Vitamin C Barbecue Maize Peanut butter Potato French fries Russian cuisine Kosher foods Guinea pig Chinese cuisine Cha chaan teng Taboo food and drink Sauerkraut Dieting Coeliac disease Pancake Porridge Soup Atkins Nutritional Approach Flour Tocopherol Tea Dim sum Agriculture Food guide pyramid Sausage Passover Domestic rabbit Cuisine of Singapore Breastfeeding Miso Soy protein Canadian Chinese cuisine Sushi Ice cream Dairy Vegetarian cuisine Rice Biodiesel Salad Low-carbohydrate diet British cuisine
