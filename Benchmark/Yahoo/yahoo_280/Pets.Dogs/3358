can any one tell me somthing to make my puppy eat although i don't know all the details i can tell you that there may be a number of reasons that it isn't eating if you just purchased the puppy and brought it home it may still be adjusting to the new environment if that is the case the puppy just needs to be reminded of where the food is and shown that it is available and when it is ready it will begin to eat it could also be that the puppy isn't used to the food that you are giving it you should always start off with the same food that it was eating before you brought it home and then slowly and gradually ween it on to a new food by gradually increasing the and mixing the new good into the old food over a course of a week or two another idea is that if it is hard crunchy puppy food it could be having trouble chewing it if that is the case you can usually put the food in a bowl mix it with a little water and heat it up slightly in the microwave mix it up good it should be mushy and then try serving it a lot of times with puppies and kittens preparing their food in this way helps them to digest it a little better until they get a little older i hope this helps Dog training Kitchen Tooth Adjustable gastric band Guinea pig Ron and Fez Socialization Bread Food Kitten The Ashlee Simpson Show Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fancy rat Customs and etiquette of Japan Domestic rabbit Sushi Idli Insulin Theory of conduct Laws of cricket Fecal incontinence Hamster Cat Housebreaking South Beach diet Skinny Puppy Raw food diet Bong Thermoregulation Diarrhea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chewing gum Sento Carburetor Tofu Microwave oven Cheese Fast bowling Stomach cancer Elephant Cuisine of the Southern United States Social rule Tooth enamel Digestion British cuisine Fasting Ferret Dog Korean cuisine About a Boy Japanese cuisine Breastfeeding Cuisine of the Philippines Tlingit Ecology Meal Sewage treatment Plastic Ramen Uranium Ruminant Economics Warm-blooded Ra (board game) Gastroparesis Sugar substitute Dieting Ammonia Halitosis Cookware and bakeware Kosher foods Garfield Brewery Sick Puppy Bengali cuisine Livestock Hiberno-English Nutrition National Football League Eating RuneScape skills Vegetarianism Anorexia nervosa Neolithic Revolution Chinese cuisine Tea Chopsticks Dim sum Bulk vending English grammar Supply and demand Babe Ruth Super Size Me Restaurant Bee RuneScape economy Hebrew calendar Kashrut
