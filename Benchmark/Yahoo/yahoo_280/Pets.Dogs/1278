why is it that dogs hate people blowing in their face yet stick their heads out of car windiws well all dogs are different and some gets bother by it some don't but i think most of them do because they're face is very sensitive to the way that you are blowing on them straight to their faces and eyes and wen they go to the window of your car they do it voluntary and the air is not blowing directly into they're faces or could just be that you take them by surprise and they did not expected that from you and is a reaction of they're body just like if someone would blow in your face without telling you you would probably do the same thing as a body and brain reaction Sin City Three Stooges EastEnders God Emperor of Dune Inspector Gadget Diving Jam (TV series) Joke The Amber Spyglass Marilyn Monroe Oral sex HIV test Sesshomaru Happy Tree Friends 24 Hours of Le Mans Samurai Deeper Kyo Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban John F.
