how do i get my dog to accept new puppy i have a female month old yorkshire terrier lucy and brought home a new female weeks tia on wednesday lucy is very placid and well behaved as i think all dogs should be given rules and limits aswell as love i thought lucy would love a playmate but she just isnt taking to tia im not forcing anything and just letting them get on with things they are fed together lucy backs off until tia is finished sleep together lucy keeps moving away if tia wants to cuddle in i just wondered if they need time or is there something i could do to move things along lucy growls if tia gets a sneaky nip at her leg but apart from that is keeping her distance help i dont feed tia before lucy i feed them at the same time and lucy chooses to back off without getting any agression from tia isnt it lucy s job to show her dominance in her own way rather than enforcing it i dont favour one over the other i treat them equally even given tias age you don't need to 'move things along' it all seems to be going well as it is lucy will growl at tia sometimes its just her way of telling her to back off it is ok that she is keeping her distance tia is probably looking for a mother substitute in lucy but lucy is still only a puppy herself so will not want to be a mother to the little one as tia gets older they will play together more and decide for themselves who is dominant let them sort out their own relationship and try not to be too anxious p s i would feed lucy first Dog training Avenue Q Dog Skinny Puppy Neighbours The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Smoking Room Lucille Ball EastEnders Badly Drawn Kitties Trailer Park Boys Friends Knots Landing Brian Griffin Smallville (Season 4) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Everwood Lucy Robinson Nintendogs Philip J.
