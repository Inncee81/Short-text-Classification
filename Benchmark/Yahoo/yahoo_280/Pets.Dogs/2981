why does my dog keep biting my dog is over months old and he wont quit biting everytime i pick him up he feels the need to bite me and everyone else that picks him up help me he keeps biting because you let him what do you do when he bites if he bites you when you pick him up put him right back down and say no in a firm but not yelling tone of voice and do not pay attention to him for a few moments then go right back to picking him up if he bites repeat the same thing keep doing this until he learns not to bite have other people do the same thing if your dog gets the same response every time he does this behavior he will soon learn that biting is not acceptable and he does not get any further attention once you pick him up and he doesn't bite praise him and tell him what a good boy he is if he then tries to bite put him down and ignore him also start other basic obedience training such as sit stay and how to walk on a leash without pulling when he has had his full set of vaccines enroll him in a training class and follow through with what you learn there do not enroll in a petsmart training class you will just be throwing away money with little results the training class with strengthen your bond with your dog and teach him you are his leader and are to be respected and listened to also have him neutered as soon as he is old enough this will help prevent other unwanted behavioral issues and help curb other dominance problems be loving be firm and most of all be consistant you're reaction to his poor behavior today needs to be the same reaction he receives every day and from everyone this is how dog's learn good luck Dog training Obedience training Dog Alexander Technique Milton H.
