can a dog's vulva be too small to allow the dog to be spayed i know this sounds bizarre but i swear someone told me their dog could not be spayed for this reason i just kept thinking that miniature breeds get spayed so why not a standard sized dog my concern is the risk of pyometra for this lovely dog if you have any animal technician training or veterinarian experience i'd appreciate your input this is not my dog but she is a sweetheart thanks for any insite you can give me the person who owns this dog is going to have the dog spayed but she was told by her husbad that the vet told her this i asked if she had seen a vet report or any documentation to support this claim and admits rather naively she trusted the other person she loves this dog immensely and feels rather foolish to have believed the story given this loved pet will be spayed in the near future spaying involves opening up the female below the stomach area and removing the uterus and ovaries it's an ovariohysterectomy surgery since hte vulva is on the outside end of the female genetalia the size of it does not affect spaying the dog the person that told you this was either making something up because they didn't want to spay the dog uneducated on spaying or misunderstood something a vet or other person told him her an ovariohysterectomy ohe or spay is the complete removal of the female reproductive tract the ovaries oviducts uterine horns and the uterus are removed not only does this procedure prevent the animal from becoming pregnant it also eliminates the twice yearly heat cycles sounds like there was some sort of misunderstanding in the explanation she should talk with her vet tell them the story that the guy told her and see if he knows why someone would say that Dog Ferret Cat Sterilization (surgical procedure) Domestic rabbit Endometriosis Pet skunk Sex organ Estrus cycle Veterinarian Androgen insensitivity syndrome In vitro fertilisation Docking Castration Guinea pig Intersex surgery Menstrual cycle Female reproductive system (human) Uterus Abortion Female genital cutting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vagina Endometrial cancer Colorectal cancer Cancer Human cloning Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Puberty Housebreaking Killian documents Rabies Ovary Ectopic pregnancy Stomach cancer Traumatic incident reduction Garfield Orgasm Shaggy dog story Prostate cancer Tooth enamel Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Animal testing Infertility Transgender Ovulation Sexual reproduction Oral sex Polycystic ovary syndrome Microchip implant (animal) Peter Griffin Childbirth Pelvic inflammatory disease God Emperor of Dune Socialization Dobermann Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Obstetrics Fancy rat Shark Scientology beliefs and practices Endometrium Pregnancy Kodocha Classified information Uterine fibroids Human sexual behavior Oral contraceptive Plame affair Sant Thakar Singh Sonic the Hedgehog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Feral cat Pretty Good Privacy Fertility awareness Caesarean section The Death Gate Cycle Partial-birth abortion The Smoking Room Sexual intercourse Extreme Programming Progesterone Breech birth Pit bull Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Toy dog Poodle Past teachings of Prem Rawat Clitoris Plame affair timeline Sex assignment Butters Stotch Acanthocephala Animal shelter
