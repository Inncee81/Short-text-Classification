new pup chihuahua coming home in a week what should i get so i haven't had a dog in a while so i was wondering can someone make me a list of what to get at petco or petsmart btw i did my research just need a list so i can write down so i dont forget anything one thing you might also want to do is if there are litter mates and for the mom have the breeder rub them with a towel or small blanket and give that to you that way the transition won't be as dramatic in addition ask the breeder what dog food the puppy is on now one of the biggest mistakes new owners make is switching the food abruptly if you feel the food is a high quality food then keep them on it and follow the feeding schedules already established nylabone only give when you are there to monitor at this age stay away from rawhide kong helps with teething be sure to get the puppy one and freeze it baby ambosol works great for teething small puppy toys only bitter apple spray on thing you do not want the puppy to chew on including furniture baby gates do not shampoo until after all vaccinations and use puppy shampoo only shampoo once a month i use bath wipes for dogs in between or pro line self rinse plus self rinsing shampoo clippers you might get baby nail clippers for a pup that small if you do buy a crate do not get a wire one for a dog that small it could be disasterous and buy one that gives them enough room to stand turn but not enough room to sleep and then have room to pee otherwise you will never get her him potty trained a to go water container like the bottle ones the obvious leash collar and loosen it only to the point that you can fit two fingers through high quality dog food look for ones that have real do not contain by products that could be any part of the animal from legs to beak we use merrick and solid gold and have had no problems a microchip done at the vets be careful about getting treats instead use dry kibble that way you wont experience accidents while you are away stainless steel bowls one great book puppies for dummies even as a breeder i still have it possibly an emergency first aid kit or book ask for a trainer to help you i used to be one there and it helped a lot of people congrats and good luck Dog training Dog Hamster Pet skunk Fancy rat Ferret Crate training Housebreaking Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Sento Dairy Care Bears Breed registry Plastic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests Shampoo Ranma __ characters Cat Socialization Garfield Scooby-Doo Elephant Professional wrestling match types Microchip implant (animal) Customs and etiquette of Japan Nestl__ Nintendogs Upholstery Shaggy dog story Tea Psoriasis Kim Possible Dobermann Emergency preparedness Sea-Monkey Livestock American Pit Bull Terrier Brewery Docking Chinchilla Childbirth New York Giants Dog food German Shepherd Dog The Apprentice 2 Kangaroo Japanese toilet Ron and Fez Dollar store Japanese tea ceremony Iditarod Comanche Trailer Park Boys Thermal power station Mixed-breed dog Kodocha Bulk vending Characters of Naruto Textile manufacturing Hemp Knife Dog breeding Agriculture Rugrats Fire fighting Sick Puppy The Contender (television series) Champagne (beverage) Cannabis cultivation Canary My Little Pony Paranoia Agent Sauna Jam (TV series) Tooth Hyperthermia Happy Tree Friends Drill bit 101 Dalmatians: The Series Television Nintendo Halitosis
