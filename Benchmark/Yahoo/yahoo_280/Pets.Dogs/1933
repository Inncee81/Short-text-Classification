do you think breeder contracts are fair so i've been looking for a puppy and i've noticed that a lot of breeders now make you sign a contract some of them are great because they simply list things such as the puppy will be well cared for not abused and if the owner gives up the puppy at any time the breeder gets him her back a lot also have spay neuter contracts for dogs who will be strictly pets which isn't too bad but i've noticed others are pretty demanding some restrict the foods you can feed it i've even seen one that listed several premium foods you couldn't use and some of them even make you agree to an all natural diet others mandate that you name the dog like kennels' dog which seems a little ridiculous i mean the dog is mine now not theirs anymore why should i name him her as if he's theirs especially if he'll just be a pet and not a show dog or a breeder so what are your thoughts on these contracts do you think they are fair what parts do you agree disagree with oh and don't worry i don't plan on buying a puppy from any of them i'm just curious to see if everyone thinks some of the contracts and breeders are a little crazy like i do every breeder is different as a breeder of standard poodles i wanted my clients to agree to the first things you listed the food issue is to make sure your pup is getting all the nutrients it needs for healthy growth the all natural diet is for your pets health you should feed your pup as you like however foods that have many fillers are not good for your dog plus you have more yard waste i usually give samples of canidae with my pups it is an all natural diet including chicken rice and vitamins that's it your dog doesn't need extra fillers that could cause allergies etc the kennel name thing is one i never insisted on yet i would explain it to my clients what they mean by the name is when you register the dog with the akc you also get your dog's lineage for example my kennel name is dallion so you have thirty spaces on the form you send in to give the dog a paper name so maybe a client would decide on a favorable name such as dallion's cleopatra they would have selected the name based on the breeding line in one instance they did call the female cleo but you can decide what to name your dog the pedigree is to show the lineage with the akc and nothing more i just purchased a new pup from ohio he came from high hope acres so i named him high hope's merlin's magic he goes by merlin so don't worry about the name once you get the papers it will be up to you it's just that if the dog comes from a long line of champions in the ring and you give him the kennel name it also proves what line he comes from i hope this helps Dog American Kennel Club Domestic rabbit Docking Dog show Guinea pig Golden Retriever Pet skunk German Shepherd Dog American Pit Bull Terrier Havanese Mixed-breed dog Cat Dog breed Ferret Hamster Dog breeding Breed registry Dog agility Puppy mill Obedience training Jack Russell Terrier Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Dog training Great Dane Livestock Nutrition Basset Hound Theory of conduct Domestication Organic food Toy dog Shaggy dog story Whippet Gray Wolf Agriculture Belgian Shepherd Dog Keeshond Fancy rat Contract Shetland Sheepdog Alaskan husky RuneScape quests Kodocha Scooby-Doo Tocopherol United Kennel Club English Springer Spaniel Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Pit bull Poodle Chihuahua (dog) Rottweiler Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder English Cocker Spaniel Housebreaking Siberian Husky Beethoven (film) Toy Fox Terrier Newfoundland (dog) Folic acid Australian Cattle Dog Dachshund Dog food Manx (cat) Genetically modified food Vitamin Cat food Pet store 101 Dalmatians: The Series Chicken 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Knots Landing Monster Rancher monsters Intellectual property Health insurance The Apprentice 2 German Shorthaired Pointer Neopets Pekingese Dobermann Breed club American Eskimo Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Philosophy of language 1957 World Series Rat Terrier Sea-Monkey Vitamin C Pomeranian (dog) Discus (fish) Aladdin (1992 film) Chinook (dog) Coyote The Ashlee Simpson Show
