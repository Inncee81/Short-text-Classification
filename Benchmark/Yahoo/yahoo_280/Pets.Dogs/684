i love both breeds but i can only get one dog which should i get pomeranian or shih tzu oh that's a tough one my opinion is that everyone should have at least a six pack of pomeranians but i've gotten to know shih tzus though friends who own them and they are all sweet clever wonderful little dogs i guess it comes down to how much you exercise every day shih tzu puppies are very active but they tend to slow down quite a bit as they mature poms on the other hand are always ready to go my eleven year old pom is still up for a four hour hike i can't imagine an older shih tzu making that trek another difference is that poms will be yappy if you let them since i can't stand the yip yap i've trained my dogs not to do it but i still have to remind them every now and then oh and grooming i find pom's coats easier to keep in shape than shih tzu's Shetland Sheepdog Shih Tzu Nintendogs Pomeranian (dog) Dog Toy dog Housebreaking Havanese Gray Wolf Keeshond Dog training Homestar Runner Cat German Shepherd Dog Alaskan husky Nicole Richie Golden Retriever The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Poodle hybrids Yorkshire Terrier Labrador Retriever Zoophilia American Pit Bull Terrier Dog show Hiking Australian Cattle Dog Tibetan Terrier Horse Hamster Guinea pig Belgian Shepherd Dog Shaggy dog story Pekingese Puppy mill Stinkoman 20X6 Breed standard Komondor Cairn Terrier Obedience training Spitz Jack Russell Terrier Kerry Blue Terrier Siberian Husky Border Terrier West Highland White Terrier Laika Border Collie Fancy rat Basset Hound Guide dog 2005 Iditarod Dalmatian Ferret Coyote Iditarod Marching band Dobermann Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Newfoundland (dog) Parachute Menstrual cup Bernese Mountain Dog Bark (dog) USS Wickes (DD-578) Whippet Eternal Champions USS Picuda (SS-382) Billboard Hot 100 Italian Greyhound Spot the Dog Humphrey Bogart Skye Terrier Smooth Collie Carl Wilson The Art of War Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Am730 Brian Griffin Dog breed Laozi Felis sapiens Table tennis Haven (TNG episode) Korea Jindo Dog Ranma __ characters Joan Crawford Wendy Testaburger English Springer Spaniel Nick Nemeth Portuguese Water Dog Martial art Tenterfield Terrier Tasmanian Devil The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Maltese (dog)
