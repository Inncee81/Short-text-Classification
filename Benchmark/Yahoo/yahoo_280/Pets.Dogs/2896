serious papillons and good natured goofballs introverted papillons and papillons who love everyone if you acquire a papillon puppy you can't know for sure what he or she will grow up to be like because a good number of purebred puppies do not grow up to conform to the norm now let's look at some common characteristics for this breed if you want a dog who is small easy to carry and doesn't take up much space is fine boned and elegant light footed and graceful has a lovely feathered coat is lively and playful is one of the brightest and most trainable of the toy breeds is polite with strangers a papillon may be right for you if you don't want to deal with the fragility of toy breeds see below excessive daintiness and timidity suspiciousness or highstrung temperaments in some lines or when not socialized enough chasing instincts birds mice flying insects from their spaniel heritage regular brushing and combing shedding barking housebreaking difficulties especially in the cold and rain a papillon may not be right for you if i were considering a papillon my major concerns would be fragility too many people acquire a toy breed puppy without understanding how incredibly fragile a toy breed is you can seriously injure or kill a papillon by stepping on him or by sitting on him when he's curled under a blanket or pillow where he frequently likes to sleep and papillons can seriously injure or kill themselves by leaping from your arms or off the back of your sofa a larger dog can grab a papillon and break his neck with one quick shake owning a toy breed means constant supervision and surveillance of what's going on around your tiny dog papillons must always be kept indoors in a safely fenced yard or on leash they are just too easy to injure when not under your complete control papillons are not suited to children no matter how well meaning the child children cannot help being clumsy and that a child meant well is little solace to a papillon who has been accidentally stepped on sat on rolled on squeezed or dropped onto the patio most papillons feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making and stress and fearfulness even defensive biting may be the result providing enough socialization papillons need extensive exposure to people and to unusual sights and sounds otherwise their natural caution can become shyness or suspiciousness which are difficult to live with grooming to keep their feathered coat free of mats papillons require regular brushing and combing and occasional trimming shedding papillons shed quite a bit their hairs come off on your hands when you pet them and stick to your clothing upholstery and carpeting be prepared for frequent vacuuming barking papillons are often too quick to sound the alarm at every new sight and sound you have to be equally quick to stop them to teach your papillon to listen to you respect training is mandatory my papillon training page discusses the program you need housebreaking toy breeds are almost always difficult to housebreak it is so easy for them to sneak behind a chair or under a small table and it takes only a few seconds for the deed to be done the results can be hard to see when you don't see it you don't correct it and so the bad habit becomes established if you hope to housebreak a toy breed consistent crate training is mandatory papillons should not be loosed in the house for many months until their small internal organs become strong enough for reliable control if you're considering an adult papillon there are plenty of adult papillons who have already proven themselves not to have negative characteristics if you find such an adult don't let typical breed negatives worry you when you acquire a puppy you're acquiring potential what he one day will be so typical breed characteristics are very important but when you acquire an adult you're acquiring what he already is Mixed-breed dog Cat
