boyfriend's dog my bf has a small dog whenever we have sex she jumps on the bed and tries to lick one of us then he gets up and puts her in another room i think it's gross she also barks all the time if he is not paying her attention and doesn't listen to him unless he has food in his hand he seems to reinforce her bad behavior by giving her food when she is barking sometimes instead of cuddling with me while watching a movie he lets his dog sit on his lap and pets her he also lets her sleep in his bed at night and talks to her like he talks to me gorgeous baby etc when he is affectionate towards me the dog gets upset so she starts barking at me and scratching is all this normal what should i do about this dogs are very jealous creatures especially when they are spoiled all the time also dogs are naturally loyal and protective they will often growl bark or lick people when they are having sex dogs do this because they hear the groaning or the slapping of the two bodies together they think somebody is getting hurt and want to help do not have sex when the dog is in the room guys and their dogs i don't know what it is they get this total attachment thing and spoil the crap out of the damn animal personally i think it is annoying as all hell but for some reason they get some weird kick out of bonding with a messy needy animal i think it's the needy part you could try turning it into a joke when the dog gets all jealous when he is giving you attention you could joke and say should i get on the floor and wine bark and scratch at you too i give my boyfriend a hard time and turn it into a joke and he takes it pretty well after a couple months his dog didn't get so jealous anymore she still does sometimes but not as much she's a pound lab too Cat Kim Possible Dog training Avenue Q Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Milton H.
