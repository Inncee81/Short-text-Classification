my pregnant dog may have a slight discharge she does not seem lethargic though could it be pyometria many pregnant dogs will have a slight discharge especially when they get closer to term this is normal and nothing to be concerned about especially if the dog is active eating and in good health otherwise but if you are concerned a vet's visit is always best pyometras infection in the uterus occur more commonly after the dog has given birth or in intact non spayed females after they have had a heat cycle within the first couple of months after the heat cycle pyometras can either be closed where the cervix isn't open and pus builds up in the uterus making the dog very sick fairly quickly and often the dog ends up in critical condition needing emergency surgery or they can be open where the cervix is open and pus is able to escape the uterus the dog is still sick but the symptoms are less severe and the treatment not quite as critical as in a closed pyometra in either case the dog needs veterinary care and most often spaying is a necessity the frequent incidence of and usually critical emergency condition of pyometras is the main reason that female dogs that will not be bred or will no longer be bred should be spayed many owners and breeders feel that their older females are too old to be spayed quite the contrary the current state of veterinary medicine makes surgeries in older pets much safer and having the surgery performed when the dog is in the best health is less risky and less expensive than waiting until the dog is extremely sick and in an emergency situation where the chances of your dog's survival are greatly decreased Dog Childbirth Cat Abortion Pregnancy Guinea pig Cancer Endometriosis Premature birth Miscarriage Pet skunk Fertility awareness Intact dilation and extraction Ferret Birth control Androgen insensitivity syndrome Intersex surgery Breech birth Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obstetrics Docking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Menstrual cycle Medicine Gonorrhoea Health insurance Epilepsy Infertility Oral contraceptive Castration Endometrial cancer Traumatic brain injury Breastfeeding Psoriasis Insulin Tooth enamel Chronic fatigue syndrome Fancy rat Cephalic disorder Infantilism Hypoglycemia Spina bifida Animal shelter Heartworm Rabies Diazepam Veterinarian In vitro fertilisation Oral sex Stroke Pneumonia Prenatal diagnosis Colorectal cancer Sexually-transmitted infection Housebreaking Hysterectomy Nuclear power Animal testing Emergency department Decompression sickness Gynaecology Cytomegalovirus Menstrual cup German Shepherd Dog Folic acid Stomach cancer Ectopic pregnancy Herpes simplex virus Pelvic inflammatory disease Great Dane Chlorpromazine Estrus cycle Sexual reproduction Intersexuality Asthma Twin Myocardial infarction Bipolar disorder Nuclear reactor Aphasia First aid Pit bull Livestock Sex assignment Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cerebral palsy Roe v.
