my mom doesn't like puppies i really want a puppy and my mom doesn't like them i got the chance to babysit one and my two cats were scared at first then they got really used to it she says that she doesn't want to get one because they poop and smell but i said that cats poop too and we could give it a bath plus my dad says i have to be responsible then we would get one so of course i started making my bed my mom's bed cleaning my brother's room and doing everything to get a puppy like for forever but still nothing i know what kind i want too a black lab puppy what should i do i was in your exact position at one point too but i finally got my dog you gotta understand dogs and cats are different i have both and at least cats go in a litterbox and clean themselves dogs poop all over the place and believe me when that dog grows up its difficult to bathe a black lab puppy wont stay small forever they grow super fast and soon it will be huge will you still love it when it loses its puppy dog looks and its big try explaining to them that you really understand what it takes to have a dog its not just feeding them and baths they need training daily walks and plenty of attention again this is a difference between dogs and cats cats are fine on their own they're very independent but dogs are pack animals and get lonely easily just keep helping out around the house and hinting to your parents about the dog and im sure you'll get it soon Housebreaking Dog training The Fairly OddParents Shaggy dog story Pitaten Garfield Fancy rat Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Sonic the Hedgehog Labrador Retriever Tag Dog Social rule The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy RuneScape quests Ren and Stimpy Calvin and Hobbes KaBlam!
