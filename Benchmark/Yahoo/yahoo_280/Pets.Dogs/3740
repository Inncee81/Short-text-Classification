help my border collie is going to be a mommy in days i have a beautiful border collie about years old and i just found out unexpectedly this morning that not only is she pregnant but that she's probably going to give birth in days before you decide i'm a clueless wonder the vet said he was surprised as well since she had no signs besides enlarged nipples which is what prompted the vet visit today so i'm still reeling from the shock my husband and i just moved weeks ago to our apartment which ever so conveniently has white carpet luckily our manager said it would be ok as long as we found homes for the puppies and took responsibility for damages but i need some advice and help what's the best way of going about setting up an area for a dog to whelp in a carpeted apartment rubber mats covered with blankets maybe one of those indoor exercise pens after reading an article about what to do during whelping i'm near panic lol any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated by both me and my little mommy p s after reviewing some posted answers i would like to add that i understand the importance of spaying neutering pets i have cats both of whom are fixed and have routinely followed this rule my entire life gwen is a purebred border collie and was not spayed intentionally because we initially planned to breed her since then we've reconsidered but we got careless during the last few months while we were planning a wedding and a move hours away and setting up a new home i appreciate the gentle reminders posted by some to others who feel this is an opportunity to insult your crude comments are not appreciated this was an accident and i feel badly enough already let he who is without sin cast the first stone you can find a baby play pen at a garage sale or something bc even if you put mats down the dog will move off of them get someting enclosed when she has them make sure she begins cleaning them asap the bag needs to be broken and they need stimulation if she doesnt do it at first you break the bag and use a warm wet rag and rub the pups firmly and quickly then put them on the teats if she is a first time mom then you will probably have to show her what to do also right before she gives birth she will leak a discharge and her water will break her vagina will also swell you will see when she starts to go into labor with them keep her as relaxed as possible during labor and delivery she will probably want to go outside thinking she has to use the bathroom watch her very closely if you do let her out good luck and god bless Cat Friends Breastfeeding Housebreaking Guinea pig EastEnders Pet skunk Hamster Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Domestic rabbit Condom South Park Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Socialization Baseball Birth control Characters of Lost Toilet humour Good Times Oh My Goddess!
