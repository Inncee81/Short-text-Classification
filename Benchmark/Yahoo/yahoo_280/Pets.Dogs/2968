isn't my boston supposed to be bigger my boston terrier panda is going to be months old on but she looks about months old she barely weighs pounds she eats very well she is caught up on her shots she gets dewormed every month all is well its just that it seems like she doesn't grow both of her parents were around pounds each and panda was the 'runt' of the litter i have a year old male boston who is pounds and i don't remember him taking as long as she is to grow is she going to be abnormally small when do bostons generally stop growing will she hit a growth spirt at all bostons bred to the breed standard generally weigh over pounds and up to pounds if they are over pounds they are technically too big your girl's parents are about average size for bostons since your girl was the runt she may develop a little more slowly but i don't think she's likely to get to be more than about pounds i've heard of dogs this size coming from parents that are within the standard the only concern and you don't mention it is whether you had planned to try to breed her one day with her this small i'd say you should absolutely not breed her bostons often need a c section no matter what size they are with her this small she might have a very difficult time with pregnancy and probably couldn't free whelp so go ahead and talk with your vet about when to spay her bostons are normally about their adult weight by the time they are a year old over the remaining to years of their average lifespan they may add a pound or two just as people do as we age but they don't double in size panda should be past all of her growth spurts since she's almost months old you really shouldn't need to deworm her every month normally puppies are wormed a few times and then you just get a yearly fecal check for worms that wouldn't be contributing to her small size though what food are you giving her most bostons do better on a premium food that is formulated for performance dogs examples are eukanuba performance nutro natural choice performance etc i've never fed hill's science diet as the other person mentioned but if they have a performance blend you could try it the deal with the performance blends is they have more protein and fat as well as some extra vitamins some bostons thrive on anything but many need this little extra from their food but even with that panda will probably always be small she's not rare or teacup and she's definitely not weird or retarded she's just small that's a good thing sometimes collars sweaters heartgard frontline and all that other stuff is cheaper for the smaller dogs just love her as she is and don't worry too much as long as she's happy and active and eats a good quality food and eats it well then she's just fine Pet skunk Guinea pig Dog Domestic rabbit Garfield Puberty Humphrey Bogart Hamster Tocopherol Cat Fecal incontinence Ferret Milk Kitten Folic acid Gray Wolf Fancy rat Giant Panda Shaggy dog story Toy dog Mixed-breed dog Human height Nutrition Equine conformation Yorkshire Terrier Anorexia nervosa Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Tasmanian Devil Piccolo Junior Saga Atkins Nutritional Approach Doomsday argument Dog training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cheese Theory of conduct Poker jargon The Shining (film) Liger Super Size Me Urinary incontinence Theodicy Veganism The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Birth weight Friends West Highland White Terrier Taboo food and drink Wood Sly Cooper Iditarod Controversies in autism Dog breeding Norman Borlaug Brown Bear Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hypoglycemia Housebreaking Overpopulation Salmon Ranma __ characters Trailer Park Boys CPU cache Coeliac disease Kakapo Goodness and value theory Egg (food) Calorie restriction The Fairly OddParents Discus (fish) Organic food Domestication Intelligent design Lion Anemia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Ren and Stimpy Dobermann Autism Fox hunting Social rule
