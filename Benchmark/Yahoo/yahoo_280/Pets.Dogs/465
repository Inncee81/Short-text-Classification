dogs in captivity someone on here keeps talking about keeping dogs in captivity how does everyone feel about this how would your dog do in the wild my dog could probably catch his own food but might easily get hit by cars if he was anywhere developed as he has a one track mind squirrels bunnies he also is a bit of a wimp and gets dominated by every dog in the dog park this could mean death in the wild i believe the dog is now a domesticated animal and most could not survive in the wild anyone else's opinions i would particulary like scubapair's opinion and an explanation of why he feels that way releasing domesticated animals back into the wild is like clipping a bird's wings and then expecting it to fly much of the natural instinct is taken away from them in the process of domestication leaving them unable to fend for themselves most dogs lack the ability to effectively hunt due to the fact that they have never had to develop that skill and now it would be hard for them to do so quickly enough to avoid starvation also they are used to being social with humans and i believe that to just rip them out of that environment that they are used to would be more than cruel Cat Dog Gray Wolf Domestication Hunting Dog training Livestock Lion Pet skunk The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Guns, Germs, and Steel Neolithic Revolution Domestic rabbit Tasmanian Devil Elephant Bat Feral child Rabies Tenshinhan Feral Hamster Feral cat Orca Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Working dog Extinction Animal rights Animal cognition Kangaroo Tooth enamel Human Human nature Falconry Artificial selection Aztec Wile E.
