question about a border collie pup we bought a border collie pup yesterday its only months old we heard that collies need spiecal care is that true and if so what care we are also having a problem with feeding coz the last owners put food out all day for him to eat when ever he liked but we would rather feed him breakfast and dinner to eat there and then as we have another dog that would eat it otherwise i have just recently given him his dinner and had to feed him out of my hand bit by bit is there anything i can do to change the ruteen please help first of all feed the new dog separately from your other dog at least at first place the food down call the animal and allow a period of time i usually use minutes after minutes remove the food do not give food until the next scheduled meal ie morning and night he may miss a meal or two it won't hurt him unless he is terribly underweight but will quickly learn to eat at feeding time do not hand feed or you're sentencing yourself to a longterm problem collies need no special care outside of grooming which should be done daily make it a treat for your dog and he'll come to love his brush good luck and enjoy Guinea pig Hamster Breakfast Meal Dog Dog training Breastfeeding Domestic rabbit Stomach cancer English grammar Nerpa Passover Japanese tea ceremony Earless seal Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cuisine of Denmark Pet skunk Care Bears Obedience training Neopets Barrister Livestock Chicken Cat Gray Wolf Sea-Monkey Sea Otter 613 mitzvot Customs and etiquette of Japan Futurama (TV series - season 5) Scooby-Doo The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dairy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shark Anorexia nervosa Folic acid Tooth Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Tea (meal) SS Andrea Doria Gastroparesis Have I Got News For You Bat Veganism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ferret Lisa the Vegetarian Garfield Domesticated turkey Shetland Sheepdog Jon Secada Ramadan Border Collie Insulin Eucharist Tasmanian Devil Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fancy rat Ron and Fez Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Theory of conduct Halitosis Our Gang Foie gras 2000 Australian Grand Prix Korban Fecal incontinence Anopheles Hypoglycemia Tick Shit USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Bedbug Thanksgiving Lunch Korean cuisine Elephant Charles Peace Terri Schiavo Timon and Pumbaa Vegetarianism Sukkot Cuisine of the Philippines Hannibal Lecter USS Trigger (SS-237) Roman eating and drinking Collision detection Publicly funded medicine Food Rule of St Benedict Bread Mixed-breed dog Kodocha Compiler optimization Hygiene Coyote Jewish holiday
