is my dog pregnant my female who was months on july was spot bleeding weeks ago which would have been starting the th of july we tried to breed her july th he did not completely lock into her for the full time he tried times but ever since that day she has been acting differently really loving clingy sleeping a lot now here is the problem today aug rd she started to bleed and i mean bleed dark i tried calling our vet and they are gone for the weekend i am just wondering what is going on i had read online a couple of places that when females are first pregnant they can bleed on another note we have an electric fence where she wears the collar that shocks her if she goes over the line i have not seen any male dogs in our neighborhood but i know that don't mean a male couldn't have wandered in the yard and mated i am concerned about her bleeding is she in heat or could she very well be pregnant thanks p s the sire was a top bloodline english bu ok for clarification cause apparently some of you are smoking something this has nothing to do with money not sure how you could draw to that conclusion there is nothing in my question even remotely suggesting we are doing this for some sort of sick profit additionally i asked a question and was looking for answers not opinions if you don't have anything constructive to say or suggest then just move along cause your opinions do nothing for her period and not that it has anything to do with the current question we are going to have her fixed but had read on web that dogs who have a litter or two before being fixed have less problems later in life in addition we wanted a litter for ourselves and our family members lastly we take both of our dogs the other is a fixed male cockapoo from the shelter for walks and have only used the invisible fence for training purposes on the female only now if you have an intelligent answer suggestion please respond seriously did i miss something when i asked a question on here all i have received is smart ass and hateful comments from people who obviously have nothing better to do then slam everyone who they think are not as good or up to their standards what is wrong with asking a question about my dog being pregnant no she isn't hemorrhaging or is she in pain whatsoever is it wrong to want to breed my dog it isn't like i am going to go dump them on the side of the road nor was it that i just left he outside tied to a tree while she is in heat so any dog could tag her all i asked was a question i didn't ask for everyone to chastise me for it let me tell you this our dogs are spoiled just as spoiled as our kids i am a stay at home mom and a student if i would have thought that any harm would have came from my dog mating i would not have done it so get it out of your head that i am a horrible human for trying to mate my dog some of us more sane types on here call the people blasting you the spay neuter police it wouldn't matter if you did wait till she was years old which would have been best but hindsight is they would blast you for breeding and then having the audacity to come on to yahoo questions to ask a question most of them only want show dogs that have championships behind them to breed never mind the fact that many great bloodlines of dogs have never been shown in the many generations they have been around the bloodline has been proven to produce dogs designed for the work that they do these dogs excel at hunting herding pulling and guarding but that doesn't matter to them all they care about is whether or not they have won in a beauty pageant of sorts now to your question your best bet would be to find an emergency vet and taking her in to be sure it could very well be a miscarriage as someone else mentioned or something far more serious good luck Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Cat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Characters of Naruto Piccolo Junior Saga Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Plame affair Domestic rabbit Garfield EastEnders The Inside Futurama (TV series - season 5) Avenue Q Kurt Cobain Social rule Humphrey Bogart Horse Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Eddie Guerrero Theodicy Abortion debate Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fox hunting Sharon Tate Ferret Pet skunk Sin City Friends God Emperor of Dune The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Time Out of Mind Abortion Knots Landing Late Night with Conan O'Brien Jumpstart 3rd Grade Killian documents Kim Possible Great Teacher Onizuka Kodocha The Subtle Knife The Catcher in the Rye Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Game show YuYu Hakusho Ocean's Twelve Ben Johnson (athlete) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Stomach cancer A Canticle for Leibowitz Ontological argument Gray Wolf Neighbours The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Russian joke Glen Jacobs Professional wrestling slang Dog training Joke Professional wrestling match types David Beckham German Shepherd Dog The Time Machine Milton H.
