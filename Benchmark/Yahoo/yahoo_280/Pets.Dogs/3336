what time does pet haven open and do they have any openings to take a dog to be put up for adoption today i have a doberman mix that needs a place to go today he was supposed to go to guardian angel but at the last minute they didnt have enough room for him i am leavin out of town for two weeks and i am in a tight spot he has to go because of my landlord i have no where else for him to go please take him for me he needs a home good luck with that one you can try to find another rescue to take him but they normally all have waiting lists you could board him until you get back and get him back on the wait list for another shelter or rescue can you ask friends and family for help for short term this is your responsibily to your dog if you take him to the pound they can euthanize him immediately the reason shelters and rescues don't have room is someone doesn't adopt like they promised or a foster a family emergency etc i'm sure they will take him when they can you will just have to board him or get him in with friends or family until then i'm going to ask the obvious question now will your landlord give you a little more time if he knows you are sending the dog to a rescue and he's on a wait list Animal shelter Rescue group Dobermann Pet skunk Dog training Animal euthanasia Golden Retriever New York Giants The Pet Sounds Sessions Ron Weasley Shaggy dog story Domain Name System Fire fighting Jumpstart 3rd Grade Leasehold estate Burke and Wills expedition Maison Ikkoku Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Philip J.
