is it good to have female dogs i have a female yorkie and my cousins have a female carin terrier they just got a new dog and they asked their doctor if it mattered if they got a female or male he said they should get a male so they ended up getting a male cavachon i really want another dog preferably a female but would i have to get a male not necessarily it's mostly a question of personalities i would suggest that when you find a dog you might want ask the owner breeder whoever it may be if your can bring you dog with you when choosing your new pup and see how they interact together after you have made your choice be aware there may be times when they get aggravated with each other and will go at it but in most circumstances these issues will work themselves out the issue if there is one will have to be settled between the two dogs it's not something you can regulate but rather will have to referee until they settle it between themselves American Pit Bull Terrier Dog show Mixed-breed dog Gender role Dog Contract Staffordshire Bull Terrier Gender-neutral language Yorkshire Terrier Tenterfield Terrier Working dog Pit bull Portuguese Water Dog Jack Russell Terrier Economic inequality Order of succession Salic law Dog agility Free will Philosophy of language Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Nintendogs Boston Terrier Transgender Hip dysplasia American Kennel Club Dog breeding Dog training Sexual selection Breed registry Dachshund Rat Terrier Best of Breed English Springer Spaniel Scooby-Doo Border Terrier Skye Terrier Companion dog Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Golden Retriever Biology and sexual orientation Morality Referendum Abortion debate Estrus cycle Taikyoku shogi Krypto the Superdog Same-sex marriage in Canada Catalan grammar Australian Cattle Dog Goodness and value theory Corporate governance Appeal Intellectual property Toy Fox Terrier Public domain Breed standard Toy dog Fox Terrier Tibetan Terrier Predestination Bull Terrier Homosexuality and Christianity Gray Wolf Consensus decision-making Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Labrador Retriever Theodicy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Expert system Pete the Pup Patch Adams (film) Primogeniture Koan Housebreaking Animal shelter German Shepherd Dog Gender identity Our Gang Griffon Bruxellois Community Artificial selection Homeopathy Docking Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Heir Apparent Great Dane Sexual orientation Keeshond Miniature Fox Terrier Person Ferret British monarchy Chesapeake Bay Retriever Governor-General of Australia Gun dog Dog breed Moral relativism Dog hybrids and crossbreeds
