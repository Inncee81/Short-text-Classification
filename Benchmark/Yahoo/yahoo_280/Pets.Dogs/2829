how can i make my dog not scared of something my dog is terrified of the ironing board and iron and the hoover the hoover he just barks and growls at but the ironing board he won't go near or go in the room if its up if he has to go in the room he sits as far away as he can and shakes is there anything i could do with him so he won't be scared anymore oh he's a collie cross if that's any help and he's n half years old i'd recommend putting him on a leash and walking him by the ironing board be careful with what you do before you setup the ironing board are you saying or doing something that clues him into it if you keep him on a leash and make him face the ironing board he should be able to get past being scared if you keep him there long enough maybe minutes or more he should realize the ironing board isn't going to do anything to him and get over that hump if he acts nervous shaky avoid talking to him in a consoling tone he might interpret your tone as reason to keep acting that way ironing board would be easier to start with because there is no noise once you get that down move on to the hoover start with that turned off just sitting in the room with him as he conquers that turn it on but don't move it eventually move up to it being on and moving avoid playing games with him some of us make the mistake of thinking it's cute that the dog attacks the vacuum Dog training Obedience training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Maka dai dai shogi Taikyoku shogi Chess strategy and tactics Tenjiku shogi The Time Machine Ranma __ characters Milton H.
