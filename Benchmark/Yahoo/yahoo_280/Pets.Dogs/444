my pup is weeks and has suddenly started to limp vet gave a anti inflametry but to no avail i need help and advise i love her dearly sha is a german shepherd and has huge paws my guess is that she has pulled a muscle and an x ray will not reveal this if it an actual paw that is the problem look for splinters in her pads a bite wound any lumps and bumps and check her nails if it is a leg that seems to be troubling her look out for bite wounds lumps and bumps and feel the joints in her legs if she cries out when you touch a certain point its probably muscle strain bandage her leg if it is this as this will support the damaged muscle and when she's resting lay a heat pad or water bottle with semi hot water in it over the site of pain its not overly important at the moment to take her for walks as long as she can get out to go to the toilet she'll be ok puppies heal very quickly so please dont worry too much although when you love them like you love her its distressing seeing them like it another piece of advice i can give you and one i hope you heed is change your vet he's useless take care x Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guinea pig Wound Dog Breastfeeding Equine conformation First aid Fecal incontinence Dog training Bruise Urinary incontinence Poliomyelitis Piccolo Junior Saga Naruto jutsu The Death Gate Cycle Gray Wolf Professional wrestling slang Diving Backstroke Fancy rat The Amber Spyglass Weight training Kodocha Proprioception Iditarod Chiropractic Cat Mattress Happy Tree Friends Strap-on dildo Traumatic brain injury Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Descendants of Darkness Ferret Sport rowing Internal ballistics Hey Jude Hip dysplasia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Repetitive strain injury Professional wrestling holds Oddworld Trigun Menstrual cup Chronic fatigue syndrome Childbirth Certified Nursing Assistant Cindy Sheehan Aerial (dance move) Stroke Swimming 2000 Australian Grand Prix Jackass: The Movie Tesla coil Bread Siphon Electroshock gun Marathon (sport) Earth Girl Arjuna Glossary of climbing terms Pet skunk Myocardial infarction Jon Secada Social rule Scenes from a Memory Transsexuality Seismic retrofit Post Polio syndrome Professor X Dobermann Hamster Wound healing phases Hal Trosky Dialysis Mercury 4 YuYu Hakusho Tarantula Hyperthermia Coffee Atomic Kitten The Contender (television series) R.
