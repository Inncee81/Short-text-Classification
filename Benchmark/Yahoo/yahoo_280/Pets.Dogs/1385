getting another puppy dog i have a three year old domestic longhair cat that stays indoors she mostly keeps to herself we have a four year old daushaund terrier mix he is adorable and we love him to pieces but he stays out in the backyard when we are at work he is very good with other docs big and small and we thought it might be good to get another dog to keep him company during the day has anyone added another pup into the mix after your dog was already established and in his habits and how did it go my experience is that if the dog is socialized with other dogs then this should not be a problem however there will be a tussle at first for who is the dominant dog with your dog being a year old and the other being a pup there shouldn't be any question as to who the pack leader will be the pup will know who is the leader the older dog will know this too i would watch them for the first couple of weeks to make sure that things are going along well for both dogs but it shouldn't be much of a problem i would say go ahead and get the pup all should go well Dog Dog training Housebreaking Hamster Pack (canine) Our Gang Guinea pig Scooby-Doo Coyote Gray Wolf Border Terrier Cat Domestication 101 Dalmatians: The Series Socialization Taikyoku shogi Pete the Pup Mixed-breed dog Shaggy dog story Yorkshire Terrier Powel Crosley Jr. Fancy rat Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Shetland Sheepdog Garfield Nerpa Avenue Q American Pit Bull Terrier Dachshund Feral Charlie Brown Ferret Philosophy of language Golden Retriever Keeshond Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Friends West Highland White Terrier Extreme Programming Puppy mill Care Bears Boston Terrier Elvis Presley Skye Terrier Great Dane Kodocha Fox Dog breeding Hip dysplasia Border Collie Billboard Hot 100 The Ashlee Simpson Show Siberian Husky Redbone Coonhound Dog show Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Sinfest Jack Russell Terrier Gun dog Epistemology KaBlam!
