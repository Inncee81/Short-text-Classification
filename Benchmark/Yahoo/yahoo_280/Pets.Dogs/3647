my dog brandy's favorite game my dog and i play a game where she runs outside through her dog door and i go hide behind a door or behind a coat on the coat tree if she can't find me then i knock on something if i don't have to jump out then i pet her and tell her she's smart it's funny because you see her nose sniffing behind something she's so cute is there any part of this that's not good for her after a few rounds we go and rest for awhile it's like you can see her smile cause it's so much fun ohhhhhhhhh i cant pik a best answer i see nothing wrong with that game i would always let her find you so it encourages her to search even if you have to move in a more obvious spot for her sounds like you both have fun and that is what is important Dog Game show The Price Is Right The Beach Boys Shaggy dog story Billboard Hot 100 The Pet Sounds Sessions Garfield Labrador Retriever Tag Social rule Joke Spidey Super Stories Obedience training Happy Tree Friends Characters of Naruto Housebreaking Whose Line Is It Anyway?
