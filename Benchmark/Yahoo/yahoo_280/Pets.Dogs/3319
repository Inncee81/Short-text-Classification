help we've been potty training our dog for months and he just doesn't get it we got our puppy in february he is a shih tzu peke cross we are using the crate training method but it is just not working i had been putting a towel in there but he would just pee on it and lay on it so i took it out a few days ago and he did pretty good but then peed in there yesterday and freaked out which i guess is a good thing i'm assuming when the towel was in there it soaked it up and didn't really bother him to lay down on it we have an area outside x for both our dogs but their leashes on each side prevent them from being able to touch eachother anyways the dog with the problem will just sit out there and bark the whole time then when we bring him in or let him run around the yard then he will potty what is the deal he will go if i take him for a walk but he gives us no signs at all that he needs to go out if has gone in his area but goes more in the house and other areas of the yard i am at my wits end i can't take it anymore its a small kennel pet taxi just big enough for him to lay down in and turn around i'm sure everyone will have great advice for you with extra stuff to what you're already doing but i just wanted to give you some reassurance i've got a beautiful german shepherdxborder collie he is the smartest dog you've ever known and absolutely loves to please you but he didn't become properly house trained until he was just about a year old there was nothing physically wrong with him i was on the verge of getting x rays and stuff done and i literally did everything in the book and a few things not in it but it just took him a bit longer now that he's house trained though he can go like hours between toilets so just keep persisting and try some new things and he will get it eventually also a male months old is he steralised i'm thinking a lot to do with it could be 'marking his territory' good luck Dog training Nintendogs Dog Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hey Jude Crate training Dog agility The League of Gentlemen (comedy) EastEnders 2000 Australian Grand Prix Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Blood on the Tracks Humphrey Bogart Social rule Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Satchel Paige AFI 100 Years series The Ashlee Simpson Show Piccolo Junior Saga Kim Possible Japanese toilet Textile manufacturing Garfield The Inside Pekingese Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) I Want to Hold Your Hand Mixed-breed dog Pittsburgh Steelers Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism She Loves You Toilet Kodocha Sampling (music) Keeshond Sento The Amber Spyglass The Star Wars Holiday Special New Morning The Chemical Brothers Skinny Puppy The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Dead Like Me Hal Trosky Shetland Sheepdog Alaga__sia Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Poker jargon The Price Is Right Sin City Boards of Canada Negima Neighbours Extreme Programming Smooth Collie Menstrual cup Reservoir Dogs Ranma __ characters Mnemonic A Day in the Life Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Traumatic incident reduction Make money fast Shit The Fairly OddParents Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jayne Mansfield The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Marilyn Monroe Docking Nintendo The Lovely Bones Ron Weasley Border Collie Singlish Cliff Richard First Battle of the Atlantic Golden Retriever Wheel of Fortune New York Giants Norway national football team Penis Basset Hound Royal Assent Aerial (dance move) Ferret Theodicy Groo the Wanderer Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Blonde on Blonde
