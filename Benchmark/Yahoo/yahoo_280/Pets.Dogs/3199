what if you put a pitbull with a puppy pug my ex wants to adopt a pitbull adult from the pound who seems friendly and is placed in the kennel with another dog who jumps all over him and nibbles at his face he is going to bring him home where there is a puppy pug is and i fear the pug will irritate him as he trys to play with the pit and the pit will attack i tell my ex thoes dogs are unpredictable and even tho hes friendly with humans and the dog hes with doesnt mean he wont snap in the future no pit bulls are not likely to snap or become aggressive than any other breed this is a big myth unforutnaly pit bulls are powerfull dogs and generall owned raised and bred by some people who either incourage aggressive behavior or breed specifically for it but this could be said about several breeds of dogs in every single case of dog attack there have been signals issues training problems with these dogs they did not go from cute little lap dog to killer unfortunaly the press does not cover the all the other problems that where there just the owner going he was sush a nice dog dont understand why he attacked my year old when their was a host of other problems signals there before the the dog attacked the dog human small animal now this specific dog this adult dogs history is unknown so depending on the dogs previous history and training could have a problem with puppies also some dogs get along better with puppies than others or dogs puppies of the same size vs very big and little dog combinations some dogs do not relate with dogs of a much smaller or larger size this could include your puppy having a problem or this adult dog having issues reguardless of breed i don't doubt that this particualr dog pit bull is not dog aggressive or it would not be up for adoption it will not just snap but you could have issues due to the size diffrence you pug could get hurt just roughhousing there is just a size diffrence to consider also adding a new dog when you have a new puppy could it self be a problem dogs can and do act diffrent in the kennel situation then at home puppies can be very irritating and no dog reguardless of breed needs to be strictly supervised when playing with a puppy often puppies get themselves into trouble when being a pain in the butt to the adult dog and do not take a hint to stop truthfully if you honesly believe this dog cannot be trusted or believe he will snap because of some bad genes or something you may find the challange of rasing a puppy with a new adoped dog too much of a challange or not understand dog interaction and behavior enough to prevent a situation either way it will effect how you interact with the older dog and that itself will effect the relationship you have with your dog you have a puppy that takes a lot of time to build the propper realationship so stick with the one dog right now if your ex decides to adopt this dog and does not live with you excersise extreme caution introducing them you would need to with any breed of dog amanda American Pit Bull Terrier Dog training Housebreaking Docking Nintendogs Labrador Retriever German Shepherd Dog Dog show Obedience training Domestic rabbit Shetland Sheepdog Border Terrier Dog agility Cat Gray Wolf Fox hunting Dobermann Pug Golden Retriever Theory of conduct Rottweiler Guinea pig Staffordshire Bull Terrier Puppy mill Autism Dog breed Smooth Collie American Eskimo Dog Jack Russell Terrier Animal testing Ferret Whippet Tobacco smoking Kodocha Social rule Breed registry Havanese Livestock Cavalier King Charles Spaniel God Emperor of Dune Greyhound Bullfighting Crate training Sin City Artificial selection Skinny Puppy Alaskan husky Toy dog Border Collie Weimaraner CPU cache Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Zoophilia The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Social psychology Companion dog Guns, Germs, and Steel Human sexual behavior Species Poker jargon Bulldog 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sick Puppy Rocko's Modern Life Dragon Booster Beagle C programming language Australian Cattle Dog Newfoundland (dog) Randomness Cockfight Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus English Springer Spaniel Domestication Great Dane Pekingese Komondor Dog fighting Rabies Diving Belgian Shepherd Dog Jet engine American football strategy Bull Terrier Shark Psychology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
