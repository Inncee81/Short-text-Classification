question about puppy someone recommended us to buy bichons because they said they tend to have good tempers and can get along with children we went to see bichons yesterday they chased my years old son and pull off his pants one bit my husband on the wrist is it their breed or all puppies does this i adopted dogs before never own a puppy in m life also are they high maintainese like human babies are they clingy bichons are lovely dogs puppies play for them playing is done with their mouths and they have sharp little teeth since they don't have hands like babies everything goes in their mouths they are prone to chewing on things and they think tugging on shoelaces and pants is a good game it really does not sound to me as if you are at all ready for a puppy perhaps an older dog may be a better idea remember these are living beings not animated stuffed animals and they have to be trained to know what is right or wrong Dog Dog training Labrador Retriever Cat Havanese German Shepherd Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Socialization Housebreaking Puppy mill Ferret Shetland Sheepdog Garfield Fancy rat Basset Hound Pet skunk Scooby-Doo Breastfeeding Zoophilia Lady and the Tramp Milton H.
