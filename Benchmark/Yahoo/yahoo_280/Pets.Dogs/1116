how do you teach your month old pup not to dig i had a black lab that loved to dig all the time and we put red pepper down in the spots he dug in and when he got a snout full of red pepper he figured out that it didnt feel good and eventually he quit digging all together if you have a big yard this may be a little hard to do but most of the time they go for flower beds and such and this will stop him from digging in areas like that hope this helped good luck Skinny Puppy Paul Is Dead Red Hot Chili Peppers John Frusciante Donovan Shark Black pepper Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Guinea pig Care Bears Squirrel Hamster KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1992 EastEnders Ron and Fez New York Giants Anchor Holes (book) Dog training Mary Wells 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sgt.
