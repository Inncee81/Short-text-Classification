i need to teach my puppy to be quiet please help she isn't of any particular breed she's about weeks old i've had her for a week and a half at first she was very timid she slept in my room the first week i took her out to pee every hour and after she would fall right back to sleep but after her first vaccines days ago she couldn't sleep she just whined and seemed to not be able to get comfortable to sleep she would lay down whimper move to another spot whimper and so on so i took her outside the first night it went fine but these last nights she has started crying at around am took her in but then she expects me to play with her and barks at me if i fall asleep what can i do my mom has threatened to take her away if she continues to not let her sleep with all the crying and barking i have a 'pet taxi' thing in my room but she's not used to sleeping there yet if i lock her in she cries loudly i would lock her in at night so she doesn't get in trouble while i'm sleeping please help the thing is she wasn't planned we found her on the street i want to keep her but my mom doesn't like dogs she wasn't uneasy about my house the first week she slept quietly next to my bed i just took her out when i felt her get up so she could pee puppies cry that first off is something to be expected use the pet taxi but start off slowly in the beginning play with her and the pet taxi throw toys in or small treats let her see that its a good thing not something to be afraid of after she's a little more comfortable with the taxi put her in for just a few minutes and walk out of the room then return a few minutes later extend the time each time you do this soon she'll be comfortable that she won't cry at night but you must be consistant don't let her out when she's crying because all that does is re enforce the idea that if she crys she'll be let out Shaggy dog story Dog training Housebreaking EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pok__mon Live!
