how old is to old for a dog to go into heat i have a year old female lab and a year old male lab i think he got her when she was in heat a couple of months ago she is wider in her rib area than normal and her boobs are filling up and when pressure is put on the nipple milk comes out i thought that she was too old cause her previous partner got her during her cycle and nothing happened was he to old he was years older than her any input is accepted if it can be from an experienced person in this area in other words no smart alecs im not new to the breeding side of things she was my step fathers and i now that they are prego for months i sold her litters for him and had no problems doing so i have a purebred male and she is purebred so i can sell the pups for a decent price i would not abort my own offspring and will not do it for a dog either she is in good health except for her age the reason that i asked is because i heard somewhere that they stop mensus just like humans that is the only reason that i asked i will consider having her fixed after this litter i will not consider fixing my male lab or my male german shepherd months old after males are fixed they are useless lay around get fat no good at guarding their territory etc that would be like fixing your significant other and expecting him to get off the couch to wash his truck it wont happen sounds to me like he did get to her i would recommend talking to your vet asap seems pretty old to have having a litter so it may be better for the mom's health if she is spayed asap and the litter aborted talk to your vet for the best opinion Dog Guinea pig Mixed-breed dog Breast Pet skunk Labrador Retriever Breastfeeding Hamster Abortion Domestic rabbit Dairy Tobacco smoking Selective breeding God Emperor of Dune Abortion debate Dobermann Kitten Sexual orientation House Mouse Shaggy dog story Manx (cat) Milk Debugging Dog breed Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Domestic goat American Kennel Club Gray Wolf Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Fancy rat Orgasm Platypus Horse Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Microeconomics Greyhound Economics Pretty Good Privacy Le Malade imaginaire Social rule German Shepherd Dog Breed registry Stem cell Great Dane Inflation Milton H.
