dog and kids' problem my yrs old parson russell used to get along well with kids of all ages till recently he will growled at them and had even bit a boy yrs old on the nose parents have been very understanding and what i can do when kids visit is to put my dog away i seriously dun think keeping him away from kids is the solution i will prefer more interaction but will like to seek more advice before doing this should i punish when my dog growl how can i make my dog understand that the kids are of higher authority to him how can i create a good impression of the kids now that after the bad incidents had happen i will like to add this in we just shifted to a new place he's coping well with everything except kids try looking at it from a dogs persceptive kids are hyper fast moving loud and excentric and they are probably frustrating or startling the dog this problem is not just dealing with the dog but with the kids as well yes dicipline the dog when he growls but dicipline the kids when they get too active around the dog and educate them on why they can't act that way the kids should not be above the dog right now but at the same level and under your supervision i wouldn't leave the dog alone around them but would keep an eye on them when the dog is out you can try to get the kids to play games with the dog such as fetch or frisbee also get the kids involved with calm relaxation time with the dog by having them gently pet the dog while watching tv or doing nothing at all eventually teach the kids to train the dog by letting them give simple commands and letting them give the dog a treat this way the kids learn how to act around the dog and the dog associates the kids with positive things Dog training Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dog agility Obedience training Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Theory of conduct Autism CPU cache Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Cat Hamster Aerial (dance move) About a Boy Electrophysiology The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Traumatic incident reduction Pok__mon Abilities Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Transactional analysis Kodocha Milton H.
