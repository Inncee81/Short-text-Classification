obediance training for pit bull where should i start if i'm looking to properly train a mo staffordshire pup well i haven't adopted him yet but he has been to diff homes previous to his current foster care so he hasn't had a lot of training why has he been in different homes at the age of months were those foster homes or did all of those people give him up and if so why you should be concerned especially if you are not familiar with dogs or the breed ask the foster home for a full history and see if there are behavior problems if the foster home is a breed rescue group they may be able to offer suggestions if he is simply untrained you can find regular obedience classes at many pets stores or get reference from vets or groomers in the area if he has behavior problems then if you do adopt him you may need to hire an experienced trainer rather than go to classes American Pit Bull Terrier Pit bull Dog Obedience training Dog training Golden Retriever Rescue group Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Guinea pig Working dog Animal shelter Dog agility Gun dog Staffordshire Bull Terrier Keeshond Socialization Housebreaking Community emergency response team Nintendogs Schutzhund Foster care Horse Terrier Fancy rat Microchip implant (animal) Mixed-breed dog Hamster Ferret Labrador Retriever Pekingese Pete the Pup American Eskimo Dog Leadership Boston Terrier Dobermann Guide dog Australian Cattle Dog Bull Terrier Musical Canine Freestyle Pittsburgh Steelers Infantilism Havanese Greyhound racing Airedale Terrier Childbirth American Bulldog Jack Russell Terrier Pet store Adoption Domestication Korea Jindo Dog Fox hunting British Rail Class 86 Pretty Good Privacy Alexander Technique Clinical depression Obedience Greyhound Simone Weil The Critic Dog intelligence Unemployment Docking Puppy mill Dog breed Medicine Subroutine Genetic algorithm Belgian Shepherd Dog Flight simulator Whippet Shetland Sheepdog Wal-Mart Bird Heinkel He 112 Mastiff Weimaraner Crate training Smooth Collie Milgram experiment Border Collie Mad Money Deconstruction Neighbours Skye Terrier Theory of conduct Prem Rawat Salvation Army Bulldog Transsexuality Equilibrium (2002 film) Democratic Party (United States) Pug Midnight Run Extreme Programming Civil Air Patrol Basset Hound Shark
