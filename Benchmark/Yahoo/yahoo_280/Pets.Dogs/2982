boxer breeders i have a question about boxer colors when they're born can you see the brindle markings or does it take some time for some pups to develop them the shelter has a litter of one week old boxers and you can tell that three of them are fawn but the others are so dark that they're almost black if you get a really good look at their fur it's dark at the root with fawn tips i was wondering if these are going to turn a sparse brindle very little striping at all are all brindles obviously striped when they're born do some grow into their stripes my eyes keep playing tricks on me because i think that i see even the least little bit of striping but then if i turn the pup another way it's gone there's a male that came with the female when the shelter found them i helped deliver the pups myself and i'm guessing that the male could be the father but he's fawn and the female is red and i've always heard that fawn and fawn equals only fawn oh well i'm guessing that some breeder turned them both out because the male is old grey on his face and only has one visible testicle and the female looks way overbred she's also not what you'd call boxer standard too much of an underbite and an overly long tongue she and all the rest are just totally adorable though usually the darker pups will have the brindle markings the actual amount of brindle markings won't be apparent too much until the pups are around months old and can even change for up to months or so and sometimes you'll just get a darker colored boxer also with them being in a shelter they might be mixed with another type of dog and will take on a different coat type great for you for looking to adopt one of these poor little ones though good luck if you are looking for a brindle i would go with the darker ones that have some fawn tinting to the hair might not work but it's probably your best chance Great Dane Guinea pig Dog Hamster Cat coat genetics Boxer (dog) Gray Wolf Shetland Sheepdog Havanese Dobermann Red Fox Fancy rat Golden Retriever Bullmastiff Taikyoku shogi Coyote Pet skunk Shark Whippet Keeshond American Pit Bull Terrier Australian Cattle Dog Dragon Booster Korea Jindo Dog Nerpa Red Squirrel Greyhound Wheel of Fortune Leopard Meerkat Meriones unguiculatus Colours, standards and guidons Mixed-breed dog Tigon Tabby cat Hair color Coat (dog) Color blindness Color theory Cairn Terrier Labrador Retriever Red Deer Color Ferret Wolfrider Boxing Billiards Resistor Griffon Bruxellois Human skin color Staffordshire Bull Terrier Irish Wolfhound Tenterfield Terrier The Contender (television series) Spider Black Boston Terrier Earless seal Panthera hybrid Gray (horse) Taekwondo Tosa (dog) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Eye color House Mouse Blue Our Gang Emu Circuit design Physical characteristics of the Buddha Discus (fish) Pomeranian (dog) Tooth enamel Sunglasses Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Skye Terrier Dodge Charger $ale of the Century Lion Border Collie Dog show Tarantula Polar Bear Black panther Poodle Game show Marching band Basenji Tortoiseshell cat Kasparov versus The World Tasmanian Devil BNSF Railway Siberian Husky Roan (color)
