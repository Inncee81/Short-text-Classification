is this possible i know that a human can get worms but is it possible to get it from pet hairs or is there other reasons why this could happen does it have anything to do with having your dog dewormed anyone i need answers please the only way a human can get worms is if they eat something which has worms in it but getting them from an already dewormed pet is not possible unless you touched your dog's worm laden poop and didn't wash your hands if you suspect that you have worms get yourself to a doctor and they can treat them with medications to kill the worms but you can not get worms from pet hairs Pet skunk Rabies Sandworm (Dune) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Unclean animals Taboo food and drink God Emperor of Dune Ascariasis Osama bin Laden Schistosomiasis Insulin Cat Baylisascaris Crazy Horse Toilet humour Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Heartworm Sesshomaru Lisa the Vegetarian Bill Clinton Pet Dog Diarrhea Skunk Hookworm Guinea pig Castration Sabretooth (comics) Discordianism Ulcerative colitis Hamster Sewage Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Klingon Lycanthropy Dil Pickles Garfield Aphasia Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist German Shepherd Dog Animal Stomach cancer Fancy rat Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Chuck Cunningham syndrome Crohn's disease Docking Children of Dune American Alligator Tony Tony Chopper Brown Bear The Death Gate Cycle Philipp Melanchthon Kashrut Horse colic Trichinosis They Might Be Giants Veterinarian Bat Philip J.
