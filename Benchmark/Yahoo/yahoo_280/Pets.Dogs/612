heartworm treatment my dog had heartworm treatment and is now loosing his hair is this a side effect from the treatment took him to the vet for it spent for them to tell me they couldn't find anything wrong they say it's an allergy does this sound right what i meant by treatment is he was diagnosed with heartworms and had to undergo the treatment to get rid of them now of course he is on the heartguard ok it could be a few things try the process of elimination from the following a lot of large breed dogs have what is known as a blow coat that is very thick and in the heat of summer tend to aggrevate their skin be very mindful of the dogs grooming brush him often especially when it is very hot outside to keep this coat to a minimum along with this keep the dog himself cool let him spend some more indoor time so he can enjoy the air conditioning as well the number cause of animal allergies is flea saliva just one bite can irritate for a week treat him with any flea treat ment that is not hartz hartz is not effective beyond weeks and is toxic to many animals after several applications wich of course manifests itself in allergic reactions stick with frontline advantage and other preventative treatments that are not hartz depending on the dogs age older dogs may develop endocrin system disorders if your dog is older than say years have your vet check his endocrin system although extremely rare some animals have an allergic reaction to the beef flavoring in their heartguard or even their daily food again it is one of those things you just have to rule out make sure any other animals in the house are treated for fleas like i mentioned before just one bite can irritate for a week i it is highly unlikely that he is allergic to the heartworm treatment itself if that was the case there would be more options in treating already occurring cases of heartworms for fear of such a reaction to a common treatment i hope i was able to offer some insight that may relieve your valued family member good luck and hope he feels better soon Allergy Heartworm Cat Asthma Hay fever Dog Chronic fatigue syndrome Conjunctivitis Radiation therapy Medicine Insulin Acne Eczema Fancy rat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bipolar disorder Urticaria Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Explosive material Paracetamol Ferret First aid Guinea pig Malaria Cephalic disorder Prostate cancer Food allergy Livestock Tattoo Haloperidol Urinary incontinence Cancer Homeopathy Flea Coeliac disease Chlorpromazine Stroke Traumatic brain injury Hamster Gray Wolf Crohn's disease Stomach cancer Hypoglycemia Domestic rabbit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Folic acid Clomipramine Cannabis (drug) Ultraviolet Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Garfield Sewage treatment Keeshond Obsessive-compulsive disorder Anthrax Toxic mold Dandruff Multiple sclerosis Animal testing Diseases of the honeybee Diazepam Airedale Terrier Combat stress reaction Dog training Social rule Rocky Mountain spotted fever Stuttering Propranolol Tooth enamel Spider Epilepsy Multiple chemical sensitivity Migraine Psychosis Fibromyalgia Contract Housebreaking Protein Drill bit Pneumonia Tarantula Corrosion Thermoregulation Mosquito Tooth Hydrogen peroxide Scar Welding Anopheles Hypertension Anxiety Post-traumatic stress disorder
