america's pet registry inc my dog is years old and was akc registered as soon as i got him i've gotten a few pieces of mail from them from time to time but today i got a new certificate from this america's pet registry inc what is it and is my dog still registered with akc did it expire or something i never sent them anything i'd wondered if for some reason akc changed their name or something your akc registration never expires so your dog is still akc registered apri is just another dog registry they usually can get your address and info and then try to sell you into their registry since your dog is already akc registered there really is no reason to also join the apri also the breeder you got your puppy from might have registered the litter with akc and apri then you would most likely get paperwork from both registries its nothing to worry about and your dog will always be akc registered American Kennel Club Dog breed United Kennel Club Docking Breed registry Border Collie Golden Retriever Dog breeding Jack Russell Terrier Labrador Retriever Dog agility Domain Name System German Shepherd Dog Havanese Mixed-breed dog Dog show Australian Shepherd Belgian Shepherd Dog Chinook (dog) Rat Terrier Whippet Whois Trademark Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Obedience training Terrier Pet skunk Dog Toy dog Intellectual property Breed club Australian Silky Terrier Selective breeding Tibetan Spaniel Dog hybrids and crossbreeds American Cocker Spaniel Puppy mill Dobermann Australian Kelpie Microchip implant (animal) Dogue de Bordeaux Domain name registry German car number plates Copyright Catahoula Leopard Dog Pet store Keeshond Public domain Miniature Schnauzer British national identity card Internationalized domain name .uk Toy Fox Terrier .au Windows registry Domain name Department of Motor Vehicles English Springer Spaniel Domestic rabbit Chihuahua (dog) Naval Vessel Register Appaloosa Horse Smooth Collie Domestic partnerships in California Hamster Icelandic Sheepdog Bull Terrier Pomeranian (dog) Shetland Sheepdog Nintendogs HMV West Highland White Terrier Border Terrier Pretty Good Privacy Alaskan husky Neopets Chinese Crested Dog Pet Civil unions in the United Kingdom Fancy rat .xxx Cat Working dog .info Taboo food and drink National Do Not Call Registry Poodle Manx (cat) Newfoundland (dog) German Shorthaired Pointer Direct marketing .biz Identity document Radio Newyork International Hotmail ICANN .ca
