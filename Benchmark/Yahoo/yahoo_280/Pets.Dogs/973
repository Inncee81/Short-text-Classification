my dog has a problem can you help okay so i have a miniature dachsound sp and he has a very big chewing problem he's about year old now but no matter how much we punish him for chewing it doesn't seem to work we buy him toys all the time but all he does is rip them open and take the stuffing out his favorite things to chew are paper and flip flops we try to keep them away from him but he jumps up on top of things and grabs them down what can we do if i don't find a solution we'll have to get rid of him please help me you people think this is my fault it's not just training okay this dog chews no matter what we've had him trained before and he stopped for a while but got right back into it after a few weeks he's chewed pairs of my flip flops pairs of slippers pair of tennis shoes we've had to replace of my friends shoes too because he ripped them to bits so don't tell me it's my fault cuz like i'm telling the dog to rip up shoes right i understand your dilemma really i do i've lost countless pairs of shoes because my dogs like to rip them apart there are many possible reasons for this people have suggested that my shoes may stink lol but i don't find this true they only rip up my shoes here's what i think my husband is retired and home with the dogs all day every day i still work and i'm gone about or hours every day i believe ripping up my shoes is their way to try to get me to stay home you know they see me putting on my shoes right before i leave what ever the reason i blame myselft partly because i know they will be ripped up if i let the shoes out where the dogs can get them so put the shoes away in a closet and make sure the door is closed i have to admit there are times when i still forget or i'm lazy or whatever but here's another piece of advice i know people say don't yell at the dogs mine continued to do it until i went totally ape shit i came home and found two pairs ripped up actually one shoe each of two pairs god forbid they'd economize i yelled like nothing ever ticked me off in my life as much as this shaking the shoes at them ignoring them for the rest of the day telling them to get away from me i'm mad at you it has been a month since any shoes have died and sorry to say i've let the shoes out perhaps i should add this so far lol i love my dogs too much to ever get rid of them i'd keep my shoes in the garage first or wear disposable shoes lol p s kimbeej gave good advice too edit ertha q never give a dog a cooked bone do you know why it is advised to not give dogs bones because they are cooked cooking even boiling a bone makes them brittle and they can splinter leaving dangerous bone parts in the intestinal tract however think about this in the wild dogs wolves cyotes fox eat raw meat and bones they don't get sick because they are not cooked buy your dog soup bones at the grocery store freeze them to kill bacteria give the dog the frozen bone but as always never give your dogs something to chew if you are not supervising him i give my dogs frozen soup bones about once a week the marrow is rich so i wouldn't give it every day they can get diarrhea from a rich diet Dog training RuneScape quests Dog Trailer Park Boys Sin City Fancy rat Married... with Children Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Humphrey Bogart Blood (computer game) Recurring South Park characters Shaggy dog story Tofu Piccolo Junior Saga Tlingit Garfield Theory of conduct Poker jargon Sub-Zero Vitamin C The Death Gate Cycle Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Reservoir Dogs The Marshall Mathers LP Cliff Richard Aztec Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Star Wars Holiday Special Ferret Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Inside Shoe The Lovely Bones Customs and etiquette of Japan Wal-Mart Spidey Super Stories The Critic Hip hop collaborations Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jackass: The Movie Sonic the Hedgehog The Cure Socrates Russian joke Domestic rabbit Meat Loaf Comanche The Emancipation of Mimi Dilbert Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Marilyn Monroe Aerial (dance move) Ramen Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy EastEnders 613 mitzvot Knots Landing The Invisibles Jewish cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Palindrome Japanese toilet Shawn Michaels Minor characters in Seinfeld Toilet humour Shit The Fairly OddParents Gray Wolf Characters of Naruto AFI 100 Years series The Dalek Invasion of Earth RuneScape skills Philip J.
