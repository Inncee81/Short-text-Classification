ideas for maintaining a good brew temperature i've been home brewing for a while but i've yet to find a good way to maintain a good brew temperature during the summer i've tried freezing liter bottles of water and putting them in the closet i've tried putting the carboy in a cooler of water this one ruined my brewometer and also tried putting a shirt soaked in cold water around the carboy any other ideas i was thinking of just grabbing a fan but thats kind of a waste of electricity put the carboy in a tub of water below the level of your brewometer and wrap a wet towel around the rest of the carboy making sure a good part of the towel is submerged in the water place a small fan facing the wet towel and the carboy will cool due to the evaporation of water off the towel you can also take those l bottles of frozen water and float them in the tub to water alongside your carboy i made a lagering closet big enough for carboys simple x strips of wood to make a cabinet between the stays i cut inch insulation to fit and covered it inside and out with very thin plywood veneer just for aesthetics on the back of the cabinet near the top i made small cutouts for piezo coolers and a temperature probe the whole contraption draws less electricity than a lightbulb and can get the cabinet down to lagering temps in a few days Beer Stout beer Alcoholic beverage Miller Brewing Ale Microbrew RuneScape quests Beer Pong Sin City Coffee Brewing Dairy Soft drink Anheuser-Busch Craps Drink Public house Vodka Milk Rainier Brewing Company Make money fast Drinking game Cider Wheat beer Brewery Samuel Adams (beer) Moonshine Canadian beer Root beer float Moe Szyslak Porter (beer) Australian words Budweiser Budvar Alcoholics Anonymous Lager Bong Chappelle's Show Shark Homebrewing Little Britain Menstrual cup Bottle French cuisine Cadbury Schweppes Plame affair Shaggy dog story Fecal incontinence Isinglass Vinegar Homer Simpson Joke Canadian slang Root beer K__lsch (beer) Haarlem President (game) Veganism Oreo Neopets Year of the Spider Cuisine of Denmark Irn-Bru Shit German beer German cuisine Theory of conduct Cocktail Viz (comic) Chocolate Reinheitsgebot First aid Tap (valve) Distilled beverage The Marshall Mathers LP Friends Jackass: The Movie American lager Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sherbet Martini cocktail Sake Eucharist Parachuting Cuisine of Finland Anthony Burgess Akvavit Wine Blackjack Bread Russian cuisine Bock Culture of France Beer in Serbia and Montenegro Can't Hardly Wait Mothers Against Drunk Driving Frogman
