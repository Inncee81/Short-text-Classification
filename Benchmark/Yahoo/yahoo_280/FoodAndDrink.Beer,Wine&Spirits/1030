can 's of a liter of whisky with diet coke make you black out im just wondering im wondering if someone slipped something in my drink or not i drank 's of a liter of whisky the tall slender bottle right above a pint of whisky i mxed the whisky with diet coke because its suppose to hit you faster anyways i drank it within hours i dont remember going home that night or anything i woke up in my apartment in the middle of the night throwing up i can remember throwing up a few times but nothing else that night the next day i felt really bad and dizzy feeling so im saying can only 's of a liter of whisky do this to me with diet coke i have not drank in like months before hand except the week before i had like beers so maybe my tolerance was down oh and im a big guy im ' about pounds i drink about once a week except for that month gap i usually average about a pint of whisky every week dan ive read about it many places for diet coke so i tried it many times look at this link http drunknewsblog blogspot com diet mixers make people drunk faster html they say it makes your blood alchol level higher by and its true i always feel it right away when i start mixing with diet coke drinking ml of any proof liquor within hours is usually enough to make anyone regardless of size quite drunk considering you say you drink a pint a week before and then practically doubled that amount in night tells me that with or without something being added to your drink you would have still likely had the same outcome of blacking out and throwing up i would tend to suspect nothing was added to your drink for a few reasons what is the motivation ghb and other drugs are added for a reason doesn't sound like you woke up with any strangebedfellows a shaved head from a prank or a missing kidney you probably would not have woken up in the middle in the night if something was added i am a moderate to heavy drinker but of a bit smaller stature ' lbs i love whiskey and at times will drink about a liter a week and one thing i can tell you is that the same type and amount of alcohol can have wildly different effects on your body there are a lot of other circumstances that can impact how you handle the alcohol how much did you eat that day drinking on an empty stomach is the surest way to get drunk quickly no need for diet coke using a straw or any other tricks on an empty stomach i can get smashed from a few shots of whiskey if i was eating properly i can drink a ml bottle and only feel buzzed sleep amount of water drank during the day and pacing of alchol intake can also impact it hopefully you come out of this learning a lesson that you can never count on being a certain level of intoxicated when drinking heavily some nights will happen the next night you might wind up in jail with a dui you are extremely lucky nothing happened that night so take that freebie and don't be irresponsible next time Dallas (TV series) Moe Szyslak Cider Jack Daniel's Bad Wolf Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Empty Child Harvey Award Xiaolin Showdown Flaming Moe's Drink The Invisibles Jack Harkness Milkshake Rum Spider-Man (games) Tekken characters Jack Kerouac Kirby Boom Town (Doctor Who) Knots Landing Diving suit Marvel Comics Bottle Rocket (film) Characters of Lost Public domain Bourbon whiskey Indianapolis 500 Martini cocktail ATI Technologies Marathon (sport) Threads (Stargate SG-1) Plastic The Ashes Jack Thompson Absinthe Big Brother (USA TV series) Ketchup Poker jargon Ninety-seventh United States Congress Colonel Potter 100th United States Congress Ninety-eighth United States Congress Walter Matthau A Prairie Home Companion Fighting Foodons Ascension (Stargate) Cuisine of Denmark Straw Bicycle lighting The Doctor Dances References to Star Trek Terry Pratchett Ninety-ninth United States Congress Apple pie Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Risotto Father Ted Daniel Defoe Humphrey Bogart Jack Benny Neighbours Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Pasta Alias episodes (Season 2) Hobgoblin (comics) Questionable Content The Comics Journal Supporting characters on Will & Grace Indiana Pacers Cocktail French fries The Lovely Bones Sub-Zero A.J.
