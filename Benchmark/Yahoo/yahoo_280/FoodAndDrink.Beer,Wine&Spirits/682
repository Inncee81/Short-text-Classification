what water bottling company is using tap water is this true and who is it i just heard this today and dont know if it is true or not sorry to burst your bubble but all bottlers who produce distilled or purified water products use tap water as a raw ingredient the water is extensively purified filtered and disinfected before bottling so it is purer and safer than the water that comes out of the tap bottlers are required by law to list their water source either on the bottle directly or on the exterior packaging of a multipack the fact that some products use tap water should be clearly marked whether or not they make a big deal out of publicizing it if you prefer to drink water that has never been through a municipal system you will have to restrict your bottled water consumption to spring water and artesian water products in order to qualify for those labels regulations require that the water come from certified natural ground sources and there are rules about how much purification can be done to make it safe for human consumption contrary to popular belief the bottled water industry is strictly regulated particularly if you buy a fairly well known brand you can rest assured that the product in the bottles is clean safe and free of chlorine and other chemicals Age of consent Legal drinking age Jurisdiction Lawsuit Public house Case law Stare decisis Tip Common law Drunk driving (United States) Tort International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Law of the United States Trademark Mediation International Criminal Court Euthanasia Driving under the influence Civil union Jury Appeal Law Slander and libel Private international law Civil law (legal system) Will (law) Due process Intestacy Roman law Marbury v.
