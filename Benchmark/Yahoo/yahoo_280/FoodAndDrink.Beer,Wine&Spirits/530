brewing with wild yeast in honey i am interested in trying a ginger wine of sorts brewing experiment using spontaneous fermentation with the wild yeast contained in honey and i want to know if this is doomed to failure from the outset and are there any serious health hazzards involved here's my plan boil ginger to make a significant quantity of ginger tea use the ginger tea to cook rice high volume of tea vs rice strain off the grains and allow to the soup to cool to a moderately warm temperature add natural organic unprocessed honey to the ginger rice soup and possibly extra sugar put the mixture in a bottle and shake to aerate add an air lock to the bottle and leave it to sit in a warm place for a long time i have read that some solid honeys contain inactive yeasts which can be seen a little active by the bubbles around the edges these become active when the honey is diluted hopefully there will be sufficient saccharomyces cerevisiae present in the mix to brew completely you are better off adding a cultured yeast instead of relying on the possibility of the wild yeasts being either present or plentiful enough to actually propagate and not be taken over by any other microorganisms when you add yeast instead of taking a chance on wild yeast you ensure the yeast takes over and will give you predictable and desirable results waiting to see if the wild yeast is even present much less prolific is a long shot and does leave a lot of room for other potential infections on top of that honey takes longer to ferment than other sugars so it will be a lot longer into the process before you will find out if you've wasted your time and ingredients or not stick with a good wine yeast or champagne yeast if you're shooting for a drier finish or higher final alcohol yield Gin Martini cocktail Fundamentalism Alcoholic beverage Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism A Course In Miracles Olive oil Ice cream Tea Scotch whisky Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Vodka Wine Judaism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Appeal God Roman Catholic Church Sloe gin Rum Champagne (beverage) Textile manufacturing Cinnamon Food preservation Oregano Jewish principles of faith Chocolate Existence of God Nineteen Eighty-Four Atheism Vanilla Glen Jacobs Church of Christ, Scientist Meaning of life Cheese James Bond Ten Commandments Martin Luther Kitsch Religious pluralism Prayer Esotericism Cuisine of the Philippines Christianity Idolatry Basic taste Prophet Jewish cuisine Bread Young Earth creationism Flavouring Homosexuality and Christianity Milkshake The nature of God in Western theology Creationism Supernatural Religion Iglesia ni Cristo Apocrypha Funeral Witchcraft Theology Cover version Predestination Gin rummy Epistemology Abrahamic religion Sapphire Pisco Babylon 5 Tofu Biblical inerrancy Opus Dei Dynamical system Sushi McDonald's George Edward Moore Sin Cliff Richard Messianic Judaism Church of Christ William M.
