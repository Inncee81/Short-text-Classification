proper way to make a spiked watermelon i am attempting to make a vodka watermelon but it seem like the vodka is not being absorbed by the watermelon i tried pouring it in and letting it soak up as well as leaving it overnight with the bottle upside down and very little vodka is being absorbed am i doing something wrong try cutting out small triangular sections on what you determine is the top of the watermelon then take either a syringe or pour directly into the watermelon itself the key to this is to give it some time such as hours before the event so that you can place it back to the refrigerator or put it on ice what ever you do be careful this stuff is potent don't drink and drive and please be mindful of your friends that may get loaded off of this have fun Watermelon Martini cocktail Aerial (dance move) Coffee Sake Professional wrestling throws Alcoholic beverage Social rule Ice cream Yerba mate Everwood Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Fanta Drinking game Tofu Glossary of climbing terms Menstrual cup Refrigerator Textile manufacturing Bong Bread Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Cantonese cuisine Tea Piledriver (professional wrestling) Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Joke Teller-Ulam design T.A.T.u.
