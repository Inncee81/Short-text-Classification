anyone heard of this custom drink i had a bunch of friends from out of town come up to stay with me for my birthday one of my male friends brought his girlfriend who wanted to make me one of her signature drinks that she makes for all of her friends since she thinks of herself as the world's best bartender i don't know this girl so feel free to say what you think but she mixed rum vodka beer and mountain dew it tasted and smelled like vomit after a rough night did she forget something or is she really just bad at making drinks i thought she was getting at something like jungle juice or hairy buffalo but i'd rather lick an actual hairy buffalo than ever drink that again if she makes this for all her friends she probably doesn't have any friends left that's why she tried it on you my cat could come up with a better drink than that but he has some difficulty using the cocktail shaker Cigar Scarface (1983 film) Live and Let Die Tobacco Serpico Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Cigarette Tony Accardo The Godfather Tony Galento Tony Montana Al Pacino Action movie The Sopranos Smoking ban James Bond George Burns Tom DeLay Dutch Masters Johnny Torrio Licence to Kill Botulin toxin Winona Ryder Al Capone Moonraker The Untouchables United States embargo against Cuba Steve Buscemi The Man Who Wasn't There Celebrity appearances in Doctor Who Tony Soprano Tampa, Florida The Late Show with David Letterman Die Another Day Stock character Cuban American Goldfinger Q (James Bond) Tobacco advertising James Bond music History of Cuba Alan King Jeffrey Wright Platoon (film) Anthony Burgess Hookah Sally Ann Howes Tobacco smoking Saxophone Smoking fetishism Dog Day Afternoon Haymarket Riot Pro Football Hall of Fame Gangsta rap Heat (film) Tichborne Case Guys and Dolls Michael Madsen Chicago Outfit Product placement Andy Kaufman Canon (fiction) Tony Martin (singer) Angels in America Eisner Award Soprano Keith Olbermann K.d. lang The Spy Who Loved Me AFI 100 Years series Tim Curry Montana The Creation Cryptic crossword Mafia Manic Street Preachers Colin Farrell United Parcel Service Luis Tiant 100th United States Congress Pink Floyd pigs Bond girl Always (film) Tony Hulman Meat Loaf Yousuf Karsh Miriam Colon Wall Street Babe Ruth Cerebus the Aardvark Home Box Office San Antonio Spurs Nas (rapper) Bon Jovi M (James Bond) Fidel Castro San Francisco 49ers Django Reinhardt
