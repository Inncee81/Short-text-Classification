bartenders how did you get your start hi my friends own a restaurant i bartended my way through college and dental school great tips if you really learn the trade and i could study when it was slow what they do is have the senior bartender or one of the owners train for about week and then they work with another bartender for another weeks before they are on their own often an owner is near by if the get an unual drink like a dirty martini or a muddled old fashion bartending school helps somewhat but it is with fake alcohol and not the real hussel the other issue is they do not teach you have to deal with people so first you have to be of age be a people person and understand how to mix drinks properly over pouring alcohol does not do anyone a favor what they do is have the new bartenders also wait tables to learn the menu and get people experience also they learn to work together as a team with the other employees i think if you do something like this you can get paid for learning your job and get all the experience you need to work that place properly if you have any other questions please ask Rum Mezcal Scotch whisky Alcoholic beverage Coffee Beer Port wine Wine Single malt Scotch Brewery Chocolate Sake Silver Champagne (beverage) Bock Wood Cider Barbecue Internal ballistics Glycerin Brandy Clarinet Tai shogi Pisco Wine making Oak Color Sugar Dodge Charger Vinegar Aging barrel Black (people) Madeira wine Soy sauce Motion picture rating system Cacha__a Dragon Booster Carburetor Wheat beer Tofu Plastic Upholstery Milk Human skin color Yu-Gi-Oh!
