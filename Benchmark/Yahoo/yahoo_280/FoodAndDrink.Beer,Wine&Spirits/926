should the drinking age go upto as a ex bar person i think the minimum age for drinking should be as i think it would solve a lot of the underage drinking and some of the brawls in our towns and cities that we hear about would stop of a certain age group i also think that the licenceing laws should go back to the old laws as it would also cut down on the binge drinkers plus the fact is that the new laws dont give both the pub landlords and staff a break from there jobs i am in halifax west yorkshire i'm undecided as i see both sides i like the idea of the age being but on the other hand how can you be old enough to go to war and be killed but not old enough to have a beer Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky W.A.S.P.
