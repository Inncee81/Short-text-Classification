drinking out of state i'm a year old from ny in ny the drinking age thing is generally pretty relaxed especially in the city yes i know its illegal but i'm legal to do everything else right point is when im out of town i always order drinks virgin and dont give anyone a hard time because i know they will get into trouble for serving me however some people get really nasty and demmand id and act like im trying to trick them somehow is it just that they are worried about liabilties or are they just purposely giving me a hard time because im young they were asking id's for virgin drinks and i had to clarify again that i wanted it virgin and some people get very nasty when you order a drink and look young again i'm not trying to give people a hard time when you go to the city of ny it is very easy to drink underage the rest of the state this is not so please read the question thoroughly before answering thanks they're worred about liabilities the liquor board can bust them if you're drinking underage even if the chances of them being busted by the police is it's still not a risk worth taking because they can lose their liquor license and the server can get fined and no they're not particularly worried about your health and safety and the few that claim to be aren't places i'd enjoy going to anyway just like any other business they are in it for the money if the drinking age was again in ny i would bet you a large sum of money that of restaurants and bars would permit year olds to drink even if every one of them jumped in their car and wrapped themselves around a tree afterwards what i would do in your situation is ensure that they know the drink is virgin if they still ask for id clarify once again virgin no alcohol if they give you a bad rap still get a soda and don't tip them it's certainly not illegal for them to serve n a mixed drinks and if they or the restaurant's policy are being a jerk then you don't have to tip good luck enjoy the booze joe Poker jargon Mothers Against Drunk Driving Social rule Alcoholic beverage Prohibition Coffeehouse Contract Blackjack Surveillance Restaurant Legal drinking age Consensual crime Concealed carry (USA) Craps Trailer Park Boys Driver's license Insurance Moonshine Breastfeeding Scientology beliefs and practices Sin City Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Beer Pong Prostitution Drunk driving (United States) Humphrey Bogart Rape Expert system Child pornography The Young Ones (TV series) Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cheating in poker Cocktail Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tea Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Drinking culture Sauna Avenue Q Insomnia CPU cache Moe Szyslak Boom Town (Doctor Who) Confidence trick Skateboarding trick Gambling Babe Ruth Maison Ikkoku Word of Wisdom George Costanza Coffee Ocean's Twelve Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Motion picture rating system Kitesurfing Nicomachean Ethics Deflation (economics) Arguments for and against drug prohibition Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Taxation in the United States Divorce Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Oasis (band) Coca-Cola Shaggy dog story Password Jackass: The Movie Good Morning, Vietnam RuneScape quests Procrastination Tort reform EastEnders Civil rights Cocaine Alcohol Jeopardy!
