how do you prepare absinthe do you need to prepare it there are special ways to drink absinthe it's not required that you drink it this way but it effects the taste and makes the absinthe easier to drink this information is directly quoted from the greenfairy org website method water ritual the classic method of drinking it involves pouring cold water over a slotted spoon which contains a sugar cube into a glass containing a shot of absinthe as the water hits the absinthe the oils precipitate out and the drink changes from a clear emerald color to an opaque milky white this is called la loucheor louching method fire ritual a variation of the traditional drinking ritual follows in this variation a heaping teaspoon of sugar or cube is briefly wet in the glass of pure absinthe then lit on fire and held over the glass as the alcohol burns off the sugar melts into the glass when the fire gets low the remaining sugar is stirred into the drink and the drink is quickly drunk the fire method looks way cooler but in the end it's the water method that tastes better Wine Champagne (beverage) Wine making Sonoma County, California Cabernet Sauvignon Anderson Valley Madeira wine American Viticultural Area Missouri Rhineland Terroir Tokaj-Hegyalja Burgundy wine Stellenbosch, Western Cape Pisco Philippe de Rothschild Missouri wine N__gociant HyperText Transfer Protocol Tokaj (region in Slovakia) Rio Grande do Sul University of California, Davis Saint-__milion Napa County, California Zinfandel Appellation d'Origine Contr__l__e Secure Shell Common Unix Printing System Chambolle-Musigny Web browser Livermore, California XML Transport Layer Security Resource Description Framework Wines of Portugal McMinnville, Oregon JavaServer Pages James Busby Chardonnay Ithaca, New York Tokaji Viognier Varietal Ch__teau Haut-Brion Ice wine Master of Wine M__ller-Thurgau Kosher wine Livermore Valley Public key infrastructure Tannin Po__ega Clare Valley S__millon B__ziers Plantation Country wine W__rttemberg Pacific Ten Conference Phylloxera Kosher foods Cognac Grey market WebDAV Halaal Mendoza Province Bet Shemesh University of Adelaide Weinsberg Cava Uniform Resource Locator World Wide Web SAML Nathaniel de Rothschild Semi-generic Spyware Sopron Martha's Vineyard Internet Unified Modeling Language Pinot Noir Malvasia Brandy Chablis wine Klopotec Weinviertel M.I.N.D.
