why did my whiskey taste like the cheaper stuff i bought glenlevit year old scotch whiskey which is supposed to be a single malt but why does it taste so rough i usually drink balletines for half the price can someone explain to me how a more expensive malt scotch can be so bad glenlivet is a pretty mild single malt as far as single malts go they filter and caramelize everything except the nadurra single malts are that all malt traditionally malted over peat fires which is a potent flavor nowadays their are maltsters from which distilleries by their product to the peat level they prefer almost no one does their floor maltings anymore ballentiine's is a blend so the grain whisky serves to lighten and soften the final product a more neutral flavor if you will the yr is the french oak finish so it may be that flavor that you find objectionable or you just may not like malt whisky they don't come much less peaty or intense than glenlivet except maybe glenfiddich which is downright fruity if you like your ballentine's then stick with it and save your money my dad could by any scotch he wanted but he's a chivas drinker to the end Cocktail Drink Beer Mothers Against Drunk Driving Cider Jack Kerouac Humphrey Bogart Driving under the influence Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Toast (honor) Halitosis Michael Garibaldi Lemonade Rum Breastfeeding Toxicity Absinthe Cognac (drink) Energy drink Binge drinking Urinary incontinence Sake Ethanol Heuristic Whisky Drinking game Social rule Cancer Ethylene glycol The Shining (film) Drunk driving (United States) Vodka Traumatic incident reduction Drunkenness Transubstantiation Happiness Moonshine Supernatural Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Urination Atomic Kitten Mead Nicomachean Ethics Rape Pirates of the Caribbean Lager Book of Isaiah Fecal incontinence Cacha__a Bender Bending Rodriguez Alcoholism Russian cuisine Guinness Yoghurt Brandy 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Poison Soft drink Yerba mate French cuisine About a Boy President (game) Lucille Ball Microeconomics Dehydration Alcoholics Anonymous Diet soda Atomism Wine Drinking culture Roman eating and drinking Bartender Drinking Samuel Vimes Bl__t Jim Morrison Inca Kola Coca-Cola Alcoholic beverage Trailer Park Boys Grog Red Bull The Marshall Mathers LP Gig Young Alcohol Vomiting Legal drinking age Wine degustation Irn-Bru Brian Griffin Beer Pong Noah Alcopop __uic__ Long Island Iced Tea Chinese tea culture Shaggy dog story Water quality New Coke
