so i think i maybe a alcoholic so i am only year old i have been told my many of my close friends and family inculding the guy i am dating that i am a alcohlic i don't think i am i drink almost everynight okay everynight i have a drink i drink very heavly on thursdays sundays i do drink everyday at least one or two beers and no they do nothing for me it takes me around to beers to get drunk and beers to get tippsy most of my friends drink and i work at a night club so i drink at work i don't want to ammit i have a problem with drinking but i think i might and i don't know what to do about it despite all i can say many who are real alcoholics are not going to believe they are in that class by every form of self deception and experimentation they will try to prove themselves exceptions to the rule therefore nonalcoholic though there is no way of proving it we believe that early in our drinking careers most of us could have stopped drinking but the difficulty is that few alcoholics have enough desire to stop while there is yet time we have heard of a few instances where people who showed definite signs of alcoholism were able to stop for a long period because of an overpowering desire to do so to be gravely affected one does not necessarily have to drink a long time nor take the quantities some of us have this is particularly true of women potential female alcoholics often turn into the real thing and are gone beyond recall in a few years certain drinkers who would be greatly insulted if called alcoholics are astonished at their inability to stop we who are familiar with the symptoms see large numbers of potential alcoholics among young people everywhere but try and get them to see it this is just a few selected paragraphs from chapter of the big book of alcoholics anonymous my advice to you is this visit this site and read the big book www recovery org aa bigbook ww and you will know if you have a problem that needs addressed i want you to know that it was written in the s but an alcoholic is an alcoholic regardless of the times you owe it to yourself expecially at your age and you don't have to tell anyone you have looked into it if you don't feel the need to also you can take the advice of some and quit for a week or month and see if you drink its garbage you can quit for a month and think about a drink everyday for a month and succeed but on that st day you have a drink and another and another etc hope this helps i try to read the book and see how you feel its pretty common alot of people that are alcoholics will never admit it ever good luck Alcoholic beverage Alcoholism Clinical depression Alcoholics Anonymous Ketamine Caffeine The Shining (film) Coffee Alcohol Sin City Dead Like Me Mothers Against Drunk Driving Sleep Drowning Diazepam Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Out-of-body experience Rape Stroke Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drunk driving (United States) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Free will Shaggy dog story Driving under the influence Sedative Orgasm Theory of conduct Beer Social rule Knots Landing Psychosis Avalanche Prohibition Hypoglycemia Abortion debate Hiccup Methamphetamine Arguments for and against drug prohibition Addiction Drug abuse Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Prostate cancer Bipolar disorder Carbon dioxide The Catcher in the Rye Drink Taxi Driver Tea Anxiety Meditation Lorazepam One Tree Hill (TV series) Immortality Magical thinking Ethanol The Marshall Mathers LP Human sexual behavior Cannabis (drug) Chocolate Moonshine Post-traumatic stress disorder Depressant Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Pisco Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants First aid Brandy Borderline personality disorder Vomiting The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Cryonics Kill Bill Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Berserker Traumatic brain injury Tobacco smoking Distilled beverage Clomipramine Parkinson's disease Hyperthermia Grog Energy drink Neurofeedback Balance disorder Mind control Hypnosis Near-death experience David Bohm Chronic fatigue syndrome Panic attack Avenue Q
