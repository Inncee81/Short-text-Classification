can tonic water go bad you might want an answer from someone who knows the difference between seltzer which is just carbonated water and club soda which is seltzer with salt and tonic which is carbonated water with quinine and sugar or for diet artificial sweetener so long as the bottle is sealed and the manufacture was not faulty e g no e coli in the vats etc then tonic like many types of soda will keep indefinitely now once there's any tiny leakage from the cap it goes flat and bacteria can get in also if it's diet there's about a six month limit on aspartame unless you keep it chilled other sweeteners i don't think are so subject to breaking down when you go to open your tonic if there's a ffft sound as the carbonation pressure escapes and if you see no floaties in the liquid then you're ok now i don't think i'd want to chance one that's been around for a half dozen years but by then they'd be flat anyhow nothing lasts forever Wine Champagne (beverage) Tea Refrigerator Tofu Wine making Refrigeration Bread Pasteurization Cider Refrigerator car Cuisine of Denmark Carbon dioxide Vinegar HVAC Pinot Noir Oak Air conditioning Hydraulic machinery Gas absorption refrigerator Brewing Heat Vacuum Heat pump Phase change heat pump Lager Rum Hiberno-English Autonomous building Breastfeeding Coffee Cell (biology) Brewery Wines of Portugal Dairy Cork taint Tire Bong E85 Heat engine Stirling engine Kitchen Japanese tea ceremony Cabernet Sauvignon Siphon Wine degustation Christmas tree Homebrewing Space shuttle main engine Basement Carburetor Emergency preparedness Capercaillie Chicken Sake Madeira wine Softball Room temperature Shelf life Guinness Food science Sun Swingout Mango Cooking oil Cork (material) Geothermal exchange heat pump Planet of the Daleks Polyethylene terephthalate Sea-Monkey German wine Sangr__a Economy of Algeria Diode Ramen Haloalkane Bottle opener Bicycle brake systems Ammonia Fossil fuel power plant Screwcap Operation Petticoat Ton Roman eating and drinking Risotto Beer Weather lore Gas compressor European heat wave of 2003 Aircraft engine controls Thermal power station Lemonade Food storage Swamp cooler Deep lake water cooling Shiraz grape Ethylene glycol Bottle In-N-Out Burger Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir
