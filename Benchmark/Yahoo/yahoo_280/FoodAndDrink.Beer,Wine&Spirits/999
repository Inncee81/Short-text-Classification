which champagne is the sweetest i really dont like wine at all and it took me forever to be able to sip champagne but now that i am getting married i need a champagne that wont make me puke anybody know of a really sweet or smooth champagne thanks you probably don't actually want something that is as sweet as possible it will end up like drinking bubbly syrup instead go for a mass market champagne like cook's or totts that is labeled extra dry i know sounds stupid to label something that is slightly sweet as extra dry but those champagnes are the second level of sweetness behind brut no sweetness at all buying a mass market brand will ensure that it is made in a style pleasing to almost everyone and the hint of sugar helps smooth out the flavor if all else fails and you just can't learn to like it you can also buy sparkling cider or cranberry juice that still bubbles but tastes like liquid candy Pinot Noir Wine Champagne (beverage) Pinot Gris German wine Varietal Alcoholic beverage Tokaji Pinot meunier Ice wine Rum Beer Burgundy wine Port wine Brandy Grape Fanta Mead Willamette Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Gin Cider German cuisine Gatorade Riesling Sake Tea Soft drink Pisco Martini cocktail Chardonnay Cuisine of Denmark Terroir Wine making Shiraz grape Perfume Yamhill County, Oregon Mountain Dew Lemonade Peruvian cuisine Chambolle-Musigny Chablis wine Lambic Kit Kat Sonoma County, California Cuisine of the Philippines Vodka Ethanol Fruit Country wine Loganberry Moonshine Cava Cognac (drink) Food preservation Anderson Valley Black pepper Powerade Cuisine of Argentina Liqueur Absinthe Watermelon Roman eating and drinking Jones Soda Vinegar Chocolate Cantonese cuisine Vosne-Roman__e Stout beer Phenology Prohibition Almond Shasta (soft drink) Cold Stone Creamery Snapple Chile pepper Cuisine of Greece White Zinfandel Coffea arabica Balsamic vinegar Bong Japanese tea ceremony Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.
