any good alcoholic drink ideas for a party i'm having a birthday party for my soon to be year old and i planned on making drinks for us adults nothing too heavy but more like a cocktail party thing a large bowl of sangria it looks and tastes great plus it is easy to make in large batches make sure you allow plenty of time for the fruit to soak as it usually goes with kids you wont have much time to waste so the party will go smoother if you dont have to constantly make drinks for everyone have a large punch bowl out fill it up before the party keep some of it for backup and actually enjoy the party The Chemical Brothers Blood on the Tracks Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Daiquiri Muslim ibn Aqeel Buzz or Howl Under the Influence of Heat Harry Nilsson Good Morning, Vietnam Limp Bizkit SmartAsk Dawson's Creek Jean Grey Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Ariel (Firefly episode) Family (Buffy episode) Simon Tam The Supremes Angel One (TNG episode) Rich Mullins Guiding Light The Drew Carey Show Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Big Brother UK series 6 Kain (Legacy of Kain) Eurotrip Supergirl Father's Day (Doctor Who) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Mama's Family Whose Line Is It Anyway?
