i always hear about beer and beer bellys but can you get a belly drinkin several glasses of wine too i always avoid drinking beer but i do drink wine i was drinking cheap wine the other day and woke up with a hang over that morning i felt so bloated fat can i get a wine belly if i drink plenty everyday or every other day or am i paranoid the feeling of being bloated is different to that of actually having a fat belly the actual beer belly which takes years and years to develop is caused mainly because beer contains large quantities or carbohydrates is mainly drunk after dinner and in the evening not long before you sleep these three factors lead to the body storing large quantities of the carbs instead of using it to fuel the body it doesn't need much fuel at night especially after a meal where it has already got its energy Cigar Cigarette Tobacco Smoking pipe Tobacco smoking Publicly funded medicine Inflation Nintendo Coffee Gross domestic product Chocolate Welding Barbecue Smoking ban Hookah Bong Vinegar Microeconomics Health insurance Bulk vending View camera Tobacco advertising Breakfast Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Tea Mutual fund Cuisine of Denmark United States embargo against Cuba Mattress Soft drink Digital photography Inca Kola ATI Technologies Cannabis (drug) Strap-on dildo RuneScape weapons Saxophone Knife Gas metal arc welding Paintball Public good Energy development Deflation (economics) Kimono Sake Supply and demand FairTax Beavis and Butt-head Public policy MMORPG Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Smoke detector Radio controlled airplane Camel (cigarette) Gramophone record Marriage Mortgage Wine Chewing gum Adverse selection Tequila Dutch Masters Hyperinflation Trailer Park Boys Flat tax Short selling Ra (board game) Arc welding Salary cap Katana Babe Ruth Hearing aid Humidor T.
