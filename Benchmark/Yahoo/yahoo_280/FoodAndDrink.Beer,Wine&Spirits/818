the drink in the movie eurotrip my friend has some are there any drugs in that drink because we get random drug tests at work it's a common misconception that absinthe gets you high acts as a hallucinogen etc yes it used to but that's going back a couple of centuries when the psychoactive ingredient wormwood was at ridiculously high levels in the drink and the drink itself was known as la faire verte or the green fairy it was blamed for the rising number of people admitted to mental hospitals in paris and was banned it has since been regulated so the amount of wormwood would do considerably less damage to you than the alcohol content in it however the wormwood only becomes psychoactive if you drink it properly through soaking a sugarcube in it lighting the sugarcube holding it over the glass letting the caramelised sugar drip in then stirring the rest in before putting it out with cold water just chugging a shot you'll get drunk and have a bad hangover drugs tests noooo problem Miller Brewing Alcohol advertising Anheuser-Busch Beer Pong Drink Coors Brewing Company Burton-upon-Trent Soft drink Molson Redundant array of independent disks American lager Rum Beer Coffee Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) Bass (beer) Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.
