i have to invest what should i do i have about to invest i was thinking about using it to open a bar they always seem to make money i would like to also hear from people that have owned bars and how they did financially was it good money i was thinking about using about half of this money for the lease for the six months or so then the rest for the start up costs liquor licenses and decorating the bar how i want it seems to be a good way to make money to me i am open to other ideas or suggestions on how to invest this money i am not sure which state you live in but to purchase a liquor license in the state of florida the going rate is about a successful bar does make money but the work is harder than it looks and good honest help is not that easy to find theft is very common in the bar business as far as employees stealing and giving drinks away to their friends the bar owner should really be present and keep an eye on things to make sure they are not being ripped off on a regualr basis it is also not that easy to find bar help that is dependable and reliable and someone to stay sober long enough to make it through their shift or to show up sober free of drugs or alcohol there are good honest people that work in bars but they are not as easy to find keep in mind that many bars open and close with in the first year and the ones that are successful the owner is usually present seven days a week at least for the first few years promoting is also a full time job for the owner very few places open and are a success without something going on either live music sports specials or whatever and that is done either by mouth from the employees or advertising which can be very costly don't forget the liability where alcohol is concerned usually insurance cost for the business is higher owning is bar can be fun but it is also a lot of work and you are always taking the chance of being sued by someone i would invest in something not so stressful like a rental property why don't you look for a commercial property and own the land that the bar sits on you will be guaranteed a monthy income from the rent and the work won't be nearly as difficult Alcoholic beverage Beer Breastfeeding Ethanol Folic acid Alcohol Sake Milk Brewery Brewing Cider Tocopherol Veganism Distilled beverage Wine Ale Prohibition Wheat beer Word of Wisdom Alcohol fuel Omega-3 fatty acid Coffee Fermentation Rum Alcohol consumption and health Soft drink Homebrewing Moonshine Single malt Scotch Yeast Guinness Public house Atkins Nutritional Approach Nutrition French paradox Rooibos Genetically modified food Chocolate Stout beer Pasteurization Absinthe Prostate cancer Vegetarianism Healthy eating Coronary heart disease Lager German beer Grog Herpes simplex virus Hangover Tea Vitamin C Hypoglycemia Alcohol advertising Aspartame Gasoline Vodka Porter (beer) Blood alcohol content Cancer Food Sugar substitute Tobacco smoking Alzheimer's disease Organic food Polychlorinated biphenyl Osteoporosis Cocaine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Drink Medical analysis of circumcision Carbon dioxide Bock Disinfection Gout Pisco Glycemic index Drinking culture Coeliac disease Hepatitis Sleep Soy protein Guinea pig Sauna Hypertension Benzene Caffeine Flavonoid Drug abuse Cuisine of Argentina Cholesterol
