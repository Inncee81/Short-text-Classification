where do you stand on teen drinking and did you drink as a teen its just i know alot of teens who drink i do teen drink and i think it's fine provided we're not going out and getting wrecked which i used to do my turning point came when i completely blacked out my mum told me i couldn't even turn my head to be sick and that if she hadn't been there she thought i would have died this scared me witless the worst thing was my mum had given me the bottle of wine i drunk she's not irresponsible she knew i had sources who would often get me a bottle of vodka if i couldn't get anything else i told her it was for between a few of us as well sadly i had it myself and didn't have anything to eat that day because i was at a friends not so i'd get drunk i was then i was paraletic i had to get put home in a taxi and carried home by my dad if i had died how guilty would my mum have felt i saw something very similar happen to a good friend maybe if we'd been educated better about alcohol maybe if we'd seen the terrifying consequences maybe we wouldn't have ended up like that i think schools should do more to show the alarming risks alcohol causes not everyone will listen but it's worth it if even a few people listen also my mum told me real life stories her friend had a party and another of her friends tried to skip through a field as a shortcut home halfway she must have feel asleep she died from the cold it was winter another time a different friend got drunk and fell asleep on a doorstep someone found him in the morning and rushed him to hospital luckily he survived things like this need to stop Alcoholism Red Bull Alcoholics Anonymous Energy drink Red Bull Racing Drinking Drink Soft drink Alcohol Alcoholic beverage Rum Mothers Against Drunk Driving Ethanol Drunkenness Cheers Abstinence Cider Cuisine of Greece Tea Driving under the influence Public house Vodka Vampire Legal drinking age Wine Cocktail Beer Korean cuisine Diet soda Lemonade Temperance movement Poison Cocaine President (game) Ginger ale Tequila Binge drinking Port wine Mami Wata David Coulthard Hyperthermia Moxie Caffeine Harm reduction Irn-Bru Brian May Coffee Drunk driving (United States) Word of Wisdom Pub crawl Drinking game Dietrich Mateschitz French cuisine Moe Szyslak Michael Garibaldi Arak (liqueur) Minardi Hangover Cirrhosis Punch (drink) William Faulkner Shasta (soft drink) Trainspotting (novel) Pisco Salmiakki Koskenkorva Blood alcohol content Alcohol advertising Beer Bad (Buffy episode) Conan the Barbarian Crunk Distilled beverage Papal bull Addiction __uic__ Wine degustation Bar (establishment) Elephant Drinking culture The O.C.
