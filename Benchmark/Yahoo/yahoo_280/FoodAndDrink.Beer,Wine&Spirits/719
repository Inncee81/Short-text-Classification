do sensible drinkers think alcoholics are just greedy and self indulgent no in fact asking a question of that nature begs me to ask how naive are you people that suffer from this crippling ailment are not how you seem to portray them at all alcoholism is something that has its way of creeping up and taking over your life the need to buy drink to alleviate the depression that hits them when they don't have it having had someone in the family who was alcoholic i find your attitude offensive sensible drinkers who occasionally get drunk are nore likely to be aggressive as their metabolism and brain try to compensate for the lack of inhibitions the individual feels the adrenalin rush created does not stimulate the brain for the flight part of the rush just the fight part although alcoholics can be aggressive what they need are people who will tell them the truth about their problem and support them through the chaos that is their life providing stability to those in need of this help can aid them and believe me like any form of drug addiction it is a hour job think hard oh sensible drinker prior to any comment you make regarding those who have any form of dependency as it may just come back to haunt you Elizabeth Smart kidnapping Scenes from a Memory Alcoholics Anonymous Frankie Goes to Hollywood Professional wrestling slang Jazz Alcoholic beverage USS Taussig (DD-746) Level 42 USS Yorktown (CV-10) Gangsta rap Distilled beverage Kamen Rider 555 Humphrey Bogart Smart and Smarter Smart growth 1957 World Series Leisure USS Toledo (CA-133) Fontella Bass Parade (military) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Liquorice Snorlax Java programming language The Inside Drowning Dumfriesshire Associative array Stuart Smalley USS Yarnall (DD-541) Reflexology USS Abbot (DD-629) 2nd Ring Road (Beijing) Kellogg Company Bratmobile Keicar MSA-0011 S Gundam Marty McFly Ben E.
