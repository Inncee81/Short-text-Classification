any recommendations on alcohol or mix drinks that taste good btw how do you make a long island ice tea this is a very complicated question actually of course you will hear that everyone has his of her own drink of choice but one of my favorite alchohol drinks for taste is as follows ounces of kettle one vodka ounce of clamato juice ounces of tomato juice the juice of lemon dash of celery salt dash of rooster sauce hot sauce found at any grocery store crushed ice take a wet paper towel and fold into a square and place on dish take a seperate dish and pour celery salt on it take tall glass and rub the rim on the wet paper towel use lemon juice to wet the paper towel then dip rim in the celery salt dish to coat the rim set glass down carefully fill glass with ice as to not disturb the celery salt on glass rim pour in vodka then clamato then tomatoe juice carefully stir with straw and place straw in glass then squeeze more lemon juice in glass and a tiny dash of the hot sauce drink quickly and make another and then another then you will be sick of that taste simply use the rest of the vodka to make vodka and tonic drinks soon extremely ugly men women will look like gods and goddesses you will be incoherent but do not drink and drive my personal alan baltes long island ice tea one fresh lemon half one fresh lime half squeeze both into a pint glass or fruit jar add oz rum oz vodka oz whiskey oz gin oz tequila oz maple syrup this doesn't taste like alcohol but actually tastes like tea enjoy Calorie HyperText Transfer Protocol Web server Merlot Ton Common Unix Printing System Alcoholic beverage Food guide pyramid Wine Healthy eating World Wide Web Uniform Resource Locator HTML Breastfeeding Calorie restriction U.S. customary units Milk Standard enthalpy change of fusion Dieting Domain Name System Life extension Dietary fiber Energy MyPyramid Super Size Me Cabernet Sauvignon Website Virtual hosting Champagne (beverage) Coffee Biosphere 2 Uniform Resource Identifier Hamburger Tofu Macular degeneration Web browser Nutrition Lotus Notes Karytaina Junk food Internet Wget Egg (food) Food additive Proxy server Cross site scripting Veganism Low-carbohydrate diet XHTML Web page Fast food Orders of magnitude (energy) Unicode and HTML Obesity Cheese Atkins Nutritional Approach Olive oil Transliteration HTML element MIME Character encodings in HTML Malnutrition Alcohol fuel Slash (punctuation) The Coca-Cola Company Wireless Application Protocol Filename extension Transmission Control Protocol Gastric bypass surgery Walter Hallstein Pound HTTP cookie Representational State Transfer Drinking culture Port wine Linseed oil Fasting Paleolithic diet Domain name Ecclesiastical Latin Southeastern Anatolia Project Web cache Shiraz grape Bordeaux JavaServer Pages Gmail Epoxy Gopher protocol Synchronicity In-N-Out Burger Cornelia Rau REALbasic Through the Looking-Glass Lefkada Graves Recipe SAML Gulag Fire
