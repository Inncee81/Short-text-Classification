all grain brewing is it worth the effort how long does it normally take from start to pitching the yeast just curious if i want to go down this road i'm intrigued about some of the recipes i've made with a mini mash combined with a malt extract kit for me it is worth the effort i can only say for you that it may be you expressed some curiosity with it and this may the signal you got the bug once bitten by the all grain bug many people never or rarely do extract again perhaps it is because we feel closer to the brew more like a brewer more control on malt character alcohol mouth feel gravity etc i only do extracts now when time is limited all grain brewing which involves the mash sparge procedures can take to hours for an infusion mash and perhaps double that for a decoction this includes heating your water for the strike or doughing in adding grist to the hot water other than this all other times boil cooling are the same as with an extract brew so i would say approx hours for an infusion mash and hours for a decoction mash from beginning to pitching decoction mash is really only for pils and a couple other continental lagers and then you would want to get a or row malt from your supplirer many people use a two row variety which would greatly reduce decoction mash times but the method is worth at least a try i recommend you find an all grain brewer to work with him her to discover if its for you enjoy Beer Homebrewing Coffee Bock Single malt Scotch Sake Bread Tea Vores __l Lager Ale Scotch whisky Alcoholic beverage Food preservation Moonshine Distilled beverage Chinese tea culture Tofu Internal ballistics Pilsener India Pale ale Sugar beet German cuisine Miller Brewing Jewish cuisine British cuisine Rum Sauna Mashed potato Barley Public house Explosive material Cuisine of Africa Cocaine Ayahuasca The Smashing Pumpkins Vinegar Yerba mate Potato Pizza Belgian beer Acetic acid Wheat beer Rice Bagel Samuel Adams (beer) Cat Japanese cuisine Drill bit Solar power Stout beer Welding Food Tamale Hop (plant) Cooking Smoked beer Casting Breakfast Cereal Soy sauce Powder metallurgy Titanium Folic acid Spacecraft propulsion Hemp Alcoholic proof Coors Brewing Company Korean cuisine Lion Nathan Prohibition Common bean Guinness Veganism Russian cuisine Hypoglycemia Yarrow Colorectal cancer Dumpling Yeast E85 Dairy Porter (beer) Nuclear reactor Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Chocolate Bengali cuisine Hard water Pasta Lambic Sport rowing Toronto Blue Jays
