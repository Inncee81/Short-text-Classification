whats the best way to help a twelve year old get to sleep she can't fall asleep at night even when she is really tired it has been going on for a long time now it affects her mood and schoolwork when she is trying to go to sleep she will literally be just laying down for sometimes even hours there are many things that can cause problems with sleep enviroment diet worry etc you need to find out what the problem is a specialist may be needed i suggest keeping a journal of her day when she wakes up what she does what she eats is she taking naps during the day this can cause problems sleeping at night does she have caffeine within hours of going to bed is there something bothering her too much school work problems with friends etc when does she wake in the morning it is recommended that you wake at the same time every morning regardless of it being weekday or weekend i have been an insomniac for years the most helpful thing for me were not napping waking at the same time going to bed at the same time and getting into a routine routines are very helpful as they allow the body to recognize that it is bed time for my routine i get into pajamas brush teeth read chapters in my book and go to bed i put on relaxing music which is another way to signal to your body that it is time for sleep it may take awhile to get your daughter to adjust her body to going to sleep at night if she is used to being awake at night it took me a few weeks to get myself back on track Insomnia Urinary incontinence Daylight saving time Lucid dreaming Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Narcolepsy Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Avenue Q Apollo 8 Delayed sleep phase syndrome Polyphasic sleep Mattress 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rule of St Benedict Siesta Caffeine Breastfeeding Out-of-body experience Blankets (graphic novel) Opportunity rover timeline for 2005 March Sleep disorder Donald Neilson The Amber Spyglass Sleep debt Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April Garfield Cat Social rule Tooth Pope John Paul I Dream Fancy rat Futurama (TV series - season 5) Characters of The Sandman Milton H.
