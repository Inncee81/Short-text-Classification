is it out of line to want to see my son stepson off to his first day of kindergarten some events in our family are parents only and i understand this for example doctor appointments unless otherwise agreed upon are parents only and parent teacher conferences are too but would i be out of line in wanting to see my stepson off to his first day of kindergarten i am torn between two things i don't want it to be a big fuss because i would like to be there because these parents only events are mostly just to appease their mother but at the same time i don't want him to think that i didn't care enough to go i was thinking about maybe just calling at the end of his day to see how it went etc would that be better opinions suggestions i know that i am a parent whether it be biological or not but is it worth having to possibly deal with an upset biological mother i don't want him to think that i don't care enough to go but i also don't want to cause problems that would possible effect his day i personally think that it would be out of line to keep you away from this event i'm sure your son will be so excited to have all his parents biological and step there supporting him on his first day of school i'm sorry if this doesn't make his biological mother happy but perhaps if you explain to her that the boy you both share is so special that you love him too either way she's going ot have to just lump it she can't tell people to not love the little boy and like it or not you are a big part of his life if you end up having to stay away which i think would be a tragedy i would suggest going out and buying your son a little happy first day gift and explain to him that his mommy and daddy want that day just to themselves but you were there with him in spirit and finally just a thought if you have the time get involved in his school meet his teacher help out at bake sales and such your son's teachers will probably be just as interested in getting to know you as you will they as you are a big part of his life it's important that they know that he doesn't just have a mom and a dad but a step mom who loves him dearly Kodocha Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) The Fairly OddParents The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Fathers' rights Miss Saigon About a Boy Knots Landing Friends Rent (musical) Theory of conduct Cindy Sheehan Humphrey Bogart Pitaten Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye Calvin and Hobbes Kindergarten EastEnders Intelligence quotient Doug Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Hey Arnold!
