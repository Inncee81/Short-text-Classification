how can i get my yr old to bed at pm i have a yr ol and she wants to stay up and play with him it time to start school we all need more sleep its hard to get her to bed at night its usually pm and too late for me makes me tired she could be overtired making her irritable and less able to wind down pm sounds quite late to me if she is active during the day pm might be a better time anyway whatever bedtime you decide you have to be consistent and stick to it start a strict bedtime routine bath pyjamas on and kisses goodnight for anyone else in the house into bed and you or partner read her a story then you turn out the light if she doesn't like the dark use a dim nightlight or have the hall light on say goodnight kiss her and leave the room for the first few nights you may have to sit outside as she may keep getting up if she does take her by the hand softly say 'it's bedtime' and take her back to bed if she struggles pick her up put her in and leave if she gets straight back up you put her straight back in after a couple of times say nothing at all to her as you put her back in and don't even give her eye contact are you in the uk have you ever watched 'house of tiny terrors ' some of those kids get put back to bed dozens and dozens of times but eventually they get the message stay there and go to sleep you must be consistent if she is used to being able to stay up she will try and get up to see if she can get you to give in again don't no matter how many times you have to put her back in bed the first few nights keep persevering as it really will get better also on the first night you start your strict routine you could explain to her you want her to go to bed when she is told and if she does and stays there she gets a reward sticker small toy sweets something small don't bribe her with that if she keeps getting up though don't get into conversations just say 'it's bedtime' or nothing at all and put her back in her bed in the morning if she didn't get up when you put her to bed give her the treat if she did get up explain that the treat was for staying in bed so she can't have it today but she will be able to try hard that night basically this is all about staying calm ignoring any playing up by simply puting her back in bed with minimal communication and rewarding any behaviour she displays that you do want to see Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog training The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sleep Shaggy dog story 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social rule Aerial (dance move) The Amber Spyglass James Hanratty Kodocha The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Daylight saving time Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Mattress Electrophysiology Otello Poker jargon Insomnia Calvin and Hobbes Avenue Q EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fancy Crane Milton H.
