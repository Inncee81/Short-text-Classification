how do i handle my year old having accidents my five year old almost started having accidents in school last year then a few weeks ago she started again i know that it is partially related to stress in kindergarten her teacher wasn't very patient she didn't like school now her daycare is having marital problems she is reacting that stress now though it has escalated so that when we go the the playground she will pee and not stop playing she played for minutes after wetting herself had we not stopped her it would have been longer and she didn't care with school we wont let her have the same teacher next year she is attending kindergarten again she will start a new day care in a couple weeks so we are working to resolve the issues but how do i handle the actual accident i've tried loving her through it being patient time outs dissapointment ignoring the situations not fond of spanking it doesn't seem to work she is a gentle spirit who's feelings get hurt easily help we did see the dr to rule out a uti or infection and have stopped w the bubble baths and she does have a lot of stress i didn't want her to go to school last year and the school sugested she give it a try she is almost six so holding her back a year will have her graduating at almost that may be more damaging in the long term thanks for the ideas thus far though i will keep on loving her through it seems to work the best w her you need to speak to your pediatrician five year olds should not have accidents on a regular basis it seems like your child has alot of strss in her young life and she needs to be reassured of her safety and well being obviously your child is quite stressed out but you need to make sure there are no medical reasons for this a therapist may also need to be contacted good luck Kindergarten Pitaten Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Social rule Traumatic incident reduction Education in the United States Drowning Kodocha Massage Transsexuality Education in Japan Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Blonde on Blonde Transactional analysis Medicine Down syndrome Hip fracture Adoption Tai Chi Chuan Childbirth Psychoanalysis EastEnders Stomach cancer Divorce Fecal incontinence Characters in the Smurfs Pediatrics 1957 World Series 24 Hours of Le Mans Gun safety Kim Possible Chronic fatigue syndrome Martial art Education in Romania Emergency department Hikikomori Education in the People's Republic of China Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Education in Germany Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Psoriasis Autism Fathers' rights Plame affair Borderline personality disorder The Contender (television series) Little Britain Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Maison Ikkoku Intravenous therapy Theory of conduct Narcissism Medical analysis of circumcision Time Out of Mind Alternative medicine Hillary Rodham Clinton BDSM Charles Darwin's illness Nurse Cytomegalovirus W.I.T.C.H.
