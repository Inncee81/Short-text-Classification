at what age is it inappropriate for a boy to play with action figures my nephew who is almost still plays with action figures i find this bizarre also and i find this even more bizarre my sister makes him kiss her every time he leaves or enters the room please give me your opinions he also is never lat out of the house he needs to see the world outside of his house he gets picked on at school and doesnt have any friends my grandson is almost and still plays with action figures he's got a great imagination and builds huge sets for them etc leave him alone on that count but when you say that your sister makes him kiss her every time he leaves or enters a room that's ridiculous excessive and sick your sister has a problem letting go of her adolescent son and he's going to get some wierd complex i'll bet there is not a psychologist around who would think that behavior is normal it would be one thing if he went to her for a kiss although also a bit wierd for a yr old but for her to make him come t her for a kiss is bizarre Friends Jam (TV series) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Milton H.
