i am concerned about my year old because she says she has nightmares all the time and her imagination from the bad dreams come to life she is afraid to be alone and is practically attached to me by the hip i cant even go to the laundry room this concerns me because her grandfather her father's dad is schizophrenic i took her to a psychiatrist a few years back when she had a similar complaint and they said it was too early to see signs of that and that she was suffering from anxiety this all began again after her aunt her dad's sister died last month in a car crash could this be the reason for the recent behavior change her dad and i are divorce the first incident occurred shortly after our seperation childhood can be traumatic although seeming sophisticated is still very young divorce and death can bring on anxiety absolutely and its manifestations may be very abstract from the actual incident i am curious what was suggested to alleviate anxiety in the past and did it work how is your anxiety level mine and my kids are surely related my son is and can get very fearful he recently was at a magic show that 'channeled' the ghost of the king of rock and he spent the next several days concerned that elvis was going to come and haunt him my daughter now also went through this phase this is an age of magical thinking what i do is some positive imagery before bed we would read a sweet bed time book not one where the angry step mother poison's you with an apple and then i have them close their eyes and i have them imagine they are on a cloud or by a river in a safe place maybe the person or animal that makes them feel safe is with them or even imaginary creatures unicorn's whatever sun shining on they're face on and on and it seemed to really work for bed time at least as for the day i let them stick to me as much as possible good luck Anxiety Charles Darwin's illness Fathers' rights Narcissism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dead Like Me Post-traumatic stress disorder Phoebe Halliwell Autism Schizophrenia Father's Day (Doctor Who) Theodicy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Psychoanalysis Traumatic brain injury Days of our Lives Yoga Sutras of Patanjali EastEnders Neighbours Ghost Bipolar disorder Sigmund Freud Borderline personality disorder Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Shaggy dog story The Lovely Bones Asperger syndrome W.I.T.C.H.
