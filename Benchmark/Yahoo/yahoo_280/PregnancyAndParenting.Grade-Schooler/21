what do you think ok so my son loves video games and will be so lazy and not go to the bathroom and hold his pee until he just pees his pants he is because that game is so important if he is at home he will go and change clothes and not until i do laundry to i find out this has happened then i go and fuss at him we have cut game time down to hour a day now at home and we do moniter that but he spent the night with a friends and apparently they played and played and played and he once again held it and when i got there he was in the bathroom i waited and waited and went and checked on him and he has peed his pants i was so aggervated i made him wear them home to show his dad i said put your shoes on and lets go and he tried to throw a fit and was embaressed i said nope lets go maybe this will teach you a lesson well his friends mom is very upset saying i should have never done that and that is degrading and so forth just wondering what yall think i do not feel it was unfair to him what you did was perfectly fair some mother's are just dramatic and over protective and that's ok but he will not learn if you don't start doing something about it and that was a good start also i would take the game away for a little bit he will be a very big brat about this my son is the same way but it has to be done tell him to occupy his time with anything other than tv and video games if he starts acting good reaward him with like minutes one day and then if he went to the bathroom and was good that day and the next make it alittle longer the next day tel him the next time he does it though you will sale his game and not buy a new one it sounds harsh but we had to do it and he really changed good luck girl and i hope this works out for you Social rule The Jazz Singer Friends Grandview, U.S.A.
