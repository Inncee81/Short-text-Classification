my daughter is telling my mom off help my yr old daughter is a lot like me she speaks her mind and is brutally honest my mom is a pathalogical liar and has burned many bridges with her stories it started to get attention and just got so out of control that my mom no longer knows what is true or false even when the truth is placed in front of her my daughter has already told my mom how she feels about her lies and deception we have planned a camping trip for days and my mom has decided to make an appearance i cannot talk my mom out of it and i cannot cancel the camping trip how do i convince my daughter who i taught to be honest and truthful to be quiet and keep her mouth shut when her grandma starts telling her normal lies last time they talked she told her that she doesn't like her lying and would not appreciate it if my mom showed up to her brother's birthday party that did not go over well well wow sit down and talk to her just say now i know i taught you to be honest but even for me for everyone some things just don't need to be said i could say a lot to grandma but idon't becuase the truth really hurts grandma like that so next time just zip that little mouth of yours at camp have fun but not to the point where everyone else has a problem with you i mean imagine what boys would say if you said everything on your mind everything that you don't like about them they wouldn't like you and then he would tell all of his friends so shh Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hey Arnold!
