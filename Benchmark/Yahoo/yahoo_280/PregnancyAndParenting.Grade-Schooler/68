to all the lego moms i have a very bright year old he's going into kindergarten in weeks and already reads at a nd grade level and he understands reason his favorite pasttime is lego kits mind you we get outside for playdates and park trips and he understands that these kits we buy him need to be treated with respect he has about a dozen star wars exoforce aquaraiders sets and we have a one out at a time rule because lost and confused pieces means you can't build it again not to mention they're expensive so we have a few little buddies who come over to play and i used to be able to set up the gentrax train in the living room or do other stuff but now all they want to do is see my son's lego sets i have them in boxes in his closet after the friend has gone the room is a disaster with all the kits messed up we have a horrible time cleaning it up because he always tells me so and so wanted to see that one and i want to help him clean up after all i'm the one who oops arranged the playdate but i don't know what pieces go where and he does do i keep his room off limits i've tried tellling the kids my rule i want my kid to be able to share his toys with his friends but how do i prevent the mayhem what do you do the other moms are not really into my thoughts we gave one kid a racer only pieces or so and he sat with wheels in his mouth while my kid built it for him i want my kid to respect the collection we've built for him and thank god we keep the big kits batcave fortress airport in our garage oh and i have a year old who wants to be in there and that's where i am while the destruction occurs i'm entertaining her thanks for any help geotrax not gentrax omg i can totally relate my kids are lego builders at ages and i also have a month old that i have to make sure the kids get all pieces picked up so that baby doesn't get a hold of them i tell you what i would have his room off limits to play dates if he wants to share one of his creations have him only bring creation down to share that way this will alleviate the problem to finding all the pieces that go with each kit have the children play at your kitchen table and tell them all the pieces have to be at the table and they must be picked up and put away nicely when they are finished make sure your son understands that these are his toys and his responsibility so he has to put the toys away that are taken out of his room for playdates also you could have a 'no lego' rule for playdates and have them do craft projects like painting or drawing or making a paper mache pinata there are other things to do than just legos save your sanity and put the rules in place it'll be easier for all of you i had to do it here at my house and it works great i've converted my basement into lego central and all the kids that want to play with lego's can go downstairs to play but they have to pick them up and pass inspection before they leave but my kids are a little older best of luck to you Lego Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Care Bears Shaggy dog story The Adventures of Pete & Pete Social rule Poker jargon Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Bionicle The Brady Bunch Lego Group The Catcher in the Rye Dog training Scale model Extreme Programming Vegeta Ben Johnson (athlete) Textile manufacturing The Fairly OddParents Monopoly (game) About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Craps The Star Wars Holiday Special Animal Crossing Great Teacher Onizuka The Contender (television series) The Apprentice 2 Laura Schlessinger RuneScape quests LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game Duplo Japanese tea ceremony South Park Hamster Ocean's Twelve Theodicy Betting (poker) Basement Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Apt Pupil Slow Train Coming The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie O scale Recurring South Park characters The Shining (film) Ra (board game) Hearing impairment Radio controlled airplane Waking the Dragons The Silence of the Lambs Shawn Michaels Emergency preparedness My Little Pony Kurt Cobain God Emperor of Dune Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Milton H.
