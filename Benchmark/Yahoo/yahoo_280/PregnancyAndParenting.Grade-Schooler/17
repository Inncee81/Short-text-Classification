crazy adopted year old girl we just adopted a little year old girl and she has been a little angel until today she started going nuts breaking everything talking back bullying the younger kids i dont know what to do with her she has been spanked by her other parents but should i i tried taking away some toys putting her in the corner nothing works i didnt want to spank her like i do my other kids but she is going nuts she also cusses at school and at me so should i spank or not and with what i cant with the hand she bites i dont know what to do please help i dont want to spank her because she was abused badley when she was little and im scared something wrong will happen im going to try taking her to a counselor or something if that doesnt work ill probably spank her but thxs yall i agree with everyone who said to get her counseling you have no idea of every thing she may have been through in her life before you adopted her you have some idea but it could be ten times worse it's very possible that until now she was unsure of her place in your home so was being on her best behavior but now she feels more secure so she isn't suppressing her emotions and needs an outlet to vent ask your pediatrician for a referral to a child psychiatrist i think you are doing the right thing by not spanking her but maybe you should also not spank your other children it might scare her to know that you do or she could think that she can get away with more because they get spanked and she doesn't try to find a good fair punishment that can be used for all of your children when they misbehave good luck Spanking Kodocha Child abuse Theory of conduct Pitaten Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder James Dobson EastEnders Friends Milton H.
