babysitting help for a family of hi i'm and i'm going to babysit next week for a family of the kids are twingirls age girl age and twin boys age this family is really close to me and i consider these kids my siblings how much is okay to charge i don't want to charge too much since they're really good kids no trouble and like my family but kids is a lot you know so how much should i charge per hour it depends where you live what time you'll be babysitting and for how long if it's at night and the kids will be in bed for most of the time your rate should be lower than if it's an all day thing where you have to entertain them prepare food etc it also depends if the family is well off or not i suggest asking them first what they think is a fair rate don't be afraid to barter most parents are just as confused with what to charge as you are but lastly remember you're only they're not hiring someone who's much older than their kids so take that into account too don't gauge them where i live babysitters get paid about hour Day care The Fairly OddParents Social rule Twin Calvin and Hobbes Eric Bischoff Empire Burlesque About a Boy Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Recess (TV series) Timmy Turner Baby Blues Time Out of Mind EastEnders The Adventures of Pete & Pete FoxTrot Boy Meets World Child Humphrey Bogart Cartoon Network Capital accumulation The Heartbroke Kid Urinary incontinence The Catcher in the Rye AFI 100 Years series The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Microeconomics Stewie Griffin Malcolm in the Middle Milton H.
