how do i explain life lessons my daughter serious answers only please my daughter is seven years old lately she has been wanting to dress inappropriate for her age i have a niece who is a teenager and wears clothing i would never allow my daughter to wear but my little girl looks up to her how do i explain age appropriately how this makes other girls look or how dangerous this could be her father and i are somewhat old fashioned but i do let her have some say in her clothes i feel like she thinks we are being mean by making her change and i want her to feel confident in what she is wearing only without showing to much i understand your problem with the child she can not understand the implications and you can not even explain it to her cool the best way is to lay rules because kids easily understand rules and limits than freedom explanations hardly work with children normally the negative words do not impact much with kids when you tell to a kid do not go out kids easily understand do go out if you tell you should not wear these dresses the next immediate question will be why not and the answers will for sure very difficult for us and for them too so try to address that the dress that we bought gives an angel look to you and a jean with a t shirt gives a responsible look to you as you are already responsible from your question i understood that you your husband have a decent dressing culture thats first to be apreciated parents are the first roll models to the kids i have seen many parents do with so called attractive dresses and finally blame their kids that go a way above them parents should stay roll models and also the direction makers so nothing harm in making rules once a kid used to for certain way dressing at his her to years of age mostly the same pattern will stay for ever so this is the right time for you to bring your child in the right dressing way Infantilism Gender role Transactional analysis Sharon Tate Second language acquisition Hijab Religion Catechism Kilt Franz Boas Clothing Scientology beliefs and practices Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jean Grey Good Times Fashion Incest EastEnders Cult Cultural relativism Paris Hilton Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Grunge music Anorexia nervosa Expert system About a Boy Saved by the Bell Marilyn Monroe Motivation Cross-dressing Sola fide Comanche Santa Claus Creationism Sexual orientation History of subcultures in the 20th century The Critic Child Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Domestic violence Sento Intelligent design movement Child pornography Psychology Skirt and dress Undergarment My Life as a Teenage Robot Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shirt One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Philosophy of mathematics Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ludwig Wittgenstein Megan Griffin Skinhead Calvin and Hobbes Science SMTV Live Recess (TV series) Goth Extreme Programming Socrates Mary Wollstonecraft Daria Polyamory Parkour The Human Stain Civil rights Sigmund Freud Social rule Goodness and value theory Corset High school subcultures Parapsychology Jumpstart 3rd Grade Recurring South Park characters Narcissism Culture of the United States Numerology Nudity Predestination Gurkha Contingent David Beckham Creationist cosmologies Incarnations of Immortality Moral Politics God Doctor (Doctor Who) Jennifer Lopez Code: Lyoko English grammar Strategic management
