what to do with my month old son st time mom in need of help well my son is on a routine of feeding every hours napping every hours for an hour to half our at a time usually wakes to eat after a nap his has bed time routine around bed by sleeps until usually wakes a couple times in the night to be givin a soother again sometimes to eat depends on the night he use to go to bed at and sleep untill but without so many wakings however it seemed like was beginning to be too late he was getting fussy around he would have an enjoyable bath then but it was always a fight for pjs and would fuss and cry until he got fed and the would go to bed at so we changed his bed time to bed time routine is alot more pleasurable but now have early mornings with night wakings what would be a good schedule is he not napping enough or too much whats a good bed time should i space him to hour feedings anthing i am big on schedule p s i am not into letting him cry him self back to sleep when my daughter was around months she went through a stage when her sleep patterns went beserk she had been a great little sleeper sleeping for hours at a time and hours up during the day and sleeping hours at night un broken apparently babies go through a growth spurt at around months my daughters whole routine went out the window she would wake screaming after minutes and her long sleeps were minutes day and night this lasted around weeks and just as quick as it started it stopped she returned to a lovely routine since then she didn't seem to need as much sleep as she had been having and i decided to let her try to find a routine i gave her days and in that time i picked up on her little signs i was able to catch her at the first sign of being tired and put her down then otherwise she quickly became overtired and it was a real battle to get her to sleep i kept a sleep chart just a table of sleeptimes feed times etc and was able to work out from there a routine that suited us both she is now months old goes to bed at pm sleeps hours wakes at am and has either two hour sleeps a day or sometimes just sleep of maybe hours i refused point blank to let her cry herself to sleep but there is a difference between screaming and her whinging sorry i can't think of a better word it is a really tired murmer type cough i would suggest talking to a lactation consultant about changing his feeding routine even if you bottle feed they are really great they know all about feeding routines and amounts my daughters routine used to be a bath before bed but i found this would wake her up to much i tried taking her in the shower with me i believe that the constant cuddles and reassurance was able to relax her alot she now prefers a shower and if you want to stick to a routine go for it your child will need to get used to a routine later in life anyway so you are just paving the way for an easier transition good luck Breastfeeding Sleep Mattress The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Sin City Daylight saving time Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Apollo 8 Avenue Q Polyphasic sleep Fertility awareness Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Futurama (TV series - season 5) Childbirth USS Yorktown (CV-10) The Shining (film) The Contender (television series) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Amber Spyglass The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Oasis (band) Spice Girls Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) USS Wasp (CV-18) Teen Girl Squad Donald Neilson Milton H.
