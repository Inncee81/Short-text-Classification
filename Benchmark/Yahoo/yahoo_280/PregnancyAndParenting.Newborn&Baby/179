can i have all the rights for our baby me and my husband will have a baby in september i want to have all the rights for the baby just in case if we will get separated one day is that possible if yes where do i have to go my hb is ok with it congratulations divine to you and your husband but of all the things to think about that is surprising that you inquired this i agree with angel about getting a lawyer to legally write out all that terms that you and your husband agree with in terms of physical custody of your child but keep in mind it depends on what state and city you are located in and you being due in september to have your child and still being married might change all of the sentiments you might currently be feeling no matter what he has rights as do you it took the both of you to make this blessed creation you soon will have in september so try to concentrate on having a healthy pregnancy and looking forward to raising a beautiful child there is more to think of than just physical custody of your child finances emotional well being etc stay optimistic and healthy and then worry about the other stuff afterwards you are already married good luck and be safe smiles Divorce Infantilism Marriage Breastfeeding Fathers' rights Abortion in the United States Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Polyamory Jon Secada Children of God Pregnancy Jacob Melanie Wilkes Adoption Social rule Pledge of Allegiance Sharon Tate Yoko Ono Soul Rape Israel ben Eliezer Women in the Victorian era Pedophilia Civil union Series finale Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Child support Childbirth Transsexuality Hillary Rodham Clinton Vivian Solon One Life to Live Legal rights of women Care Bears Maria Hertogh riots Ethics The Amber Spyglass Spanking Theory of conduct Clinical depression Child Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religion Intellectual property Fathers' rights movement in the UK Virgin Mary in Islam Evolutionism Decision making Miscarriage Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Right Miranda warning Frankie Laine Days of our Lives Magical thinking Abortion Visitation Arjuna Trinity Knots Landing Intact dilation and extraction Child sexuality Family Same-sex marriage in Canada Single parent Zohar Hypoglycemia Simone Weil Separation of church and state in the United States Los Rold__n Miranda v.
