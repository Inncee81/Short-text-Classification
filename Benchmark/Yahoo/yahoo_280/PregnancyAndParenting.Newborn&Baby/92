is it ok to stop breastfeeding your newborn if so then why do i feel like such a horrible person i stopped trying to breastfeed when my daughter was weeks old it wasn't working for us for many reasons my milk wasn't as plentiful as she would have liked and my year old son always acting up when i tried to feed her knowing i wasn't as fast to get up and put him in time out were two of the main reasons she would get frusterated at the lack of milk at first and then she just stopped trying after a few days i feel like i am a horrible mom for not trying longer but the truth is it was making life hard for us both and i was a weepy mess i love her so much and wanted to give her all the best i wanted to be the type of mom who breastfed their child until the child weaned like or now i feel like she was cheated what is your opinion on this my little girl is only weeks days now so that's why i am still so sad where are all the peoples answers that gave the thumbs down there is only one it's not ok answer but some peoples answers have thumbs down i want honesty here even if it hurts don't beat yourself up about it breastfeeding just isn't for every woman and that doesn't make you a bad mom just as women who do breastfeed shouldn't look down on women who don't as if they are better you tried to and that's all that matters i breastfeed my little girl for the first week or so too the first few days of trying were horrible b c she wouldn't latch on right and she wasn't getting enough to eat which meant she was constantly crying so then i started trying to pump but my breasts just wouldn't produce that much i finally decided to just give up on it b c she had began losing weight all that mattered to me was that my daughter was finally eating and healthy breastfeeding may be less expensive and better for the baby but i think bottle feeding it more convenient and helps give mommy a break b c daddy can help feed too so don't feel bad about it b c you love your child and that's all that matters Social rule Theory of conduct Kodocha Shaggy dog story Infant Knots Landing EastEnders Friends Milk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fertility awareness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pregnancy Childbirth Pitaten Fiddler on the Roof Charmed Breast pump Scenes from a Memory Ben Johnson (athlete) One Tree Hill (TV series) Infantilism Theodicy Breast milk Jon Secada Infant formula Ron and Fez Poker jargon Hey Jude The Fairly OddParents YuYu Hakusho Phoebe Buffay's songs The Emancipation of Mimi Piccolo Junior Saga Jaundice The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Frankie Laine Kyle Broflovski Nipple piercing Kurt Cobain Street-Legal Kibbutz About a Boy Ranma __ characters Days of our Lives She Loves You Tupac Shakur Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Little Britain The Amber Spyglass Mina Mongoose The Ashlee Simpson Show Characters in the Smurfs 2000 Australian Grand Prix Smallville (Season 4) International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Bon Jovi Transactional analysis Blonde on Blonde The Contender (television series) Father Ted Le Malade imaginaire The Apprentice 2 Prolactin The nature of God in Western theology Sin City Samuel Goldwyn Marilyn Monroe Baby bottle Alena Year of the Spider Indianapolis 500 Cliff Richard The Adventures of Pete & Pete Oasis (band) House of M Spice Girls Humphrey Bogart Plame affair Montreal Screwjob Something Positive History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Eddie Guerrero True Crime: Streets of LA The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Yoko Ono Joke The Death Gate Cycle Incarnations of Immortality Laura Schlessinger
