another poop question ok earlier i recieved an answer that mucusy poo is normal in breastfed babies it is yellow and seedy but also mucusy i was concerned that the baby may be sensitive to something i'm eating i'd like to know if anyone elses exclusively b f baby had mucus in there stool and where can i find info to back up that this is normal as i've read that is due to illness or sensitivity not to contradict anyone just curious as i stated earlier the baby is happy and quite content i'm not paranoid just concerned thanx to all who answered my earlier question i appreciate the advice i agree that the yellow and seedy part is okay but i don't know about the mucus i've never heard that it was okay to have a mucusy poop i think you should ask your pediatrician to find out for sure your baby may have a sensitivity to something or a medical condition or a minor infection Breastfeeding Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Feces Diarrhea Plame affair Infantilism Cystic fibrosis Psychosis Mario Colorectal cancer Infant formula Irritable bowel syndrome Schizophrenia Ulcerative colitis Joke Paranoia Human feces Helicobacter pylori Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Childbirth Allergy Jaundice Urinary incontinence 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Congenital disorder Medical analysis of circumcision A Course In Miracles Pulmonary alveolus Infant Australian constitutional law Escherichia coli O157:H7 Fibromyalgia Common cold Conker's Bad Fur Day The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Fecal incontinence Charles Darwin's illness Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Taxi Driver United States Senate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pet skunk Shit The Beatles discography HIV Sudden infant death syndrome Insomnia Leviathan (book) Milton H.
