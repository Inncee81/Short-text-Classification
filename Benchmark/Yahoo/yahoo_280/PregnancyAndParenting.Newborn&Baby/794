what made you decide to start your baby on solids how old were they and were they formula or breastfed just a sort of poll out of curiosity and interest i've just recently started my three month plus one week old son on rice cereal x per day he has reflux and the rice is supposed to help according to his pediatric gi so i feed him the cereal at his last feeding of the day i know some folks do this to make their babies sleep through the night for my son that is hit or miss depends on how well he napped how wet his diaper gets how alert he is when his daddy goes in for him sometimes he won't go back down in the middle of the night without a bottle even after his cereal meal but that was never our goal in the first place i should add that he hates his formula and he's a very big boy he is about pounds with good head and neck control those are criteria that i have read as a precursor to starting solids he won't have anything but the rice until the end of next month and i will only start introducing other foods if he is taking ounces of formula and still hungry Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Infant Urinary incontinence Cereal Breakfast cereal Kimberly-Clark Corporation Sin City Agriculture Milk Diaper Scooby-Doo Breakfast Bowl Championship Series Cheese Rice University Billboard Hot 100 Rice Folic acid Bread Garfield Hamburger Nestl__ boycott Sean Combs Indianapolis 500 Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Camp Lazlo Gastroesophageal reflux disease Sleep Baby bottle Chess (musical) FoxTrot Infantilism Burger King Siesta Cleveland Indians Nestl__ Snooker Tupac Shakur Cliff Richard Futurama (TV series - season 5) Formula One Obesity Anopheles Vegeta Phoebe Buffay's songs Narcolepsy Ham Pet skunk Ron and Fez Laws of cricket Scott Storch EastEnders Provisioning (cruise ship) The Contender (television series) Cincinnati Bengals Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Rice Krispies Kibbutz Atkins Nutritional Approach Hypoglycemia Veganism Hamster Kosher foods Jon Secada Sumo Sake Hip hop rivalries Super Size Me Fasting National Football League Coeliac disease Lisa's First Word New York Giants Elimination communication Wheel of Fortune Shaggy dog story Vegetarianism Ayrton Senna Adjustable gastric band Alcoholic beverage $ale of the Century Parenting Kellogg Company MRE Plastic Cat Bodybuilding Phil Hendrie San Francisco 49ers Oat Fecal incontinence Shen Gong Wu Samples of music from the United States One Piece minor characters Kurt Angle Polish cuisine Rod Stewart
