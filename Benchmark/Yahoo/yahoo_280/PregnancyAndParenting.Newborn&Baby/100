is there any state in which breastfeeding in public is illegal no however in some states like texas private businesses can use the claim that they have the right to refuse business to anyone in many states legislature is being discussed as it is on the federal level to change this so hopefully soon there will be a federal law stating that a woman can breastfeed wherever she the child are entitled to legally be plus she cannot be asked to cover up go to the bathroom or leave in the event that a complaint is made based solely on the fact that she is breastfeeding i'm sure they word it more legal than that but that's the proposed meaning check w your state and find out what's going on there sign petitions email representatives be active about it and on the health hazard thing if osha does not consider it a biohazard then no one else can so if this ever happens to you fight it if a restaurant tries to stop you it's because someone stupid has complained that they don't want their husband looking at you they should be the ones to be relocated to a different section of the restaurant breastmilk even the milk of a stranger is not a health hazard Breastfeeding Occupational Safety and Health Administration Childbirth Whistleblower Same-sex marriage in the United States Child pornography Controlled Substances Act Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Supreme Court of the United States Judicial review E-mail spam Intelligent design movement Article One of the United States Constitution Treaty Ice hockey Same-sex marriage in Canada Health insurance Constitution of Ireland Tom DeLay Head of state Government of Australia Nuclear option (filibuster) Town meeting Jury Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Cannabis rescheduling in the United States United States Postal Service Evan Mecham Hazardous material Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Civil rights Gay rights Lawrence v.
