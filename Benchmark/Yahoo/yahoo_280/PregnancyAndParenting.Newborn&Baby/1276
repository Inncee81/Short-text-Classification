how do you make a month old sleep my month old cousin won't sleep all night and he won't sleep in his room during his naps too i want him to sleep when i am watching him because when he doesn't he is cranky so i let him sleep on my bed next to me while i read then he will sleep for a couple hours otherwise he only sleeps minutes he won't sleep in his crib wrong he will sleep by himself if you give him sufficient time to do so right now you have been getting him in the habit of falling asleep only when you are around habits take time to make and break put him in his room by himself when it is time for sleep let him cry and make noise he will eventually stop although this might seem to take forever eventually he will cry for shorter periods and then stop all together this may sound cruel to you but allowing the situation to be what it is now is crueler for you and him if he is constantly dependent on you in order to fall asleep then that does him no good especially as he gets older Sleep Narcolepsy The Amber Spyglass Siesta Shaggy dog story Friends The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Insomnia EastEnders Miss Saigon Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sleep debt Sudden infant death syndrome Cat Futurama (TV series - season 5) Mattress 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence The Catcher in the Rye Kurt Cobain Pitaten Co-sleeping Time Babe Ruth Apollo 8 Blood Simple Bon Jovi Otello Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Sin City Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Daylight saving time Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
