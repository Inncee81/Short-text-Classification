why do so many people see breast feeding as a bad thing or that they'd rather sleep i'm a mother of three i feed all three n stil feeding my month i dont think that people that dont breast feed r bad or anything but the people that do breast feed shouldn'y be judged because we do n this thing with rather sleepin please when you have a baby you never get much ne else find this i dont have a problem with people that bottle feed as i have put my milk into a bottle at times but i dont think that because we breast feed is a right to get on at us plus having a baby means hardly any more sleep it just bugs me with something i read on hear the other day where something was said there'd rather sleep etc that dont happen when you have kids there is nothing wrong with breastfeed so i dont know why people have to put people like me down about it my friend bottle feed and i had no problems with it everyone is different etc i just dont see the point in bad mouthin people that do what did we do i cover up when i feed my month old baby out side or i'l go some wher no can see once again i have no problem with people bottle feeding as a lot of my mates did well heather yes i was frm what i know n my point in my question was why did people that didnt breast feed their babys for as they put it for sleep why get on us that did on do breast feed their baby i have no point with people bottle feeding at all if you didnt see that b so you can get back off you high horse should read what i said b saying what you thought i was saying as it wasnt it was a question saying why do most people say stuuff b cos we breast feed or feed should i say i have no problem with people that bottle feed every is different but dont get on other peoples backs because they do or did it's a choice just like anything else i breast fed both my sons until they were month old i found i got more sleep because i didn't have to get up and prepare bottles with my first son i supplemented with formula after i'd introduced solids at months because he wasn't gaining but i still nursed him on demand people have choices about lots of things giving up cigarettes while pregnant taking folic acid while pregnant giving up caffeine while pregnant giving up alcohol while pregnant while it's clear that breast feeding is better for the child and the mother there are some cases where it's not possible my cousin tried for four weeks with her daughter her nipples were so raw and bloody that she cried as soon as her daughter started to stir she would sit bolt upright and stare at the wall with tears sliding down her face the whole time her daughter was latched on she called me one day at the time i was the family breastfeeding expert and i told her that in my opinion feeding should be a calm and loving experience where the child and the mother look in each other's eyes i didn't think the benefits of breast feeding were going to outweigh the stress that these two beings were going through there was no way that child was oblivious to her mother's pain and distress that being said i think that a mother who doesn't try to breast feed her child at least for a month is in the same league as a pregnant mother who won't give up her cigarettes selfishness is selfishness choice or not you can at least express and freeze breast milk for a month or two if the thought of an infant's mouth on your nipple makes your toes curl as for people having issues with it in public i find the way some people dress offensive but all i have to do is look away i always used a sling or a shawl in public but people would still give me that disgusted look i'd just meet their eyes and give them a sweet smile if there was a nursing station i'd use it but i refused to ever feed my child in a bathroom now that is disgusting EastEnders Infant Breast Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Milk Fertility awareness The Shining (film) Childbirth 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Abortion debate Friends Folic acid John the Baptist Pregnancy Infant formula Yoko Ono Little Britain Nipple piercing Breast pump Cat Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Social rule Days of our Lives Kodocha Guinea pig Goodness and value theory The Contender (television series) Pitaten Premature birth Marilyn Monroe Mojave people The Marshall Mathers LP Nestl__ boycott Sin City Sharon Tate Urinary incontinence Breast cancer Hera Jam (TV series) One Life to Live Breast milk Elephant Obstetrics Brassiere Salad Fingers Great Teacher Onizuka Cindy Sheehan Tocopherol The Catcher in the Rye Anne Boleyn The Amber Spyglass Baby bottle YuYu Hakusho Kurt Cobain Babe Ruth The Apprentice 2 Futurama (TV series - season 5) Avenue Q Fecal incontinence Simone Weil Equine conformation The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Nipple Milton H.
