why are moms who don't want to breastfeed looked down upon i didn't ever want to because it hurt it should be a choice i read online how hospitals are refusing to give formula to newborn babies at some of them right they will lose a lot of business it should be a mother's right to choose why would a hospital have that right they are only involved in the first hours of care sounds to me like they just don't want to spend the money on formula and are using this as a way out so what is your opinion on this matter yes that's true about bringing your own formula to the hospital but it sounds like the hospitals aren't even letting this wow i didn't realize it was as heated as it is lot of strong opinions i am surprised people should have a choice i don't care what you think is best for me only i know what is best for me women should support each other despite the fact they might not make the same decisions i think it is terrible how some of these people act when you say you didn't breastfeed so what if you didn't the only thing that matters in the long run is if your baby is happy and healthy Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Childbirth EastEnders Shaggy dog story The Apprentice 2 Pitaten Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Abortion debate Paradox Characters in the Smurfs 2000 Australian Grand Prix Infant Fertility awareness Jon Secada Social rule 24 Hours of Le Mans Mother Teresa Marilyn Monroe One Tree Hill (TV series) The Contender (television series) Street-Legal Lorelai Gilmore Abortion in the United States Theodicy Philosophical skepticism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ty Cobb Grandview, U.S.A.
