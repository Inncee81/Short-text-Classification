is this normal why does my four month old baby sometimes scrunch up his nose and make funny breathing noises he is so funny he'll huff and puff with his little nose scrunched up and take really fast deep breaths it's so random it doesn't seem to bother him i asked the doc and he said it's behavioral like when some babies make coughing noises just to hear themselves cough just wondering if any other moms out there have had or have babies that do the same thing thanks hugh a booger was my first thought too so i tried the nasal sucky thing no boogers lol sounds like he's a goon as long as he looks like he's able to breath fine and there isn't an obvious sound of mucus interfering with his breathing make fases back at him and enjoy it it sounds like your doctor has it right and he's playing with you to see what your reaction is i can garantee your face was probably pretty funny the first time you heard that and went running to see what was wrong Mucus Shaggy dog story Joke Bart chalkboard gags Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Drag racing Milton H.
