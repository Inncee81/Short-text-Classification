what are some good toys for a month old we do tons of floor time but i would like to give him something to keep him occupied for those moments when i have to tend to my year old pretty much anything that has no sharp edges no small bits that can fall off and no long cords my son loves to sit next to me in the kitchen and play with plastic bowls so you dont need to go and buy anything fancy but if you are i would look for things that will grow with him as he gets bigger at months theyre very intersted in sucking everything they dont really care too much what theyre sucking so if i were to buy something id go for big plastic building blocks or baby lego as theyre big and bright and safe to suck and will grow with him right through till hes or years old Lego Drill bit Patrick Star Plastic Care Bears Humphrey Bogart Breastfeeding My Little Pony Knife Atomic Kitten Hamster Primus (band) Shaggy dog story Gramophone record Urinary incontinence Fancy rat About a Boy Jennifer Lopez Comanche Carnivorous plant Poker jargon RuneScape quests Kitchen Lego Group Canary Teletubbies Childbirth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Super Bowl Toy Textile manufacturing Strap-on dildo Sea-Monkey Blood on the Tracks Piano Little Britain The Unquiet Dead Milton H.
