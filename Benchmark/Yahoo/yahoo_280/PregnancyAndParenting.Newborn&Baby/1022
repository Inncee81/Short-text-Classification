what do i do when i already have two kids by two different girls and im only i have two baby girls shannon and jaycee and i love both of them very much shannon is two months old and jaycee is a month old they are beautiful because they both look like their moms the girl who had shannon is and her name is shelbi and jaycee's mom is and her name is jaylen i love both my babies and im going to be a good father because i never had one growing up and i still dont have one so im going to give them everything i never had i spend every moment i can with both my little girls i just dont know how to handle their moms they know about each other and don't like the fact that i have a baby with both of them but they except it i live with my mom but i stay at jaylen and her mom's house more than my own to help her with the baby and im trying to get custody of shannon so i can be with both my girls i still go to school whenever its possible and i do keep trying to go for everyone's sake what should i do as we get older i think you are doing a good job given the circumstances atleast you want to be a part of their lives i think you should continue being around them as much as possible and stay in school so you have a fighting chance at a career later on talk to the mothers of both of your children and tell them to get over themselves and quit being dumb so what if they dont like the fact that you have kids with both of them theres nothing any of you can do about it just keep your head up and make sure that no matter what happens that your babies know that their daddy loves them Atomic Kitten Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Charmed Jon Secada Angelina Jolie Baby Blues The Adventures of Pete & Pete Laura Schlessinger One Life to Live Married... with Children Phoebe Buffay's songs Cliff Richard Spice Girls Teamo Supremo Friends Doug Days of our Lives EastEnders The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Rugrats Tupac Shakur Humphrey Bogart Billboard Hot 100 Knots Landing Stewie Griffin Abortion debate Fathers' rights Little Big Mom Kyle Broflovski The Amber Spyglass Something Positive Everwood Triple J Hottest 100, 2003 Mr. and Mrs. Turner Springfield Elementary School America's Next Top Model My Life as a Teenage Robot Pitaten Full House Whitney Houston The Beach Boys Chad Michael Murray Babe Carey Saved by the Bell Ron and Fez The McGuire Sisters One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story For Better or For Worse About a Boy The Drifters Gregg Alexander Phil of the Future Alois Hitler Infantilism The O.C.
