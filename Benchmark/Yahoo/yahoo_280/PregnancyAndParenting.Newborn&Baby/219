colic or no so i have a week old baby and she's been breastfeeding exclusively however on thursday i started adding formula to the breastmilk because i'm going to be going back to work at six weeks and that's what the doctor told me to do on saturday she started to be really fussy but it wasn't too bad now today she has been screaming and crying all day i don't know if she's gassy because she hasn't had as many bm's as usual or if it's because of the formula also i have been sick since friday it started with very bad stomach pains which i still have and i have been having very very loose stools starting today the stomach pains are so bad that it almost feels like i'm in labor so i don't know if she has maybe caught what i have and the diarreah hasn't started yet or if it's gas or if it's caused by the formula or if she's just colicky any advice would be greatly appreciated normally if mother is working mother's breast milk stored in refrigerators in feeding bottles for the baby during the absent of the mother breastfeeding effect the baby when mother taking things such as extra foods and does effect the baby allergist food to mother does effect the baby take your baby immediately to the doctor the mother must see the doctor for advise Infant formula Breast milk Milk Childbirth Stomach cancer Infant Jaundice Pregnancy International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Fertility awareness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nestl__ Nestl__ boycott Baby bottle EastEnders Breast Breast pump Horse colic Kodocha Joke Friends Gastroesophageal reflux disease Obstetrics Fecal incontinence The Caves of Androzani Cindy Sheehan Diarrhea Premature birth Jam (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Prolactin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Protein-energy malnutrition Indianapolis 500 Mastitis Folic acid The Shining (film) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Aliens of London Dairy Ayyavazhi mythology Sulfasalazine Phoebe Buffay's songs Knots Landing Food allergy Adjustable gastric band Insulin Sydney Riot of 1879 Saturday Night Live Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Kibbutz The Empty Child Mad Money Paracetamol Irritable bowel syndrome Night (book) Comanche The Curse of Fenric Clomipramine Ron and Fez Soap opera Decompression sickness Coeliac disease Botulism Milton H.
