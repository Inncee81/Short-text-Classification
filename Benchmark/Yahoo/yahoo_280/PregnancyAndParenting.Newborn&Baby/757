would it be possible to breastfeed even though i have to travel for my job when i return to work full time i will have to travel about once or twice a month for about two nights each trip is it possible to pump while i am traveling how do i store two days worth of breastmilk if i am staying in a hotel i want to make breastfeeding work and am looking forward to hearing from those of you who have had a similar experience i stay at home so i haven't personally had the experience i was reading about a woman who is in the army and breastfed her baby she had to travel out of state for a school common in the military and could last several weeks or months when her baby was very young she got a good hospital grade pump pumped on a schedule and kept the milk in a mini freezer she had bought to keep in the barracks with her you would probably have to make sure the freezer in the hotel is cold enough then she had the milk shipped back to her husband through a refrigerated shipping company i thought that was incredibly dedicated of her to go through all of that and i was really impressed the biggest concern i would have is that the fridge in the hotel room is cold enough you could also invest in a good cooler both to store the milk and travel home with it a third option would be to try to bank enough milk at home for the days you are gone and pump just to keep up your supply while away it can be done but it will take a lot of work on your part good luck Breastfeeding Refrigerator Milk Fertility awareness Breast pump Dairy Childbirth Vacuum Ice cream Breast USS Vestal (AR-4) International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Breast milk Rais massacre Infant formula Internet fraud Nestl__ boycott Hotel Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Solar power Sears Holdings Corporation Refrigerator car EastEnders Jaundice Air conditioning Carburetor Breakfast Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Food storage Neighbours Ocean's Twelve Nestl__ Battles of Lexington and Concord Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baby bottle Basement Cruising (maritime) Las Vegas metropolitan area Sharon Stone Bodybuilding In-N-Out Burger Kodocha Pregnancy Fancy Crane Attack on Pearl Harbor Make money fast Kitchen Operation Petticoat Joke Social rule Infant MapleStory Little Britain Tofu HMS Electra (H27) Coffee Francisco Pizarro Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Education in Germany Pitaten John F.
