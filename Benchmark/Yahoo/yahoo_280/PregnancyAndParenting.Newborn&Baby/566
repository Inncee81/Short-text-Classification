autism and breastmilk has there been any research done to show how many autistic children were breastfed i am beginning to think there is a link most autistic children that i see have older slim mothers that breastfeed could there be something the mother is doing not doing to unintentionally cause their child to be autistic i see some mothers worrying about their bodies after the pregnancy could the infant not be getting enough fat in their diet which is very important for brain development i formula fed both my children and i have not had any problems with chronic illnesses or mental dysfunction has anyone seen any research i doubt there's a link to breastfeeding or the mother's age causing autism i have kids and they all were breastfed my youngest was born when i was no autism one of my nephew's on the other hand was bottle fed and born to a young mother around or so and he's autistic i believe the rise in autism is due to the fact that not all mental deficiencies are being lumped into one category any more autism is being recognized in it's own separate category with it's own unique symptoms so we can now clearly see that there's a difference between a child with autism and say a child with down syndrome edit both parents of my nephew with autism were young and she has a second son who is not autistic Breastfeeding Controversies in autism Autism epidemic Asperger syndrome Autistic spectrum Autistic community Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Bernard Rimland Hypoglycemia Andrew Wakefield Autistic enterocolitis Nutrition Thimerosal Pervasive developmental disorder Cephalic disorder MMR vaccine Ethical challenges to autism treatment Infant formula Haloperidol Autistic culture Facilitated communication Protein-energy malnutrition Simon Baron-Cohen Intelligence quotient Brain Childbirth Fertility awareness Glycogen storage disease type I Refrigerator mother Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Gluten-free, casein-free diet Mental illness HIV Anti-psychiatry Gifted Diabetes mellitus Folic acid Lesch-Nyhan syndrome M.I.N.D.
