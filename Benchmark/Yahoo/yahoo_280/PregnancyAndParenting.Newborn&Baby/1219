my five and a half month old refuses to eat veggies she does eat her cereal what should i do i do not have any children but i do have three nephews the youngest one is months and when he was first introduced to baby food he would act like he liked it one day and then the next he wouldn't take one bite of the same stuff and usually he isn't that interested in trying anything too different i think your baby probably is just surprised by the change and not interested at the time give it a little break and try later and try to give it her at a time when she's very smiley i find this is the easiest time to get them excited about something new but if months go by and no improvement you should probably consult a pediatrition MRE The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kodocha Breastfeeding Breakfast cereal Piccolo Junior Saga Breakfast Hey Jude Elephant Burger King Fecal incontinence Social rule Knots Landing Giant Panda Comanche Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cheerios Folic acid Vegetarianism John Harvey Kellogg Characters in the Smurfs Mnemonic Gluten-free, casein-free diet Snack food Theory of conduct Fasting Hera Terri Schiavo Nestl__ Humphrey Bogart Melanie Wilkes Coeliac disease Bread Smiley Smile EastEnders The Beach Boys Eddie Guerrero Jon Secada Neighbours Passover Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 1968 Pet Sounds Characters of Lost Vegetarian cuisine Friends Infant formula Tasmanian Devil Sesame Street Bat Boy Avenue Q Cliff Richard Messerschmitt Bf 109 The McGuire Sisters Ron and Fez Mental Health Act 1983 John the Baptist Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Siege of Antioch VeggieTales Popeye Late Night with Conan O'Brien Shark Green Revolution I Want to Hold Your Hand Charmed Neopets Invader Zim Hall & Oates Jam (TV series) Kimberly-Clark Corporation Food and Drug Administration London Congestion Charge Anorexia nervosa End of Han Dynasty Wild Honey Pregnancy 613 mitzvot Cereal Food Stamp Program Toronto Blue Jays Kender Aston Villa F.C.
