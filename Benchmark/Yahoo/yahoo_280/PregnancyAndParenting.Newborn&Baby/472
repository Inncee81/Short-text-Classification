cloth diapers are they worth all the fuss ive been looking up cloth diapers and seeing if they are worth getting and on eof the kinds say that you can only use them for days or maybe thats just the garuntee kushies i dont understand i know how to wash them and and put them on but what is the best kind to use like the ones with disposible liners or the mirofiber insert ones or what help please thank you angel l in my humble opinion there is only one choice in this matter that is cloth cloth cloth cloth the only real diaper is a cloth diaper cloth diapers are cheaper in the long run than disposables true there is a larger cost up front but each time you use those cloth diapers they become cheaper and cheaper until the are less than the disposables cloth diapers breathe where disposables won't even with wearing diaper covers over the cloth diapers they breathe better this means next to no diaper rashes you just need to make sure that you change them right away they are better for your baby's skin cloth diapers aren't that difficult to maintain under normal circumstances for one child you shouldn't have to do more than one or two loads of diapers a week that really isn't that much when you think about how much better off your baby will be in the long run not to mention your wallet cloth diapers when taken off your baby should have any waste dumped into the toilet and flushed away then they should be put in a diaper pail with water and white vinegar to cut down on the odor causing bacteria cloth diapers should be washed with a detergent just like your other laundry don't use the kind that says chemical free because they leave a residue in the diapers make sure you use a nd rinse cycle during the first rinse cycle put in a cup of white vinegar and let the nd cycle rinse it out cloth diapers should not be washed in bleach because bleach will break down the fibers in the diapers causing them to prematurely wear out and become nothing more than rags cloth diapers should not be washed or dryed with any kind of fabric softener because it leaves a coating on the fibers and makes them less absorbent cloth diapers can be dryed in the dryer but if you can hang them in the sun it is a natural bleach and helps get rid of stains and gives the diapers a very fresh clean fragrance i use a drying rack instead of a clothes line to dry mine that way i don't break my back reaching up to hang them up i don't drop clothes pins and i don't hang myself on the clothes line yes i say mine i'm incontinent and have to wear diapers due to a medical condition i wear cloth diapers all the time the only time i will wear disposables is on a long trip where it isn't easy to wash or store used cloth diapers give them a try i think you will like them today's cloth diapers are not your grandmother's diapers any more there are so many different styles of diapers and diaper covers that are just as easy to use as disposables by the way they will last for years if you take care of them properly good luck Fecal incontinence Infantilism Textile manufacturing Urinary incontinence Dishwasher Menstrual cycle Plastic Washing machine Sewage treatment Upholstery Dry cleaning Procter & Gamble Hard water Dairy Vinegar Japanese tea ceremony Water purification Japanese toilet Clothing Poker jargon Soap Sento Nuclear fuel cycle Comanche Wound Mattress Jute Laundry Halitosis Tattoo Hand washing Hydrogen peroxide Leather Diving suit Floppy disk Tampon Water Sulfuric acid Domestic rabbit Brewery Sodium hypochlorite Hemp Bong Autonomous building Paragliding Car washing techniques Psoriasis Candidiasis Jennifer Lopez Genericized trademark Kimono Nuclear reactor Toilet humour Dishwashing Sauna Bedwetting Sterilization (microbiology) Toilet Hamster Casting Radioactive waste Wood carving Equine conformation Hygiene Breastfeeding Shroud of Turin Motor oil Internal ballistics Aztec Cheese Energy development Ultraviolet Microeconomics Thermal power station Fossil fuel power plant Theory of conduct Condom Professional wrestling match types Sanitary towel Hat The Dalek Invasion of Earth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tooth Climbing equipment Spina bifida Wood Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RISC
