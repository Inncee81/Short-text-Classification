hyland's teething tablets dropped in bottle as i've posted before i feel a tooth so i've been using hylands tablets orajel and cool teething rings some suggested to drop a few hyland's tablest in baby's last bottle before bed anyone else tried this was it effective so i'm guessing the tablets work inside out like a pain killer new mom very paranoid i never tried that as i breastfed and didn't use bottles but they worked alright by putting them under my sons tongue or anywhere in his mouth really they don't really help with the pain as much as they help to take the edge off of all of the symptoms associated with teething Breastfeeding Cocaine Knots Landing Liam Gallagher Milton H.
