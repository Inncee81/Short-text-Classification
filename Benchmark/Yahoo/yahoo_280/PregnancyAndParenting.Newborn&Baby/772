only producing milk from one breast my baby is months and i am slowly weening him but i noticed that i am totally dried up from one breast and still producing in the other i try to nurse him on both but he turns away and doesn't want to nurse now my breasts are different sizes and look totally deformed is this normal in weening should i only nurse on one breast or keep trying both this happens to me everytime every sigle time i have nursed i have kids at about months my right side always dries up i think it may be because its more comfortable for me to nurse on my left and i am better at it on that side so i just nursed more often on that side if you want to try and make the non producer produce again just try pumping that could help but they will get back down to the same size once you stop nursing good luck and happy nursing Breastfeeding Puberty Prolactinoma Equine conformation Childbirth Breast Brassiere Milk EastEnders Urinary incontinence Dairy Humphrey Bogart Chlorpromazine Breaststroke Prostate cancer Nipple Timeline of alternative rock Upholstery Hera Mattress Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Infant Breast pump Breast milk Aerial (dance move) Cancer Breast cancer Obstetrics Radiation therapy Nestl__ Mastitis History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Backstroke Premature birth Human penis size Amiodarone Tocopherol Giant Panda Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Paige Matthews The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The McGuire Sisters Elephant Drill bit Tofu Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Janet Jackson Certified Nursing Assistant Polychlorinated biphenyl Nipple piercing Knots Landing Carbon dioxide Fertility awareness Baby bottle Dean Ween Patron saint Kimberly-Clark Corporation Songs in triple meter Cutey Honey Mammary gland Bah__'u'll__h Lorraine Baines McFly Haloperidol Oh My Goddess!
