let down question does any one not actually feel there milk let down i am exclusively breastfeeding my week old son and i rarely feel my letdown reflex is this a bad thing how do you describe the letdown as feeling the few times i remember feeling it it was kind of a burning sensation and it has only happened a few times we have had a problem with slow weight gain could this be the culprit thanx i have been working closely with a l c and we have had weekly weigh ins things are improving she is on vacation to the who asked it took him until he was weeks old to get back up to his birth weight now he is at he gained from rd to th week from th to th and from th to th lines him up to gain at least a lb in a month he is evening out well i'm not worried we are not big people my year old looks like some year olds and the reason we had such a rough start not to place blame completely but his uninformed doctor misinformed me about nursing on demand which i do now her theory was min each side every hours regardless i educated myself ''online'' and started to work with a lactation consultant and things are good now she 'the doc' even tried to get me to supplement stating that if he still eats after mins he is still hungry and my boobs were empty needles to say i'm in the process of finding a new doc i sadly fell into the rut many women do and i see why so many have a hard time with breastfeeding nowdays it's a disgrace if i wasn't so stubborn i woulda gave up hi susan whew you make me feel better i do weigh him weekly and he is in between oz a week i so pump twice a day also its all i can do he nurses a good bit and i can't pump all day i think my milk was slow to come in also and he wasn't feeding enough to help due to poor advice from doc i am using the consultant for guidance and in the process of changing docs hey we're in similar boats i asked the same question within another question a few days ago too i don't feel anything when my milk is letting down and my five week old was lbs oz when she was born lbs oz when we brought her home and she dropped to lbs oz even after that i fed on demand but my milk was slow to come in i still question my output but i've been pumping now too are you pumping i ended up having to supplement with formula until she got back to her birth weight it took her a little bit less than three weeks to get back there if i give her any formula at all now it's less than oz daily but i won't tell you to supplement because i understand how it sabatoges your milk supply too pumping on the other hand will only help your milk supply some people suggest pumping for minutes after every feeding i haven't been able to pump more than twice per day myself pumping tricks your body into thinking you need to make more milk as for your baby if your pediatrician is out can you even just bring him in just for a weight check my ped's office lets you do this without needing to see the doctor so you have piece of mind but it also sounds like you just want to be sure your baby is really on the right track good moms do that i bet your son really is doing just fine i hope you can get that piece of mind soon one thing i did was step on the scale myself then step on the scale holding my daughter and subtract the difference to see how much roughly she weighs it at least let me see she was gaining not losing Childbirth Milk Fertility awareness Dialysis Folic acid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
