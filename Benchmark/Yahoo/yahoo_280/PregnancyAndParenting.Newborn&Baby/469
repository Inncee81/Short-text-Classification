does daytime sleeping increase during a growth spurt my week old normally his norm slept about minutes at a time during his daytime naps usually took about a day today he has already taken a hr min nap and is currently over an hr a half right now very seldom has he slept longer than hrs during the night usually wakes times to feed q could a growth spurt be making him sleep longer during the day q will this disrupts what every kind of sleep he gets at night any advice is welcome first time mom am i doing something wrong for him to not be sleeping through the night at this point hi everything you are describing is totally normal for a newborn they are growing rapidly and require a lot of sleep especially in those first few months i noticed with both of my children as newborns that they would go for a few days and take really long naps and then it would seem to cycle off and they would be awake longer it wasn't a consistent thing and their sleep patterns fluctuated a lot especially the first months don't be concerned by it let him sleep as much as he wants i wouldn't worry about his sleep being disturbed at night he is growing and needs all that rest sometimes it is common for newborns to get days and nights mixed up but that is totally expected and you are a new mommy so i am sure that you are eager to comfort and spend as much time as possible with him if he wakes up in the night then try offering him a bottle or rocking him back to sleep if all else fails you can lay him down next to your bed in his bassinette some babies do not sleep through the night until they are up to a year old i am not trying to scare you my advice for that is to learn to sleep whenever your baby sleeps that is the only way to deal with a child that isn't a good sleeper but don't worry you will be fine Sleep Narcolepsy Insomnia Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Siesta Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Social rule Humphrey Bogart Cephalic disorder Dream Childbirth Puberty Infantilism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs Milton H.
