how do i create a new object for my c class hi i am a newbie to c programming i created a class named mycar my teacher taught me to create a new object of type mycar i would do like this for exmaple a ford mycar ford the problem is i have to type the name ford inside the code so whenever i want to create a new object i physically have to type a new name in the code my goal is that i want to create a new object at runtime so whatever the name i give to the machine at runtime it will use that name to create a new object can anyone show me how or at least point me to a right direction so i can look for it on the internet thank you so whenever i want to create a new object i physically have to type a new name in the code only when you're doing so at compile time that is you need to give a variable a name if you want to create multiple objects you can just place them in an array a good way would be to use a vector and push into it objects as needed my goal is that i want to create a new object at runtime so whatever the name i give to the machine at runtime it will use that name to create a new object not possible it's the wrong idea anyway the names are there only so you while typing code can refer to various objects and variables when converted to an executable these names and symbols in general will get stripped out the computer doesn't deal in names Uniform Resource Locator HyperText Transfer Protocol Search engine optimization World Wide Web Website SAML Wget Google search HTTP cookie Web server Spamdexing Meta tag Squid cache PageRank Web traffic Jabber Uniform Resource Identifier Mozilla Firefox Delta encoding Web browser Domain Name System Common Unix Printing System Domain name Virtual hosting Ajax (programming) Mydoom Phishing Session Initiation Protocol Typosquatting Google Web Accelerator Internet Proxy server Gmail MSN Messenger Search engine WebDAV Nigritude ultramarine Web analytics BitTorrent Principia Discordia CPAN Google JavaServer Pages Apache HTTP Server Router Denial-of-service attack Opera house Extraterrestrial hypothesis Port numbers Cloaking Bbc.co.uk Slashdot trolling phenomena Link spam Liberal leadership conventions Dacia Wireless Application Protocol World Trade Organization Gopher protocol Wikisource XMLHTTP Lehigh University Unix Mod python Digest access authentication Unicode and HTML Subversion (software) Web design Web crawler Multimedia Messaging System Piedmont Park White House Scalable Vector Graphics Ecclesiastical Latin Character encodings in HTML Slash (punctuation) Cross site scripting Irish language Web cache MOS Technology 6502 Ice core Mozilla Application Suite 400 (number) Warez Network Time Protocol Whois Who is a Jew?
