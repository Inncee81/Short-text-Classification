why can't i call console based exe files from within batch files on win apache i've installed apache and i've got a script that is called whenever a certain file extension is encountered for example scriptalias script c foo addtype application x httpd foo foo action application x httpd foo foo run bat now this works fine if run bat just 'echo's something sensible echo off echo content type text plain echo echo echo this works the problem is that it doesn't work if i call an exe even if it is a console based exe using cmd exe for an example echo off echo content type text plain echo echo cmd c echo this doesn't work instead what happens is you see the cmd exe console briefly flicker on the screen when the page is accessed it seems to me the problem is that it is somehow creating a new child console window so that stdin stdout is being lost even though the script will wait for the child process to be terminated so i guess my question is how do i create a child process that shares i o i've got it working perfectly under apache unix but i want to be able to support both platforms jaxbot i really appreciate your suggestion but i can't seem to get it to work if i use cmd exe foo run bat then apache appears to launch cmd exe but it launches in interactive mode and therefore hangs the request i need to go into task manager and kill it if i use cmd exe c foo run bat or cmd exe c c foo run bat or cmd exe c c foo run bat then apache just responds with bad requests and the error logs say invalid uri in request get i've tried a few other variants and am still not having any luck thats because of the way the batch file works try having apache run cmd exe and have cmd exe launch the file for example scriptalias script c foo addtype application x httpd foo foo action application x httpd foo cmd exe foo run bat hope this helps Macromedia Flash Windows Media Video GIF PlayStation Portable QuickTime ITunes Streaming media PNG ASCII art Portable Document Format Video codec Mod (computer gaming) Podcasting Commodore 64 Warez Windows Mobile Trusted computing IPod AVI Common Unix Printing System MSN Messenger Web page Apple II family StarOffice Kazaa Ebook Unicode Filename extension Microsoft Open-source software ITunes Music Store JPEG Opera (web browser) America Online Online music store Mac OS X File format Digital photography Bulletin board system Spyware Apple Computer Mach kernel Karaoke Free software Paint Shop Pro Software engineering RealNetworks MPlayer Copyright infringement of software Mac OS X v10.4 TiVo Musical Instrument Digital Interface SonicStage AOL Instant Messenger Atari 8-bit family Source code Internet Google Stardock Comparison of media players Gmail ImageMagick Theora Open source culture Vorbis Public domain Library (computer science) BitTorrent NTFS Copy protection Mandriva Linux Microsoft Office High-definition television Wallpaper group Mozilla Firefox System 7 (Macintosh) TeX OpenOffice.org Linux AmigaOS Download.com MAME Screenshot File system SAM Coup__ Copyleft Winamp Tagged Image File Format Abandonware DivX WordPerfect ZX Spectrum Digital camera Unix Ogg Xbox 360 Internet pornography MP3 PlayStation 3 Raw image format
