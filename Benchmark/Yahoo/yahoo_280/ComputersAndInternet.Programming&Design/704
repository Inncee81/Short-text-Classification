secure ftp error error ef receiving sftp packet anyone have thots about resolving this error i have an app which uses ws ftp pro sdk for secure ftp i'm getting this error server has disconnected for reason ssh disconnect protocol error data exceeds window size error ef receiving sftp packet googleing produces alot of questions but no answers as well as more detail on the error message which doesn't fit here experts exchange com suposubly has an answer they want me to pay big bugs for any help would be lovely thanks cez yea i see what you mean about trying to find more info on this one thing that happens to encrypted data is that it can get bigger this usually isn't a big deal because disk space is cheap but it matters more when you are transmitting it like with secure ftp my best guess is that the encrypted data is encrypting to a particular block size which is larger than the mtu you might not be able to change the mtu of your network but you could change what the mtu of your computer we used to do this with computers that use vpn kind of like secure ftp we would tell the computer to set mtu to while we knew is what could be transmitted when the computer added the encryption headers on top of the it was still under and the packets transmitted full search for change mtu for your operating system also see if there are some switches to force this program to use smaller packets that might help good luck Inkscape Windows XP PNG Mozilla Firefox EIA-708 Microsoft Paint IPod Macromedia Flash Vitreous enamel Windows 2000 RGB color model GIF Kazaa 2D computer graphics KDE Mouse (computing) Multiple document interface International Phonetic Alphabet Minesweeper (computer game) Palm OS Taskbar Gradient HTTP cookie Screenshot Windows Vista ImageMagick Canal lock Pop-up ad Macromedia Fireworks Image file formats Macintosh Finder Hello world program Object Desktop Conjugate gradient method Adobe Photoshop Mac OS X Blue screen of death Gmail The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) SAS System Optical spectrum Windows Picture and Fax Viewer The Parting of the Ways Mozilla Application Suite Halo: Combat Evolved Stoma E-mail spam Avalanche Colorist DVD GIMP Library DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Transparency (optics) Duct tape Blogger Graphics tablet Photography Sega Saturn S3 Texture Compression Double-click (computing) Watercolor painting Stopping e-mail abuse Window Finale notation program Visual Basic .NET Plan 9 (operating system) Messaging spam Hong Kong Central Library Poker jargon Delphi programming language Apple Macintosh Edge detection Hydraulic head (hydrology) Microsoft .NET Mac OS X v10.4 Gramophone record X Window System Windows Installer Expos__ (Mac OS X) Portable Document Format Steam engine Opera (web browser) DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Tai shogi Halo 2 Street-Legal Spyware Dodge Charger Elevator Adobe Illustrator Leica PC Engine Window Maker Glass Apostrophe (mark) Railway signalling Film
