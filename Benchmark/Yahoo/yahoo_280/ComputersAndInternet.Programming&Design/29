visual basic pls help me im now learning visual basic pls tel d meaning of dim integer string boolen and how n when use of these hey ash the first answerer is correct those are the basic steps to learn in vb more for any program you write in vb you must bear in mind that vb holds data only during runtime so when you close the program all the data are lost a typical example is the calculator program that u find on your computer if u had to solve the ff eqn of x you enter the numbers one after the other but each time you press the sign key the numbers disappear but its stored temporarily somewhere to be used for the next number dim this is how dim variables work in vb variables are used to store values temporarily or throughout the runtime of the program dim myage as integer dim myname as string integer means a whole number value from eg myage string could be letters words or sentence usually enclosed with in most earlier versions of vb eg myname ash barbara boolean means true or false usually used to present the result of a conditional statement most times boolean value are used to represent properties of the vb form eg me enabled true chkbox checked false there are couple of books you could use that explains in the most simple way one of them is vb by mac graw hill or you use the help menu on the vb program with the msdn page more one thing about these variables is u loose them once u close the program take for example u make a program for a storekeeper the strekkeper enters the sold items the costs and enters the amount paid so that your programs calculates the balance and adds the items to a stock list all the items you enter during runtime is lost once you end the application special note u seems to ave a great desire learning vb anyway vb is one of the best programming langs aroung simply because it has a gui where u ca see what u are designing and just put some codes to it but microsoft has since dropped the idea of vb and made new programs such as vb and next visual studio net developed on the net framework these are exciting programs langs that u can learn and its full of new ad latest technologies of todays sotware environment if u're not yet too deep in vb i'll advise u to get up with visual studio net it comes with powerful tools such as classes oop object oriented programming integrable databases and oles to build from simple application to web interfaces and database apis i can help u with some articles and some programs including the msdn network where you can chat and get info from co software developers around you while building your own application my chat is prenticehalls yahoo co uk i can chat u up starting from am Object-oriented programming Visual Basic .NET AppleScript Computer Library (computer science) C Sharp JavaScript Microsoft Datatype Windows 2000 Programming language Lisp programming language Windows API Hello world program Windows Vista Perl Common Lisp Polymorphism (computer science) WebObjects Windows XP Cocoa (API) Thread (computer science) Mac OS X Component Object Model ITunes Database XML Class (computer science) Emacs RISC Variable Expert system CPU design OpenOffice.org Linked list Lotus Notes Abstraction (computer science) PL/SQL HyperCard Windows registry Hash table SAS System Microsoft Jet Database Engine Pointer MUMPS Object-SQL mapping Prolog Computer virus ALGOL 68 Software engineering Tcl G__del's incompleteness theorem Mac OS X v10.4 Boolean datatype Visual C Plus Plus Scheme programming language JADE programming language Digital circuit MySQL Unicode X86 Ajax (programming) CPU cache OpenStep Compiler optimization Game programmer ASP.NET On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition AmigaOS Palm OS Embedded system Geographic information system Database management system Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Smalltalk System 7 (Macintosh) Eiffel programming language DBASE Common Unix Printing System Mach kernel
