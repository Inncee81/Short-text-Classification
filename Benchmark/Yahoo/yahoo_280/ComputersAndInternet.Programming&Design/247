graphics design hows the pay i have interest in working in the field of graphics design i have no clue how to do any of it but will be going to college and learning about it is it worth it to take graphic design as my major does it pay well is it easy to find jobs hey norm my experience has been that you will make a moderate income graphic design is such a varied field and there are so many design programs out there and schools who teach it fast and fairly cheap that the market is full of graphic designers it's like playing in a band there's a few who make the really big bucks and live like rock stars but the huge majority are still making a pittance playing the local bar most graphic designers are making between and depending on what part of the country you live in new york pro'lly pays pretty good but the cost of living is quite high orlando fl w disney pays in the lower ranges because everyone wants to work there so they can have it on a resume i live in that area and make hr no benefits except a flexible work schedule and that's pretty good it took me years to get to hr but i will make more with the company i am with obviously lead designers make better that the grunts i see this field as suitable if your job satisfaction is linked more to what you are doing and how well you do it as opposed to how much you make if money is important graphic design is not a sure fire way to make lots of money but it is a lot of fun good luck c Perl Python programming language PHP String (computer science) C plus plus Forth programming language Regular expression Object-oriented programming Programming language Java programming language World Wide Web Software engineering Hello world program Cascading Style Sheets Garbage collection (computer science) Gmail Scripting language Associative array Comment Linux kernel ALGOL 68 Web crawler Cross site scripting Visual Basic Cocoa (API) Linked list Ajax (programming) Emacs Obfuscated code Hacker BASIC programming language Pointer Game programming Thread (computer science) CPAN Extreme Programming Ebook JavaScript Reflection (computer science) Computer science Lisp programming language Cross-platform Free software Aspect-oriented programming Categorical list of programming languages Wget Computer chess Ocaml Linux CPU cache Game programmer JavaServer Pages Variable Computer virus Uniform Resource Identifier BitTorrent Computer program LaTeX Polymorphism (computer science) Pretty Good Privacy Tcl Class (computer science) Microsoft TeX FAQ Unix Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Numerical analysis Computer Optimization (computer science) Computer programming Uniform Resource Locator Open-source software Compiler Newsgroup Expert system Wiki Website Windows Vista Windows API Artificial neural network Interpreted language GNU General Public License CORBA OpenBSD XML Microsoft .NET Conway's Game of Life Fortran Internet Design pattern (computer science) The Art of Computer Programming Richard Stallman
