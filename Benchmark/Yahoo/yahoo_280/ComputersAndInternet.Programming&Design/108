sum average in crystal report in crystal report i group the records using the refno and i find the average charge also in final report i need a sum average charge when enter like this means it showing error the summary running total field could not be created eg ref no charge group by ref no avg avg avg total sum avg in final report i need sum avg how to solve this hi thahir the best way to create properly weighted averages in crystal is via formulas create a separate average charge formula for each group level and one for the footer for your specific example i recommend using formula names such as avg charge refno and avg charge total here's what your formula code might look like avg charge refno sum table charge table refno count table charge table refno avg charge total sum table charge count table charge enjoy jeff update thahir i see you extended the deadline by days did you try my solution i use this technique all the time and it works perfectly if you want a weighted average in the total perhaps you don't want a weighted average and simply want to sum all of the individual group averages here's what you need to do if you truly want a sum of the group averages create formulas named initialize totaverages avg charge refno and totaverages initialize totaverages whileprintingrecords global numbervar totaverages avg charge refno whileprintingrecords global numbervar totaverages numbervar grpaverage sum table charge table refno count table charge table refno totaverages totaverages grpaverage grpaverage totaverages whileprintingrecords global numbervar totaverages totaverages add the initialize totaverages formula to the report header section of your report you may want to suppress this formula so that it doesn't print add the avg charge refno formula to the group footer or group header of your reference number group add the totaverages formula to the report footer the totaverages formula will display the sum of all of the group averages PHP JavaScript Cross site scripting Hello world program DOM Events JSON Ajax (programming) HTML scripting Perl Object-oriented programming Unicode Bookmarklet Client-side scripting Scripting language HTML element SHA hash functions Associative array Aspect-oriented programming Exponentiation by squaring Calculator Captcha Web application Python programming language COMMAND.COM Macromedia Flash Web design Gmail JScript .NET Macro Web page String literal Datatype AmigaOS Computer keyboard HTML XMLHTTP Blowfish (cipher) HTML editor Dynamic HTML Regular expression Common Gateway Interface Server-side scripting Comment Wiki C plus plus Reflection (computer science) Fire alarm control panel Closure (computer science) Sherlock (software) MySQL Short message service AppleScript CPAN Dialog box Computer virus Programming language Obfuscated code Class (computer science) NPAPI XForms Optimization (computer science) Dynamic programming language MD5 HyperTalk Application programming interface Scalable Vector Graphics Website Opera (web browser) Analog-to-digital converter XML Control flow Java programming language AWK programming language Greasemonkey BASIC programming language ActionScript Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Perl 6 Scheme programming language Software documentation AutoComplete TikiWiki JADE programming language SAML Game programmer Quicksort Lisp programming language Prolog Chinese input methods for computers Function (mathematics) HTTP cookie NaturallySpeaking Compiler Common Alerting Protocol Prototype-based programming Forth programming language
