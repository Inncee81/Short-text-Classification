how can i stop images from being resized after i upload images to my server i type in an image's address in my browser and it shows a smaller version of the image i have to zoom in to see the images clearly i want the image to be displayed in its actual size do you know how to do this is there any html code that might help if you're just viewing the image and not an image thats placed inside of a web page then there is no html code to help because there is no html page to edit or place the code into this is most likely the default action of your browser in order to stop it you would have to change the setting in your browser options Chat room AOL Instant Messenger Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Everything2 Internet Relay Chat MMORPG Spam (electronic) Computer game bot Chat IRC bot World of Warcraft MapleStory Neopets E-mail spam Leet Website Web crawler Link spam Internet phenomenon Internet forum Internet fraud Turing test America Online Social software Ragnarok Online Chatterbot GunBound MSN Messenger Xiaolin Showdown Instant messaging Battle.net Gmail Internet bot Quake III Arena Modem Pure Pwnage Jabberwacky Newbie Serdar Argic Warcraft III Mystery Science Theater 3000 Stopping e-mail abuse Cybersex RuneScape cheats Game programmer Internet troll Homestar Runner Computer and video game genres Short message service Newgrounds Blog Captcha ICQ System/34 MPAA film rating system Bulletin board system BZFlag Gay Nigger Association of America Machinima Defense of the Ancients Goatse.cx SubSpace (computer game) GameFAQs message boards Miranda IM Doom (film) Opera (web browser) Alternate reality game Social network Yahoo!
