how to insert one layer into another file using actions in photoshop hi i am trying to apply a watermark to some images that will go up on my site i have quite a few so rather than do each one seperately i want to create an action that will make the watermark move it and lower opacity i'll then use photoshop's batch feature to do all the images at once however i've hit a snag i've used actions before but never have i had to import an image from a different file my watermark is in a file of its own and i'm having troubles getting it into the file with my image although cutting and pasting does work for one image the other images return errors when the action hits the copy layer step i would like to know if there's a simple way of somehow importing my watermark and as i said before if i copy and paste or just drag the layer from one file to another it only works once thx did you know in photoshop if you have two images open you can drag one onto the other automatically creating another layer hope this helps stuart http www layeroneuk com manufacturers aspx Computer wallpaper DeviantART PlayStation Portable Website Goatse.cx Legal research Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act America Online ROM image The Best Page in the Universe Autostereogram ITunes A Course In Miracles Windows Vista Potassium nitrate Webster's Dictionary Virgin Mobile Windows XP Tux Paint PNG Star Trek, other storylines E-mail Dictionary CPU cache Xbox Live Quebec Resident Evil Digital Millennium Copyright Act A Tale of a Tub Wallpaper group Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media NOFX Internet Mnemonic Facebook (website) Social bookmarking Yellow Pages Jigsaw puzzle The Onion Encyclopedia Yearbook Hey Jude Homestar Runner Myst franchise BMW Oscar Wilde BBC News Online Traditional animation Password Sony The Sydney Morning Herald Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Point groups in three dimensions Manga Active Desktop DC Comics Symmetry H2G2 Egyptian language Time Inc.
