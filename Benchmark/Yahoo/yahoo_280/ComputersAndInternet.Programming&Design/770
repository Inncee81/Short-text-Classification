please help hate java need to do class public static void bubblesort int a boolean asc with this alg algorithm for i until a length for j i until a length if a j a i make a i a j and make a j a i j j end for j i i end for i that algorithm appears to ignore asc try this public static void bubblesort int a boolean asc for int i i a length i for int j i j a length j if a j a i asc int t a i a i a j a j t notes i use the exclusive or operation with 'asc' and a reversed compare with a i and a j when asc is true this inverts the result of the compare ascending and when false it leaves the result of the compare alone descending note that i don't use the multiple additions to swap while it may look cool to not use an additional variable i believe it is stylistically not a good idea a it's less efficient additions and assignments and array dereferences in the swap by add versus just assignments and array dereferences and no additions in my implementation b it's less apparent what's going on and this makes the code harder to maintain it is a good habit to get in the practice of writing code that a someone other than yourself can review understand and easily work on c adding integers which are very close to the positive or negative limit for integer values can break down in this case i don't think it does but why overflow an int unnecessarily sample main and test public static void main string args int a new int test ascending bubblesort a true for int i i a length i system out print a i system out println asc test descending bubblesort a false for int i i a length i system out print a i system out println desc output asc desc PHP Ajax (programming) Apache HTTP Server CPAN Cross site scripting XMLHTTP Web page BitTorrent Web server World Wide Web Uniform Resource Locator Web design JavaServer Pages Website Slashdot trolling phenomena Gmail PHP-Nuke Scripting language HTML Captcha Web hosting Common Unix Printing System Streaming media HTTP cookie Domain name MySQL XML XSL Transformations Domain Name System LAMP (software bundle) Perl Proxy server Phishing Regular expression Common Gateway Interface Web crawler Managed learning environment TikiWiki Transport Layer Security Internet Mozilla Firefox Object-SQL mapping X Window System WebDAV Blog Mac OS X Server Free software Representational State Transfer Categorical list of programming languages Web traffic JSON Jabber Python programming language Internet censorship in mainland China Stopping e-mail abuse WebSphere Web browser ICalendar HTML element XHTML Wget SHA hash functions Search engine optimization Macromedia Flash Mod python Internet Relay Chat Web analytics Social bookmarking Squid cache Arianne PNG Object-oriented programming YaBB Client-side scripting Linux on zSeries Open Database Connectivity Hello world program Novell NetWare HyperCard Spyware Mozilla Application Suite Wiki User agent Associative array Windows XP Search engine Web service Internet forum Uniform Resource Identifier VBulletin FAQ Spamdexing Password TOC protocol WAMP Game Maker
