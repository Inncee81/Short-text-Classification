microsoft access filtering tables im not very familar using microsoft access and i was wondering if someone could give me the steps on how to do filtering for example i have a table with a range of postcodes and i need to know how many post codes come before any ideas or how many locations have a postcode between and not sure what henry is talking about whether you want to simply view filtered records or create a filtered set of records for a form you should create a query create a new query in the show table dialog box select each the table in question click add and then click close next from the table now shown in the query design drag down any fields you want to the grid the columns at the bottom including postcode if you want to sort on any field make the appropriate selection in the sort drop down in the criteria row under the postocde field you can type without the quotes or and or any other criteria you like this will limit the query results to those records that meet the criteria you specify one more thing if you just want a count of those records with a postcode that is less than create a new query and show the table click the summation button the greek sigma on the toolbar now the query grid includes a total row you can choose count group by min max where and other summary fields drag down any field that is unique to each record like the id field and select count in the total row drag down down postcode select where in the total row add the criteria to the postcode column and uncheck the checkbox in the postcode column which means don't show the postcode in the results you'll get a single row returned with just one column the data will be be the number of records with a postocde less than play around with this stuff you'll learn a lot in no time at all Electronic commerce PayPal Internet fraud HyperText Transfer Protocol Pretty Good Privacy E-mail spam Cross site scripting Apache HTTP Server Opera (web browser) Mozilla Firefox World Wide Web BitTorrent Something Awful Forums Ajax (programming) Something Awful Emacs Spyware HTML PHP CPAN Gmail Secure Shell Kazaa Domain Name System Neopets Python programming language Whois Transport Layer Security Bond OpenBSD Uniform Resource Locator Computer virus Common Unix Printing System Mozilla Application Suite Lotus Notes Wget WebSphere Visual Basic Denial-of-service attack Spam (electronic) MapleStory Linux kernel Webcomic Sales promotion Squid cache RuneScape cheats Price discrimination HTTP cookie BlackBerry Domain name 4chan Proxy server Web hosting System/36 Skype IPod AmigaOS Facebook (website) E-mail GameFAQs Stopping e-mail abuse Public key infrastructure Session Initiation Protocol Retailer Linspire Netscape Navigator Web browser Second Life Oil-for-Food Programme Netscape Communications Corporation Federal Standard 1037C Hotmail Software testing Unix Jabber Linux SCO-Linux controversies Files-11 Web crawler Commodore 64 Shopping cart Search engine optimization Charles Ponzi Windows 2000 Punycode Customer relationship management ICalendar Cheating in Counter-Strike Sender Policy Framework Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Miranda IM Website Internet forum Forum moderator Windows XP WebObjects Electronic money Advance fee fraud Wireless Application Protocol
