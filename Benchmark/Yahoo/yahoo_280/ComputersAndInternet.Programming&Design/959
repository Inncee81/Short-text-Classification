which one is better sql or oracle can somebody please answer me which is better between sql and oracle databases and let me know the reason your question is confusing sql is a data manipulation and structure definition language used in many if not all relational database management systems oracle is a rdbms that uses the sql language it also incorporates an programming extension called pl sql i don't know if they changed the name of that oracle is widely acknowledged as the premier database in the world it is used in just about every fortune business at one time they did sell a pc based version which was full featured but that has long since been discontinued the oracle database has been the leader in developing performance enhancements such as record level locking which allows other users to access records within the same block it also is a true database manager in the sense that each data structure table is maintained with the files of the rdbms and not an individual file such as file management database use there are many technical reasons as well as performance reasons not enough room here to list them all if you are asking about small databases or those which can be run on a pc or very small computer then access or sql server are probably the better choices mysql is one of which i heard recently i think you can download it for free i do have to admit i'm a little biased toward oracle see the source HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Common Unix Printing System Web server Flowchart World Wide Web Website Wget HTML Domain Name System Ajax (programming) Web page Microsoft Office Cross site scripting JavaServer Pages Uniform Resource Identifier Apache HTTP Server Finance Unicode and HTML Mozilla Firefox Representational State Transfer HTML element Filename extension Mydoom Southeastern Anatolia Project Macromedia Flash Virtual hosting SAML Spyware Electronic commerce Web browser Portable Document Format Client-server Process XHTML Transmission Control Protocol Lotus Notes Linked list Graphics Phishing Web crawler Enterprise content management Internet Ice core Thin client Cross-platform OpenOffice.org Multimedia Messaging System Slash (punctuation) SAS System Gmail History of the Internet Karytaina Markup language Squid cache Unified Modeling Language Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Inspiration (computer program) Domain name Character encodings in HTML World Wide Web Consortium Hello world program Scalable Vector Graphics Data flow diagram JADE programming language BitTorrent Web analytics Astrology Free software Workflow Macromedia Internet censorship in mainland China Digest access authentication File Transfer Protocol International Phonetic Alphabet Virtuoso Universal Server Digital art Ranger program Java Servlet HyperCard Web portal CPAN Cascading Style Sheets Software agent Application service provider Extreme Programming Jabber Mozilla Application Suite Wireless Application Protocol Unix Fire Online shop ASCII art AmigaOS Web cache Web service Requirements analysis
