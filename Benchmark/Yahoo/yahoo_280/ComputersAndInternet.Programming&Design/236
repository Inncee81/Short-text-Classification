how does variables and c programs are managed in memory i was recently asked this question on school im referring probably to ram since my programs do not store anything yet any help will be apreciated thanks memory is managed by the heap and on the stack local variables are always on the stack allocating from the stack is done automatically it's fast but stack size is limited allocated memory with malloc or new are on the heap allocation is not as fast as on the stack but you have more memory also you have to free the memory with delete or you get leaks Hyperlink Web page HTML element HTML World Wide Web Macromedia Flash Cascading Style Sheets Spamdexing Online advertising Wiki HTML editor Web design Yu-Gi-Oh!
