how do you save a photoshop project into png or jpg with a transparent background i have photoshop and i have been trying to save what ive been working on into a png or jpg with a transparent background ive searched online and all the sites say to do file save for web i dont have the option 'save for web' under file is there another way to save an image with a transparent background not white i thought that by saving it as a png that it would keep the tranperancy but when i upload it to photobucket it has a white background does photobucket not support transparent backgrounds none of this is working lol its saving with a white background instead of being transparent in the back before i save it it shows it with a transparent background but when i open the saved file it has a white background this is driving me crazy older versions of ie do not support transparency in png files ie finally does jpg files do not support transparency at all your best bet is to save the file as a gif if you want all browsers to handle the transparency photoshop tip if you want transparency start with a true transparent background relying on the save for web feature and picking a transparent color is not very reliable in my experience however if your canvas' background is truly transparent i e the little grey and white boxes you should be fine Flickr HyperText Transfer Protocol HTML element London Goatse.cx Remora Google Maps HTML CPAN 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Bridge Saturniidae Web server Uniform Resource Identifier Photography Web page Photo sharing ImageMagick Rafflesia Sutro Tower Milan Uniform Resource Locator Warez World Wide Web JPEG Phishing Apache HTTP Server Hampi Ajax (programming) Multimedia Messaging System 4chan Nikko, Tochigi PNG De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter Representational State Transfer Beijing Gmail HTTP cookie Jacques-Louis David Something Awful Forums Slash (punctuation) Digital photography Wikimedia Commons Prank flash Google German federal election, 2005 PHP UFO conspiracy theory The Bund Slashdot trolling phenomena The Best Page in the Universe YTMND Tariq Ali Photoshopping International Marxist Group BitTorrent XMLHTTP XRI Squid cache Instant camera Leica Ivy Photographic lens Graphics B3ta SAML Differentiated services Domain Name System Internet phenomenon Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten PlayStation Portable MSN Messenger E.
