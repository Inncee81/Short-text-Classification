is streaming really good for acne ok so i've been having some acne lately due to puberty i heard that streaming can really help is it true can some explain me how it's done and after the streaming should i wash my face with soap dove the moisturizing one or should i use some acne products instead and r you supposed to put a towel or somethin on your head if yes then in which was should you put it yeah my bad i meant steaming do you mean steaming i guess yeah since it should release alot of oil and other impurities from your pores however make sure you wash your face properly when done becasue not washing it will just leave the oil on top of your pores leading to more acne steps put in about hand fulls of salt in the bowl boil some tap water while the water is boiling wash your face with cold water iuno why dont as me it just happens that its cold water if your a girl get the headband and get all your hair outa your face if your a boy and long hair that will get in your face do that as well the water would probably be done boiling by now pour the water in the bowl half ways enough so that the salt will dissolve when the salt dissolved get ready to have the steam of your life face your face down so that it is only inches higher than the water itself when you feel the steam coming up put the towel over your head so that no steam can escape steam for mins dont open the towel untill you reach at least mins what to do after steaming wipe all your sweat out make sure you wash your face after this is the best time to wash your face all your pores have opened up to be killed you can continue to steam for another mins if you feel comfortable and the water was still as hot a great product to use on your face after steaming is biore pore minimizing face wash to close up your pores then follow up with a light weight moisturizer like kiehl's yerba mate tea lotion to soothe your skin taken from website listed below Acne Menstrual cup Tofu Soap Manicure Thermal power station Puberty Sento Sauna Sulfuric acid Leather Hard water Yerba mate Textile manufacturing The Amber Spyglass Water (molecule) Psoriasis Japanese tea ceremony Hand washing Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fossil fuel power plant Brewery Towel Sugar beet Dialysis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hyperthermia Diving suit Aloe Bread Desert Fujian tea ceremony Shaving Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Common cold 613 mitzvot Instant coffee Boom Town (Doctor Who) Cleanser Wudu Massage Heinkel He 100 Water purification Rice Wood Dishwasher Wok Hair Professional wrestling throws Yarrow Upholstery Sugar Baptism Porosity Japanese toilet The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cliff Richard Weathering Cantonese cuisine Agar plate Cuisine of the Philippines Degree Fahrenheit Town gas Shampoo Teen Girl Squad Leaf Wound Deluge (mythology) Mattress Beer Hydrochloric acid Customs and etiquette of Japan Car washing techniques The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy The Parting of the Ways Swingout Soap bubble Cookware and bakeware Comanche Solvent Nuclear power Salah Professional wrestling holds Peanut Renewable energy
