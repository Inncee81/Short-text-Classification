a cry help wat should i do i've got a very dry skin with sensitivity wat cream should i use any idea i hate it like that that make's me look ugly the prob is that it's just my face i have been there done that it can be very embarassing but it can be helped first of all you'll want to use a moisturizer that is hypo allergenic fragrance free and non comedogenic these three terms mean that most of the things that irritate sensitive skin are not in the ingredients of the product i have tried different products including cetaphil and eucerin my current course of action is to put eucerin cream on my face and then pat it dry after it sits for a few minutes the cream doesn't absorb very well then i use a baby lotion i found at a drugstore to lock in the moisture you could also try other brands such as oil of olay or neutrogena just check the ingredients make sure to apply the lotion or cream right after you get out of the shower to lock in as much moisture as possible also try a cooler shower hot water dries skin out to summarize the best thing you can do is look for non irritating moisturizers and test them out and see what is best for you my skin was at one point almost scaly and it was embarassing after some trial and error work i've finally found the right combination for me i would avoid vaseline at first because it is very greasy and could cause breakouts use this as a very last resort i can't promise you that your skin will improve overnight but in a week or two you will hopefully see noticeable improvement good luck Eczema Psoriasis Shaving Shampoo Urticaria Urinary incontinence Ice cream Explosive material Acne Scabies Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Glycerin Manicure Aloe Massage Dandruff Sunscreen Stomach cancer Cosmetics Tattoo Animal testing Perfume Essential oil Coffee Diaper Ammonia Pubic hair Baldness treatments Instant coffee Hyperthermia Cleanser Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Otitis externa Hemp Crohn's disease Shoe polish Sulfuric acid Pasta Plastic Grape seed oil Breastfeeding Dietary fiber Tocopherol Leather Diving suit Depilation Houseplant Hamster Air conditioning Sento Allergy Cleveland Browns Dairy Dialysis EastEnders Weather lore Upholstery Medical analysis of circumcision Teen Girl Squad Hay fever Veganism Idli Ultraviolet Dairy product Menstrual cup STS-59 Dick and Dom in da Bungalow Motor oil Comet Skin Asthma Wood Zinc Friends Hydrogen peroxide Food Hypoglycemia Curry Onion Radiation therapy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Knife Cruising (maritime) Butter Diode Capsaicin Sorghum Herpes simplex virus Soft drink Poker jargon Bacon Multiple chemical sensitivity Baking Homeopathy
