sunburn severe help me pls im just wondering i had the most perfect tan ever but then it started peeling im afraid i will never get that golden skin anymore when i tan next time will i look like that again i agree with kippy most guys don't think they need to moisturize because they think only girls do that also get one of those loofah sponges or the puffy thing because it takes off the dead skin cells when you lather up in the shower also as far as the tanning goes i have a golden tan all year without hurting my skin too much this is what i do you only lay in the sun no more than an hour a week or tops so that you don't burn put an spf of at least or so that you won't burn and get skin cancer then for a couple days after apply the aloe because your skin soaks it in the rest of the week you use the sublime by loreal sunless tanning lotion no way to get skin cancer with tanning cream so you have a real tan but this stuff really extends it and makes your skin look awesome plus it doesn't look yellowish or orange it blends well with your natural skin color Sunscreen Psoriasis Sunlight Malignant melanoma Aloe Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Manicure Sun tanning Tanning Skin Skin cancer Leather Wound healing phases Jon Secada Phoebe Buffay's songs Tofu Rich Mullins Shaving Tattoo Massage Pubic hair Treehouse of Horror XV Avril Lavigne Essential oil Neighbours Tocopherol Vegeta Upholstery Jennifer Lopez Leopard The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Zinc Actinic keratosis Hyperthermia Social rule Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Color theory Melanin Giraffe TLC Scabies Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Sin City Time Out of Mind Tallulah Bankhead Wang Chongyang Empire Burlesque Jute Full House Bleeding The Amber Spyglass Trigonometric function Taxi Driver End of Han Dynasty Wart Cosmetics Pok__mon Live!
