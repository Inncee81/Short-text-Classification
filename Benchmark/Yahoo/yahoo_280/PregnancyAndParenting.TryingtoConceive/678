bought an ovulation kit and my lh surge is up had intercourse last night and did another strip and it's still up so me and fiancee are going to have relations again nite the thing is knowing this when can i test and what's the difference between ovulating and lh surge thanks hi good questions it took me a few months of playing around with the tests to get it down the lh surge occurs right before you ovulate you can test any time of day as long as you haven't peed for at least hours before sometimes i take one in the am and it is almost positive and then take another one in the afternoon and it will be very positive for example here is what i got this cycle friday darker test line but ot as dark as the control sat super dark test line sun dark test line mon light test line and according to my temps i ovulated monday so my lh surge occur days before remember that an lh surge only tells you are about to ovulate not that you did temping will confirm that so once that test is positive bd for the next couple of days good luck Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Ovulation Day Emergency contraception Conifer cones Hebrew calendar Estrus cycle Temperature Puberty Polycystic ovary syndrome Sydney Riot of 1879 Hurricane Rita Pregnancy National Football League Pregnancy test Monday Night Football Niddah Solar eclipse Birth control Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Ron and Fez Tide Oral contraceptive Hurricane Wilma Friday the 13th 2003 North America blackout Daylight saving time Good Friday Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Hipparchus (astronomer) STS-59 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina In vitro fertilisation Fasting Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Black Tropical cyclone Test cricket Nintendo Ovarian cyst Neopets Infertility 7 July 2005 London bombings General relativity Dominical letter Holy Week Christmas 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Joy Division (band) Experiment Phoenix, Arizona Second Battle of El Alamein Toonami American and British English differences International Date Line Gregorian calendar 21 July 2005 London bombings Time Out of Mind Operation Market Garden Soap opera The Chemical Brothers Climate of the United Kingdom Time Full moon cycle Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Astronomy on Mars Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Akuma (Street Fighter) STS-61 Ben Johnson (athlete) EastEnders Norwegian Campaign Transit of Venus Gonadotropin-releasing hormone James Hanratty Game show Planet Waves Rugby union Nuclear fallout Extreme Programming Ovarian cancer Emergency preparedness Maya calendar HIV test Drug test Weather lore Season Philosophical skepticism Sunday The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll American comic book Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Mars Samus Aran Storm surge Big Brother UK series 6 Tests of general relativity
