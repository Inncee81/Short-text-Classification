warning tmi but need assistance hi all well yesterday i asked a series of questions concerning ovulation and so forth so i had ordered a package of ovulation and pregnancy strips last week fortunately they were in the mail when i got home so i took two ovulation tests at two separate times between pm and pm both came out positive like really dark and positive not only that but i had the egg white cervical mucous we always look for so of course we ''baby danced'' but today i had bleeding when i went potty like a huge glob of blood and still some egg white cervical mucous it's like a period but way lighter than my normal periods and besides that why would i get a positive ovulation test positives when my period was just around the corner literally what's up is this normal after having sex when ovulating or what i'm so confused all over again thanks in advance ya'll it could be implantation bleeding or you released two eggs this month not uncommon causes fraternal twins or women to get pregnant while on period or it could be just bleeding from sex or i hope not it could be hormones gone haywire i'm sorry you are having problems hope all goes well for you but try to relax at this point and let it have a little more time i have never been where you are at but i do know that is alot easier said than done good luck Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Infertility Ovulation Miscarriage In vitro fertilisation Childbirth Progesterone Obstetrics Polycystic ovary syndrome Twin Ovarian cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pregnancy test Gonorrhoea Emergency contraception Endometriosis Abortion Ectopic pregnancy Cervical cancer Multiple birth Endometrial cancer Urinary incontinence Puberty Ovary Estrus cycle Cancer Gynecologic hemorrhage Breastfeeding Gynaecology Ovarian cyst Prenatal diagnosis Estradiol Sexual reproduction Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Prostate cancer Human chorionic gonadotropin Stroke Abortion debate Coeliac disease Human cloning Vaginal bleeding Cephalic disorder Diabetic retinopathy Turner syndrome Cervix Anal sex Endometrium Medical analysis of circumcision Niddah Social rule Androgen insensitivity syndrome Premature birth Placenta praevia Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Prolactinoma Transsexuality Anemia Breech birth Autonomic nervous system Oral sex Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Multiple sclerosis HIV test Drug test Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Depo Provera Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bleed Like Me Flowering plant Sex and the City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Insulin AIDS Infantilism Pelvic inflammatory disease Stomach cancer Vertebral column Wheel of Fortune Sleep apnea Genital wart Sexual dysfunction Abduction Phenomenon Homosexuality and transgender Katelyn Faber Gregory Goodwin Pincus Acne Ovum Orgasm Hyperprolactinaemia Sexual intercourse Female reproductive system (human) Pornographic movie Lung cancer Human papillomavirus
