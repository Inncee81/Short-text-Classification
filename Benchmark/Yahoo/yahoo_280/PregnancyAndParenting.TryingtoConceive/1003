am i overreacting i'm really afraid i'm never going to be able to get pregnant i don't know why i'm just scared i guess my periods have always been regular i started when i was years old and i haven't missed one in the past years they are quite heavy at times though for a while before i got on the pill i was using a super plus tampon every two hours or so i do have a bleeding disorder von villebrand's disease so i'm not sure if that has anything to do with it since going off the pill my period returned exactly on schedule and it's a little bit lighter than it usually was i've been to the gynecologist and have had pap smears and everything came back normal i thought i had endometriosis because of heavy periods but my dr said everything was just fine i don't know why i'm so scared i'm just afraid something's wrong any advice i'm afraid i'm not ovulating that's mainly my concern lisa i'm my husband is yes you're overreacting there are a small percentage of women with fertility problems there are growing numbers of women however that wait too long for children thus making it more difficult the younger you are when you have children ie in your 's the easier it will be to conceive and the less likely your children will have birth defects Menstrual cycle Endometriosis Fertility awareness Gynaecology Pregnancy Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Polycystic ovary syndrome Menstrual cup Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Infertility Tampon Urinary incontinence Folic acid Ectopic pregnancy Miscarriage Breastfeeding Tocopherol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fertilisation Endometrial cancer Cancer Childbirth Crohn's disease Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gynecologic hemorrhage Pelvic inflammatory disease Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sanitary towel Puberty Psoriasis Ovarian cancer Human cloning Abortion debate EastEnders Cervical cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dysmenorrhea Von Willebrand disease Apollo 8 Vampire Tobacco smoking Coffee Hearing impairment Pedophilia Eugenics Tag Time Out of Mind Religion and abortion Genetic disorder Prenatal diagnosis Phoebe Halliwell Caffeine Congenital disorder The Inside Malaria Coeliac disease Dioxin Premature birth Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cartman Joins NAMBLA The Time Machine Margaret Sanger Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Ovarian cyst Multiple birth Medicine Teenage pregnancy Stuttering Piccolo Junior Saga Malcolm in the Middle Zhao Yun American Dad!
