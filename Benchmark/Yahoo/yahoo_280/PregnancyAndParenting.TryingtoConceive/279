i am so confused and frustrated my husband and i are trying to conieve i am and have a daughter of and trying for i have been off of bcp since may this month we made love every second day unprotected i am due for my period tomorrow yesterday i was feeling pressure in my lower abdomen so i took a pregnancy test and then at work when i went to pee sorry if to much info it felt like my bladder was pulling so i go to the doctor and i have a bladder infection i figure ok we will need to try another month but i have been having confusing cm for the past few days i have been having again sory if too much info white creamy cm on my underwear and today when i went to the bathroom i had clear watery stretchy mucus does anyone have an explanation for me my breat have been itchy for a little while and feel a little nauseated from time to time but i thought it was the pills that the dr gave me for the infection he knows we are trying to concieve so he gave me stuff that is safe incase i was pregnant help may wasn't that long ago it sounds like your body is still adjusting to being off bc pills some women need months to get back to normal even though your period is due tomorrow it could be that you are ovulating today which would then mean that your period is due in two weeks from now if it were me i would run out and get an ovulation predictor kit and see if it's positive if you don't have the time energy or money to do that you could just wait it out and see what happens some women do get stretchy cm right before their period starts too so really anything is possible here the bottom line is your symptoms could be pregnancy pms or your body still adjusting to being off bc pills you could also be ovulating late since you are recently off the pills and possibly not yet regular i would have sex today and tomorrow just in case the ovulation theory is correct if your period doesn't come as expected tomorrow you could test again or wait it out a little longer good luck Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Endometriosis Psoriasis Multiple sclerosis Neighbours Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Birth control Breastfeeding Guinea pig Ovarian cancer Ovulation Fecal incontinence EastEnders Coeliac disease Polycystic ovary syndrome Stomach cancer Ovarian cyst Breech birth Abortion Spina bifida Sexual abstinence Social rule Childbirth AIDS Turner syndrome Hypertension HIV test Premature birth Pregnancy test Folic acid Miscarriage Days of our Lives Obstetrics Niddah Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Syringomyelia Urination Abortion debate Coffee Gonorrhoea Rabies Caffeine Time Out of Mind Pelvic inflammatory disease Knots Landing Tocopherol Herpes simplex virus Infertility Cystic fibrosis Sharon Tate The Inside Penis Autism Sexual revolution Gallstone Friends Tobacco smoking Vitamin C Anal sex Search for Tomorrow Prolactinoma Gender-neutral language The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Ectopic pregnancy Malaria Smallpox Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Heartworm Inflation Stuttering Cephalic disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Poker jargon Acne Transsexuality Jean Grey Conjunctivitis Syphilis Sexual intercourse Married... with Children Japanese toilet Dialysis Elephant The Shining (film) Menstrual cup Cytomegalovirus
