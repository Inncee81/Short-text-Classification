what exactly is involved with donating your eggs i am considering donating some of my eggs to a couple desperate for their own baby i have had three children of my own yet i know how distressing it is to have trouble conceiving and carrying a baby to full term i'm just wondering what exactly is involved with donating your eggs how invasive is the procedure how long would you be in hospital etc i would love to help this couple out but don't want to jeopardise my chances of having any more of my own children any genuine answers appreciated to hotcakes i actually want to know what is involved with the procedure i know the eggs are 'removed' but you didn't actually say how that is wonderful of you i have thought the same for some friends of ours and here are some of the things i have found donors must undergo a series of hormonal treatments that routinely lead to a month or more of bloating and discomfort and culminate in the moderately painful suctioning of as many as two dozen eggs from their ovaries via a needle inserted through the vagina oocyte donation is invasive physically demanding and often painful donors are required to receive daily injections of drugs that induce ovarian hyperstimulation the ovaries are caused to produce several eggs at a time for three weeks donors must go to the infertility center every morning so that the physician can monitor egg development and take blood samples to ascertain hormone levels indicating egg growth approximately hours before egg extraction donors receive an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin to trigger ovulation and then they begin to take antibiotics to ward off infection several donor related health risks are associated with egg donations which need to be considered seriously fatality has been reported and approximately of those undergoing the procedure are known to suffer from side effects some of the potential health risks associated with egg donation are mentioned below some of the common side effects of the medications include vaginal dryness hot flashes breast tenderness sleep related problems body aches fatigue headache vision related issues respiratory issues mood swings in extreme cases renal failure ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ohss is another by product of the procedure if it is mild as in most cases it goes away on its own in a few rare cases ohss may be severe and life threatening in some instances all the mature eggs are not retrieved from the donor while in others they may be released early in such cases unprotected intercourse may result in an unwanted pregnancy according to some studies there is an increased risk of ovarian cancer among the donors complications such as infection or bleeding may reduce the chances of pregnancy in the donor in people who suffer from such side effects it is important to understand the factors that promote susceptibility in them these are some of the risks and the site the above answerer gave is also good it can be worth the risk but just be sure it is one you are willing to take good luck in your decision as for us i am and have decided i am going to have one more baby of my own and then do the donation Turner syndrome Growth hormone Stomach cancer Clinical depression Blood transfusion Hepatitis C Fertility awareness Acne Dialysis Ovarian cyst Paracetamol Ovulation Crohn's disease Progesterone HIV test Intersex surgery Colorectal cancer Insulin Growth hormone deficiency Rocky Mountain spotted fever Breast cancer Folic acid Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Abortion debate Endometrial cancer Coeliac disease Pregnancy Cervical cancer Intravenous therapy Haloperidol Rabies Group A streptococcal infection Emergency contraception Epidural Methamphetamine Ectopic pregnancy Human chorionic gonadotropin Prolactinoma Leukemia Chlorpromazine Obesity Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Glycogen storage disease type I Gonorrhoea Twin Blood donation Acupuncture Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Myocardial infarction Intact dilation and extraction Chemotherapy Stem cell Common cold Ovary
