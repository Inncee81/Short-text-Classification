its roughly dpo and preg symptoms have gone i was getting little pains on dpo on the left side of my pelvic area and it also felt a bit achy i also had tingly nipp's now it i have just a lower ache and no sore nipp's is it normal for pregnancy signs to go away the first time that i thought i caught ovulation are starting to slip away yet another month of tea got to work on my points now lol i read that you cut down on the caffeine i'm trying to bit hard when you work in an italian restaurant though i get the odd cramp twinge and thats it really i think that one point i'm going to come on then it goes i have cm was yellowy whitey yesterday sticky not as much as there was the other day but still there just going to try and not think about it and wait until the end of next week to test thats if i don't come on oh and i forgot last time you said you saw a palm reader i saw a medium not long before you and they said that i'll need some medical help to get me pregger's my friend is holding a party when they come to your house and do readings so i said i'll pop along to that too who knows i'll keep you posted xxxxxx hey chloe you keep popping up everywhere bad luck about your points how annoying is that listen pregnancy signs are different for everyone and may come and go what you are feeling are possible implantation signs but even if they've disappeared at least you know now you have ovulated and maybe your body will now sort itself out and you'll get more regular cycles now or get pregnant on the down side sorry not even tea when you're ttc only kiddin but i reduced my intake big time this cycle when i got pregnant what hell we go through hey they do say caffeine does have a bearing on conception rates but tea contains less than coffee you haven't mentioned your cm what is it like mine was noticeably sticky and creamy this cycle and that's common in pregnancy but if you are dry then you are more than likely approaching your period i only got glass in nipples feeling on one night dpo and then it disappeared it was that that made me think hhhmmmm i think i could be pregnant i actually wrote that in my diary so keep focusing on those twinges and let us know in a few days xxxxxxxx Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Fertility awareness Breastfeeding Caffeine Endometriosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Miscarriage Ovulation Fecal incontinence Coffee EastEnders In vitro fertilisation Friends Insomnia Hey Jude Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Prostate cancer Folic acid Ovarian cancer Psoriasis Hypertension Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Ectopic pregnancy Ovarian cyst Guinea pig Abortion debate Anemia Breakfast Emergency contraception Equine conformation Abortion Social rule Human sexual behavior Mattress Stomach cancer Infertility I Want to Hold Your Hand Multiple sclerosis Hearing impairment Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Premenstrual stress syndrome Diabetes mellitus Pregnancy test Gastroesophageal reflux disease Sleep 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sexual abstinence Yerba mate Anxiety Tour de France Tobacco smoking Herpes simplex virus Pelvic inflammatory disease Malaria Childbirth The Adventures of Pete & Pete Knots Landing Extreme Programming The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kurt Cobain Radiation therapy Cephalic disorder Tocopherol Milton H.
