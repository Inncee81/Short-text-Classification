when can i test to see if i'm pregnant my fiance and i both have strong feelings that i am pregnant my period started on the th last month so assuming that it'll fall on the same day this month is it safe to test now i know they have pregnancy test that say find out as soon as days before you're period but i read the side of the box and it says that of women tested positive days before your expected period so to me that's not very accurate and it's not days it's days i'm just soooo anxious to find out and yes we want to be preggers do you think if i am pregnant that it'll show up no matter if i test today or in days thxs in advance you can test now but it is possible to read negative since it is still early you are more likely to have an accurate reading once you miss your period but the home pregnancy tests claim that you can tell up to days before so the only thing you have to lose is the extra cost of a preg test why not if it is positive then you will know if it is negative then wait a few more days and then retest Pregnancy HIV test Pregnancy test Miscarriage Drug test Friends Fertility awareness Coeliac disease Abortion debate Menstrual cycle Prenatal diagnosis Cytomegalovirus Ovarian cancer Abortion Autism GED EastEnders Endometriosis Infertility Breastfeeding Psoriasis Prostate cancer Folic acid Melanie Wilkes History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Gonorrhoea Obstetrics Oscilloscope Ben Johnson (athlete) Turner syndrome Prolactinoma Birth control Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Oral contraceptive Taken Pregnancy fetishism Adoption Spina bifida Niddah Isotretinoin Chemical abortion Experiment One Tree Hill (TV series) Sydney Riot of 1879 2005 English cricket season Breech birth Human sexual behavior Twin Childbirth Sexual abstinence Fantastic Four M16 (rifle) Philosophical skepticism Maya calendar Dispensationalism Thalidomide History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Diabetic retinopathy Jeopardy!
