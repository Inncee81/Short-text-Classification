is there any way to shorten the length of your menstrual cycle i am ttc and stopped birth control pills in january since then my periods have been so infrequent they weren't before i went on the pill i began taking my bbt and know that i am ovulating but on cycle day rather than cycle day as a result i have many fewer chances to get pregnant is this normal this long after stopping the pill is there a way i e diet excercise vitamins etc to speed up ovulation it's been about months since you stopped the pill most people's bodies are usually getting back on track by this point make an appointment with your ob gyn and tell her of your situation and your concerns she'll probably tell you to wait it out for a while but she may consider using some fertility drugs such as clomid that allow you to precisely control your cycle length and ovulation date most likely your ob gyn will suggest you keep trying until january ' if it hasn't happened by then they'll take some action in getting you started Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Ovulation Polycystic ovary syndrome Tocopherol Birth control Puberty Acne Folic acid Endometriosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ovarian cyst Urinary incontinence Psoriasis In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate Vitamin D Niddah Infertility Coeliac disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Twin Progesterone Vitamin C Apollo 8 Guinea pig Migraine Computus Depo Provera Julian day Nutrition Month Year Roman calendar Menstrual cup Heartworm Prostate cancer Antidepressant Fertilisation Anorexia nervosa Antiretroviral drug Breastfeeding Hebrew calendar Isotretinoin Female reproductive system (human) Baldness treatments Chlorpromazine Gregorian calendar Human chorionic gonadotropin Sexual intercourse Ovum Alzheimer's disease Vitamin Ovary CPU design Toronto Transit Commission Timekeeping on Mars Toronto Subway and RT Sexual abstinence Multiple sclerosis Sleep Weight training Common cold Hipparchus (astronomer) Conifer cones Maya calendar Kodocha Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Pregnancy test Premenstrual stress syndrome Cat Friends Stomach cancer Anabolic steroid Ovarian cancer Time Malaria Knots Landing Indianapolis 500 Toronto Streetcar System TGV Veganism Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Paget's disease of bone Clinical depression Cray-1 Vehicular cycling Eclipse cycle Orgasm Obstetrics Tour de France Tropical year Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Meiosis Drug abuse
