strange period then implantation bleed hubby and i ttc for months know it isnt long but is driving me crazy and feel convinced there is a problem anyway last period was dark dark brown in colour couldnt call it s period really got checked out private gyne and said all ok am now weeks from nex period and had very light light brown spotting past two days and some cramps as well as back pain am convinced i am not pg but wonder if any of you have had implantation bleed and or any other symptoms so early on if you are weeks from your next period then you only ovulated a few days ago it would be really early to have an implantation bleed at this time although not impossible but rare i would wait and see if your periods are late and then do a pregnancy test when they are a few days overdue could it not be that you are stressing yourself out so much over why you are not pregnant that the effects are showing on your cycle stress is the worse thing when trying to get pregnant and as you say months is nothing in reality calm down and try and put it out of your mind i know its hard but i think you are making yourself not get pregnant by being so worried about it if possible go on a holiday forget about calendars ovulation and pregnancy and leave it all to nature you only need to start thinking something might be wrong if you are not pregnant within years the less you think about it the more it is likely to happen and yes i know how obsessive it can become i have a lot of xl tshirts in that area Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Endometriosis Miscarriage Childbirth Ectopic pregnancy Obstetrics Stomach cancer Abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pregnancy test Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hebrew calendar Time Out of Mind Ovulation One Life to Live Polycystic ovary syndrome Birth control In vitro fertilisation Diabetic retinopathy Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Year of the Spider Clinical depression Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Anxiety Space opera in Scientology doctrine Infertility Psoriasis Scientology beliefs and practices Daylight saving time Endometrial cancer Emergency contraception Neighbours Kodocha Ovarian cancer Time Milton H.
