trying to conceive but am unsure if i'm ovulating help my husband and i have two girls that were both unplanned it seemed so easy to get pregnant with them we now have decided to have another i've done hrs of research online i realize now how difficult it is my cycles range from to days i remember i used to have stretchy egg white discharge but i haven't seen that in a long time i still have a period every month though does this mean i'm not ovulating start charting on fertilityfriend com you can enter your body temp your mucus readings your results from opk's ovulation tests that is the only way i could really know and in my opinion was the only way i conceived last month after months of ttc take your bbt every morning before you get out of bed at the same time every morning start taking ov tests from days through you can get tests at dollar tree or you can get a day pack at most pharmacies for about don't do ovulation tests using first morning urine wait til later in the morning or in the afternoon just take them at the same time of day every day a test line that is the same or darker color than the control line is a positive anything fainter than this is a negative it detects the lh surge and a positive result means that you should ovulate within hours from taking the tests this is why you really need to take them every day for a while if your cycles are messed up some women get positives but the egg never pops out but they help with fertility awareness the next step is getting your progesterone p tested days after you ovulate blood test talk to your obgyn about this p levels indicate whether an egg actually came out this month because after you ovulate the empty space on the ovary starts to emit progesterone this doesn't happen if the egg never leaves the ovary enter the data on the website it'll generate a nice chart for you and will also tell you when your most fertile time is and also when you most likely ovulated i swear by that site and have only been using it for a few months Fertility awareness Ovulation Oral contraceptive Polycystic ovary syndrome Pregnancy Puberty In vitro fertilisation Progesterone Human chorionic gonadotropin Emergency contraception Pregnancy test Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Flowering plant Infertility Niddah Apollo 8 Obstetrics Birth control Ovarian cyst Endometriosis Urinary incontinence Drug test Stomach cancer Fruit Ovarian cancer Tide Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pelvic inflammatory disease Shaggy dog story Social rule Friends STS-62 Prostate cancer Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Breastfeeding HIV test Breast cancer CPU cache Coeliac disease Ocean's Twelve Ovum Mountain Gorilla Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ben Johnson (athlete) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency The Lovely Bones Swyer syndrome Ectopic pregnancy Compiler optimization Flower God Emperor of Dune CPU design Housebreaking Ginkgo Nuclear fallout Cytomegalovirus Sexual abstinence Conifer cones Theory of conduct Sexual reproduction Blood on the Tracks Kodocha Female reproductive system (human) Time Out of Mind Surveillance Jet engine Expert system Endometrium Menstrual cup Pachypodium baronii Rabbit Debugging Jean Grey Gynaecology Vitamin C Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carbon dioxide RISC Calvin and Hobbes Guinea pig Bipolar disorder Platypus Collision detection Pachypodium brevicaule Technetium STS-59 UK Singles Chart Gonorrhoea Lightning Miss Saigon Egg (biology) Carpel Spacecraft propulsion
