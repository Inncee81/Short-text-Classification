hi can clomid help bring back ovulation after depo injection i came off depo ijection after one shot on the th june and still have not had a period and i want to try for my nd child so just wondered if clomid could help first please remember that the depo shot is very powerful even if you have only one some women take months or years to recover could clomid help you to ovulate yes many women get pregnant with clomid but i would suggest you give it more time then a couple of cycles it is totally normal for your body to need some time after coming off depo your body has gone through enough hormonal changes with the depo shot and now you want to do clomid and by the way you need to have a period before you can take clomid so now you're talking about taking provera first to force a period then clomid to stimulate ovulation all two months after stopping depo provera i would give your body a little more time if your period doesn't come in the next two months then talk to your doctor about your options in them meantime at least you would have had more of a break from synthetic hormones good luck Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Depo Provera In vitro fertilisation Ovulation Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Polycystic ovary syndrome Urinary incontinence Puberty Infertility Oral contraceptive Anabolic steroid Ovarian cyst Estrogen Phoebe Halliwell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Glucocorticoid Growth hormone deficiency Characters of Lost Estrus cycle Growth hormone Pregnancy test Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Emergency contraception Social rule Growth hormone treatment Hypoglycemia Emperor Yuan of Han Jam (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Testosterone Human chorionic gonadotropin Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog Gynaecology The Shining (film) The Ark in Space The Inside Hormone Chu-Han contention Chemotherapy The Death Gate Cycle Stomach cancer Breastfeeding Acne Kodocha Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Folic acid Insulin Thyroid Psoriasis Tocopherol Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Endometriosis Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Curse of Fenric Breast cancer Death Comes to Time Human height Erythropoietin Niddah Volleyball Orgasm Cryptorchidism Baldness treatments Androgen insensitivity syndrome Luteinizing hormone Childbirth Strap-on dildo Angel One (TNG episode) Chronic fatigue syndrome Incarnations of Immortality Rabbit Sydney Bristow Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Invisibles Follicle-stimulating hormone USS Yorktown (CV-10) Bedwetting Miscarriage Acromegaly The Dalek Invasion of Earth Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Homosexuality and transgender Sharon Tate Father's Day (Doctor Who) Haven (TNG episode) Prolactinoma The Amber Spyglass Bob and George Ovarian cancer Auxin Cortisol Kill Bill Futurama (TV series - season 3) Endocrinology
