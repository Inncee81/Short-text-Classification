irregular periods pregnancy i have had irregular periods since i went off the pill in after being on it for over years only ovulating every months until this may and june when i ovulated each month my partner and i have had unprotected sex in hope of falling pregnant but i am concerned about the irregularity of my periods that this may not occur i am currently overweight and i am not sure whether this may be the cause can anyone offer some advice and some information about whether i can fall pregnant or not thank you for your time being overweight is not a concern unless it is a symptom of pcos pcos has many symptoms one of them being overweight and pcos does cause fertility problems however if you don't have pcos you can do internet research on it then your weight is not an issue it looks like being on the pill for so long has caused your cycles to be irregular unless of course you were irregular before you went on the pill in which case you are returning to what's normal for you i think the fact that you ovulated two months in a row is a good sign as long as you're ovulating you have a chance of getting pregnant i would continue to monitor your cycles for a few more and see if you continue to ovulate if may and june prove to be a fluke you may want to go in and talk to your doctor about taking something to stimulate ovulation every month good luck Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Polycystic ovary syndrome Oral contraceptive Pregnancy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception Ovulation In vitro fertilisation Birth control Puberty Infertility Ovarian cyst Psoriasis Breastfeeding Folic acid Malaria Obesity Ovarian cancer Prolactinoma Endometriosis Estrus cycle Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Sleep apnea Progesterone Prostate cancer Abortion debate Miscarriage Guinea pig Nutrition Bipolar disorder Sexual abstinence Stomach cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease Abortion Multiple sclerosis Obstetrics Spina bifida Ectopic pregnancy Clinical depression Turner syndrome Neighbours Tocopherol Twin Fertilisation Apollo 8 Caffeine Endometrial cancer Tobacco smoking Stroke Hypertension Sexual intercourse Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Sex education Conifer cones Knots Landing Sleep Human chorionic gonadotropin Duchenne muscular dystrophy AIDS Medicine Gregory Goodwin Pincus Herpes simplex virus Autism Premature birth Childbirth Cephalic disorder Teenage pregnancy Gonorrhoea Health issues and the effects of cannabis Premenstrual stress syndrome Baldness treatments Myocardial infarction Diabetes mellitus Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Flowering plant Acne Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Alanis Morissette Cytomegalovirus Infantilism Human penis size Huntington's disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Anorexia nervosa Cardiac arrhythmia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Heartworm Paroxetine Amphetamine Hyperprolactinaemia Oral sex Religion and abortion Hypoglycemia Big Brother UK series 6
