monthly cycle ok you might think im being really dumb but im kinda confused me and my hubby are trying to get pregnant and im trying to work out when i will be ovulating im just abit confused about the definition of the cycle is it the time between your periods or is it including your period coz i've been told both i know when the best time to try is i want to now when my cycle starts is it at the beginning of my period or the first day after my period has ended i've been told both first i want to say congratulations on starting a family we just had our first baby a son in march and couldn't be happier remember it's not dumb to ask questions and get answers it's dumb not to especially when it comes to parenthood start taking those prenatal vitamins if you haven't already and you can see your doctor for a pre conception checkup your doctor will provide you with a lot of helpful advice and materials to assist you and answer any questions you may have most women are on a day cycle so that they will ovulate around days from the start of the last period there are online calculators you can use to help you determine the day you'll ovulate do a search on ovulation calculator start keeping list of the dates your period starts so you can find out how long your cycle is once you figure out when you'll be ovulating you can start trying around day or so after your period as the sperm can survive a couple of days and be waiting for the egg to be released we got pregnant during the fourth month of trying beginning on day good luck god bless and have fun trying Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Oral contraceptive Ovulation Niddah Maya calendar Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Roe v.
