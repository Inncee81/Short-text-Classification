could i be pregnant is this scenario plausible i have been having what i call mexican jumping beans with my right ovary twitching i have pcos so i dont get reguular periods and it has been difficult getting pregnant my husband and i had sex at about am right before i peed then after wards for the hell of it i took a pregnancy test peeing again within minutes from the last time the first line was clear the second was there but very light so we went and bought another test once again being impatient as soon as i got home i peed and took the new test within no more then from the last time this time the first line was clear but there was no second line i was thinking the because i had peed so close together after peeing normally all day could the pregnancy hormone be so low in my urine that it was able to register in the nd test please only serious answers i peed right before we had sex i know that i am not pregnant from this time im not stupid we have been trying for years i am asking about the hormone level being to low because i had peed so much in such a short amount of time you can't get pregnant that quickly after sex so if you are pregnant it would be from an earlier time the best way to check would be to book an appointment with your doctor whose tests will be more accurate or some chemists will do a test for you with a sample of your pee edit i didn't call you stupid i answer questions with the details i feel others searching for answers may want to know as well as i said asking a doctor or pharmacist is the best way to get an accurate result there is no need for you to be offensive Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Breastfeeding Pregnancy test Endometriosis Human chorionic gonadotropin Puberty Hypoglycemia Miscarriage Androgen insensitivity syndrome In vitro fertilisation HIV test Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Tour de France Abortion debate Cytomegalovirus Sleep Prenatal diagnosis Marilyn Monroe Chronic fatigue syndrome Biology and sexual orientation Growth hormone treatment Gender identity Turner syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Birth control Penis Lance Armstrong Prolactinoma Coffee Sex assignment Emergency contraception Folic acid Big Brother UK series 6 Caffeine Gamma ray burst Age of the Earth GED Phthalates Sunscreen Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion Teenage pregnancy Rabbit Diabetes mellitus One Tree Hill (TV series) Insulin History of intersex surgery Transsexuality Sexual differentiation Normal distribution Family Feud Sex education Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Diabetes insipidus Science Singlish Urine Sexual orientation Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Vitamin C Soap opera 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Medicine Cancer Ovary Ovarian cancer Methamphetamine Growth hormone deficiency Ben Johnson (athlete) Satanic ritual abuse Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Hyperprolactinaemia Urinalysis Kidney Spina bifida Sonic the Hedgehog Lou Gehrig Endometrial cancer CPU cache Guinea pig El Chavo del Ocho The Catcher in the Rye The nature of God in Western theology Laura Schlessinger Human skin color Homosexuality and transgender Shit Benzene Software testing
