early ovulation my dh and i are ttc for months now my lmp was july just ended day before yesterday yesterday was very light spotting my lmp was very normal i usually have day cycles today i just used an opk and had two lines one a little lighter than the other i also noticed the creamy lotiony cm just a while ago this was the only time i noticed it today and it was only when i wiped i am just wondering could it be that i am ovulating early or it is just left over from my lmp i have also been charting bbt and tuesday and wednesday were today and yesterday was i am just asking opinions as i dont want to miss it this month thanks sounds like you will ovulate in the next days or so you can definitely ovulate early but remember if you don't get pregnant your period will come sooner because your luteal phase is constant never varying by more than a day or so keep taking the opks because you want the lines to be the same color or the test line darker than the control line take one at like pm and another at pm so you don't miss your surge if you can affort to use up that many tests have sex every other day until you get a positive and then do it on the night of the positive opk and then for nights after you can also check around your cervix internally if you want to get a better idea of what your cm is like sounds like a possible ovulation on day or so which isn't too abnormal when is your normal ovulation day keep baby dancing at least every other day until you get that confirmation of ovulation by high temps after a rise and a dry up of cervical fluid good luck Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) In vitro fertilisation Puberty The Beatles discography Cliff Richard Childbirth Oral contraceptive Paul Is Dead Miscarriage Pregnancy test Urinary incontinence Cervical cancer Endometrial cancer Prenatal diagnosis Birth control Social rule Niddah Tide Abortion Emergency contraception STS-62 Donna Summer Sexual reproduction Jon Secada Menstrual cup Jet engine Jennifer Lopez Intact dilation and extraction AFI 100 Years series Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Cervix Ocean's Twelve Human papillomavirus Gonorrhoea Singlish Cancelled Apollo missions Extraterrestrial skies Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Estrus cycle Akuma (Street Fighter) Rod Stewart Transformer Endometriosis Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Beatmania IIDX Liturgical year Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ovarian cancer Boyz II Men Sun Month Billboard Hot 100 Androgen insensitivity syndrome Second Battle of El Alamein Sex assignment Carbon dioxide Wood Snooker Marching band Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cytomegalovirus Cryptorchidism Cephalic disorder Drug test Joni Mitchell Lunar phase Glossary of partner dance terms Maya calendar Flowering plant Autism Prostate cancer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Frankie Laine Cancer Oscilloscope Elephant Hey Jude Fasting Sheryl Crow The Shining (film) Yesterday (song) January 2005 in Britain and Ireland Climate of the United Kingdom Macular degeneration Sharon Tate Day Battle of the Somme (1916) Abortion debate USS Seadragon (SS-194)
