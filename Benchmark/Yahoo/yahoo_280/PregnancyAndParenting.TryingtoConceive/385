is it posible ok just wondering is it possible to concive before ovulation and if yes how because the eggs havent been relesed yet thanks in advance you can't actually conceive before ovulation but you can conceive at ovulation from sex beforehand since conception is the act of egg and sperm fusing sperm can live up to days in the right kind of cervical fluid days is probably more realistic but eggs only live hours at the most probably more like most pregnancies result from sex just before ovulation since the sperm have had time to swim up to the fallopian tubes and hang around and wait for the egg to be released so if you are trying to conceive you start having sex every other day about days before you expect to ovulate so that sperm are always there waiting if you wait until you ovulate the egg may be dead before the sperm have a chance to reach it hope that helps Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Ovulation Fertilisation Infertility Pregnancy Sexual reproduction Emergency contraception Birth control Ovary Sexual intercourse Oral contraceptive Niddah Puberty Ovum Spider Prostate cancer Intersexuality Spermatozoon Miscarriage Chimera (genetics) Ectopic pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Androgen Oral sex Artificial insemination Gonorrhoea Ovarian cancer Estrus cycle Fetal development Sterilization (surgical procedure) Epididymis Shark Flowering plant Old wives' tale Multiple birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Edward's syndrome Abortion debate Pregnancy test Fruit Carpel Pelvic inflammatory disease Twin Sexual abstinence Endometriosis Homunculus Human sexual behavior Sperm Whale American lobster Sex organ Estradiol Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Safe sex Ovarian cyst Marchantiophyta Alternation of generations Parthenogenesis History of sex William Shockley Man Sea-Monkey Premature birth Grunion Gynecologic hemorrhage Ploidy Stroke Whale Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Penis Grasshopper Beetle Progesterone Drosophila melanogaster Homosexuality and medical science Krill Solar power Semen Gynaecology Social rule Hermaphrodite Leatherback Sea Turtle Gamete Douche Male reproductive system (human) Octopus Gonadotropin-releasing hormone The Jam Housefly Giant squid Urinary incontinence The Children of Men Cervical cancer Albatross Cephalic disorder Swimming Anencephaly
