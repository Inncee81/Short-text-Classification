what exactly is maca root anyone been successful ttc from it does peruvian maca root really help with fertility pregnancy any successful or unsuccessful stories please share thanks maca question i am pregnant and feel that maca would be good for me to take during my pregnancy but i know there are a few companies who sell maca that say it is unsafe during pregnancy can you please direct me to a doctor who you know is very familiar with maca and could give me an educated opinion about taking maca during pregnancy i really hope to talk to someone soon maca magic answer we cannot recomend maca while you are pregnant while maca is non toxic even at high doses it does stimulate graffian folicals stimulates fertility and it would be unwise for us to try and answer your question because there seem to be no studies that indicate it's safety during pregnancy we simply do not know there have been studies with animals however which indicate maca increases birth weights and the size of litters maca is also frequently used by woman after giving birth or to become pregnant perhaps peruvian woman in the andes would be better able to answer this question as they have been using maca for several hundred years so far in the usa there have been no studies that we know of that can help answer your questions maca question i'm pregnant and would like to find out if taking the multivitamins prescribed by my md and the maca would have any negative effects on me or my baby maca magic answer we do not recommend maca during pregnancy the implications are unknown and have not been studied however it is commonly used in peru during preganacy and has a long history for increasing birth weights of animals even though another site says this ive linked both sites below there are a lot of ways to use maca root for better health one way that is often overlooked is its effects our body during pregnancy is maca root safe to use while pregnant maca root can be consumed safely throughout your whole pregnancy maca root is actually not technically an herb it is a whole food it is actually part of a daily diet consumed by the people of peru it works very well to balance hormones and keep progesterone levels high while you are pregnant this can be especially beneficial during the first trimester there are no hormones in the maca itself so there is no need to worry about over doing it in anyway it works by stimulating and healing the pituitary gland so that it can function at a higher efficiency there is no way to overdose on maca root there is no toxicity from it worrying about overdosing on maca is the same as worrying about overdosing on potatoes it is a food not a drug maca root supports a healthy pregnancy there are vast amounts of nutrients found in maca root it can almost be a pre natal vitamin in itself due to the large amounts of vitamins minerals and amino acids contained within maca root helps to ensure that your unborn baby is getting the nutrients that he or she needs choosing the right maca root there are a lot of different brands of maca root out there i have successfully only used one kind of maca root throughout two of my pregnancies this is because the extracts and gelatinized versions do not contain the whole food therefore they will not provide the same benefits i highly recommend navitas naturals organic raw maca powder it is a reputable product from a great company navitas maca root comes directly from the farmers who cultivate them and are free of heavy metals chemicals and pesticides i have found the best prices on navitas maca root to be from amazon you can go straight to it by clicking here how to eat maca root maca root tastes like it sounds like a root the taste can easily be compared to that of a potato but slightly more bitter if you try and eat it plain you will spit it out fairly quickly this is why it is best to disguise the taste in food personally i put two tablespoons of maca root in my morning smoothies it tastes great when mixed up with bananas and fruit it is best to take about two tablespoons daily but you can do more or less depending on your individual needs i would recommend speaking to your doctor about this he she would know more than i do as you can see from above both sites say something differently i wish you well good luck Menstrual cycle Organic farming Chocolate Oral
