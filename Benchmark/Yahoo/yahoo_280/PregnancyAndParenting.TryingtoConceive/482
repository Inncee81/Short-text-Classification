my husband and i want to have a baby i need to lose a few pounds but what is the point when you will put on weight with a baby anyway anyone else been advised to lose weight before trying to conceive but hasn't and just gotten pregnant any complications they say it is harde to conceive when a woman is over weight but i agree with you about losing weight just to put it back on i was a bit overweight when i got pregant with my second child and i had no complications ecept for it is harder to lose the extra extra weight after giving birth but sometimes different people canhave different problems like oyu could develop diabetes or the child could be born with different health problems too i wouldnt stress too much about it if oyu are just a few pounds overweight i dont think it is a biggie but if your say pounds overweight try a lower calorie diet and eat tons of veggies and fresh fruits doing this will help you lose weight and maintain a steady weight and prepare you for eating right when you do actually become pregnant good luck and bless you Obesity Breastfeeding Binge eating disorder Atkins Nutritional Approach Premature birth Childbirth Coeliac disease Anorexia nervosa Pregnancy Folic acid Guinea pig Body mass index Vegetarianism Hyperglycemia Low-carbohydrate diet Prenatal diagnosis In vitro fertilisation Birth weight Hamster Milk Diabetes mellitus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Veganism Egg (food) Hypoglycemia Weight training Fecal incontinence Nutrition Weight loss Kodocha Calorie restriction Domestic rabbit Dialysis Hamburger Friends Obstetrics Ton Tocopherol Miscarriage Infertility Oral contraceptive Gastric bypass surgery Hypertension Abortion Raw food diet Car safety Spina bifida Human cloning Birth control Anchor Cytomegalovirus Money Dick Gregory Fasting Equine conformation Romulus and Remus South Beach diet Boston Public Olive oil The Notorious B.I.G.
