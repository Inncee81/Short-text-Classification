do most insurances cover sperm analysis i was wondering do most insurances cover sperm analysis some insurance companies are great and cover all infertility workups and treatments others do not the only way to know is to contact your insurance carrier and request in writing their policy on infertility coverage it's good to get it in writing or the name and employee number of who you spoke with so there are less problems when going for treatments some fertility specialists require upfront payments and like to reimburse the patient so they can make sure they are paid fertility treatments can be extremely costly so if you have all your insurance terms in writing it makes it more difficult for the specialist to demand an upfront payment from you what you could do to have a sperm analysis is have your partner go to a urologist they can perform a sperm analysis and send the results to your dr or give you a copy to keep when the urologist submits the bill to insurance it may be covered since it is not from an infertility specialist hope this helps lots of luck baby dust Infertility Insurance Publicly funded medicine In vitro fertilisation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Life insurance Medicine Medicare (Canada) Legal aspects of transsexualism Annuity Adoption Health care in the United States Primerica Financial Services Mortgage Workers' compensation Unemployment HIPAA Health maintenance organization Contract Lloyd's of London Transsexuality Microeconomics National Health Service Canadian and American health care systems compared Medical malpractice Fertility awareness Human cloning Student loan Risk management Copyright Pharmaceutical company Unemployment benefit Sexual intercourse Liability insurance CPU cache Social Security (United States) Endometriosis Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cystic fibrosis National Insurance Abortion debate Social Security debate (United States) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Phimosis Testicular cancer Medicare (Australia) Vicente Fox Terri Schiavo Managed care US health reform under FDR Prolactinoma Advance fee fraud Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Medicare (United States) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Title insurance Cryptorchidism Home insurance Varicocele Compensation of employees Pelvic inflammatory disease Money Medicaid Canada Health Act Government debt Economy of the United States Genetic disorder Multiple birth Mutual fund Wal-Mart Radiation therapy Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Social security Obesity Payroll X chromosome Medical analysis of circumcision Great Depression Product Lifecycle Management Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Stem cell Adverse selection Bank Credit card National Kidney Foundation Singapore Polycystic ovary syndrome Bond Shoppers Drug Mart Artificial insemination Health savings account Xerox Surety bond US health reform 1912-1920 Menstrual cycle Term life insurance Randomized controlled trial
