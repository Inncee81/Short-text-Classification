could this be possible an interesting point was put before me today me and my so have been ttc for months now with no luck my daughter was conceived whilst i was on the pill i have a tendancy to forget to take it so my friend told me to go back on the pill to get pregnant as you are most fertile once you stop or forget to take it according to her im sceptical as to whether or not this would work but it is an interesting point anyone else know if this is true could it work i think that's backwards thinking if you are trying to conceive you wouldn't take birth control not everyone is fertile immediately after stopping the pill in fact some women take months to get back on schedule stopping and starting the pill can interfere with your cycles and i wouldn't risk it also remember that no two pregnancies are alike just because you had a happy accident the first time on the pill that doesn't mean it will happen again good luck Oral contraceptive Birth control Friends Knots Landing Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception EastEnders Childbirth Abortion debate Depo Provera Kodocha Endometriosis Infertility In vitro fertilisation Humphrey Bogart Neighbours Folic acid Theory of conduct Apollo 8 Philosophical skepticism Days of our Lives Miscarriage David Hume Toronto Transit Commission Religion and abortion Marilyn Monroe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Code 46 Psoriasis Good Morning, Vietnam Ectopic pregnancy Eddie Guerrero Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Guinea pig Incarnations of Immortality Reservoir Dogs Sexual abstinence Spina bifida The Death Gate Cycle Caffeine Tocopherol The Star Wars Holiday Special Twin Pok__mon Live!
