can you help me solve my decorating dilemma my husband is an avid hunter and fisherman and he wants to hang his mounted deer head and mounted bass in the living room i suggested he hang them in the bedroom but he says no one will see them there we do not have a garage i hate to argue with him about this because he will let me have complete control on the way everything else is decorated paint floors fixtures etc do you have an extra bedroom he can use as a man room while i understand you not wanting the whole house decorated to look like a hunting lodge i have to say better in the family room than staring at you in the bedroom lol if you don't have the extra room that he can have as his and his alone then let him put them where he wants to maybe agree to one wall in the family room to put all of his mounts and or ask that he limit the ones in that area to one deer and maybe a few fish anything over that goes into another room and he can rotate them every so often it's truly not worth arguing over he's obviously proud of them and wants to show them off so allow him that joy it's his house too Chatsworth House Wilton House Bungalow Blenheim Palace Buckingham Palace Fox hunting Lighting White House Shaggy dog story The Brady Bunch The Cure Francis Bacon (painter) Dormitory Kedleston Hall RuneScape quests Interior decoration Comanche Linear Pottery culture Japanese tea ceremony McMansion The Curse of Fenric Bathroom Mandan Jayne Mansfield House Hunting Squidward Tentacles 742 Evergreen Terrace Paradox Washroom Serenity (Firefly vessel) Whaling Super Chief Door Rathfarnham Rashtrapati Bhavan L.
