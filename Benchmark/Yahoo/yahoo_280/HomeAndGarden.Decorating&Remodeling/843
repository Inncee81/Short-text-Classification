can laminate cabinets be painted if so what is the process painting laminate is tricky because the surface is so smooth and slick that the paint has a hard time getting a good grip it helps to scuff up the laminate with sandpaper before you paint but the real trick is to use a formula designed to stick to slick surfaces you have the option of using a powerful primer which you can then top with whatever finish paint you want or you can skip primer and use one of several paints designed to go directly over laminate whichever approach you take the first steps are the same remove knobs and pulls if hinges show or if they are easily removable take doors down from the cabinets so you can paint with the doors propped up on sawhorses or a workbench if the hinge hardware is concealed or if it is complicated to remove consider masking the metal with tape and painting the doors in place next wipe down the cabinets with a low sudsing grease cutting cleanser such as tsp and rinse off all the residue when the surfaces are dry you can sand them with grit sandpaper wear a disposable respirator and mask off doorways with plastic if you are working in the kitchen vacuum off the sanding dust and wipe surfaces with a damp cloth a tack cloth or a microfiber dusting cloth after that you proceed pretty much as if you were painting wood laminate cabinet doors usually are flat which means your main challenge is to avoid leaving brush strokes a roller or a paint pad may give you better results than a brush Upholstery Knife Plastic Drill bit Glass Table saw Textile manufacturing Sandpaper Casting Mouse (computing) Printmaking Brewery Radio controlled airplane Printed circuit board Mattress Laser engraving Friction Brush Soap Internal ballistics Wood carving Drawing Violin Anchor Arcade cabinet Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Floppy disk Aerial (dance move) Plaster Door Leather Frogman Lionel Corporation Sundial Poker jargon Amateur telescope making Fire extinguisher Explosive material Welding Climbing equipment Comanche Vacuum cleaner Handloading Diving suit Fecal incontinence Manicure Dairy Bong Glossary of climbing terms Glossary of firefighting equipment Equine conformation Lathe Mars Exploration Rover Paint Seismic retrofit Japanese tea ceremony Carbon dioxide Loudspeaker Thermal power station Gas metal arc welding Ice hockey Washing machine Kitchen Wok Epoxy Figure skating Chopsticks Architecture of the California missions Hard disk Tire Oscilloscope Skateboarding trick Brazing De Lorean DMC-12 Electric motor Dinghy Vacuum tube Rolling-element bearing Halitosis Masking tape Piano Dishwasher Fire fighting Vacuum Soldering Circuit design Menstrual cup Guitar Typewriter Plane (tool) Dry cleaning Drowning Car handling
