what do you stuff a comforter with my husband bought this really nice comforter but when we received the order by mail the comforter didn't have any filling i'm not sure what the name of the thing is that we have to purchase in order to make our comforter comforting and warm and fluffy does any one else have an idea sounds as if you may have purchased a duvet that is sort of a huge pillowslip for quilts or blankets i have two on the bunkbeds my grandkids use when they come visit i just bought a fluffy king size quilt at the thrift shop washed it and cut it to fit inside the duvets then i turned under and stitched the raw edges of the quilt so the filling will stay in the kids love them i've also seen people cut or fold blankets to fit and loosely tie them together every foot or so as you would a quilt then put them in the duvet i actually prefer a duvet because you can easily take out the quilt or blankets and wash it in the machine since it is only the size of a couple of sheets they are nice year round too beause you can use them without the quilt in summer or add more layers inside in the winter Mattress Quilt Textile manufacturing Textile manufacturing terminology Upholstery Paper size Clothing Quilting IBM PC compatible Sewing Tire Coffin Poker jargon B-47 Stratojet Comanche Knitting Animal Crossing Kilt Strap-on dildo Blankets (graphic novel) Applique Bong Casting Sampling (music) Little Britain Equine conformation The Inside Vince McMahon Undergarment Violin Patchwork Casualty lifting Cruising (maritime) Boat building Wound Wheel of Fortune Sewing machine Screw Microeconomics Harmony, Minnesota Arado Ar 80 Neighbours Billboard Hot 100 Dim sum Pink Floyd Idli Diving suit Operation Barbarossa Heinkel He 112 Diagon Alley Time Out of Mind Toilet paper P-38 Lightning Kimono Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hamster Shaggy dog story Knife Hey Jude Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tofu Humphrey Bogart The Jeffersons (South Park) Drill bit Douglas Adams Archery Linux De Lorean DMC-12 Dairy The Shining (film) Envelope Dry cleaning Glass 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Sushi The Apprentice 2 Bookbinding Flax Gramophone record Christmas tree Mars Exploration Rover House music Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Brassiere Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Sailing Tank Empire Burlesque Scale model The Amber Spyglass Curling Towel Heinkel He 100 Rigging Fecal incontinence Menstrual cup Milton H.
