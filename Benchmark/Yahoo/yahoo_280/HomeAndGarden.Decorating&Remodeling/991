i am going to paint my room soon but i don't know what color of tan to paint i am buying the paint from wal mart if anyone has ever painted interior walls with tan paint from wal mart then please let me know what color i am trying to get some ideas go with name brand not wal mart brand that way it coats nicely instead of being drippy trust me on this my friend manages the hardware dept of a wally as for the color well that depends on your room and the colors that dominate it personally i hate tan's but my kitchen is a wonderful kind of cocoa tan which goes really well with all of our red accessories if you have dark woods or dark bed linen go with a warm rich color if your room has lighter colors stick with a paler shade of tan or one with a little gold that will pick up the light and brightness of your room good luck to you Color Paint Vitreous enamel Cigar Physical attractiveness Human skin color Rococo Yellow Wal-Mart Lighting Comanche Sunglasses Sears Holdings Corporation Sundial Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Camouflage Tobacco Nintendo Billiards Black Mithril Chesapeake Bay Retriever Leather Microsoft Paint M&M's Fluorescent lamp Kitchen Pedro Mart__nez Wood Grace Cossington Smith Berkshire Hathaway Wood carving Harp The Brady Bunch Francis Bacon (painter) Georges-Pierre Seurat Red Viva La Bam Martin Sharp Chatsworth House Collectibles in Bionicle The Legend of Zelda series enemies Gaia Online Blue Upholstery Lionel Corporation Eye color Pennsylvania Railroad Hot Wheels Horse PlayStation Portable Linear Pottery culture W.I.T.C.H.
