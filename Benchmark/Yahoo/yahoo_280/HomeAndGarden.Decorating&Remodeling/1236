dying a denim chair has anyone ever dyed a denim chair if so what's the best possible technique and dye paint to use i can say this don't use rit dye go to a good art supply store and ask a pro about what kind of dye to use next you want to be sure that the dye doesn't come off on people's clothing when they sit on it that involves a lot of heat heat will set the dye and a lot of rinsing a steam iron comes to mind or a heat gun if you're really careful and no forget the heat gun steam iron it or just iron it once it's dry then steam clean the holy crap out of it be aware the amount of rinsing steam cleaning you need to get a good clean dye job that wont rub off will lighten the color a lot so dye it way darker than you intend for the finished color this can be some pretty tricky stuff but you can do it try a test area or just be flexible about the shade you want good luck oh yeah and as far as applying i would just use a big paint brush and slather it on shamelessly that's why you're going to need all that rinsing if you try to be delicate about it you will get bad overlapping and it will be a frickin' mess Upholstery Sento Textile manufacturing Hair coloring Paint Car washing techniques Indigo dye Textile manufacturing terminology Professional wrestling slang Tattoo Gilding Dry cleaning Weaving William Murdoch Social rule Pysanka Energy development Casting Brewery Shit Drill bit Soldering Japanese tea ceremony Wok Brush Cochineal Drawing Impressionism Fruits Basket The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Leather Dairy Dishwasher Great Teacher Onizuka Pottery Coffee Manicure Solar cell Tie-dye Wassily Kandinsky Aluminium Craps Clothing Sword making Denim Chromium Batik She Loves You Turquoise Cheating in Counter-Strike Time Out of Mind Staining (biology) Professional wrestling throws Halitosis It's Walky!
