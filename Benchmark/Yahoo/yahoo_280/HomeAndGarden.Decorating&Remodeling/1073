am i getting ripped off on carpet sorry i have square yards of carpet and it's going to cost me including tear out padding and having them move the furniture around the carpet costs sq ft it sounds a little high where do you live in relation to dalton ga where of carpet is manufactured are they shipping it across the country only reason i ask is freight rates are also figured into that and is this a patterned piece that requires extra yardage for the pattern repeat if so you might have a waste factor in there the carpet based sq ft yards x sq ft in a yard was before tax a pound pad yards you can't buy a partial roll of pad around labor usually a good installer will charge per yard there is always a charge for moving furniture usually per room and removing the existing carpet and pad for around per yard don't forget to tax materials only if you do go get other estimates make sure you are comparing the same carpet in each store nothing is more aggravating than to have the customer say that he went with someone else because they were cheaper then the customer didn't get the price on the same product they chose a cheaper one a good flooring store has more than a couple of choices if you like the store and trust them just tell them that's more than you want to spend what do they have thats comprable but less Microeconomics Carpet Solar cell Tax Value added tax Health insurance Gross domestic product Hydrogen economy Berkshire Hathaway Welding Tesco Upholstery Free trade Digital photography Publicly funded medicine Wal-Mart Bulk vending Sport utility vehicle Tariff Illegal drug trade FairTax Chair Biodiesel Plastic Galactic Civilizations Animal Crossing Insurance Law of value Inventory United Kingdom corporation tax Inflation Economy of the United States Clothing Computer Economic history of Spain Economy of Norway Alcohol fuel Dairy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Vacuum cleaner Laserdisc Space Shuttle program Airline Price discrimination Department store Economy of Russia Capitalism Capital accumulation Sweatshop IBM PC compatible Dance Dance Revolution Atari ST Economics CPU cache Mutual fund Economy of the Republic of Ireland Canadian and American economies compared American football Auto insurance Iowa class battleship Loss leader Future energy development Hybrid vehicle Casting Outsourcing Supply and demand Social Security debate (United States) Euro Wind power Monopsony Opportunity cost Mortgage Medicare (Canada) Economy of India Best Buy Overclocking Floppy disk Printed circuit board Solar power Surplus product ITunes Music Store Nuclear power phase-out Surplus value Wall Street Tag Natural monopoly Offshoring Lighting Nuclear fuel cycle History of the Panama Canal Deflation (economics) Airbus A320 Wood carving Progressive tax Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping Atari 8-bit family Taxation in the United States Retailer
