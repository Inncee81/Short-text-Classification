what are the benefits of a popcorn ceiling is there anyway to make it flat we have one of those speckled or popcorn ceilings is there any benefits to these also what are the cons do these ceilings and is there any way to get rid of them interesting question the main benefit of a popcorn ceiling is for the contractor it takes time effort and skill aka money to make those wall and ceiling seams smooth so to save time and contractors just smooth the walls and spray the ceiling i think if contractors could get away with making popcorn walls they would lol so just be aware before your start that most likely there's not a smooth ceiling waiting for you removing the popcorn is easy but it's messy if you haven't moved into the house you're lucky but all you have to do is remove the furniture from the room not absolutely necessary but makes life easier when having to move ladders cover the entire floor with plastic then using a pump sprayer the kind you find in the gardening department at walmart or lowes fill it with water and spray the ceiling getting it wet but not soaking wet you might be able to get away using a spray bottle but i think it would take a whole lot of spraying to be able to adequately saturate the popcorn material and your cramped hand would hate you let the water completely soak in for about minutes and then take a wide putty knife gently scrape to see if it has loosened i would do a small area first about a square foot just to get an idea of how much to spray on and how long to leave it then with that information and how comfortable you are with this task do either large sections or if you have a helper spray the entire ceiling when properly saturated this stuff pretty much comes right off almost in sheets to clean the bits left over i was tired of going up and down ladders and used a sponge mop with a new sponge head on it to clean the residue hopefully the contractors finished the ceiling good enough for you to just let the ceiling dry so you can prime it don't forget to prime otherwise the paint will peel off in a couple of years and paint if it's not smooth and you're not comfortable with doing that you always have the option of taking slightly thinned down joint compound and a wide putty knife and creating a texture which is more acceptable than popcorn if you go that route don't waste time buying one gallon at the very least a gallon bucket and prime after oh and make sure you're safety glasses a dust mask and wearing some sort of scarf to protect your hair trust me i forgot the last bit and it's not fun trying to comb that guck out of your hair have fun hope this helps and good luck with your project Mattress Drill bit Textile manufacturing Asbestos Casting Menstrual cup Champagne (beverage) Table saw Knife Upholstery Glossary of firefighting equipment Dundas Square Bong Wood carving Hamster Vacuum cleaner Woodworking RuneScape quests Diving suit Cruising (maritime) Lighting Fire extinguisher Leather Drawing Brewery The Apprentice 2 Social rule Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Thermal power station Kitchen Firefighter Paint Violin Tire Wallpaper Volleyball Breastfeeding Gas metal arc welding Coffee Doom engine Diving Japanese tea ceremony Xanadu House Glossary of climbing terms Sento Glossary of firefighting terms Dishwashing Quake III Arena Drywall Brush Christmas tree Welding Strap-on dildo Blood (computer game) Internal ballistics Japanese toilet Basement Mach kernel Theory of conduct Dry cleaning Fan (implement) Cannabis (drug) The Amazing Race Floppy disk Architecture of the California missions Wal-Mart Curling Car washing techniques Glossary of wildland fire terms Climbing equipment Professional wrestling match types Bassoon Wildfire Printed circuit board Radio controlled airplane Happy Tree Friends Fast bowling The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Wood Tanning Sundial The Wall Great Teacher Onizuka Dialysis
