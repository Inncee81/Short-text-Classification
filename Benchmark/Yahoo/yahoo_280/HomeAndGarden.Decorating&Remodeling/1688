question about paint painting interior of house whats the best paint to use latex or oil based eggshell or satin finish what is a good brand well it all depends personally i prefer latex paint much easier to clean up dries faster which means you can second coat faster less odor however that being said it's important to use an oil based primer on paint you are unsure of or oil paint already on the wall you can easily paint over oil based primer with latex paint but you can't paint latex paint over oil paint it won't stick properly will peel chip and scratch off easily as for finish you'll want to use matte for the ceiling when painting a ceiling a color as the walls you'll need to make the ceiling paint lighter in shade as the ceiling absorbs less light than the walls and it will always appear darker eggshell is nice to look at but hard to wash without leaving marks so if you're going to paint a high traffic area such as hallways kids rooms family room etc you're better off going with a satin finish or a teflon finish they are easily washable when painting trim such as door and window trim use a semi gloss paint these are spots that get dirty easily and semi gloss will make them sooooooooo much easier to wash as for kitchens bathrooms use a paint made especially for these rooms as they are high humidity areas and the special paint will inhibit mold from growing in these rooms again use a satin or semi gloss finish as for rooms that are not high traffic such as the master bedroom a laundry room an office opt for the eggshell it is softer more muted and looks great in those rooms the more you're expecting to wash the walls in a room such as a child's play room the more you want your paint to shine as this will make it a cinch to clean as for brands home depot has a home brand that is quite good you can also go for benjamin moore or pittsburg paints i also like pratt lambert if you're looking to save money you can buy recycled paint it's a company called boomerang and they have quite a few color choices and different finishes and the cost is so low it's fantastic i often use this when preparing a house to sell here's a link http www boomerangpaint com philo asp oh to make certain your paint sticks you should wash your walls with liquid tsp first this will remove all grease and grime that can keep your paint from sticking properly you'll find liquid tsp at any home hardware store use the liquid instead of the powder as the powder is toxic harder to mix and to boot you'll have to rinse before painting you won't have these problems with the liquid tsp enjoy Casting Plastic Paint Menstrual cup Sento Pottery Mattress Tofu Handloading Upholstery Manicure Bulk vending Illegal drug trade Textile manufacturing Passenger car Coffee Dishwasher Fire extinguisher Kitchen Tattoo Dry cleaning Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Soap The Brady Bunch Japanese tea ceremony McMansion Genericized trademark Hamster Xanadu House Knife Leather Cheese Sewage treatment Aluminium Drill bit Lionel Corporation Chocolate Volleyball Hydrogen economy Toilet paper Dairy Fire fighting Japanese toilet Biodiesel CPU cache Laundry Fecal incontinence Titanium Fancy rat Grand Central Terminal Lighting Cookware and bakeware Hard disk Comanche Chewing gum Blenheim Palace Trisodium phosphate Thermal power station Linux IPod Glass IBM PC compatible Powder metallurgy Acrylic paint Explosive material Epoxy Shoe polish Chatsworth House Car washing techniques Strap-on dildo Poker jargon Eczema Solar power Wilton House Vitreous enamel Overclocking Brewery Glaze Violin Diving suit Sundial The Legend of Zelda series enemies Professional wrestling slang Traveling salesman problem Atari 8-bit family RISC Pastel Stucco Light-emitting diode Motor oil Welding Inflation Billiards Curling
