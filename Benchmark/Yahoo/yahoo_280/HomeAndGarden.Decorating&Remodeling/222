what is the difference between a duvet and a duvet cover which one is better and why also which fabric of a duvet will be most comfortable cotton velvet etc thanks in advance for any advice the duvet is like the comforter it's the plush fluffy warm part some people silly people don't cover the duvet that's just wrong because now it's going to pick up all the dust spills odors and have to be washed more so we slip it into a cover like a pillow case on a pillow this allows a couple of things one we can buy a plain duvet usually cheaper and two this allows us to decorate the room to suit your taste you can purchase duvets covers in the size of your duvet i sometimes tend to go a size bigger in everything because i like it to hang over the edge in all colors styles and even get matching pillow shams if you have your heart set on a color you can't find easily you could always buy two flat sheets and sew them together on three sides slip in the duvet and then using oversize buttons or ties or velcro do up the bottom opening and the duvet cover or sheets come off for easy washing the possibilities are endless when it comes to fabric everything's out there for most casual go cotton for something more formal and really high end the upholstery fabrics will be heavier and lay on the bed more like a comforter set dress things up with oversize cushions or bolsters don't forget the plush fabrics are going to be harder to launder and may require dry cleaning where cotton and cotton poly blends are cheaper and easier to care for i picked up my latest set from ikea and i love them seems to me a king was less than have fun decorating your bedroom Upholstery Textile manufacturing Textile manufacturing terminology Strap-on dildo Pillow Carpet Undergarment Clothing Bed (furniture) My Little Pony Diaper Plastic Violin Gramophone record Quilt Chair Japanese tea ceremony Menstrual cup Floppy disk Weaving Sento Bookbinding Social rule Buckingham Palace Knitting Suit (clothes) Fast bowling Shirt Kilt Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sock Sari Little Britain Tire Casting Solar cell Bedbug Velcro First aid Lindy Hop Poker jargon Autopsy The McGuire Sisters Cookware and bakeware Singapore Police Force Professional wrestling match types Flax Drill bit Glossary of nautical terms Bong Social aspects of clothing Comanche Irish dance The Apprentice 2 Sauna Glossary of climbing terms Knife IBM PC compatible Care Bears Disney's Contemporary Resort Shoelaces Diving suit Wound Dry cleaning Kitchen The Amber Spyglass Bicycle Victorian fashion Colours, standards and guidons Customs and etiquette of Japan Tofu Mouse (computing) Surveillance Palace of Westminster Han Chinese clothing Condom Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tent Wire The Shining (film) Boat building Milton H.
