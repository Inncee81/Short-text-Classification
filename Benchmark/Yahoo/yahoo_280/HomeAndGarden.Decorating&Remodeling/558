remodelling question my grandma is thinking of fixing up one of the bathrooms in her home and she wants to put a door on one of the rooms the other day she was listening to a radio talk show and heard where some one did remodelling work on their home and since they didn't have a permit it got ripped out she is worried about having the work done is this something she would need to get a permit for if your remodeling and it involves plumbing hvac electrical or moving a structural wall then you are supposed to have a permit there is other things that require permits such as complete roof tear offs you do not need a permit to install a door unless your going to change a weight bearing wall i have done both with and without its up to the homeowner whether i pull a permit i charge more if i have to deal with an inspector cause of them dont' know a damn thing and mojority of the rest couldn't care less they walk the jobsite talking on the phone right out the door i am confident in my work and the years i have done this no problems have occured a contractor often has hard time pulling permits because they expect more from them if a homeowner pulls a permit of the time its automatic because they own the house they will even let them do what requires a licensed professional i always suggest if the homeowner wants a permit to pull it themselves if i pull it i charge additional paperwork cost and any additonal cost such as special licenses and such there are cercumstances where getting a permit helps if the city's allowed me to pull permits without specail requirements i will gladly do it and pay the fee the reason they want a licensed professional is because they don't want to look over the work they dont' want to be responsible for it therfoer the money you are paying them is just a what i can only explain as a bully fee pay me now or you'll pay later i mean think about it if they are inspectors they will catch any bad work duh i will allow anyone that the customer wants inspect my work they are free to take pictures and i'll gladly put warranty in writing i take pictures of all jobs just in case it does occur i can help out the homeowner and show proof the job was done correctly with pictures they will just most likely charge the permit fee and go on way in my opinon different cities has lost alot of revenue by allowing contractors to compete for certain jobs and more than not a licensed professional has lost the job to me because my cost is way less i called to have a outlet for a stove installed for a senior citizen i called to get permit which the client wanted i did this with no problems the city refused my request because i was not licensed in the field even though my electical experience proof of insurance and even licensed with the state i contacted some local licensed electricians charging times what i was i gave this option to my client and explained the cons and pros she confided in me and i done the job the job is done to the national code and was installed from experience the city lost and so did the licensed electrician i been doing work for this client for years after this job there is no proof that that wiring was not there when she moved in how would they know any interior work was not there perhaps if you have some nosy neighbors asking about the contractor van in the driveway but they still won't know what your doing now exterior is different story if they can see you doing the work they stop work all the time for this until a permit is required some municipalites wil record some serial numbers like on hot water heater and furnace but of them don't care or pay attention there just isnt' enough manpower to do it yes if you choose not to pull a permit it can cost you so keep good records take pictures at different stages don't forget videos choose a reliable contractor and check him out make sure he's current in his insurance and physically check out his work go and see it ask for references though remember most all contractors have bad references even i do the reasons of why vary some people are just difficult to deal wth but contractors will always only give you their good references but its better than no references make sure the reference is recent and applies to the job your doing if your remodeling a bathroom skip the references for a roof so as you can tell i really dislike inspectors and my experience with them is why and its not because a inspector has ever failed my work because they haven't its when you get an inspector that comes out ask for the paper to sign without looking at the work my money wasted thats why i dislike them so call your building inspector and see if you can pull the permit to do the work if you can then do it it can keep you from shoddy work if you can't well its going to cost you for the permit and the licensed professional Elevator Plame affair Insurance Poker jargon Wal-Mart United States Postal Service GNU General
