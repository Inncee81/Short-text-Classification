what kind of quality is ikea furniture i know they are cheaply priced that is why i am asking how long does their stuff usually last what i am asking is after a few months can you feel the wood beams in a sofa or is it going to last a few years or more ikea is an awesome store people are able to purchase trendy and contemporary pieces for an inexpensive cost the downfall the pieces won't last forever they are perfect for a dorm room a young adult or a married couple just starting out however if you want furniture that will last for years i don't suggest ikea they are a perfect place if you want to redecorate your home on a really tight budget but aren't expecting it to last forever i purchased a corner desk from them a few years back i had it in storage for a year or two but have been using it now for about two years it still stands up however the wood veneer is peeling and lifting and even curling it is cheaper furniture and great for temporary i wouldn't necessarily purchase a sofa from them and yes their furniture is assembly required it isn't the best quality however you should get a few years out of it good luck and hope this helps Chair IKEA RTA furniture Wood carving Bulk vending Neopets Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Wood Furniture Ontological argument Subwoofer Hamster Kitchen Microeconomics Tuileries Palace Solar power Couch Solar cell Nintendo Plastic Strap-on dildo Shaggy dog story Geodesic dome Violin View camera Secretary desk Mattress Rich Mullins Gross domestic product Potato Textile manufacturing Michael Thonet Baseball Stars Bed (furniture) Woodworking James T.
