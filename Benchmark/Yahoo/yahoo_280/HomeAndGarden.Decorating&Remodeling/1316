how do i brighten my daughter's bedroom up my little girl has a very small bedroom about m x m with a small single window in it the room is decorated in light yellow and her bedding and curtains are light yellow winnie the pooh i've recently taken her curtains down and replaced them with a blind because i found the room wasn't getting much light because of the size of the windows even though the curtains were light yellow the room is now much brighter in the day but lacks that cosy feeling can anyone suggest a way of making the most of her small window without making it look so sparce numberquestion why is that wrong i genuinely don't understand as i've seen others do the same you could try draping a voile curtain or something across the edges of the window and blind to try and make it look less straight ikea do sets of voile curtains for about per pair and i've used them to create a voile panel in my bedroom windows because they're quite long you can tie knots in them drape them or even chop them up alternatively you could perhaps buy or make some flower garlands to match or contrast with the colour of the room and drape those around the edges The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Chatsworth House Color blindness Poker jargon Wilton House The Marriage of Figaro Passenger car The Shining (film) Buckingham Palace RISC Sento Sari Colours, standards and guidons Dial M for Murder Tabernacle Window Jon Secada Textile manufacturing Francis Bacon (painter) The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Oscilloscope Winnie-the-Pooh Shaggy dog story McMansion Mattress Alhambra Necktie Kedleston Hall Curtain Irna Phillips Milton H.
