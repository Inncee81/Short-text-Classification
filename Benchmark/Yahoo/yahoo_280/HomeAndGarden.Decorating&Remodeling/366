color issues i'm female and am going to have my room re painted soon but what color there are so many to choose from yet i can't find anything that really seems to fit me see i went to that pbteen com site and of what i saw the rooms are like airy fairy princess land with everything all frilly pink or fancy or bubbly blue and green mixes that are too complex to feel like home i don't really like those ideas and have no idea what type of color to use i like the idea of a simple but inspiring place for myself i'd really like to have one wall black but my mom is against it but maybe i could get it to work i also like the deep but not that dark blue colors i dislike green i think it would be nice to have some sort of design on a bit of one wall maybe flowers or a moon and stars anyone have suggestions for me thanks for reading this by the way d my daughter is also and she would like to have black in her room she likes red as well we have comprised by combining the two colors if you paint your walls a light color you can either design it a certain way like with a wallpaper border or even they have out those murals you can put up that look cool or you can put posters all over your room my daughter's room is going to be a combo of black and red leaning more toward black and that is fine with me maybe you can talk to your mom and explain that if you have a light color on your walls you can accessorize anyway you want my daughter has a red chair and also she is getting black chairs for her friends to sit in her bedding will also be black i would say that most of her room is probably going to be more black than red as long as she is happy i am fine maybe if you sit down with your mother and discuss that you are getting older and just want a room to reflect you and not want a too girly room maybe she will understand we all go through phases in our lives you will eventually change and decide you want something different this is not something big to argue over this is your room greathoneybear Color Wallpaper group Avenue Q Lighting Color theory Wassily Kandinsky Shaggy dog story Grace Cossington Smith My Little Pony Milton H.
