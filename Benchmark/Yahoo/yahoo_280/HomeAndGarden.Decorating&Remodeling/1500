feng shui principles why are you not supposed to have a mirror in the bedroom and what rooms is it o k to have a mirror in a mirror is like another doorway in fengshui doors in a straight path is death in fengshui thus it is not adviseable in fengshui to put a mirror right in front of a door like a toilet when you go into a toilet it is okay to put the mirror at your sides not in front of the door or of you when you enter when the head of the bed or the foot of the bed not the side is directly in front of a door it also means death thus when you put a mirror in front of a bed it is like a opened door towards a bed thus means death in theory it is ok to have a mirror in the bedroom as long as you cannot see the bed on the mirror but to be on the safe side it is still better to keep the mirror even full length in the closet or cabinet this is really not considered as fengshui principles but it is more like good fengshui common sense i think it is unfair to say that fengshui is dumb just because you do not know anything about fengshui does not mean that fengshui is dumb it is just like saying that you are dumb because i do not know anything about you is this the st century where people start to judge something that they do not understand Sento Passenger car The Marriage of Figaro The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Dog agility Chinese architecture Buckingham Palace Wilton House Door Wood carving Stairway Bedroom Bike lane debate Sin City Sleeping car Euphemism Shaggy dog story Pickup truck Vehicular cycling Abbey Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine Theory of conduct Grace Cossington Smith Swingout Feng Shui Batting (cricket) HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building Closet Trapped in the Closet Xanadu House Bristol Grammar School McMansion Washroom Toilet humour Milton H.
