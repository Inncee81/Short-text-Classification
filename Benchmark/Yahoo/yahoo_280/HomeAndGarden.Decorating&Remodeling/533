why do painters wear painter's pants what's so special about painters pants is the off white color easier to clean every professional painter i've ever encountered wore them do they all lol i am a year experienced painter and laughing at the answer that the less paint on them the better the painter actually when i hire people and see the pants new or too clean i see a painter that does very little work and too worried about keeping paint from under his her fingernails than they are about applying paint actually most high grade painters pants have a 'soil release configuration to them that help release some of the materials during washing this does not get near all the paint out but i guess it helps i can't notice thedifference i have whites that i use for different applications i have some so dirty looking but hygenically clean that it would scare you i use these for when i'm spraying stains and oil based enamels then when through spraying the said materials i have a spare set in the van i then change beware of a painter with too clean of whites some have never painted in thier life and buy new ones to fool you personally i require all my painters to wear whites but i am leary about hiring a painter that all of thier tools seem to be new all thier whites are new this shows me they acquired new tools and clothes to simply land a job for a week or so before they get fired my whites all have paint on them of some sort and certain applications of paint will not allow to keep them spotless show me a spotless painter and i will show you either a lazy one are they are very slow i can paint around carpet and never have a drop on it but my whites will have some Paint Painting Upholstery Manicure Undergarment Tattoo Chromium Dry cleaning Drawing Sento Pastel Wassily Kandinsky Social rule Japanese tea ceremony Plastic Social aspects of clothing Frans Hals Ripped Pants Fire fighting Printed circuit board Wheel of Fortune Car washing techniques Opportunity rover Casting Nicolas Poussin Cowboy Union Pacific Railroad Portrait miniature Surveillance Chinese painting Clothing Brush Drill bit Vitreous enamel Home repair Hemp Carpet Oakland Athletics Hazing Artemisia Gentileschi Justification (theology) Great Teacher Onizuka White-collar worker Tooth Boy Scouts of America Mac OS X Diamond Watercolor painting Laserdisc Camouflage Expert system Textile manufacturing Light-emitting diode CPU cache Comanche Brett Whiteley Software engineering Painter and decorator Leather Marching band Diaper Piet Mondrian Pepper spray Apple Macintosh The Apprentice 2 Toilet humour Tommaso Masaccio Animal Crossing Motion picture rating system Willem de Kooning Glossary of firefighting equipment Washing machine __douard Manet Eug__ne Delacroix Blood Simple Johannes Vermeer Art Baptism Dick and Dom in da Bungalow Siphon Condom Gas metal arc welding Tooth enamel Knots Landing Glaze Hat Circuit design Lucille Ball Timothy Leary The Adventures of Pete & Pete Squidward Tentacles Motor oil Knight Rider M60 machine gun Bob Jones University Jumpstart 3rd Grade
