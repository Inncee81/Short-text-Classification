can you apply feng shui principles as a combination in individual rooms and to a building the same time i've recently become interested in feng shui my home i just moved into a house would like apply feng shui principles it i've been reading about the placements of objects colors in certain areas directions bagua of the home in individual rooms or throughout a bldg for better flow of chi i want know if i could do this as a combo move things around in an individual rm as well as the house in general if so does this confirm that each rm has its own n ne e se s sw w n directions i already understand the elements each direction will the placement of objects in a certain rm defeat the purpose of placement of objects in the bldg such as something against an e wall a neighboring se wall i've glanced thru books visited various websites info i am hoping someone who is readily familiar w feng shui can give me some advice rather than directing me to a website or such any other additional relevant info would be appreciated via email thx i had taken some courses under some chinese fengshui masters and i can tell you that there no such thing as a general guideline to follow because there are too many fengshui concepts and each one of them is complicated to explain here and when someone makes an audit to a house he she must visit the house personally to get precise measurements thus if you are interested to learn fengshui get the book a master course in feng shui by eva wong isbn ms eva wong is considered to be a very good fengshui master but she does not offer courses she is even better than ms lillian too ms lillian is a writer and not a fengshui master ms lillian wrote many books about mansions but she did not include the secret of attracting wealth using this concept in any of her books in that book ms eva wong writes about flying stars concept you need to understand that the book is good but most fengshui writers just do not write about some alternative ways on the application of the concept thus it is still better to take some courses under a master i know that you want an easy answer but the truth is when a fengshui does an audit he she must first look at the location of the house in relation to water road river bridges and mountain building structures around the house or where is your house located in the subdivision then we also take the direction of the source of yang energy usually the main front door this must be a precise degree measurement using a compass then you can use flying stars to calculate for the good locations and bad locations in your house the good and bad locations pertain to the energy distribution based on the calculation or flying of the stars the energy is not what you think it is it is chi it cannot be felt nor sensed it just can be calculated using this concept because a direction like east degrees is subdivided into parts degrees each a tiny deviation can make a big difference thus it is difficult to summarize everything here without the concepts most of the fengshui that you will do are not that powerful to bring in wealth or health to change your life significantly even with placing aquariums or deciding where your kitchen must go depends on using these concepts i think what most fengshui book writes about are things that are common sense to most fengshui practitioners or to most chinese and these things won't change your life for me it is just a waste of time to even bother with these without the concepts if you know the concepts you will not even bother to use mirrors or baguas or putting statues around the house because you know more powerful ways to achieve what you like and in fengshui you need to have a goal to apply a concept for example you need to attract wealth then you need to activate the current water star to do this you need to put an aquarium with an aerator the number or color of the fish do not matter at all like what most books tell you this is putting you off so that you will not know the secret of this which is that you need a moving water which is an aquarium with an aerator or a flowing water at the current water star this is where the concept comes in if you do the calculation it will locate the current water star in your house in fengshui you can only attract either health or wealth application for goal there is no such thing as harmonizing the elements to make your place in harmony this is another misconception that writers and fengshui people use for you not to get their trade secret and people actually believe them i know that this is not an answer to your question but i hope that you get the book it will explain to you a lot of things and with it you can diy your house and other houses if you do buy the book also get a compass it is better to get a chinese compass or the luo pan because each circle represent something in the fengshui concepts but you can replace it with a compass with a rotating compass at the middle ps for me it is better for a fengshui application to be supported by at least fengshui concepts you need to use the fengshui concepts together to cross reference them the more concept you use in an area the more powerful it becomes colors do not affect fengshui it is more that it affects our minds and fengshui deals more with the environment house not mind you need to understand that fengshui is not a belief it works even if you do not believe in it meaning if you use the concepts properly after application you need to forget about it and go on with life and after months life should be easier like everything is falling into place like suddenly you just got more clients that is if you are attracting more wealth in my case if i want more clients in my business whenever i do a fengshui in my house i usually get a result just after a couple of weeks if you combine the flying stars and the elements then your fengshui will be a lot more powerful than mere painting your room green and you need to understand that nobody has done a fully fengshuid house if you achieve a or done right then it is already good Tai Chi Chuan Taoism Theory of conduct Numerology Gravity Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Logic
