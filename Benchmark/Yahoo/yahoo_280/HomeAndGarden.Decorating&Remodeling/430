decorating a house how long does it take a decorator decorate a house that is semi detached attics bedrooms sitting rooms dining room hallway i wanna move in by christmas its been newly plastered days for each bedroom days for a sitting room if wallpapered attics dependent on size days each dining room days dependent on size hallway to include stairs and landing etc days dependent on the number of painted doors if all done as a single job some saving can be made if the ceilings are all done as a single part of the work no roller cleaning and a straight through the house doing them all could be achieved in days if wall colours are the same then a further saving can be made due to the speed of doing them as a single entity if you have a lot of painted doors opening onto the hall stairs etc this could add some time on as they need undercoat and topcoat sometimes topcoats all this is based on one man doing the work alone i have been a decorator for many years and this is how i would estimate the work a tip when the price is given ask for a quotation and not an estimate you provide the materials as some decorators inflate the amount used and the cost of them ask how many days he is quoting for and ask for a reduction if the work is finished early beware though as some of the clever ones use smaller brushes and small rollers than they could in order to string out the job try to keep an eye on the work as it progresses and if he looks like he is trying it on then mention it remember you are the boss as you are paying again dependent where you are the rate for the labour should be around per day for a hour day for continuous work over more than a week there should be a reduction on this amount best of luck The Brady Bunch Stairway McMansion Chatsworth House Drill bit Wilton House Blenheim Palace Buckingham Palace Bungalow Pottery Property tax Textile manufacturing The Phantom Manor Passenger car White House Brewery Kitchen Japanese tea ceremony The Haunted Mansion Gas metal arc welding Xanadu House Casting Sento Restaurant 742 Evergreen Terrace Stucco Abbey Speed of light Dairy Paint Inflation Holkham Hall Taxation in the United States Digital photography Lighting Wallpaper Labour economics Painter and decorator Combine (Half-Life 2) Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Palace of Westminster Glossary of firefighting equipment Unemployment Surplus value Thermal power station Shotgun house Compton Wynyates In-N-Out Burger CPU design CPU cache Basement Shaggy dog story Social Security (United States) Wood carving Glossary of firefighting terms Hot air balloon Productive and unproductive labour House System at the California Institute of Technology Labor theory of value Brush Wallpaper group Fan (implement) Paintball The Shining (film) Tax Great Pyramid of Giza Monticello Palazzo Vecchio Shetland Sheepdog Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Fire fighting Elevator Serenity (Firefly vessel) Social Security debate (United States) Harrow School FairTax Christiansborg Palace Rolling-element bearing RISC Volleyball Interest Blackadder Vincent van Gogh Straw-bale construction Floppy disk Wire McFly Work breakdown structure Super Chief Grand Central Terminal Columbine High School massacre Sin City Fuel injection Progressive tax Economic inequality Insurance Port Authority Trans-Hudson Mies
