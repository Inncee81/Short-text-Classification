apartment floorplans which do you prefer i need a guest bedroom and an office space but not a lot of dining area vista grande at tampa palms month sq ft http tinyurl com qfro arbors at carrollwood month sq ft http tinyurl com tmk o comparing price and square footage this should be a no brainer but i'm in love with both of these places i need office space because i work from home wow i can see why you're in love with both i wish we had apartments that looked like those around here this is a hard one taking a good look at the floor plans keeping your specifics in mind though here's how i see it the vista grande has a rather big dining area but it's next to the bigger i'm assuming master bedroom you can use that as an open but cozy office space since the kitchen has a nifty little breakfast nook you can use for dining the arbors has the cute little upstairs loft that could be used for an office space but it doesn't look like there's any type of dining area at all it would leave you resorting to eating in the living room or at a kitchen counter that doesn't sound fun all in all i'd say your best bet is the vista grande it's cheaper smaller in square footage but seems to be the better choice since it's got something to satisfy both your requirements whereas the arbors only fulfills one it's all up to you though of course good luck o p s this was a fun question to answer i love playing with floor plans everyone insists i just need to be an architect or something lol i'll even spend hours on that sims game just to build fun houses or my idea of my dream house forget the people let me build decorate dangit o The Brady Bunch Walt Disney World Resort McMansion Vista Way Disneyland Wilton House Buckingham Palace Chatham Square NorthBridge Apartment Complex Bungalow Donald Trump The Inside Animal Crossing The Commons Rent (musical) Game show Friends Passenger car University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Avenue Q Social rule Ron and Fez Restaurant Poker jargon Super Chief Trapped in the Closet Office Disney's Contemporary Resort Microeconomics University of California, Irvine FX Networks Bristol Grammar School New Urbanism House Stairway Epcot Jumpstart 3rd Grade Carlsbad, California Palace of Versailles The Star Wars Holiday Special Babylon 5 Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center Courtyard University of Michigan Draw poker The Sims State room Dormitory __ras an Uachtar__in Cuisine of Denmark Hollywood Squares National Gallery, London Hartford, Connecticut Irish Houses of Parliament Frankfurt kitchen University of California, Santa Barbara Holkham Hall Abbey Florida Institute of Technology Pure Pwnage Bad Wolf In-N-Out Burger Urban sprawl Sin City Pitaten Ra (board game) The Shining (film) Osborne House Rochdale College Fraternities and sororities Kitchener, Ontario Little Britain Japanese tea ceremony Wall Street Blackjack The Basement Tapes Vertigo (film) Las Vegas metropolitan area Walt Disney World College Program 2004 Republican National Convention Le Corbusier Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Chula Vista, California The nature of God in Western theology The Young Ones (TV series) Palace of Westminster The Apprentice 2 Francis Bacon (painter) Harrow School
