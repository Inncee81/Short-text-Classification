how do you cut wallpaper so that it will cover the side of surfaces that are semi circle without the bulges i tried cutting the corners into sections so that when i fold it downwards to cover the sides it wont bulge but the end result is not nice to look at the cut edges were eye sores i wonder how the makers of computer tables did it since all curved sides were smoothly covered i was thinking that maybe there is pattern to follow when covering curved sides please help me hmm when you are trying to cover curves you need to snip into the fabric to ease it around the actual curve i guess wallpaper must be similar try taking little vee shaped nicks out of it not promising it will work though Wallpaper group Amateur telescope making Knife Tessellation Mattress Tide Planetary orbit Drill bit Drawing Valles Marineris Equine conformation Wood carving Woodworking Laser engraving Point groups in three dimensions Sundial Dice Boy's surface Wallpaper Skirt and dress Diamond cut Moon CPU cache Floppy disk Heinkel He 100 Lorentz group Internal ballistics Parabola M__bius transformation Autostereogram Metalworking Minesweeper (computer game) Welding Spinnaker Geodesic dome Glossary of graph theory Tidal locking Katana Trigonometric function Regular polytope Nonuniform rational B-spline Earth Solar system Sword making Computer wallpaper P-61 Black Widow Bassoon Table tennis B__zier curve Tire Textile manufacturing terminology Sword Modified Newtonian dynamics Curve Billiards Cissoid of Diocles Kimono Sphenoid bone Spline (mathematics) Reuleaux triangle Movie projector Stairway Camouflage Technical drawing Casting Normal distribution Supply and demand Geodesy Boat building Leaf Geology of the Moon Yield curve Color Geographic information system Book of Kells Speech synthesis Pottery Geology of the Appalachians Hangul Saw Map projection Fan (implement) Quotation mark John Wallis Sewing machine Symmetry Freeform surface Extrapolation Milling machine Chair Computer animation Explosive material Sternum Saturn Shotgun Voynich manuscript Black hole Dog Natural deduction Geodesic
