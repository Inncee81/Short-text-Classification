how to decorate my brick wall with fireplace i have a large livingroom with one entire wall of brick with a wood burning fireplace the brick color is varied 's style i have a large dark stained mantel over the fireplace and have placed a tall bookcase on either side of the fireplace but it just doesn't pop there is also a brick ledge approx bricks deep along the base of the entire wall this is perfect height for low level seating but i'd have to move the bookcases my couch and loveseat are brick red with dark wood trim my room has a hardboard ceiling similar to original hardwood flooring i will be painting my walls a sage color i really need some guidance on the brick wall i don't think whitewashing is the answer in my traditional livingroom without the bookcases the wall is plain and flat with the exception of the mantel i'm open to ideas you might want to narrow down the brick area to just a little wider than the fireplace and drywall the wall on either side using the same sage paint color you might also use chair rail and picture frame trim on the painted walls either side of the fireplace also consider adding crown molding where the walls meet the ceiling consider painting your ceiling a light flat color maybe eggshell or white to increase the brightness of the room and paint the crown molding the same color as the ceiling but use a satin paint if your bricks look too dry and plain you might want to seal them with clear urethane to give them a wet glossy look i think you will like it Stairway Wood Wilton House Wood carving Lighting Molding (decorative) Architecture of the California missions Sento Drill bit Chair Paint Sistine Chapel McMansion Upholstery Casting Basement Alhambra Stucco Polyurethane Dundas Square Door Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Colours, standards and guidons Chatsworth House Wallpaper group Abbey Brush Fan (implement) Rococo Hogwarts Floor Directory Glass Xanadu House Opportunity rover Mantelpiece Fireplace School bus Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Plastic Pottery Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Magical objects in Harry Potter Fire fighting Light-frame construction National Statuary Hall Equine conformation Gamut Doom engine Bubble Bobble Irish Houses of Parliament Plaster Rathfarnham Volleyball Grace Cossington Smith Gothic architecture Holkham Hall Soane Museum Comanche Badshahi Masjid Sundial Carpet Santa Claus St. Peter's Basilica Shotgun house Light-emitting diode Palace of Westminster Tobacco Typewriter Wrigley Field Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Poker jargon Skateboarding trick Lake District Bong First-person shooter Fenway Park Mattress Bungalow M.C.
