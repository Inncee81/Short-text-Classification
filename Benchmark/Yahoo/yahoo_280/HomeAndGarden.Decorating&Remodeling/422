what type of paint can i use to paint murials on walls with do i need to apply anything over it to protect it i want to paint a section of my room wall with a murial and dun know what type of paint to use help hahahaa mural not murial thanks for the correction oil paints are durable but they take a long time to dry handy if you want to re work parts to perfect it and won't need sealing they may be a little smelly too keep your windows open acrylics would be the best as they're virtually odourless look for a brand named d'art they come in large plastic tubs buy some plastic drinking cups with lids and mix a colour you like into each and keep closed with the lids they tend to dry fast buy a basic set white black red yellow blue and purple then you can mix any colour you want alternatively normal house paints would work but the colours tend be muted you can buy the mini bottles to do a mural but shop around if you can borrow an overhead projector to project the image onto the wall and draw it that's great but not easy to find do a rough sketch freehand if your confident personally i would just go for it from your heart while you're filled with the passion to do it and don't worry about imperfections when art is from your heart there's no such thing as a mistake make sure your wall is clean and free from dust if possible do a water emulsion paint base coat nb if you do the base coat as dark as possible then sketch your image out in white then apply colours over the top it has a stunning effect that is easy to achieve sofiahemma neigo com Paint Casting Bong Color theory Color Pottery Drill bit Top-bar hive Sento Grace Cossington Smith Drawing Upholstery Thermal power station Billiards Table tennis Masonry Acrylic paint Color blindness Brett Whiteley Mural Circuit design Light-emitting diode Projection screen Hamster Knife Tofu Violin Gramophone record Painting Brush Glaze Timpani Table saw Textile manufacturing Photography Lionel Corporation Flag of Hong Kong Menstrual cup Tea Motor oil Leather Singapore Police Force Tincture (heraldry) Molotov cocktail Wood Manicure GunBound Movie projector Ceramics RISC Mouse (computing) Dance Dance Revolution The Last Supper (Leonardo) Rose Customs and etiquette of Japan Coffee Baby bottle Arsenal F.C.
