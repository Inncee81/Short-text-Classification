i am building a new home im terrible at decorating what sofa color works with olive walls i am building a very basic two story home downstairs having a family room den computer room kitchen with nook walk in pantry half bath and laundry upstairs i have split into two suites each side have a large bedroom ensuite and x walk in closet end of the hall is a walk in linen closet x very simple and basic i like the greens yellows and browns but have no idea what to do i have gone to four interior decorators but all of them come up with something different just looking for some clues or ideas i suppose thanks regardless of the size of your rooms and the colors of your walls when you keep your furniture simple in color and basic it always works better also due to the advent of stain resistant microfiber you can get light colored furniture with no worries about stains i would suggest a light color in browns since if you ever get tired of your color scheme you won't be forced to shop for a new sofa what you can do is maybe get a beige sofa any style you like and then buy olive and maroon cushions as an accent piece everything doesn't have to be perfectly color coordinated that would make it boring see if a jewel tone maroon accent cushion or a throw will appeal to you that may contrast with your beige sofa and a jewel tone olive cushion the jewel or bright color of cushions brighten up a sober sofa nicely without overwhelming the room with a lot of color in the sofa itself a dish on your neutral colored center table with potpourri that is also olive colored and maroon table lamps that are white or cream colored with a maroon olive pattern or a lamp shade that is white with maroon or olive embroidered the key again is to accent subtly so that it just looks open due to less color in furniture but the overall effect is just very harmonious compliment with an area rug in the center and continue the theme with cream or white curtains around the room with similar colors in embroidery or scarves that reflect the olive walls in small details Kitchen The Brady Bunch Lighting Upholstery Billiards McMansion Color Buckingham Palace Chatsworth House Carpet Cross-stitch Chair Rococo Blenheim Palace Wassily Kandinsky Stage lighting Bristol Grammar School Diamond Furniture Sicilian Baroque Alhambra Palace of Westminster Beret Wilton House Dormitory Staining (biology) Dragon Booster Abbey Little Britain Traditional animation Diamond simulant Wood carving Francis Bacon (painter) Tire The Shining (film) Camouflage Cuisine of Denmark Wallpaper group Animal Crossing Baroque Le Corbusier Fluorescent lamp Human skin color Xanadu House Couch Colours, standards and guidons GunBound Atari 8-bit family Super Chief TARDIS Passenger car Japanese cuisine Glass Fischer Random Chess Sundial The Star Wars Holiday Special Symmetry Applique The Ersatz Elevator Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Loudspeaker Bicycle lighting Stained glass Phoneme Mattress Light-emitting diode CPU cache Snooker Wood Eight ball Modem Gothic architecture Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Stereoscopy Diamond cut Cat Avenue Q Polarization Trapped in the Closet Diamond color Make money fast Drawing Berghof (Hitler) Ammolite Hangul Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Power Rangers Stairway
