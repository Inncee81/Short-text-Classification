how do i get a plate glass mirror in bathroom off the wall this spec home builder put up horribly ugly plate glass mirrors to cover whole bathrooms walls how do i get these off the walls thanks to all home builders and contractors and home improvement specialists for their answers try in a corner of one of the walls at the bottom take a hair dryer and put it on high and aim between the wall and the mirror there may not seem as if there is a space but there is get it good and hot and take a screw driver to try a lift it up a little not to far to break but to see if it will move some builders use a product called liquid nails to put up those mirrors and then some use construction adhesive so it depends on that issue when liquid nails becomes hot it tends to liquify and be more pliable construction adhesive tends to harden and needs to be actually broken into pieces see what i mean about the difference you may end up having to break the mirror into big pieces that you can remove but always wear safety goggles and heavy duty gloves Seismic retrofit Casting Welding Drill bit Tire Brewery Solar power Clinker (boat building) Upholstery Tesla coil Space Shuttle program Car handling Glossary of firefighting terms Softball Mirror Motor oil Tile Plastic Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Pottery Textile manufacturing Violin Aluminium Printed circuit board Adhesive Paul Is Dead Professional wrestling throws Glasses Steel Stairway Leather School bus Redundant array of independent disks Amateur telescope making Wayne Corporation John Hancock Tower Stereoscopy Rail tracks Vacuum tube B-52 Stratofortress Space Shuttle external tank Menstrual cup Meccano Hamster Elevator Automatic number plate recognition Drywall CPU cache Bong The Brady Bunch Timber framing Wallpaper group Fecal incontinence Stave church Rail terminology Wood Table saw Glossary of climbing terms Wrigley Field Straw-bale construction Crew Exploration Vehicle Diving suit Lathe Equine conformation Wood carving M16 (rifle) Climbing equipment Shen Gong Wu Professional wrestling match types Door Bicycle frame McMansion Collecting fossils The Shining (film) Powder metallurgy M60 machine gun Internal combustion engine Homebuilt aircraft Cookware and bakeware Epoxy Customs and etiquette of Japan Transformer Genericized trademark Air conditioning Polyethylene terephthalate Cathode ray tube Golden Plates Tattoo Boat building Sugar beet Oxyacetylene Eyeglass prescription Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Residual-current device Seismometer Loudspeaker Windows XP Double bass
