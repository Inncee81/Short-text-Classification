drywall mud dust and old unfinished hardwood floor how do you get the drywall mud dust off of old unfinished hardwood floors so they can be sanded and refinished we have tried everything and all we get is a white coating on the floor from the dust do we even have to worry about getting it up or will the floor sander do the job for us we are refurbishing an year old home and this is our one and only question i can't count the number of times we have used the shop vac on these floors lol we just have so much puttying and sanding that we can't get it all up you all have given wonderful answers thanks so much i'll remember them all when we get to the second floor falls over and faints from exhaustion the second floor is all hardwood too omg believe me when you start sanding that floor the mud dust will be a distant memory and will seem miniscule compared to the sawdust you get from sanding on a lighter note though you will notice that as soon as you sand the wood all the garbage on the surface will get ground off and the fresh wood look will appear it will be dull at first because of all the sawdust but once it's washed and waxed polyurethaned it'll shine like new just make sure that before you put any coating material on it that you have washed it good at least or times this of course follows sweepings otherwise you'll trap the sawdust in the coating and it will always be dull or dusty looking good luck Drill bit Vacuum cleaner Plastic Casting Wood Upholstery Seismic retrofit Polyurethane Sawdust Woodworking Plywood Knife Explosive material Mars Exploration Rover Anchor Charcoal Tire Brush Piccolo Junior Saga Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Epoxy Wood carving Eolian King George V School Mattress Hardwood Christmas tree Mud People Nunchaku Deep Impact (space mission) The Amber Spyglass Naruto jutsu Paint Plaster Nuclear fallout The Shining (film) Table saw Tank Wallpaper Collecting fossils Stairway Erosion Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Building material Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drywall Series finale Solar system Pottery Impact crater Garbage collection (computer science) Hamster Oscilloscope Opportunity rover Notable lines in the Star Wars series Softball Violin Fallout shelter Wood finishing The Curse of Fenric Methane Spirit rover Book of Isaiah Gaia Online Fire fighting Amber Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Asbestos Social rule Comet Pok__mon Abilities Desert Spidey Super Stories George Carlin Sand Pebble bed reactor Las Vegas metropolitan area Surtsey Gypsy moth Wood pulp Stalag Luft III Volcano Car washing techniques Brewery Caving Sand casting Stucco Deck (ship) Survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks Atlantic Ocean Abiogenic petroleum origin 2001: A Space Odyssey A151 road Sewage treatment Extraterrestrial skies Little Britain Home repair Shoe Motor oil Crossbow
