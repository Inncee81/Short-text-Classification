double glazing problem i have recently had a new double glazed window fitted in my kitchen the problem i have is that there appears to be a grey film on the glass which by the way is pilkington k glass the other thing that happens is that first thing in the morning the window is completely misted over on the outside but clears as the day goes on i have contacted the company that installed the window and they said they would send the glass rep along to have a look at it but they couldn't tell me when has any one any idea as to what the problems could be thanks in advance i hear this problem quite frequently and rest assure this is absolutly normal the grey film is more likely what they call low e its a thin coat applied to glass to reflect the heat away from the glass therefore helping in excessive condensation as well as keeping heat away to keep your home cooler in the summer the outside condensation forming is not in any way a sign of bad installation or bad window this will happen on even the most high end windows and is very little that can be done its just cause by the atmospheres condition with the dew point and therefore is actually proof that the window is doing what its supposed to do so techically you should feel good about seeing this you more than likely wont' stop this completly but you can help im not sure if you use drapes but if you leave them open this will allow heat to transfer through the window sometimes this can be temporary very common in new construction remodeling and rapid changes in environment on another note if you start seein condensation on inside this is caused from to much inside humidity and you'll soon find out you need to probably invest in a dehumidifier or ventilation system again the windows are doing their jobs by not allowing the heat to escape from the inside and on another note on that when winter rolls around and you find this water content excessive definitly do something about it because it can cause mold issues you would be surprised how many gallons of water are in the air and this is why newer tight houses built today has so many legal issues with this your house still needs to breathe Solar power Air conditioning Glass Fire fighting Water vapor Autonomous building Carbon dioxide Cloud Insulation Thermal power station Heinkel He 100 Severe weather terminology (United States) Furnace E85 Bong Fog Swamp cooler Welding Weather lore Ocean thermal energy conversion Carburetor Greenhouse effect Window Plastic Phase (matter) Cookware and bakeware Ice Pottery Gas metal arc welding Aquarium Inflation Dehumidifier Solar cell Hard disk Tesla coil Glossary of firefighting terms Mouse (computing) Windows 2000 Drill bit Asthma Diving suit Hyperthermia Steam engine Vacuum tube Brewery Inertial confinement fusion Casting Headlight Jet engine Sun Basement Equine conformation Fluorescent lamp Gliding Corrosion Decompression sickness Tire Coffee Water Sento Heat exchanger Nuclear power Knife 2000 Australian Grand Prix 1957 World Series Refrigerator Mercury Atlas 6 Sauna Houseplant Pretty Good Privacy Poker jargon Fossil fuel power plant Pebble bed reactor Carnivorous plant Asbestos Microsoft Windows Alcohol fuel Passive solar Powder metallurgy Lighting Linux Rapid transit Climate of the United Kingdom Kitchen Public-key cryptography Circuit design Glasses Superconductivity Unemployment Wind power Microeconomics Volleyball Fiberglass
