guys why do many of you seem so confident all the time i mean how can you do it it seems like all the guys who i know are very outgoing and confident about themselves they can also be very very cocky which drives me crazy are you really that way deep down inside or do you do it just to be manly chicks dig guys that are confident if we acted like little pussies and kept doubting ourselves when we talking to you you wouldn't even think about giving us a chance would you ego is very important ego is what draws peoples attention to you its what makes people respect you its what makes people want to chill with you those who lack confidence have nothing to be confident about but theres a fine line between being confident in your abilities and being cocky Charmed Mojave people W.
