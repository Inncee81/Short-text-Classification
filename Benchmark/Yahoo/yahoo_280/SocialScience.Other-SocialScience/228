why are opera sung in italian why i mean it could be in french or english or german didnt french and austrians write opera themselves mozart was austrian i just saw amadeus and now im curious about some things what is opera or opus anyway when did powdered wig fashion die out and why was salieri really a madman what is don giovanni about what is a requiem why am i an agnostic so interesting in catholicism now anyway for some strange reason im attracted to catholics were the austrians catholic or prostestant i wonder what being a priest is like im takeing confessions when casanova comes to me catholicism sure seems like an outrageous religion to be in the scandals the horror the myths the legends the comedy the romance the satires the drama sometimes i feel left out because i wasnt born a catholic lol but who wants to be a slave to religion its like being in dimensions when you could be in that's quite a lot of questions to be answered here why not take a music appreciation class or a class on catholicism or check out some opera or catholic websites there are plenty of them out there but here's a few answers so you don't feel completely bashed on here operas are written in many languages there are a number of very good operas that are written and performed in english opus is singular opera is plural the literal meaning is a work a creation of music art literature etc a magnun opus means greatest work of art one has created opera is what one calls the form of musical and dramatic work in which singers convey the drama versus a play where the actors speak the words as for whether or not salieri was a madman was anyone's guess he did enjoy success in his time and was something of a mentor rival of mozart if the play movie amadeus is to be believed salieri was intensely jealous of mozart's success and mozart mocked him a lot such things could lead to obsession and eventually mental illness however i think it was more a matter of a friendly rivalry and a bit of office politics within the royal court as it were a requiem is a formal catholic funeral mass or the music written for such a religious service as for austrians and catholicism at the end of the twentieth century about of austria's population were registered as roman catholic while about considered themselves protestants now whether they actually go to church anyone's guess a friend of mine from austria told me they have to pay church taxes so a lot of folks refuse to go to church for that reason who says all catholics are slaves to their religion or anyone else who believes in a higher power people often make their own decision on what parts of a religion to believe and hold onto and what part is useless to them agnosticism doesn't seem to be a matter of being in demensions to me it's a state of doubt but that's ok doubt leads to questioning and seeking the truth and that is what i think you are doing unless you are a very skilled troll but i don't think that's the case well time for you to hit the library or at least the net happy learning Amadeus Classical music era Antonio Salieri Symphony Requiem (Mozart) Roman Catholic Church Joseph Haydn Religion Franz Schubert Musical works of Mozart Opera Literature Opus Dei Austria History of literature Agnosticism Choir Drama Theology Roman Catholicism's links with political authorities Fugue Trombone Atheism Bosniaks Charles Darwin's views on religion Bertrand Russell Separation of church and state History of theater Life and work of Ludwig van Beethoven Beethoven and his contemporaries Giuseppe Verdi Existence of God Baptist Idolatry Fidelio Arthur Machen Novel Ludwig Wittgenstein Religious pluralism Alcoholics Anonymous Sonata (music) Theatre English literature French literature of the 17th century Culture of France Mass (music) Mennonite German language EastEnders Spanish verbs Evolutionary creationism Louis XIV of France Requiem Freemasonry Reactionary Polish theater Funeral Catholicism God Marie Antoinette John Wycliffe History of Europe Fr__d__ric Chopin Theory of conduct Rich Mullins Arnold Schoenberg Church of Christ Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate Max Weber Pierre Beaumarchais Christianity Sydney Riot of 1879 Baroque music Minor Discworld characters The nature of God in Western theology Church of Scotland House of Bourbon Gioacchino Rossini Eastern Orthodox Church Augustan drama Funeral of Pope John Paul II Protestantism Scientology beliefs and practices Romantic music Justification (theology) Minister of religion Infant baptism Social rule Moli__re Philip II of Spain
