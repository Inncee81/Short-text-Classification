how do you build up patience wisdom is difficult to communicate you would have to explain you whole life story to someone to get them to understand but then i find my family very ignorant my cousin had a son but he indulges him too much and now my nephew is like a spoiled brat since what i say would sound like gibberish i decided to be patient and wait for their own epiphanies to happen which could take a lifetime i find myself however intolerant to ignorance and misunderstand how can i build up patience all things will be revealed in good time or however the qoute goes i may be much wiser and intelligent and mature than you are but i would not waste my precious time with you fretfully trying to bring you to where i am on the learning curve of life i would instead savor your companionship and appreciate the pleasures of the person you are at the moment that savoring of others that's where we find patience and that's where others around us find the trust to listen to you more often it's not about the compendium of knowledge and wisdom that we obtain privately for ourselves that is important in human relations and love and friendship it is the pleasure of each others company during our daily individual travels of learning that is most satisfying like listening to a great pianist in rapture rather than fretting that i cannot myself play the piano that well or savoring the exquisite moments of discovery that occur among the young the look look i can tie my shoe moments it is in the leisurely pleasures of the meaningful mixed company of others from many places on the learning curve that we rise in wisdom Nicomachean Ethics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Socrates Happiness Past teachings of Prem Rawat Goodness and value theory Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Social psychology Sant Thakar Singh Second language acquisition Storytelling Social rule Shaggy dog story Asperger syndrome Philo Victor Cousin Religion Friedrich Schleiermacher Love Theory of conduct Rudolf Hermann Lotze Apology (Plato) LaVeyan Satanism Predestination Free will Numerology Meaning of life Joseph Justus Scaliger Pitaten Rule of St Benedict Stoicism Infantilism Bhajan Philosophy of language Horse breaking Duties of the Heart Time Out of Mind Artificial consciousness Utilitarianism Intelligent design Karma in Hinduism Ludwig Wittgenstein Labour economics Geometry Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Classical music era Everwood Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Carl Jung Charles Goodyear Al-Ghazali Earth Girl Arjuna Religious Society of Friends Incarnations of Immortality Goldstein's book Cognitive science Sheikh Abdullah Samuel Pepys Supernatural Pashtunwali Miss Saigon Jewish Messiah God Emperor of Dune Microeconomics Aphasia Time travel Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Paradise Lost Psychology Force (Star Wars) John the Baptist I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue John Howard Yoder Richard Francis Burton About a Boy Vishnu sahasranama Sri Aurobindo Obi-Wan Kenobi Calvin and Hobbes John Cage On the Nature of Things Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de S__vign__ Pratitya-samutpada Original sin Consciousness Sadism and masochism Christian eschatology Vulcan (Star Trek) Victor Hugo S__ren Kierkegaard A Course In Miracles Public-key cryptography Creationism Epicureanism John Wycliffe Tiberius Infidels The Death Gate Cycle Eastern Orthodox Church Pysanka
