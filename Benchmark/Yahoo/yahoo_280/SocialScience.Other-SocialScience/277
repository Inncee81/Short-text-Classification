why is it that everyone assumes that just because people are blonde that they are dumb i find that stereotype very offending i mean not to boast or anything but i get good grades in school average and everyone always cracks blonde jokes around me and i always get upset why is it this way because most people are very superficial and judge based on first appearances many of the most famous blondes in our culture paris hilton jessica simpson etc aren't exactly known for their impressive intellect so a lot of people tend to base their opinions of blondes on this i can relate to how you feel about offensive stereotypes though i like to dye my hair a different color a few times over the summer usually something like purple blue green etc it seems that people have less respect for me because of this when my hair is a normal color i have to dye it something normal for school usually i go with brown or red i am treated just like any other person but if i was to enter a gas station or something today my hair is purple right now i have no doubt that i'd be treated with some contempt many people assume that because i have a crazy hair color i'm a drug dealer or something this in part might be because i live in a small town purple hair can't exactly be called common unfortunately you can't really do much to change someone else's opinion of you unless you talk to them prove to the people around you that you are intelligent don't shove your report card in their faces or anything like that try to engage them in conversation arguing really it would be more like a debate than an argument is a good way to prove your intelligence show that you have a strong opinion and can back it up with facts and don't forget the golden rule you know treat others the way you would like to be treated stay away from all forms of stereotyping be open to all sorts of ideas and people you'll be much more respected think about it you don't seem to have too much respect for those that stereotype you right sorry for the long answer it's just a topic that i'm passionate about Blond The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Social rule Joke Totally Spies!
