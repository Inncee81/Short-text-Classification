i can't believe this even from a liberal i asked if it should be a crime to bring food to the morbidly obese i got the dumbest answers in my life they have the freedom to eat what they want and 'it's like giving alcohol to an alcoholic they have the right to do what they want' i don't know how rational people could call an addiction a freedom after all isn't it usually liberals who talk about how bad it is to be addicted the biggest contributors to poverty if thats the case then they must think freedom is bad i think its a crime like giving a gun to a suicidal person you might as well pull the trigger yourself now i'm being attack my more idiots the same hypocrits that favor seatbelt laws i don't favor them because unlike morbin obesity it's not suicide remember these are the same people who sue mcdonald's for fat food sue cigarette companies sue all kinds of businesses for people making bad choices we have to freedom to make many choices in our day to day lives and it is our prerogative to sue blame someone else if we screw up hopefully collecting millions of dollars and stickin' it to the man god bless america Consensual crime Goodness and value theory McDonald's Trailer Park Boys Obesity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Atkins Nutritional Approach Super Size Me Guns N' Roses Alcoholics Anonymous Bill O'Reilly (commentator) True Crime: Streets of LA Rush Limbaugh Theodicy Ron and Fez Nicomachean Ethics Health insurance The Shining (film) Humphrey Bogart Little Britain Coercion Social rule Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Conspiracy First Monday MAD Magazine Big Brother (USA TV series) Meaning of life Free will Brian Griffin South Park Sin City 2004 Republican National Convention Hip hop rivalries Procrastination Kodocha McLibel case Survivor (novel) Video game controversy Bill Maher Soft drink Homer Simpson Human sexual behavior Friends Original sin Radio Yerevan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kurt Cobain Cigarette Smoking Man Beavis and Butt-head Ex-gay Gun politics Concealed carry (USA) Oasis (band) Predestination Samuel Goldwyn Pat Robertson Aquemini Criticism of libertarianism Invader Zim Gun politics in the United States The Jim Rome Show Fecal incontinence United States Bill of Rights Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sharia Drug addiction Phoebe Buffay's songs Twelve-step program Social justice YuYu Hakusho Plame affair Low-carbohydrate diet Food Center for Consumer Freedom Eric Cartman Political correctness Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mahatma Gandhi Microeconomics Marlon Brando United States Constitution Divorce Out-of-body experience Temperance movement Prem Rawat Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Libertarianism Poker jargon Philosophical views of suicide Knots Landing Victimless crime Jacob Michael Savage (commentator) Simone Weil Tom DeLay
