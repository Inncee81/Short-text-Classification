does the eiectric chair hurt in the other hand whoever has sat in that ghastly piece of furniture can tell us what about the gas chamber injection hanging garroting guillotine etc give the method of your execution electric chair probably one of the most painful ways of dying ever devised crucifixion might have hurt more but only because it took longer to die that way gas chamber probably as unpleasant as drowning or choking to death i would just as soon avoid anything that messes with my lungs hanging completely painless if done properly if the noose is just right and the drop long enough the medulla oblongata is severed cleanly resulting in instantaneous physiological death unfortunately if the noose isn't right or if the drop isn't long enough the victim dangles chokes coughs and sputters for minutes or so before dying also sounds unpleasant garroting again with the lung trauma this is probably also not fun guillotine completely painless effective but very very messy still you would not feel a thing death comes so fast you'd be gone before your head hit the ground i wouldn't mind getting nuked i think that'd be a way to go out with a blast or overdosing on viagra cocaine heroine and lsd all at the same time it'd be quite a trip before your heart exploded then it would mostly just hurt a lot these are the kinds of thoughts that kept me out of the really good schools Guillotine Capital punishment The Suffering (game) Cocaine Suicide methods Decompression sickness Torture Professional wrestling holds Drowning Trapping Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling attacks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Crucifixion Bong Hanging Pain Fred A.
