why do some people not make eye contact when talking to them i really don't know why some people do this but it sure does make me uncomfortable i have to look at someone in their eyes when i am talking i am very shy but i guess when i do talk i want to be sure that i am heard when people talk to me and do not look me in the eyes i get a really bad feeling impression especially if it is someone i am meeting for the first time it makes me really uneasy to have someone talk to me but not look at me at the same time i am curious to see other peoples responses great question Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.
