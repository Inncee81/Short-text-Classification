do i move on or get even i don't know if that's that's the best way it can be said but here's the story i dated and fell in love with a girl who caused me nothing but hurt trouble and embarrassment for some reason i still loved her now i'm done loving her i've had enough i don't hate her but i have some friends who do now i've thought of a horribly mean prank but i'm not sure if i should do it mostly because i still highly respect the rest of her family no harm to anyone not offensive to anyone but her just a little mess for her to clean up and some explaining to do of coarse my friends and i will be the first suspected of the prank but it's so simple that there's no way to catch us doing it or proving we did it should i do it or just forget i even met her i've always tried to be the more mature person but that hasn't gotten me any where i still hurt in side and she continues to embarrass me publicly thinking about it her mom might even find it a little funny i'd never do anything to physically hurt her or her family i just want my turn to embarrass her my friends tell me i've sat back and done nothing for too long instead of looking like the bigger man let alone the only man in this situation i'm more like the kid who gets bullied then one day goes crazy point is not doing anything isn't working move on pulling this prank whatever it is will only show her that you still care especially since you said that she would suspect you your friends of doing it get over her man and get laid by a new chick The Adventures of Pete & Pete Social rule Shaggy dog story The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Fairly OddParents Pitaten Friends The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Humphrey Bogart Garfield W.I.T.C.H.
