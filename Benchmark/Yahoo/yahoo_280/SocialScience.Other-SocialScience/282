am i the only one am i the only one that never abuses other people but been abused myself there's this saying that people who have been abused abuse other people and animals well i don't abuse other people or animals so am i the only one and i've tasted every type of abuse i totally agree and i hate it when people say that it's so unfair when i was in high school i applied to work at school at the after school day care with elementary children my school was k but i was almost denied the job because my school principal had this bizarre idea that i had been sexually abused as a child and would do the same i have never been abused in that way nor would i do anything of the sort but she contacted my parents with her concerns and my parents set her straight lol i did get the job too by the way but they had everyone who applied go to this anti pedophilia class to make sure that we knew not to abuse kids it could've been protocol or maybe they made it protocol because of my principal's suspicions my principal had absolutely no proof except that i showed signs of having been abused and these signs were being quiet not looking people in the eye avoiding people not talking etc i think it would've been safer to assume that i was merely shy because i was extremely shy when i started at that school in th grade and she never stopped thinking of me in that way btw i did have some issues growing up that may have been considered abuse not sexual abuse though my dad was kind of mean sometimes and he used to be verbally mean to my mom and me and he used to hit me i finally called the police once when i was about and he never hit me again when i was he kicked me out of the house and used physical force to take the key away from me this left a bruise on my arm for several days but just because injustice was done to me doesn't mean that i will do the same to others in fact i see it all as a learning experience when i have kids i will make a point of not carrying on the way my father and his father before him behaved i am kind to people and to animals too i don't think i could ever hurt someone although i consider myself to be a nice person most of the time i do admit that i have explosions once in a long while this scares me but i try to control my anger because i found out early on that acting on my rage will only make the situation much worse Domestic violence Social rule Theory of conduct Recurring South Park characters Kodocha Infantilism Fathers' rights The nature of God in Western theology Human sexual behavior Transsexuality Anger management Dead Like Me Spanking Abortion debate Rape Kyle Broflovski Adoption EastEnders Boston Public Transactional analysis Education in the United States Child sexual abuse Shaggy dog story Pitaten Childlove movement One Tree Hill (TV series) False memory Capital punishment Dissociative identity disorder Tenshinhan The Marshall Mathers LP The Fairly OddParents Public-key cryptography Child abuse Motion picture rating system Milton H.
