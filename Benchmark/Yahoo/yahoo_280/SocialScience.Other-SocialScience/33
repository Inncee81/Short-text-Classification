why do men seem so rude and arrogant in bars clubs i was just wondering why some men seem to be so full of themselves at bars clubs it doesn't happen everytime i go in fact it only ever happens when i haven't paid any particular attention to my looks ie after work to grab a few beers with my girlfriends it's not that it even matters to me as i have a boyfriend and i don't like dancing so i'm rarely within flirting distance when it comes to most of these places but out of curiosity why is it that when i went in all dolled up the guys were acting normal like any other person in a bar but tonight when i was wearing jeans a t shirt no makeup and a ponytail the men didn't just not look to me they had these attitudes like you have no business being here it was such a turnoff and even my friends picked up on the vibes it was even worse the first time i went to a stripclub i realize i haven't spent hours on my looks like the dancers have and that women are rare in those places but the rudeness agh liquid courage is abundant Homer Simpson Aerial (dance move) Social rule George Costanza Fiddler on the Roof Humphrey Bogart Striptease Recurring South Park characters Ex-gay Beavis and Butt-head Kender Avenue Q Barbie Janet Jackson Shaggy dog story Married... with Children Cliff Richard Turks (Final Fantasy VII) The Smoking Room Sin City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) One Tree Hill (TV series) Skinhead Knots Landing The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Saved by the Bell Minor characters in Seinfeld Professional wrestling match types Nudity Something Positive Dilbert Good Morning, Vietnam Napoleon Dynamite Kim Possible Sharon Tate Ron and Fez Can't Hardly Wait Dead Like Me The Catcher in the Rye Little Britain RuneScape quests Characters in the Smurfs FoxTrot Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Devil Wears Prada Crazy in Love Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Weebl and Bob Kimi Finster Smallville (Season 4) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Boston Public Roxette Haven (TNG episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Otaku St. Elmo's Fire (film) Friends Calvin and Hobbes God Emperor of Dune Quarashi Sub-Zero Britney Spears The Shining (film) Paul Is Dead History of subcultures in the 20th century Leo Frank Theory of conduct Minnie Mouse Sex and the City Homestar Runner Japanese grammar EastEnders Mahoraba The Inside The Ashlee Simpson Show For Better or For Worse Dawson's Creek Miss Saigon Sauna Kylie Minogue Piccolo Junior Saga Rod Stewart Philosophical skepticism Scottish country dance Eurotrip Craps Infidels Jennifer Lopez Urusei Yatsura Fight Club Port Coquitlam, British Columbia Appointment in Samarra Coming of Age (TNG episode) Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Tupac Shakur ECW One Night Stand Eisner Award The Fairly OddParents
