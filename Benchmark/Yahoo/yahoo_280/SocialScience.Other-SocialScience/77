on which area will molds grow bigger under light or in dark moulds are fungi they do not photosynthesise like plants so in general terms they do not care whether they are in light or darkness but they do prefer damp conditions and dark places are often naturally damper because they are less exposed to air circulation and heat radiation one could set up an experiment to compare how well mould would grow in damp light conditions and dark dry conditions Solar power Fungus Photosynthesis Soil life Water mould Hamster Stratification (botany) Carbon dioxide Wheat Carnivorous plant Big Bang Nuclear reactor Cell (biology) Casting Sunlight Compost Slime mould Garden Strawberry HVAC Cannabis cultivation Furnace Houseplant Air conditioning Nuclear power Chocolate Leaf Renewable energy Solar panel PlaneShift Comfrey Lawn Lichen Hemp Sugar Upholstery Sewage treatment Botany Sun Damping Diving suit Molding (decorative) Hydrogen economy Thermostat Wood Plant Cyanobacteria Car handling Model organism Injection moulding Color Ecology Orchidaceae Explosive material Gas lighting Physical paradox Pebble bed reactor Mitosis Future energy development Timeline of the Universe Piano Passive solar Nuclear fallout Seismic retrofit Heat exchanger Alkane Evidence of evolution Synchrotron radiation Phytophthora infestans Ionizing radiation Climate of the United Kingdom Gypsy moth Permaculture Global climate model Food preservation Stoma Plaster Psoriasis Anticyclone Luminiferous aether Desert Common bean Electromagnetic radiation Protist Air pollution Gravitational radiation Harmonic oscillator Energy development Ozone depletion Plastic Glucose RLC circuit Mushroom hunting Inertial confinement fusion Thermal power station Fan (implement) Largest organism Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Epiphyte Seismometer Diseases of the honeybee
