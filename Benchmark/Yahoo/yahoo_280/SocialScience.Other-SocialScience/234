is humanity in trouble i believe it is simply because we have no rules to live by and everyone lives for themselves and bases their whole existence on money and devising ways how to get it everyone's life is based on their own work school interests like clothes electronics sex etc and no one thinks or cares about the next guy too much people aren't too educated so they can't see past their immediate surroundings and don't seem to possess higher thought abstract processes for the most part their thought process is i agree i don't agree i do this i do that i don't care with humanity in the state which it is today with everyone almost being a hypocrite and doing things and hiding it for society and trying to outsmart the system and everyone else and genererally being unhappy and lost their purpose in life how can it not be in trouble if people have it good have lots of money etc they try to live it up and ignore the problems but they have no idea what goes on around god and religion aside because that can stir up enough debates on its own too many people focus on little things like their own interests and fields like history writing chemistry etc and devote their whole lives to it and seem to block out anything else i believe this is our downfall we focus too much on our own selves and interests and to hell with everything else and how it happens that's going to lead to a disaster scenario that's why we have beautiful movie theaters out there in la and beautiful chain restaurants and beautiful malls and all these shiney things and gadgets but if you look around you see attitude unhappy people social problems galore and lots of neighborhoods getting trashed up it's because people expend their energy for the dollar and the finished product but to hell with humanity itself it's all about the money products that's how i see the world and it's sad that others are blind to this b c they're too focused on work and anyone who doesn't agree to this question which you're entitled to my opinion is that you're just dreamers or living through rose colored glasses with your hopes and optimistic outlooks on the world and humanity you are idealists you don't really see it how it really is you're seeing it for what it could be that's not wrong but it's also not adressing the problem at hand whatsoever you can have faith that a drug addict will become a wonderful world leader one day but in the mean time they're still drug addicts get it prolly not b c you don't care you're too busy gettting that dollar and caring about yourself the biggest thing is this is all going to bite us at the end more school shootings more violence more bs more of everything nobody is safe when are we going to wake up yes humanity is in trouble we are struggling because our old methods aren't working and we aren't in agreement on what new methods will work regardless of how intelligent we try to be at the end of the day most people just do what the guy next to him or her is doing we are good at identifying threats like a punch on the nose but not good at identifying threats that we can understand clearly only with our intellect and reasoning like greenhouse gases like propaganda like the politics of fear the challenge for the human race is to rise above our biological and psychological limitations i think science is part of the answer i think peace justice and putting people before profits are the priority for me but of course at the end of the day every person must act in accordance with what they believe no life is a waste no conscious mind will go unutilized and hopefully our good intentions will average well on balance with the bad do not despair but you are correct that there are big challenges ahead gonna take a lot of work i recommend that you get politically active you sound like someone who is seeking peers who want to see change real change you are not alone you can do something about it seek and ye shall find Theory of conduct Soul Goodness and value theory Theodicy Religion Economics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sigmund Freud Sexual orientation Simone Weil Human Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Law of value John Howard Yoder Psychology A Course In Miracles W.
