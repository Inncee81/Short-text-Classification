should i give up things i want to learn an enjoy playing because of ignorance and inexperience i really want to play the piano again after several years but then there is so much i haven't learned when i was taking lessons and i dont play up to my ears expectations that i discourage myself from playing same goes for many other things i want to do like sports huge multiplayer games learning music and outdoors activities one of the reasons why i dont join teams or go biking and hiking and camping because i have no idea what its going to be like being inexperience discourages me but if i dont try how will i ever be experienced i want to have a teacher but them im afraid ill just annoy them with my ignorance you know how people feel about noobs i feel better off on my own but i could get killed with no one to notice why do i feel discouraged from doing the things i want how could i understand my fear of failure hey i feel the same way sometimes humans have a tendency to be afraid of what they don't know this is a horrible characteristic and you're not the only one who feels this way what you have to realize is that everyone was a noob at one point teachers especially understand this and i am willing to bet that no matter how bad you are when you first start something there were thousands that were worse than you i think you already know that the best way to start off with something is with a teacher or a coach just remember they wouldn't have that job if they didn't want to teach inexperienced people like yourself if you are joining a group of other people try to join a one that are just starting off like you another thing to think about is well what is there to lose why do you think other people will make fun of you or even think bad about you if they do then they aren't worth your time anyway but most people will actually try to help you instead of tearing you down just gotta suck it up and do what you want to do once you get your foot in the door you will love it so much that you will just want to try everything and that is the way to live Newbie Poker jargon Kender Hiking Milton H.
