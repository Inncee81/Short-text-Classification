what is the mechanism of retainning and rerival knoledge from our memory cells in brain is our knolege in memory cells is chemical changes or electrical one and how we retrive old events in seconds i think our memory is a series of process which involve both chemical electrical changes to my knowledge scientists still haven't found out the exact mechanism how it work if you find out any relevant materials please tell me but my previous research on the web may be helpful to you part of it is as follows there are three basic questions to ask about memory how are memories formed encoding how are memories retained storage how are memories recalled retrieval encoding is an active process it requires selective attention to the material to be encoded there may be different levels of processing which occur and that some are deeper than others but there is no definition for what is meant by deeper structural encoding emphasis on the physical structural characteristics of the stimulus is a shallow level phonemic encoding emphasis on the sounds of the words is an intermediate level semantic encoding emphasis on the meaning is considered deep processing about storage the most accepted model states that there are three stages of memory storage sensory store short term store and long term store sensory store retains the sensory image for only a small part of a second just long enough to develop a perception short term memory stm lasts for about to seconds without rehearsal of the information with rehearsal short term memory will last as long as rehearsal continues short term memory is also limited in terms of the number of items it can hold see miller capacity is about items can increase capacity by chunking combine similar material into units short term memory allows one to recall something from several seconds to as long as a minute without rehearsal its capacity is also very limited george miller when working at bell laboratories conducted experiments showing that the store of short term memory was items the title of his famous paper the magic number modern estimates of the capacity of short term memory are lower typically on the order of items and we know that memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunking for example fb iph dtw aib m vs fbi phd twa ibm beyond finding meaning in the initialisms above herbert simon showed that the ideal size for chunking letters and numbers meaningful or not was three short term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information and to a lesser extent a visual code conrad found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of words that were acoustically similar e g dog fog bog log long term memory has been suggested to be permanent that nothing is forgotten only the means of retrieving it is lost long term memory is believed to work semantically baddeley found that after minutes test subjects had the greatest difficulty recalling a collection of words that had similar meanings e g big large great huge memory retrieval is not a random process cues can help with retrieval context cues perhaps it is the process of reinstatement of context cues that accounts for the helpfulness of hypnosis in recall mood state dependent memory refers to the improvement in recall that can occur when the same emotional state is created as was present in the acquisition phase our memory is billions of routes and the ones that are easiest to travel and not inhibited by any other factors will be preferred like the path from the water drop on the book so more activity in certain routes will make it easier for signals to travel in the memorized directions theories of forgetting ineffective initial encoding pseudo forgetting usually occurs because of ineffective attention in the acquisition phase decay forgetting occurs because memory fades with time sort of like the effects of friction but time is in and of itself is not a variable it is only a medium in which processes can happen interference forgetting occurs because of competition from other information retroactive interference new information interferes with what has already been learned proactive interference old information interferes with what is being learned retrieval failure sometimes we can not remember something which at another time we can remember it perhaps this is because of the context cues or retrieval cues present at the time motivated forgetting we may tend to forget things that we do not wish to remember freud Philosophy of language Short-term memory CPU design Redundant array of independent disks CPU cache Password Human Philosophy of perception Expert system Artificial consciousness Psychology Visual cortex Explosive material Information warfare Iconic memory Color Clinical depression Cognitive psychology Dyslexia Long-term memory Causality RISC Milton H.
