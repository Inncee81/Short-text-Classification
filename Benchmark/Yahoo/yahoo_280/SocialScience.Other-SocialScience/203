being number one in any field hi i was wondering if you can give me some qualities altitude and achievement that the elites of any field eg sports business educator etc have such as discipline waking up earily working harder than anyone desiring that one thing more the any other person and so on because i am fascinated with this subject thank you no doubt disipline is one quality but it's a recipe to a larger reason to wanting to become number one in a certain field take donald trump why is he one of the best disipline commitment this small qualities that make big results are driven by his passion he loves what he does he loves making deals that's why this field he's in is suitable for him at his best to be the best you must be driven by passion and a compelling reason to succeed in that field sometimes we people want to do things beyond our abilties things we have never done before but have now raw talent in that is where compelling reason comes in where as a very powerful reason a powerful benefit for your future will give you the force desire to disipline yourself why many people cannot be number in certain fields is because they don't have a strong enough want to achieve that field what benefits does doing a certain field give you financial freedom acknowledgment depends on the reason many people live in comfort of where they are and never gave a reason so strong that could push them forward to do the uncomfortable and to succeed above all in the field they desire to succeed in if you have a field you want to be the best in then you have to first think with an end in mind it has to be what you truly love and how it can contribute to you and those you care about around you when you succeed you must be able to see feel and smell success in that field before you even attempt that field proactives which is driven by desire to be number which is driven by passion activated by a strong compelling reason to succeed what is your chosen field and how bad you you desire it if you think talk dream about it it is likely that is your passion and a great chance to succeed disipline cannot be forced entirely when you have a reason that is larger then life you will disipline yourself in what needs to be and not be done in order to succeed one must have a dream passion gives you the drive to be number in the field compelling reason gives you the reason to take a step further in becoming even more successful in the field burning desire to want the success of your field fighting day after day without much rest prepared ready fired up and proactive sharpening the saw of your abilities day after day but of course all this is useless if you do not have one important factor how do you know if you have passion or not for this field as stated above when you live dream think talk about it sense of urgency that you wake up in the morning and right away you rush out get ready as fast as you can preparing to continue your life journey towards your goal your dream the fact that you sleep you think about it reflect upon improvements and changes to become better in the field to wake up every morning ready excited and commitmet to face the challenges of your field without holding back without fear that's how successful people of their respective field become number they have a passion compelling reason burning desire and sense of urgency Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jon Secada Spice Girls K' Theory of conduct Phaedo Force (Star Wars) W.I.T.C.H.
