smart but unsightly people how much iq would you sacrifice to gain beauty i'm at about the th percentile in iq but maybe the bottom half for looks i'm wondering if i'd do better in life if i could hypothetically give up a small amount of iq for a large gain in beauty like iq point per percentile gain in looks that is too greedy but percentiles isn't enough i feel my iq is so i have some to spare without dropping much on the distribution and i'm wondering if i would have been better off if i had been given a slightly different genetic hand i have a brother who i'm slightly smarter than but he's significantly better looking and has gotten a lot of breaks in life as well as better treatment so it kinda pisses me off i'm not in bad shape or bad hygiene either it's just natural beauty any smart people out there craving more beauty in theory i extend this to hot people craving more smarts as well although i presume they would be less capable of comprehending all of this depending on just how lacking in smarts they are yes i'm banking on the surgery bit even so there is no substitute for natural beauty it's something to be exalted well i've always gotten good marks on iq tests and i'm as ugly as a pig's butt well i think so but then i do have low self esteem yet i have never felt the need to excell and have just spent my life sofar relaxing and entertaining my brain i have almost always managed to find female companionship and they have all been interesting people and pretty although that has never been a requirement for me to be friends with someone i do not care for appearances or status or wealth and have never striven for or attained any of them it has never interested me having said that i do believe that if you want to acquire status and or wealth you would find it much easier to do so with good looks than with a high iq so if i ever decide i want success in the world of money and status damn right i'd sacrifice iq for beauty but only enough to lower me down to above average no use being a moron an iq of would suffice to ensure one could move successfully in the world but it would be the good looks that would open the doors definitely Microeconomics Social rule Wood carving Poker jargon Crash test dummy Economic inequality Obesity Equine conformation Inflation Capitalism MP3 Love Economy of Russia MMORPG Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Race and intelligence Prisoner's dilemma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia Supply and demand Transsexuality Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Drill bit Puberty Physical attractiveness Wealth Cocaine Philip J.
