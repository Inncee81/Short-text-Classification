what is oxidative stress its a process we all undergo that is believed to be a major cause of aging as byproducts of normal metabolism and respiration we create what have been termed free radicals these are atoms or molecules that have been ionized stripped of critical balancing electrons and they go around oxidizing other molecules as they raid them for their electrons this basically causes a cascade of electrochemical electron robbing that can damage cell membranes and more importantly their dna this is why antioxidants is a big buzzword in health conscious circles because they are molecules which are able to donate their electrons safely to the free radicals without them having to raid and do damage to our cells Antioxidant Redox Corrosion Radical (chemistry) Oxygen Biochemistry DNA repair Nutrition Cellular respiration Tocopherol Poison Signal transduction Senescence Oxidative phosphorylation Ozone depletion Mitochondrion Whole proteome analysis Aluminium Iron Glycolysis Ozone hole Carbon dioxide Enzyme Apoptosis Organic reduction Electrochemistry Sulfur Oxidation number Selenium Benzene Carbon Photosynthesis Alzheimer's disease Hydrogen peroxide Ammonia Cell (biology) Insulin Metabolism Polychlorinated biphenyl Haloalkane Phosphorus Cryonics Cell growth Phase (matter) Life Stroke Anaerobic respiration Electrophysiology Ion Glucokinase Hydrogen sulfide Molecule Virus Corona discharge Molecular biology Nanotechnology Wound healing phases Water (molecule) Ozone layer Hypoglycemia Evolution Electrochemical potential Protein Ethylene Chemistry Alcohol Explosive material Polymerization Ionosphere Diabetes mellitus Chlorine Hydrogen Helium Omega-3 fatty acid Mesothelioma Oxygen sensor Hydrogen economy Mutation Paracetamol Fatty acid metabolism Lithium Ultraviolet Enriched uranium Nitrogen Vitamin C Potassium Crystallography Acetic acid Origin of life Major histocompatibility complex Vacuum tube
