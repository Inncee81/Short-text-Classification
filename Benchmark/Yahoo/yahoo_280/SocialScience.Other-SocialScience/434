why did so many early humans live in africa i know that that is their origin but why did they live there and stay there having evolved most likely in mixed forest grassland regions of africa the earliest humans were best suited for that type of environment they would not have expanded explosively and thus needed to move because they were still subject to the dangers of their primate cousins and only minimally advantaged over them in terms of defense as humans diverged from other primates and as homo sapiens sapiens diverged from australopithecus afarensis lucy and intermediate hominid species they may have experienced population pressures that encouraged their territorial expansion also climate changes over the hundreds of thousands of years of early human expansion would have opened up new opportunities and made formerly comfortable areas less habitable both of these led to migration of hominid populations difficulty of movement have you ever gone backpacking for a week and the necessity of intimate knowledge of the local environment slowed human expansion down substantially Human evolution Human Cradle of Humanity Australopithecus afarensis Australopithecine Olduwan Primate Hominidae Paranthropus Single-origin hypothesis Ape Stone Age Origin of language Human extinction Lower Paleolithic Whale History of South Africa Scientific classification Prehistoric Britain Indigenous peoples Created kind Species Extinction Milford H.
