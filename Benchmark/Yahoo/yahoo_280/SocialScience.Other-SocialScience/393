why human being cannot live more than years usually we die at or year old if you believe in god in the bible it said adam died at around year old and eve at around year old cell error in the replication leaves us with a time limit for our life and there are even certain parts of the dna strand that make sure cells age and eventually die when cells create an error in reproduction several things can happen the cell dies the cell is poor and will later be replaced or cancer cancer is cells with errors on extreme overdrive they push out the good cells creating a malignant growth a tumor this tumor can become life threatening if the cancer cells start to leave it then they can spread through the body inciting more cells to go cancerous our cells dna have a limit to how often they can divide and reproduce themselves according to wikipedia http en wikipedia org wiki dna repair senescence an irreversible state in which the cell no longer divides mitosis is a protective response to the shortening of the chromosome ends telomeres the telomeres are long regions of repetitive noncoding dna that cap chromosomes and undergo partial degradation each time a cell undergoes division see hayflick limit these telomeres put a limit on a cell s life when the telomere is reached the cell can no longer reproduce and so it dies lose enough of them and the organism dies scientists are currently working on a way to remove or change those telomeres so they can lengthen the human lifespan otherwise we are limited to years before cumulative damage starts to cause problems we can medically extend the lifespan beyond years but at a cost with things like arthritis organ failure loss of sight and other complications that we know as aging the problem is that the organs can be replaced the skin tightened even hip joints can be replaced with arthritis destroys them but we can t do much to repair or rejuvenate the brain so while the best medical care can get you beyond you will probably be in a wheel chair unable to walk and you will lose some sensation and feeling in your body due to nerve damage alzheimer's may be just such a problem coming out usually it only appears in people who are far beyond the age of after that point evolution is finished with us females lose their ability to reproduce and any changes made in the body after that point will not be carried on to future generations so as far as evolution is concerned you can drop dead at age when mankind started to change their environment to suit themselves they stopped evolving the english language has changed more than the human race has since homo sapiens first started walking around the biggest changes are less hair taller height and thanks mostly to technology an increased lifespan entire species have evolved and changed in a few generations yet modern man is pretty similar to say an ancient egyptian Human Life extension Cell (biology) Chromosome Stem cell Carcinogenesis Prostate cancer Chemotherapy Meiosis Engineered negligible senescence Cell growth Mutation Evolution Mitosis Extinction Stomach cancer Species Y chromosome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cloning Reproduction DNA Gene Apoptosis P53 Virus Traumatic brain injury Puberty Death Nutrition Action potential End of civilization Cephalic disorder Ataxia telangiectasia Lung cancer Aspartame Baldness Gene therapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Biology Life expectancy Barbara McClintock Abortion debate Chlorophyta Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Cryonics Human evolution Tumor Junk DNA Metastasis Equine conformation Mobile phone radiation and health Life Fermi paradox Wound healing phases Neanderthal Stroke DNA replication Evidence of evolution Self-replication Eye Medicine Skin Macroevolution Cell cycle Human skin color Race Francis Crick Dog HIV Multiple sclerosis Pain Human genome Brain tumor Jean-Luc Picard Radiosurgery Cerebellum Myxobolus cerebralis Sexual differentiation Urinary incontinence
