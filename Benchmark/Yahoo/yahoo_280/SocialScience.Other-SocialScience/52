what would you like old age to look like oh i love this question i have such an affection for the senior generation i love these people they are so full of knowledge and common sense they can be funny and i always always learn something from them i want old age to look like the sunset after the sun has blazed through the sky in a mixture of adolescent energy middle age business and bright ideas it sets as in the sunset of our life full of color i want old age to be colorful with the blues of old mistakes that taught lessons of pinks of little grandchildren running through the garden of lavenders of quiet nights with your mate that you still love even though they no longer walk this earth i want each color to blend into the next so that when looked at as a whole is an amazing kaleidoscope of rich hues gentle tones i want everyone younger to look at this rainbow of the color of life and learn and understand that through these people's lives run rich thought deep lived life and memories worth more than the riches of the earth Color Care Bears Milton H.
