would it be better to get rid of income tax and just put an extra or pence on the goods and services we buy if you think about it in the uk we actually pay soo much more than the income tax rate i think the standard rate for income tax is however why doesnt national insurance get included in that because it would make an income tax percentage that would make people revolt so the government cleverly hide all these extra taxes on well everything vat already exists on most of the goods we buy so adding a couple of pence wont work as we already pay pence for each pound of value that we spend on these goods tax is everywhere for example if i earned gross less income tax less national ins less per month council tax then if i was to spend all on vat inclusive goods x so from the total tax deductions would be therefore i feel hard done by out of in this instance i would get taxed now this doesnt take into account airport taxes fuel road tax and any other taxes we pay without realising i think it stinks if the government did it all as one deduction from your monthly wage we would all hit the roof as we would realise how much we have stolen from us when it boils down to it the government charge us for living in this country and charge us for the privilege of letting them run mess up our country why should we be charged for a human right last of all i know this is a sermon i believe that income tax was first introduced into the uk during the penninsula war with napoleon and france at the start of the 's it was a costly war as great britain had to use much of the cavalry of saint george golden guineas to bribe other european countries to keep fighting napoleon as this was expensive coupled with the cost of the army in spain income tax was introduced when the tax was abolished i forget the date someone of note loudly proclaimed that parliament should burn all records of the tax so that no one in the future could ever believe that such a propestorous tax ever existed i think they had the right idea Tax Value added tax Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Flat tax FairTax Gross domestic product United Kingdom corporation tax Income tax Social Security (United States) Compensation of employees National Insurance Publicly funded medicine Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Credit card Measures of national income and output Capitalism Money Gold standard Economy of Russia Progressive tax Great Depression in the United Kingdom Pound sterling Insurance Inflation Hyperinflation Surplus value Economy of the Republic of Ireland Tax deduction Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health insurance Annuity William Pitt the Younger Sales tax Wal-Mart Productive and unproductive labour Euro Bond 401(k) Member of the European Parliament Health savings account Mutual fund Liberal Democrats (UK) Minimum wage Toll road Capital accumulation U.S. public debt Taxation in the United Kingdom Personal finance Deflation (economics) Property tax History of the United States (1789-1849) Hybrid vehicle Economy of France Economy of the United States Income statement Value product Stamp Act Student loan Postage stamp Margaret Thatcher Franco-Prussian War Social Security debate (United States) Supply-side economics Canadian and American economies compared Income Nuclear power phase-out Value added Tariff Economy of Norway Corporation Trickle down effect Airline Sport utility vehicle Government debt Anarchism and capitalism Labour economics Keynesian economics New Model Army Currency Capital gains tax Economic inequality History of the European Union Efficiency wages Fuel tax Warren Buffett Tax haven Operating surplus Kyoto Protocol Commune in France Mortgage Canadian Pacific Railway Napoleon I of France
