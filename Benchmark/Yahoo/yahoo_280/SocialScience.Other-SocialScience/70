to smokers what made you persist first i'm not some radical non smoker who is trying to diss smokers i'm just genuinely curious myself i never did persist with something i didn't initially like i don't eat brussels sprouts for that reason but nobody likes inhaling smoke when they first try it you cough it tastes awful so i've been told my smokers it seems unnatural to be breathing in smoke so why did you stick it out until you started to like it or at least got used to it what motivated you to keep on with something that was at first distasteful to you like i said no judegements on my part just wondering mine started out as something to do just hanging out with my friends i was when i started which ironically i never drank until i was legal so it could have had to do with the bar scene but then i became addicted to the nicotine and let me tell you it can get a very strong hold on you the prospect of not being able to have a cigarette whether it be lack of money or ability to get to the store will drive you mad and make you want it all the more now its not just the addiction i think a lot of mine is also habit for instance if i'm driving i'm smoking however when i suspected i was pregnant with my twins i quit cold turkey and didnt start back until they were about months old wish i had never started back up again by the way noone in my family smoked and kudos for asking about such a controversial issue without being condescending or otherwise insulting to the rest of the people in the forum Tobacco smoking Cigarette The Smoking Room Cigar Bong Tobacco Smoking pipe Cannabis (drug) Hookah Smoking ban Cigarette Smoking Man James Bond Friends Smoking fetishism Nicotine gum Smoking cessation Fitz Hugh Ludlow Mojave people Cocaine Knots Landing Asthma One Piece minor characters Nicotine Addiction Kretek Common cold Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Health issues and the effects of cannabis Spliff Reefer Madness Methamphetamine Anger management EastEnders Lung cancer Daredevil MMORPG Schizophrenia Jack London Midnight Run Breastfeeding Pneumonia Chewing gum Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Cancer of the larynx Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Homer Simpson Cancer Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Drug abuse Illegal drug trade Trailer Park Boys The Shining (film) Alzheimer's disease Dead Like Me Shaggy dog story Waterworld Coffee Drug addiction Liam Gallagher Calvin and Hobbes Kurt Cobain Causality Blonde on Blonde One Tree Hill (TV series) Brian Griffin Tobacco advertising Alcoholics Anonymous Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Drowning Boogie Nights Theodore Kaczynski Snus Coffee and Cigarettes Sherlock Holmes Little Britain The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Prohibition (drugs) Sin City The Marshall Mathers LP The Game (rapper) Red Hot Chili Peppers Kitchen Medical cannabis Bird Suspicion (film) Hikaru no Go Billboard (advertising) FoxTrot Guns N' Roses Atkins Nutritional Approach Opie and Anthony Something Awful Tupac Shakur Jos__ Luis Rodr__guez Zapatero Kender Dawson's Creek
