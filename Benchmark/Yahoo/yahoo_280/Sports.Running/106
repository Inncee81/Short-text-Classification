i have some questions about cross country training i'm years old my mile time is around min or less and i can run miles around the track at min mile how many miles should i run a day to get ready for cross country where should i train for cross country there's no hills around me mostly streets how many days a week should i take off how fast should i be running min mile thanks for your help i would suggest getting in somewhere between five and ten miles in a workout there will be days when you will want to focus on other things and will get in less but look to that as a goal nothing beats just getting out on the road and running unless it is a trail however for hill training you might want to consider going to a local high school and running up and down the football stadium stairs this would be one of those days where you do not get in long distances race up the stairs and use the down as a recovery this will help with uphill climbs but won't do that much for downhill technique i would suggest running five to six days a week i know people who run seven days a week but i never could keep that up for very long i always wanted needed at least one day off however if you are serious about x country you will want to get in the miles and workout at least five days a week for the most part i suggest not worrying about how fast you are running but do make sure you are pushing yourself the initial goal should be to build up your base miles especially during the off season as you get stronger your speed will naturally increase once you get into the season your coach will be working with you to improve however one thing you could do is pick a course three mile five miles what ever and time yourself use that as a base and then as you run do a personal time trial periodically to see if you can improve your time some days you will some days you won't but that can serve as a barometer on how your training is going the other thing about how fast is that it is dependant on your conditioning and natural ability i have no way of telling how fast your really may be but i suspect you have lots of room for improvement my guess is that you can probably work that min mi for three miles down to minutes fairly quickly but again right now pre season just concentrate on base miles good luck Cross-country skiing Toyota Prius Weight training Eventing Norway national football team Carolina Panthers Triathlon Mountain bike Marathon (sport) Drag racing Fell running Paragliding Gliding Cincinnati Bengals San Francisco 49ers Extreme Programming TGV Ben Johnson (athlete) CPU cache Alex Ferguson Baseball Dog agility Auto racing Troms__ I.L.
