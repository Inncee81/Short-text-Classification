when i run i dont get out of breath but my legs ache really bad pleeease help i'm a girl years old stone lbs and foot ' i've started running recently last month a mile once or twice a week since competing in the m i would say i was quite fit and can run a mile in with out stopping when iam jogging for training a jog a mile with some hilly parts i dont get puffed out at all but my legs ache sooo much this really annoys me because i stop because of my legs not because i puffed out any advice to stop my legs from aching lots thanks well here is the problem number one you are used to training for a meter and that is only half of a mile so since you are running mile straight and you only run twice per week you are running half of your distance in one day that is like me running miles straight and i agree my legs do hurt all that i have to say is that distance running is different than running sprints that mile in a year old girl is extremely impressive i have never heard of something so impressive i really do respect that i would recommend slowing it down to a mile though because you are not used to the distance yet and so that is where the runners pace comes in if you are wanting to get to the point where your legs don't hurt start running days a week and when you do run at a slower pace one day a week optional you can run a fast mile if you feel like it make sure you stay hydrated and that you rest saturday and sunday that time is unbelievable year old males usually average that and i commend you for that but you should not run that pace every time because you are not ready for it follow my advice and you will see yourself get comfortable when you do you can increase your pace and that run will be quite easy and you might oneday be running miles don't give up your hopes stay respectful and rest most of all good luck Running Fast bowling Equine conformation Triathlon Horse gait Backstroke Sprint (race) Aerial (dance move) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule The Amazing Race Middle distance track event Seabiscuit 1957 World Series Ben Johnson (athlete) 24 Hours of Le Mans Recumbent bicycle Indianapolis 500 Swimming USS Tunny (SS-282) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 The Contender (television series) Hurdling Iditarod Parade (military) Pain Volleyball Jon Secada Poker jargon Billboard Hot 100 2005 United States Grand Prix Drag racing Zeno's paradoxes Weight training Tour de France Episodes of Lost (Season 1) English cricket team Public transport Fanny Blankers-Koen Front crawl Girls Aloud Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Iliotibial band syndrome Dog agility International League 1925 serum run to Nome Sport rowing American football Piccolo Junior Saga Atomic Kitten Theory of conduct Butterfly stroke Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Journey (band) Fielding (cricket) Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metres Haile Gebrselassie Hurricane Katrina timeline Slow Train Coming Cricket Satchel Paige 2005 Iditarod Norway national football team Rod Stewart Rugby union positions Laws of cricket Boston and Lowell Railroad Horse Breastfeeding Fasting Glossary of climbing terms Baseball Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Battles of Lexington and Concord Paragliding Communication skill Mixed martial arts The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Bethalto, Illinois CPU design Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chair Deflation (economics) Connecticut Michael Watson 800 metres Hebrew calendar Types of bowlers in cricket Mattress Gregorian calendar Heinkel He 112 Captain Thunderbolt Paintball Babe Ruth
