does a degree in business involve shitloads of math or is it all pretty much basic math i know now a days we have technology that does everything what if i wanted to become a finacial advisor what courses might you reccomend me taking to get there and would you reccoment this job then how can i figure out whats for me lol soo hard stressfull yes and no the level of math is pretty high but you are correct that we use technology to do most of that math still you'll be required to understand how to do the math without the technology as an example as a financial advisor you may me asked to calculate loan payments using varying criteria nobody does this by hand anymore it's done in the computer or on a financial calculator but in finance class you will have to learn how the calculator came up with those numbers another example is business stats you'll use software to run your data analysis but you'll still have to learn those formulae yourself as well the math classes you will need to succeed in finance are basic algebra business calc and stats anything else in the world of math is a help a real help is truly learning to use a financial calculator before you need to use it i like the hp c platinum but the hp b or b and the ti baii are more than acceptable for most purposes don't let the math scare you off it's going to be important in business but it's more applied math that has real applications and not so much the theoretical stuff there are plenty of business people that don't do math but sharp math skills make a huge difference Mathematics Calculator Statistics Education in the United States GED Computer W.
