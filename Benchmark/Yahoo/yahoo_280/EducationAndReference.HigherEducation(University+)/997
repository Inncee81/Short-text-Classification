what is a sorority what is a sorority are they good what do they do a sorority is a social group for female college students and alumni there are national sororities with chapters on various college campuses and local sororities with a chapter only on one campus there is a process called rush through which sororities and prospective members choose each other there are membership fees and assorted other costs for those who join belonging to a sorority can be great if you find the right group of women the sorority is a business essentially in that it has officers the chapter organizes social activities for their members and most national sororities and fraternities have an affiliation with a national charity that they do work and fundraising for and will do some other activities with local organizations visit senior centers etc being an officer in a sorority can be a great way to learn leadership skills as with all things there are drawbacks the group you want to join may not choose you there are requirements to participate in activities that may be hard to juggle with your studies there may be personality conflicts within the group something to keep in mind if you join a national sorority and stay with it through the provisional membership period you can quit but you will never be able to join another national sorority basically i would suggest going through rush if you are at all interested in joining but only joining if you find a group that you really feel at home with you will still be able to join later if you get to know the members of one of the groups better and change your mind i did join one late in my freshman year in college and i'm glad that i did however i know its not for everyone so you don't want to make the decision lightly Fraternities and sororities North-American Interfraternity Conference Alpha Phi Alpha Phi Omega Carnegie Mellon University Trinity College (Connecticut) Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology Education in the United States Merrimack College Cornell University Honor society Belmont Abbey College The George Washington University Kettering University University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Hazing Franklin W.
