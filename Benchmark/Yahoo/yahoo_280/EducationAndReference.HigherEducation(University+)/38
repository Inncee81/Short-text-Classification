online computers ed gvsu so i'm wondering if maybe i should take my mandatory computers in education course online it's at gvsu by the way so some of you may know the course it's required for all education majors minors so i have to take it eventually i've been told since its a foundation course it's extremely easy and that it's a waste of time to go to the class but i'm worried if maybe i would have the discipline to take one of these courses also i'm wondering how these courses would work if i have to give a powerpoint would i send it to the professor and what would happen if my laptop randomly died would i just use library computers or should i just take it as a normal class take it as a normal class because if you know how to use facebook this class should be a piece of cake after all if you want to become a teacher you would need to know modern technology besides facebook and myspace i've attached a link to the syllabus for more information Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in the People's Republic of China Facebook (website) Education in Portugal Education IBM PC compatible Secondary education in France Grade (education) Grand Valley State University Dublin City University Librarian Surveillance Education in the United States Managed learning environment Far Eastern University Education in Malaysia Bluetooth Textbook Peer-to-peer Galactic Civilizations Internet Education in Germany PLATO Windows Vista Trinity College, Dublin Northeastern University, Boston Morse Code Computer bus Graduate school Japanese tea ceremony Junior Certificate Ajax (programming) United States Naval Academy Savannah College of Art and Design University at Albany Professor Microsoft Office Open access Stevens Institute of Technology Quantum computer College University of Massachusetts Amherst Distance education Microsoft PowerPoint University of Pennsylvania Law School Andrey Kolmogorov Digital rights management Seminary Education in France Cornell University Cooper Union Windows XP Education in Hong Kong Science Laptop Secondary education in the United States Master's degree Education in Taiwan University of Maryland Baltimore County Florida State University Columbia University Teacher Redundant array of independent disks York University High school E-learning Book CPU cache Brown University Carnegie Mellon University Lyceum of the Philippines University of Central Florida Universal Serial Bus Georgia Southern University File sharing Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Secondary education in Japan Gwinnett University Center PaX Chess United States Postal Service University of Arkansas Copyright infringement of software Artificial neural network Randomness Floppy disk Intelligent design movement Computer-supported collaboration Freenet IB Diploma Programme Hard disk Sant Mat Technology Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet Academic freedom Juris Doctor Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University
