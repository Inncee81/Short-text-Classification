cant get into college im and cant get into college i dont want to waste or years in community college what do i do kill myself what are ge classes and after i take them what sat's act's can i go to a cc and just take ge classes and bounce to a normal college really fast whats the fastest way in with cc or without it prefer without there is nothing wrong with going to a community college first then transferring in fact it's even better sure you're missing out on the typical college experience of meeting new people but that can wait you save a lot of money by going to community college to get some ges out of the way some of those ges at actually universities and colleges are ridiculous so please don't kill yourself and just look at the bright side if you're determined you can easiliy do it in years you know you might end up at a really great school that you thought you had no chance of getting into when you were just out of high school it's not too late edit okay so i saw your additional details and i'm going to try to remember what you asked the sats and acts are standardized tests most colleges in the u s require in addition to seeing your high school grades extracurricular activities etc etc just go to their respective websites basically they're additional components to your college application ge's general education classes these are those mandatory kinds of classes that freshman usually have to get through to then be able to work on classes for their major cc's usually do the job in getting rid of these because taking a huge english lecture class at an actual university could cost a bundle compared to taking a substitute or similar qualifying class at a cc again this is my point it saves you a lot of money you're asking if you can get these classes out of the way then bounce right into college eh not necessarily true you do want to get these out of the way but not in its entirety the main questions you have to ask yourself and the main concerns are figuring out what you want to major in example let's say you want to major in business and want to get into the haas business school at uc berkeley you would have to complete some prerequisite classes for that business major that are equivalent to taking classes had you already gotten yourself into uc berkeley as a freshman do you see my point as for timing and getting into college asap it depends how determined and willing you are to fill up your year cc and then applying most every college has something for transfer students go to the college website you're interested in and you can pretty much figure out exactly what you need to do in order to get into whatever major you wish finally i don't realy think you can skip the cc part and move onto a major university to then earn a bachelor's degree if you want to skip cc you can probably just end up getting an associate degree at least so i'm not sure what kind of college it is you want to head to but transfer students of time come from a cc i hope that helped Education in the United States Graduate school GED Education in Germany SAT Juris Doctor College admissions Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Portugal Law school Community college Medical school Master's degree Lawyer Education in Hong Kong Education in Sweden Associate's degree Grade (education) Professor College Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Quizbowl No Child Left Behind Act CPU cache High school Trinity College, Dublin Fast bowling Student Japanese tea ceremony Extreme Programming Education in Australia Kwantlen University College Alexander Technique Dog agility A-level Students' union California Polytechnic State University United States Naval Academy Secondary education in France Inflation Academia Entropy Affirmative action Explosive material Microeconomics Advanced Placement Program Physician National Certificate of Educational Achievement Compiler optimization Saved by the Bell Computer Economics IB Diploma Programme The Amazing Race Education Chiropractic Single Transferable Vote Normal distribution University of Central Florida Teacher Education in Romania Software engineering Government of France Law of value Appeal Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Education in Canada Standardized testing Georgetown University Education in Malaysia Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Middle Tennessee State University Cricket Lowell High School (San Francisco) Academic degree Test (student assessment) Mach kernel Insurance Paralegal Capital accumulation Poker jargon Secondary education in Japan American and British English differences Education in Japan Central processing unit Product Lifecycle Management Meaning United Kingdom corporation tax Pitaten RISC Prostate cancer Second language acquisition Intelligence quotient Scientology beliefs and practices
