what's the difference between computer science and computer engineering i need to decide my major which one do u recommend computer science computer engineering or computer software engineering but first i've to know the difference among them please help computer engineering and computer software engineering are similar to electronic and electrical engineering and in my opinion are both considerably harder than computer science however i am doing computer software engineering and i wish i was doing computer science instead engineering is so boring the engineering ones will also be much more hadware orientated as opposed to the programming approch computer science takes Software engineering Computer software Computer Computer science Computing Computer-aided design Central processing unit Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Electrical engineering Engineering Embedded system Reverse engineering Computer virus Object-oriented programming Database Numerical analysis Digital circuit Avionics software Computer insecurity Computer program University of Waterloo Redundant array of independent disks UIUC College of Engineering Software componentry Engine Computer programming Library (computer science) Acorn Computers History of computing hardware Scientific computing Atari 8-bit family Mouse (computing) CPU design History of software engineering Design pattern (computer science) Hacker Software testing Source code Computer security Aircraft flight control systems Digital photography ZX Spectrum Statistics National Chiao Tung University Hubble Space Telescope Analytical engine Artificial intelligence Linux Expert system Application software Programming language Eiffel programming language Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer and video games Electrical network W.
