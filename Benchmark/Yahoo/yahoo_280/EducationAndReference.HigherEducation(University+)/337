any college entrance counselors out there hello sorry this is long i'm writing this on behalf of my sister she's starting to apply for colleges and she's afraid she won't get into any she went to an inner city public high school for her th and th grade years i didn't btw she didn't get the best grades and was only involved in one or two clubs for half a year or so after that she couldn't stand to be there anymore and is being homeschooled for the remainder of high school her grades in homeschool are excellent but she isn't very active in the community no job or volunteering experience part of the reason she had so much trouble in high school was because she had depression yes she was diagnosed she had no alternative but homeschool if she attaches an essay explaining basically everything i mentioned here what are her chances of getting into a public university in michigan or in general thanks for any help her gpa is about a or something around there and her act score was either a or a she has anxiety as well and has always choked on standardized tests since she was a kid a teacher told my mom that she should be checked out for that okay her gpa is not too bad but her test scores would have to be brought up by a good points to be more competitive for admission into a state college university if she has been diagnosed with a medical condition then maybe she can qualify to take the act and or the sat as a learning disabled student no disrepect to her just throwing out suggestions i believe that would have to be documented though by a doctor but as i have heard she would either get more time or it would not be timed at all not sure about that though i know her diagnosis was not of a learning disabled nature but maybe she can look into seeing a doctor to determine such a problem let me talk with someone where i work and i will let you know more tomorrow i want to give you current gpa and test score criteria so you have something to go on i just don't have that on me me right now but just keep in mind that community college is still a respectable route to a year university college she will not be denied there no worries i work in admissions at a florida university she could attach a letter stating her past and current situation but i'd like to know what her gpa is also what are her test scores act or sat if i knew that then i could guide her better worst case though she could attend a community college for the first years it's less expensive and you would be taking the same classes there as you would at major college university sometimes community college is better anyway it eases you into the college life best of luck to your sister sounds like she has a pretty good sibling Education in the United States Grade (education) Homeschooling GED SAT Education in Germany Graduate school Medical school Affirmative action Education in the People's Republic of China Bipolar disorder Law school Law School Admissions Test Middle Tennessee State University Prostate cancer National Certificate of Educational Achievement Chiropractic Physician Milton H.
