isn't my professor generous i had such a tough st semester back in college this summer became homeless because of domestic abuse then found my new apartment as a result my performance in school was very poor she gave me a d instead of an f since she knew i tried the hardest i could under the pressure i was under it's like trying to lift weights the more you try to lift the harder it gets i'm making an analogy of lifting weights to handling stress i have been in the teaching profession and sometimes have awarded students with grades based upon their determination and their learning process and not just on the quality that they are able to process this is usaully done with my average students the more effort they put in and the more they learn which maybe is not comparable to those gifted for being geniuses i mean the amount that they learn from the work they put in froms my criteria of grades for them so if you come into my class with less amount of knowledge than some you can still pull your grades up based upon what additional knowledge you could get from doing work in my class even in the end it is not up to the standard of an a grade you will have the chance to get b c and d but from what you say i can say that your professor has made a fair judgement for you and she or he is a good educator Grade (education) Education in the United States Graduate school No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Education in Singapore Education in Germany SAT Experiential education A-level Juris Doctor College admissions Education in Japan College Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Alexander Technique Knife Test (student assessment) Education in Portugal Education in Hong Kong Master's degree Marching band Massachusetts Institute of Technology Weight training Motor oil Professional wrestling holds Law school American University Equine conformation Charter school Gifted Artificial neural network IB Diploma Programme Boston Public ELO rating system Handloading Bulgarian language Competition Judo Education in France Internal ballistics Standardized testing Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Australia Community college Wood Socrates College and university rankings GED Education in Austria Secondary education in France Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Hunter College High School University of Massachusetts Amherst High school The Hidden Curriculum Lawyer Physician Harvard University Shoot boxing Professor Brown University Doctor of Philosophy Public policy Education in Malaysia Diamond Go ranks and ratings Grade inflation Dublin City University Tuition Explosive material Charles William Eliot Education in the Republic of Ireland Extreme Programming Mattress Doomsday argument Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Teacher Dog training Pitaten Homer Goes to College Bologna process Inflation Education in Sweden Method of complements Current teachings of Prem Rawat Secondary education in the United States Martial art Kwantlen University College Professional wrestling throws Finnish language Terminal ballistics Physical education Advanced Placement Program
