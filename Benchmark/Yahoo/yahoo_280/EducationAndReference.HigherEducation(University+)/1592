tiered universities i can name quite a few st tiered schools who can't what about second and third tier i think i hear of a th maybe does some organizations does this classification or it just what colleges called each other is there a list of this i am familiar with us news rankings i didn't know it was based off of that sorry coacht but i am still confused how are the tiers determined again is it based off of that big national university list or something else my university is ranked higher than i thought but from what i hear form other students were are not tiered i am talking about the university of missouri columbia this is based on the ratings of us news and world reports the first and second are really ranked as top in each category and include the top the third tier is next and includes the next the lowest is in fourth tier add in each separate category the schools are ranked this makes the list different for national universities master's universities liberal arts colleges etc each list has a top tier and tier a school could move up or down the tiers simply by changing categories for example a small liberal arts college would not score very high if they were compared to the national universities a national university would score very high on the list of bachelor's comprehensive colleges the thing is each of those lists is different the schools on the separate lists can't be fairly compared to each other because they are different types of schools u mo columbia is on the national universities list that doesn't place them higher than number one on the liberal arts college list those are different types of college it does place them lower than other national universities though top on the national u list is a pretty nice place to be though some schools are so specialty driven that they aren't ranked at all the juliard school is an example http colleges usnews rankingsandreviews com usnews edu college rankings rankindex brief php Education in the United States College and university rankings Grade (education) Harvard University University of Houston University of Michigan ELO rating system Bowl Championship Series College Education in Australia University of Notre Dame University of Washington Affirmative action Student loan Associate's degree Marylhurst University Missouri National Football League Quizbowl University of Pittsburgh College admissions PGA European Tour The College of New Jersey Luther College Rugby union New Trier High School Tulane University University of Arizona University of Tennessee Ivy League California Polytechnic State University The Times Higher Education Supplement Music Bachelor of Arts Ohio Wesleyan University Babson College Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Poker jargon Education in Canada Pennsylvania State University National Certificate of Educational Achievement Law of the People's Republic of China Graduate school University of Central Florida University of Southern California The Internet Movie Database NASDAQ Vanderbilt University University of Chicago Kim Clijsters Liberal Democrats (UK) Illinois Playoff Fox News Scientific classification Education in Taiwan Education in the People's Republic of China Boston College University of California, Irvine High school University of California, Los Angeles Physician The Football League Liberty University Floppy disk University of Szeged Degrees of Oxford University Quicksort Florida Institute of Technology Florida State University National University of Singapore Liberal arts college SAT Military Occupational Specialty Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics District Political divisions of the United States Georgetown University University of Connecticut Classified information Northeastern University, Boston K__ppen climate classification GED Education in the Republic of Ireland University of California, San Diego Swarthmore College University of British Columbia Emerson College Search engine optimization Baylor University Tripartite System University of Miami NEXTEL Cup Juris Doctor Bank PHP
