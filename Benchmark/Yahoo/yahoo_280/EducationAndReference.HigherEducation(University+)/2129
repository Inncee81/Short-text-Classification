how can i improve more to get in to duke i am in newspaper red cross model un tutoring in honors in math english history hope to be in ap when i become a senior math history english sports years of soccer i just started this year but i have a b average would they regect me right off the bat because of the b and i just started junior year would i be accepted i did not take the sat yet please tell me i really want to go there that is my dream university with a b average your chances are going to be really tough even if you blow out the sat and have a near perfect score what you have to realize is that there are times more individuals that equally want to go to duke who have a averages and near perfect sat scores when the pool of candidates is so incredibly full it makes the selection process extremely competitive and those that are chosen are the cream of the crop that does not mean that there is not hope my suggestion to you is to minimize some of the activities do a few but do them well make sure that you have leadership roles in those organizations this will also give you more time to concentrate more heavily on your studies make it a goal to bring that b average up to an a and don't count on using those senior year grades because first round applications are due in the fall of your senior year when most grades have not been posted i also suggest looking at other schools there are great schools out there that would love to have you don't put all of your eggs in one basket this will minimize your disappointment good luck to you and work hard SAT Education in the United States Education in Romania Football (soccer) Education in the People's Republic of China Pittsburgh Steelers Lynbrook High School ELO rating system Education in Taiwan Graduate school Hunter College High School New York Knicks Hopkins School United States House of Representatives College admissions Luther Head Steve Nash Tag A-level Affirmative action Cleveland Browns Batting average Alex Ferguson New York Giants Inflation Tai Chi Chuan English cricket team New York Jets Baseball Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Voting system Baseball Stars Advanced Placement Program Competition Single Transferable Vote New Trier High School West Bromwich Albion F.C.
