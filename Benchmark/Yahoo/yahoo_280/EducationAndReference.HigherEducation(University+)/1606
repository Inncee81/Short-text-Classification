college problem im currently enrolled in stony brook university's pre med program as the school year is approaching i am getting worried that im not going to be able to handle the course load what should i do if i cant do decent in this programmm im getting kind of scared matt the st thing you need to do is think positive if you convince yourself that you will do fine then you in a sense are going to work harder to achieve that since you already picked out your classes for this fall find out what the curriculum outline is going to be and start doing your research on the different courses you will be taking be organized in your approach once your classes begin do not let yourself fall behind on any of the courses you will be taking try not to miss any days of school in math it is vital that you do not do this speak to you school counselor and see if you can lessen your course load find out about free tutoring the school might be offering or study groups be pro active and you will succeed but most important be positive do not let your fears get in the way of accomplishing your goals fear is a negative energy you are sending out to the world and when you send out negative energy you are going to receive the same energy back think to yourself i am going to do great this year i can't wait to school starts the fact that you were accepted and enrolled in a pre med program tells me you are a pretty smart guy and have accomplished quite a bit now we just have to get you to start believing in yourself and start thinking that way you will do fine best of luck Education in the United States Medical school Master's degree Education in Romania Stony Brook University Scientology beliefs and practices Graduate school Education in Australia Affirmative action Education in Taiwan CPU cache University of Central Florida Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Law school Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Education in Portugal Psychoanalysis Community college Gwinnett University Center A-level The Inside __cole Polytechnique Education in Germany Secondary education in Japan Pennsylvania State University Wheaton College, Massachusetts Extreme Programming College University of Houston University of Notre Dame Education in Austria Explosive material University of Pennsylvania Avenue Q York University Dog training Georgia Institute of Technology PLATO University of Michigan Brown University Cooper Union Professor Florida State University Tai Chi Chuan Homeschooling California Polytechnic State University Piccolo Junior Saga Purdue University Montgomery Blair High School Chiropractic One Tree Hill (TV series) University of Texas at San Antonio Transactional analysis Landmark Education Prostate cancer Pittsburgh Steelers Swahili language Jumpstart 3rd Grade Kim Possible Reiki American University SAT Teach the Controversy Object-oriented programming Brooklyn Technical High School Bah__'__ Faith and Education New York Giants Complexity classes P and NP Air Education and Training Command IB Diploma Programme Mach kernel Education in Malaysia Education in Singapore Cornell University Experiential education No Child Left Behind Act Education in Hong Kong Charles William Eliot Tenshinhan Bernard Williams Independence Party (Iceland) A Course In Miracles Education in Sweden University of New England, Maine University of Southern California Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Babson College Milton H.
