bookbag or bookbag and use locker i am going to high school this year we have lockers that we all get but i have heard that in our high school your locker is everyone elses because anyone can break into any ones locker and steel stuff and people do so should i get a backpack and carry it around with me at all times whitch we are alowed to do or should i just empty my stuff into my locker and go to my locker threw out the day and get the stuff i need at that time and risk getting books and stuff stolen or should i keep my back pack with me at times but just drop off my books at my locker when i dont need them because they are heavy and they will most likely hurt my back if i carry them all day any storys you can share or perosnal experience or advice whould be helful thanks noticed i said break in to the lockers there are locks on them people pick them we dont have stacked lockers they are the full body ones i think that you should carry a bookbag and just drop off the books you don't need during breaks just make sure you keep all your valuables with you because most likely if the person sees that you only put books in there they wouldn't want to break into it Changeroom Columbine High School massacre Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Ocean's Twelve The Inside The Shining (film) Sento One Tree Hill (TV series) Teachers (film) Castle of the Winds Sammy Sosa Time Out of Mind Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Professional wrestling attacks Dinghy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Swimming pool Professional wrestling throws The Right Stuff Poker jargon Hiking Sin City Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Caves of Androzani The Dalek Invasion of Earth The Catcher in the Rye Suplex Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers SS Morro Castle Beavis and Butt-head Striker Pack Mercury Atlas 6 Parachuting HMS Electra (H27) RuneScape quests Carrie Equine conformation Full Metal Panic?
