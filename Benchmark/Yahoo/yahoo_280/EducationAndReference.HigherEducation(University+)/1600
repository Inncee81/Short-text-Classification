should i finish my phd i'm getting a phd in english but so i'm sick of this field sick of these classes it feels so useless i am determined to steer clear of academia after i graduate or simply shoot myself in the head so i should leave my program right only dilemma is that i've got just under yrs left in my program and i have no idea what i would pursue instead when people ask me what i would be doing if i had a million dollars i say not a d mn thing what do i do with myself i'm extremely unhappy girl you and i you and me anyways are the in very similar situations first i would say that it first depends on what you want to do was your master's also in english what about your ba i would say that you have it made if your current avatar is an accurate pictorial representation of you i'd have to say that you could absolutely write your own ticket there are not very many african american women with ph ds if you don't want to be a college professor or even teach highschool english i'm wondering what you could do maybe for a magazine or newspaper writing although you could always teach english overseas again i say it all boils down to what you want to do if you continue to feel that it is useless or want to leave academia that's fine even years prior to finish years in a program is a lot of time but then again it's not either that's years that you could be even closer to getting to where you want to go now the part about what you'd do if you had a million dollars i don't know you have to do something everyone has some an interest in something even if it is completely unrelated to what you've been doing in english do you like business or art music maybe you have so many interests you just can't boil it down to one thing maybe you are doing what everyone else says you should do or what you think the job market demands these are reasons to pick a degree but not what will make you happy personally i just graduated months ago with a master's degree in a field i realized i don't want to work in at least not right now i know what i wake up in the morning thinking about and what i feel good doing ba and master's together this is years and k in loans later however i am more convinced that people do better on jobs that they enjoy money talks but i felt so miserable getting up going to work everyday to a place i know i didn't enjoy i didn't even take extreme pride in my job and my performance suffered i was late all the time and at times wasn't very pleasant or tried to go the extra mile sometimes you have to do what you can for the time being but don't be miserable i know of a lady that went all the way in a particular field to complete her ph d and then returned for yet another master's in a field that she knew she wanted to work in if you want to actually talk about it i'd love to email me puntodevista yahoo com best in whatever you decide Graduate school Avenue Q 2000 Australian Grand Prix Master's degree Academia Supply and demand EastEnders The Apprentice 2 Blonde on Blonde Extreme Programming Software engineering Juris Doctor Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Knots Landing Plame affair Education in the United States Pitaten Sant Thakar Singh Anderson Cooper Social rule Time Out of Mind Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Education in Portugal Chinese University of Hong Kong Ranma __ characters Education in Romania The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Professor John Cage Kodocha Columbia University Satchel Paige Microeconomics Doctor of Philosophy Academic degree Jon Secada Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Ethics Highway 61 Revisited Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Phoebe Halliwell Babe Ruth Education in Australia Marilyn Monroe Milton H.
