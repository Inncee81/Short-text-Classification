itt tranfer issue i am currently attending itt and i am in my fourth quarter but am thinking about tranfering to a university but doing research online i found out that itt tech isn't a credited school even though i was told that it was accredit when i first start and if i was to tranfer i could lose some or all my credits i honestly don't think itt tech is the best choice to go what do you think i should do itt is accredited just not by the same organization that accredits the typical college university a regionally accredited university may or may not accept credits in transfer from a school that is not also regionally accredited there is also a level of education training issue at play source of accreditation aside coursework must be equal level to transfer to a year university many courses and programs at technical colleges such as itt or even the local community college are vocational in nature vocational credit will not transfer into an academic program for example truck driver training probably won't transfer to your local year college even if the school you took it at is accredited by the same organization the nature of an aas is very different than an aa the former being an applied technical degree and the latter being a transferable academic degree even when two schools are accredited by the same organization when transferring credit you are likely to lose some hours the credit you offer has to apply exactly to the program at the new school transferring credits is not an automatic right it's the privilige of the receiving school if you're in the th semester now there isn't much you can do but finish the program you're in and then explore options the training and education you get at itt isn't bad it has a place and a purpose and many itt grads have achieved success with that education what you can and should do is find the college you want to attend and seek admission whether they transfer credit or not once admitted you can use alternative methods to validate what you already know most schools have a departmental evaluation option that allows you to take an end of course exam for credit and most will accept clep and dantes examinations for credit so let's say you think you already know all of the material for english at local state university but they don't want to give you credit for your itt class simply take the exam they require for equivalent credit departmental or clep and move on note a technical degree from a technical college is not less of a degree than an academic degree from an academic college they're just different things altogether when looking for a technical employee employers generally prefer the technical degree when looking for a general or management employee they want am academic graduate an aas is not a bad degree and it's a lot more than the average person has which is no college education Education in Australia Education in Portugal Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Associate's degree Law school Master's degree College High school Education in Taiwan Education in Hong Kong Education in Malaysia A-level Physician College admissions Grade (education) Florida Institute of Technology Nurse Medical school Salt Lake Community College University of Central Florida GED School accreditation City and Guilds of London Institute National Certificate of Educational Achievement Professor Franklin W.
