what is the difference post law school between st tier and nd tier schools i am planning on attending law school in california and i am just curious how much of an effect what law school i go to will have on the job im able to find upon graduation if it will be the deciding factor on the pay i recieve and how much harder the st tier law schools are to get accepted into than the others how hard it is to get accepted just goes along a sliding scale the higher the rank the harder to get in the effect after law school also goes on a sliding scale the higher the rank the lower your grades and class rank can be to still have a good shot at a job go to harvard and you can still get a high paying big law job with a c average go to a rd th tier school and you better be in the top if you want a big law job nd tier might let you get away with being in the top pay goes with the job not really what school you go to employers don't normally give differing salaries based on things like what school you went to or what your class rank was any minor variance in compensation will be due to your own negotiation skills College and university rankings Grade (education) Education in the United States Economic inequality Graduate school Education in Australia Education in the People's Republic of China Intelligence quotient Salary cap Principal-agent problem College College admissions Education in Germany Professor Law school Tax Final Fantasy XI Education in Portugal Minor league baseball Education in Romania University of Pennsylvania Law School Working time Contract Secondary education in Japan Inflation Student loan ELO rating system Illegal drug trade Go ranks and ratings Call centre Warrant Officer Steve Jobs Juris Doctor Efficiency wages Appeal Columbia University Education in Japan No Child Left Behind Act Mutual fund Progressive tax 2004-05 NHL lockout Education reform Unemployment Poker jargon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Compensation of employees Taxation in the United States Israeli Arab Boy Scouts of America University of Michigan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus High school Publicly funded medicine Canadian and American health care systems compared Equal Protection Clause FairTax Trade union British Civil Service Inheritance (computer science) Capitalism Tripartite System Knots Landing RuneScape Exploitation Health insurance Harmonica Harvard University White-collar worker Extreme Programming Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Bowl Championship Series Education University of California, Los Angeles MapleStory University of California, Irvine Richard Vigneault Mediation Car handling Gross domestic product Stanford University Price discrimination Warrior (World of Warcraft) 401(k) Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Social class Model minority National Kidney Foundation Singapore United States Army Violin Corporate governance Estoppel African American contemporary issues Floppy disk Lawyer Boston College Life insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Fast bowling
