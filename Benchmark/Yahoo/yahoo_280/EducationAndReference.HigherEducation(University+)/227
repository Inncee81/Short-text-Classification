if you had a choice highschool question this coming school year i will be a senior and this summer i was thinking about changing my classes from anatomy to somthing diffrent and more easier not that anatomy is hard but it is my senior year and i just want it to be stress free so my question is what class would you take that is much easier in place of anatomy what about digital design what did you do in that class was it easy stick with the anatomy high school is going to be stressfull whether you take the hard courses or the easy courses if you cop out and take the easy courses you won't be getting yourself as ready for life after high school copping out becomes too easy a habit push yourself learn all you can now it's harder later get the course in so that you can move on to nursing medicine or whatever you are trying for at the end of the course you'll have a lot more self esteem knowing that you took a good challenge and won than if you knew that you just took the easy path the others around you will also respect the fact that you didn't just take the easy route Alexander Technique Education in Romania Education in the United States Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Tai Chi Chuan Physician IBM PC compatible Education in Germany Extreme Programming Education in Portugal Richard Feynman Secondary education Dog agility Boston Public High school Reiki Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Professor Aikido Socrates Education in Australia Humphrey Bogart Secondary education in France Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Chiropractic History of science GED Charles Darwin's education Duke University School of Medicine Tenshinhan Community college Golf Beatmania IIDX Education Pitaten Scientific method French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Johns Hopkins University The Contender (television series) Secondary education in the United States Jiddu Krishnamurti Tripartite System Strategic management Education in the People's Republic of China Experiential education College Theodicy Yearbook Battle of Gettysburg Procrastination The Adventures of Pete & Pete Nurse Diablo II: Lord of Destruction True Crime: Streets of LA Education in Singapore The Princeton Review Grade (climbing) University of Michigan Education in Taiwan MP3 Electronic amplifier Smith College Pump It Up Advanced Placement Program Hunter College High School Identity and change Education in Malaysia Carpal tunnel syndrome Fast bowling Tag Jade Empire Spanish verbs Milton H.
