what do you think of online college degrees i am thinking about continuing education online i want to get my bachelor's degree in nursing of course they sound fairly easy to deal with does anyone who has done this have advice i am an lvn now and want to continue there aren't a lot of online choices for a bachelor's degree in nursing from start to finish the challenge is that you have to do a lot of hours in a nursing program in clinical settings and there's just no easy way to do that online that said there are some very good online programs for people who are already rn or even lpn from diploma and associates programs who want to progress to the bachelor's level there are also some very good master's level programs these require that you already have some level of certification and that you have a place to practice your skills ie you work in a patient care setting if you pick a regionally accredited school and in nursing you'll also need professional accreditation then you'll find that online coursework is actually harder than the in the class counterpart the online class only changes the venue and not the material covered nursing is one of those things that is best learned most often in the practical lab environment make sure the school you're looking at is accredited regionally and professional and that your state will accept a degree from that school as eligibility to take the nursing exams before you spend any time or money Juris Doctor Education in Australia Graduate school General practitioner Education in Portugal Physician Architect Community college Education in Hong Kong Paralegal Medical school Chinese University of Hong Kong Lawyer Teacher Athabasca University Midwifery Chiropractic Bachelor of Arts Law school Medicine Nursing No Child Left Behind Act Memorial University of Newfoundland Master's degree University of Central Florida University of Phoenix School accreditation Software engineering College Education in Germany Nurse anesthetist Dentistry Pharmacist Medical Assistant Dublin City University Associate's degree University of Houston Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Finland Academic degree Education in Malaysia Medical University of South Carolina Bachelor of Laws Australian Qualifications Framework Florida Institute of Technology Far Eastern University Homeschooling Florida State University Cooper Union Education in Canada Education in Romania Indiana State University Georgetown University City and Guilds of London Institute Electrical engineering Master of Business Administration Irish dance Education in the Republic of Ireland IB Diploma Programme Profession Athletic trainer Northeastern University, Boston Pennsylvania State University Mapua Institute of Technology University of San Francisco Emerson College Music therapy Education in Taiwan Civil engineering Education in Sweden The College of New Jersey Podiatrist Distance education Certified Nursing Assistant College admissions Doctorate A-level UCAS Reiki Temple University Quizbowl National Health Service Junior Certificate Master of Laws Cancer Barrister Anesthesia Test (student assessment) Experiential education Diablo II: Lord of Destruction
