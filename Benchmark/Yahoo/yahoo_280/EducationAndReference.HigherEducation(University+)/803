do you think an online phd or doctorate is acceptable do you think an online phd or doctorate is acceptable i have a friend looking into capella university for a phd in an it security field i personally do not like online degrees exspecially from a for profit institution i am wondering if you teach or have earned a phd from such a university institute what your experiences are i know many phd's who teach at university's who have told me they would never accept an online doctorate to teach regardless of the university i also know that my company will never hire anyone with a degree from a for profit institution unless there is a highly desired reason to because of their acceptance policy and the overall quality of the previous students we have hired i do not mean to offend anyone i am looking for insight and experience you have had thanks at the masters and even more so at the phd level the reputation of your program within your field is vitally important to your ability to get a job in that field it pays to go to the best reputed program that you can and most of those online programs are not at all respected worse he's considering capella oy honestly that's not going to help his career in fact it may hurt as many employers refuse to look at resumes from schools like u phoenix capella devry itt strayer aiu etc at least if he must go online he should consider doing an online degree from a school with a good rep for it's offline programs that said the it industry is one of the few that do have some respect by some employers for some of the high level online programs but capella isn't one of those programs instead if he can't attend a good school in person he should consider the following online programs which are at well respected universities carnegie mellon rensselaer polytechnic penn state u maryland u mass amherst u illinois champaign urbana u idaho u nebraska northeastern university boston university and still he'd do better going to a program in person even from the list i gave if he must go online i'd probably only seriously recommend that he look at carnegie mellon which offers one of the top programs in his field in the us maybe bu Graduate school Doctor of Philosophy Education in the United States Education in Portugal Academia Education in Australia Professor Master's degree Systems engineering Juris Doctor Doctorate Software engineering Education in the People's Republic of China University of Chicago Institute of technology Florida State University Community college Affirmative action Fight song Medical school Education in Malaysia Tianjin University Lawyer Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Physician Columbia University NHH Economics Ross School of Business Academic degree University of Notre Dame Outsourcing Management information system Amtrak Education in Singapore College Apprenticeship University of Massachusetts Amherst Librarian Texas Woman's University Master of Business Administration Cooperative education University of Ottawa Corporate governance Warren Buffett Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Education in Finland Alpha Epsilon Pi Andrew Carnegie Paralegal Tufts University No Child Left Behind Act Chinese University of Hong Kong Champaign, Illinois University of Michigan Theory of conduct University of Bristol Cass Business School, London Inflation Tufts University School of Medicine and Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences University of Pennsylvania Culture of the United States Georgetown University Economic inequality Intelligent design movement Education in France Lambda Chi Alpha Arizona State University Johns Hopkins University Florida A&M University City and Guilds of London Institute University of Santo Tomas San Diego State University Stanford University Social network Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area Washington University in St. Louis Insurance University of Toronto Virginia Commonwealth University California Institute of Technology University of Houston Cornell University Education California State University Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Allegheny County, Pennsylvania
