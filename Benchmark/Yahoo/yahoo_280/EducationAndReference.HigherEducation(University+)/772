i want to study spanish in colege would it be a good idea to go to a spanish speaking country for college it may be cheaper and a better experience going to college in another country may have cheaper tuition however there are many other expenses to consider for example travel costs especially if you want to return home for holidays and typically student visas prohibit students from working if you attended school in the us you would be able to work part time to help offset expenses also you would lose out on some financial aid by not attending a us school one option you may want to consider is a semester abroad most colleges offer study abroad programs or have sister colleges in other countries i would suggest investigating these options at your local colleges the typical program includes housing and visa fees your tuition will cover the cost of the classes at the other college that means that your financial aid including federal grants will help pay for it it can be a great learning experience good luck Education in the United States Student loan Tuition Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Credit card Visa (document) College Kwantlen University College American University Study abroad Community college Education in Australia Law school Students' union Lawyer Brigham Young University Brown University Price discrimination Education in Taiwan Scholarship Education in Hong Kong Juris Doctor College admissions Gettysburg College Affirmative action University of New England, Maine Medical school Pitzer College University of Rochester Financial aid Public education Food and Drug Administration H-1B visa Education in Romania Mutual fund Queen's University Dalhousie Student Union Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Academic term Education in Japan Culture of the United States North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Immigration to the United States Georgetown University Berea College School choice The College of New Jersey Walt Disney World College Program Life insurance Education in Malaysia Miami University University of Michigan No Child Left Behind Act Private school Hampshire College __cole Polytechnique Education in Albania Yeshiva Pennsylvania State University Academia Princeton University Subsidy Education in England Independent school (UK) Education in France Homeschooling Virginia Military Institute Insurance Caulfield Grammar School GED Publicly funded medicine Grove City College Kalamazoo College Voluntary Student Unionism Indiana University Bloomington Professor Emerson College Eton College Education in Portugal Canadian and American health care systems compared Salt Lake Community College Passport University of Toronto University of King's College California Polytechnic State University High school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Member of the European Parliament Franklin W.
