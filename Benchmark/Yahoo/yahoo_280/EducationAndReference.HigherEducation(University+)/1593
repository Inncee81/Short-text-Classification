what's the first year of college like i'm about to start college in a couple of weeks and i'm really excited but i'm also very scared because i don't know what to expect any advice you could give me or a heads up on being a freshman i've been new to college twice once when i was and again when i turned at a really big university it seems daunting but you'll get through it first be prepared make sure you bring all of your paperwork and identification with you keep it organized in a folder according to what it is bring a back pack or other type of bag that will make carrying things easier make sure the bag is sort of big not huge but big enough for a lot of stuff especially if you haven't picked your classes yet or bought your books make sure you bring something to eat and drink with you depending on where you go to school you might be in a lot of lines for a very long time second get a map of your school figure out where the main buildings are registration is a big one financial aid is another as well as the college bookstore you'll be in and out of these buildings a lot third if you're going to be going to a dorm or student housing somewhere come prepared bring all of the normal stuff bedding pillows shampoo etc but also bring at least a few dishes and a pan or two you'll want to be able to cook something once in a while so be prepared to have those things a coffee mug or a few cups and glasses wouldn't be bad either bring a crate to store them in so you don't have to have them falling all over the place in case there aren't any storage facilities available in your room also bring a few locks skinny ones and thick ones at least one of each you'll want to lock up your valuable stuff theft on campus can be a big problem sometimes third before your classes begin make sure you know exactly where they are as well as where the room is you'll need makes a better first impression if you're on time for your first class it's not a big tragedy if you're not but its cool if you can do it and less frustrating fourth bring extra cash with you first week of classes seems overwhelming and rough but to make it easier make sure you have cash for the small things that you'll need food drink transportation fees for id's if not included in tuition extras professors might want you to get or just some fun money so you can go to a movie or go out to enjoy yourself after you've gotten through the first few days fifth even though it's college don't plan on doing any partying for the first two weeks get used to things first get into the swing of classes there are a lot of ways that you have more freedom in college but they also expect a bit more from you too don't use up all of your leniency from your professors before you have an idea how hard or easy it will be most of all don't let all of this or anything you experience once you get there daunt or overwhelm you if you get in trouble find your advisor and let them know what's going on if you need help or understanding from a professor tell the truth on what's going on and they'll most likely understand if the professor gives you a hard time then if it is still early in the semester you can drop that class and find a professor that's a bit more understanding make sure to always keep up your number of hours if you drop below full time hours usually then you'll jeopardize your financial aid if you get any because they won't give you as much or any the following term if you do find you have to drop a class and that it will drop you below full time hours then do so on the last day of allowed drops and this should safeguard your money anyway don't worry too much lots of freshman before you went through the same thing and survived like i said it seems overwhelming at first but it's really not big deal a hassle during the first week but no big deal btw wear comfortable shoes the first day good luck Social rule Japanese tea ceremony Equine conformation Fast bowling Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Student loan Theory of conduct Dairy Princeton University Georgia Institute of Technology RuneScape quests Brown University Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Education in Germany Reed College Franklin W.
