full time college student and working i am entering my sophmore year and had one small campus job my first year currently over the summer and a little of the last semester i've worked at a campus health position i was wondering if there are any jobs that might be best for a college kid to do there are a lot of prepare home mailings and be a millionaire scams out there so i'm looking for something that might be at my own pace however not be super stressful or time consuming i am a huge financial worrier and am just trying to find stuff that pays well for college kids and can work around our hours it seems that if you live off campus student loans goign to tuition costs and your parents aren't well off that you sort of get bogged down by the cost of living and school yet to make good money you need to go to school i have a small scholarship as well thank god and i certainly don't waste money on stupi dthings i e games cds car upgrades thanks all for your help sorry its long and confusing i know what you mean about the cost of living i ended up going to community college for two years before transferring to a major university to help cope with the costs living off campus can be very difficult which is why i will be buried in student loan debts after i graduate but i've made my peace with that helps that i'm going into a career that will make me money right way nursing i'm entering my junior year of college and my first year at a major university so the tuition and books cost hike is killing me i paid for all my tuition books living expenses et al on my own before this but then i was going to community college and able to work full time now i'm going to a major university and starting the upper division nursing classes with a course load that makes working even part time impossible so i'm relying on a little bit of help from my parents and i mean little and a rather large student loan thank god i can use the leftover money after tuition is taken out for books rent utilities gas etc before i took classes that fit around my work schedule so if you can design your own schedule this is great but not all schools let you do this so you have to make your work fit around school i fortunatley have a emt license and was able to work plenty to pay for everything the nice thing about working for an ambulance company is that it runs so finding times to work when i wasn't in class isn't that difficult i just talked with my employer about my school schedule and desire to keep working and he was very willing to work with me and my schedule most employers are when you start applying places just be upfront about being a full time student and what your school schedule is and you'll find that most places are pretty flexible about that sort of thing not all but most places campus jobs are great for this although they aren't always the best paying you could try waiting it isn't for everyone but the job pays well and most places are pretty flexible about schedules i'd stay away from anything in the mall since those tend to be minimum wage positions and they aren't always flexible since they can easily find someone to fit their needs high school kids are always hanging around the mall looking for jobs check with your financial aid department to see if they have any good work study jobs and keep applying for scholarships good luck i hope things work out well for you Graduate school Student loan Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Tuition Scholarship Credit card Community college Microeconomics Education in Australia Kwantlen University College Franklin W.
