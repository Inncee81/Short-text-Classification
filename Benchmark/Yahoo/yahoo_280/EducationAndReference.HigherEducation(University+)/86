did anyone goto school on line i am just curious because i am a house wife and i have an associates degree however i will like to get my bachelors degree and someone suggested that i goto school on line because i do not have the time to go to the university personally i am planning on returning to work but i want to have my ba degree please let me know how it works is it hard to get your degree this way or is it better to goto the school thank you for responding regarding the naysayers one of my degrees i have several is from a distance learning program it was more than sufficient to get me accepted to a nationally ranked mba program in which i'm performing at it's been sufficient to improve my employment level far beyond the local burger king and other fast foods though fast food is one of the industries i own stock in i'm going to jump out here and say categorically and point blank people who say that employers and grad schools don't respect degrees from distance programs know not of what they speak ie they're being ignorant the facts speak differently in fact there are a couple industries where a degree from an online program is considered better than one from a traditional program this isn't any longer the finest schools in the us and abroad offer wholly online degree programs this includes the likes of harvard university umass boston u u london fl state uc it can go on in fact most public universities offer courses online and very many offer whole degrees it's the way things are going to be and the traditionalists can either embrace it and take advantage or cling to the old ways and fall behind the primary consideration is the choice of school good name recognition helps if you live in indiana and do your online degree through the university of indiana you have some name recognition advantage accreditation is essential regional accreditation is the higher standard and what you should insist on this is an essential consideration cost is a factor for most i've taken courses online for as little as per course and as much as per course so how does an online course work for the most part it works exactly like an in the seat course except you don't go to a classroom you get a syllabus and a list of assignments it may include video lectures or may not it will include a lot of reading and assignments it will likely include peer discussion in the form of online forums or message boards in legitimate programs you will be graded exactly like people in the seat are graded but there will probably be more assignments to complete than the in the seat people have to do expect to write papers instead of taking multiple guess tests for your evaluations doing coursework online isn't easier than traditional but the outcome is the same or better ashill swan there is also empirical evidence that employers do not regard a distance education as less than a traditional one adams defleur bourne regional accreditation is the key to acceptance a traditional presence also helps ie the school also offers in the seat degrees remember that those heavily advertised for profit schools are not the only options out there your state university may even have an online bachelor's degree program very many do now those who demean distance and online education are simply stuck in a system that has now outlived it's usefulness it's interesting that many who say online education sucks have completed no advanced education themselves online or otherwise it's not unlike the way many retailers in the late s said that people just won't shop online they were wrong
