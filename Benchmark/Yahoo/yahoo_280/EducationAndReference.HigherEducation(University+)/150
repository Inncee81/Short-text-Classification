what do you think is the best liberal arts degree and why hich do you think provides more career opportunities i'm not exactly sure what you mean by liberal arts degree i go to a liberal arts university and we have between and different degree programs but if you're asking with program is the best i'm going to be biased and say psychology or women's and gender studies i'm a double major hehehe in all seriousness though just about any degree from a liberal arts college is great because as a liberal arts student you have to take a variety of classes outside of your chosen major s or minor s this makes you a more well rounded person and makes you more appealing to some employers Drew University Master's degree Sonoma State University The College of New Jersey Smith College Affirmative action Otterbein College Chinese University of Hong Kong Bachelor of Arts Bates College Seneca College University of Maryland Baltimore County Georgetown University Northeastern University, Boston University of Central Florida University of Connecticut Wesleyan University Florida Institute of Technology Harvard Division of Continuing Education Oregon State University California Polytechnic State University Trinity University (Washington, DC) Heidelberg College Liberal arts college Trinity College (Connecticut) Haverford College Hartwick College Bryn Mawr College University of Judaism Associate's degree University of Hawaii at Manoa Columbia University Tufts University Pitzer College Furman University American University Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences Trinity College, Dublin University of Pennsylvania University of Michigan The Catholic University of America Gettysburg College Augsburg College University of Toronto Baldwin-Wallace College University of Maryland, College Park Centre College California Baptist University Degrees of Oxford University Washington University in St. Louis Academic degree Brown University Western Kentucky University Lawrence University Duke University College Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences Florida State University Liberal arts Christian Brothers University Education in the United States University of New England, Maine Niagara University Emerson College Education in Taiwan Gender identity Agnes Scott College Rutgers College University of Alabama Cooper Union Five Colleges of Ohio Wheaton College, Massachusetts Juris Doctor Lawyer Jewish studies Bowdoin College Homeschooling Sexual orientation Truman State University California State University, Long Beach Columbia College of Columbia University Connecticut College Doctorate Caldwell College University of Texas at San Antonio Grand Valley State University Education in the People's Republic of China Philadelphia University Virginia Commonwealth University Feminism Homophobia Dallas Baptist University Tulane University Claremont McKenna College Simon Fraser University Pennsylvania State University Birmingham-Southern College College of Notre Dame of Maryland University of North Carolina at Charlotte Bachelor's degree
