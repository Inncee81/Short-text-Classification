is it possible to do well in biomed science at uni even though you never took chem or physics in school i was just wondering whether it's possible to study biomedical science and do well having never taken chemistry or physics while still in school do you learn chemistry from scratch at university studying biomed science or do you have to know the basics which is taught in school even if you did take those subjects in high school you would have to take them over in college for those who did take them previously the college level courses wouldn't be quite as hard having never taken them you will have to study diligently it all comes down to you your study habits and your self discipline and whether you have the brainpower to handle it Health science Science Australian National University Doctorate Education in Singapore Johns Hopkins University Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Advanced Placement Program Chemistry Education in Taiwan National Autonomous University of Mexico Medicine University of Coimbra Computer science Education in Hong Kong Stevens Institute of Technology Dublin City University Physician Ecology High school Education in Portugal History of science Education in Australia Graduate school University of British Columbia Grand Valley State University Education in Japan Biomedical engineering Medical school Tianjin University University of Queensland Columbia University Gymnasium (Denmark) York University Physics IB Diploma Programme Chinese University of Hong Kong Electrical engineering College Linus Pauling Education in Germany Flinders University University of Notre Dame ITESM A-level Social sciences SAT Uppsala University University of Connecticut Statistics University of S__o Paulo Massachusetts Institute of Technology Physical therapy Community college Juris Doctor Education Victoria Junior College University of Central Florida University of Canterbury Tufts University Smith College University of Bradford Tufts University School of Medicine and Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences Kingston University Florida State University Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Seneca College Technion American University University of Strathclyde Texas Wesleyan University Pennsylvania State University Ohio State University University of Aarhus University of Victoria University of Houston University of M__nster University at Albany The College of New Jersey Far Eastern University Furman University Drexel University Degrees of Oxford University University of Michigan Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences Florida Institute of Technology Nanyang Technological University Jewish studies GED Portland State University Cornell University College of Engineering Secondary education in Japan Open access Master's degree Biology Nanjing University Warsaw University University of California, Riverside
