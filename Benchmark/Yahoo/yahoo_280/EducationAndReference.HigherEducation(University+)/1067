i am really worried and confused i'm studying chemical engineering and i'm about to start my third year i know this isn't what i really want i don't like the curriculum and i know it doesn't satisfy me i've been to my counselor a million times and the only thing she says is you should wait until you take courses that are really chemical engineering courses the problem is that i can't waste more time and money until i take those classes because i need to make a decision now i can't wait any longer i know i'm a little late for this but i'm thinking in switching majors i thought about switching to a bachelor's degree in chemistry but i don't know if it's the right thing i don't really know what to study i'm really confused and worried because i'm supposed to have pretty clear what i want to do instead of having all these doubts in my mind can someone help me please serious answers only yeah it's great to not be confused about what to study and to be very clear about it instead but that wasn't the reality for many people who went through college including myself it's really confusing and worrisome but it's okay if you stress about it too much you might end up making the wrong decision out of desperation the difficult thing about this is that you're the only one who can really figure out what makes you happy so how about you write down a list of fields you think you're interested in majoring in then google what can i do with a chemistry math statistics english etc degree since chemistry is what you're considering right now here's the one for chemistry http www google com search hl en q what can i do with a chemistry degree f take the jobs that sound interesting to you and go to the bureau of labor statistics' occupational handbook it's here http www bls gov oco type a position into the search box on the top right hand corner it'll give you great information about the career including job growth salary training and qualifications if you're not sure about chemistry and need help digging into yourself in order to figure out what might make you happy you might want to try one of these books i could do anything if i only knew what it was by barbara sher http www amazon com could anything only knew what dp author's website http www barbarasher com icoulddo htm what color is your parachute for teens http www amazon com what color your parachute teens dp ref pd sim b ie utf qid sr at the end of the day you have to do what makes you happy don't choose a major just because it'll let you graduate on time as tempting as that is extra classes and graduating later than you'd planned for is much better mentally and financially than future career unhappiness Education in the United States Software engineering Unemployment 2000 Australian Grand Prix Education in Portugal Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Infantilism World Wide Web Graduate school Lawyer Chinese University of Hong Kong Massachusetts Institute of Technology Microeconomics Jon Secada EastEnders Theory of conduct Economics Physician Gross domestic product The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Master's degree Francis Crick Stevens Institute of Technology Electrical engineering Operation Market Garden Nurse Goodness and value theory Cooper Union Florida Institute of Technology Education in Taiwan The Apprentice 2 The Skeptical Environmentalist Teacher Shaggy dog story Domain Name System Babe Ruth Economy of Colombia Academia School counselor Milton H.
