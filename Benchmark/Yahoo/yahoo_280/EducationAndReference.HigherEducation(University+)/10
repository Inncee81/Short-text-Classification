can someone explain to me why some colleges have different criteria for entry based on race someone in a question i answered earlier stated that at some schools the criteria is lowered for minorities as opposed to whites i'm black and i think it's totally unfair to have different critera is this sort of reverse discrimination true yes it is true in some unversities that there is somewhat different criteria for the blacks i don't ever think a black that was completly unqualified to attend a certain university would get accepted there but the whites and other groups would have to have somewhat higher credentials than the blacks to get in in some instances colleges call it diversity they are trying to make sure that the in coming class has a variety of voices from all ethnic backgrounds since blacks in general have poorer quality of education than the whites have since their sat scores on average are lower than whites' are and in general some of the high schools they attend aren't great they can get by with having not as good credentials as whites and asians and some other ethnic groups the colleges accept the blacks with less credentials because they need multiple perspectives of life and issues these get discussed in the classroom therefore people of all backgrounds can consider other people's opinions regardless of issues like race since all the people are together on one campus and they learn more because of the many different perspectives that's diversity i feel i cannot really say much about my opinion without saying something that would offend someone i do think it is annoying that black people end up getting better financial aid scholarship deals than people of other races do i knew two african american students who got full rides to college and another one who got all but about per year paid for at a very expensive private college most of this was through merit scholarship aid that other ethnic groups cannot get as the scholarships were designated for minority students it upset me because those three people were already middle to upper class americans why should they get to pay very little to go to college while the rest of us have to get in debt or pay lots to go to college why cannot those who give out scholarships just give scholarships based on economic status alone or merit alone i also cannot stand it when blacks can get into better colleges than the rest of us when they do actually get to attend good high schools at that point the playing field has sort of been leveled between blacks and otherpeople so i don't think blacks should get any special consideration for their minority status at that point but they still do in the name of diversity basically affirmative action would be great if it helped only the underprivleged but it helps those who are as privleged as the rest of us get an advantage as well those people don't really need that advantage so affirmative action in this country is flawed Education in the United States College admissions Education in Portugal Education in the People's Republic of China SAT Student loan Race and intelligence Graduate school Education in Romania Model minority Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Equal Protection Clause GED Discrimination Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Bumiputra College Economic inequality Democracy Racism African American American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Education in Japan Theory of conduct Intelligent design movement Education in India Academia Education in Malaysia Tuition Quizbowl Numerus clausus Education in Germany White (people) Appeal High school Debate Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Homeschooling Plame affair African American contemporary issues Education in Australia Scholarship Franklin W.
