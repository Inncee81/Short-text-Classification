ways to prevent book theft i'm the lead tutor in the esl language lab at a community college using grant funds we have assembled a mini library of paperback fiction at different reading levels for our students who are learning english as a second language over the last couple of years since this miniature lending library was created the collection has diminished as a result of checked out books not being returned but also from books simply walking off without being checked out in the first place we do not have the funding to implement any electronic methods of preventing book theft however we are racking our brains to develop a simple system to accomplish this there are more costly books we would love to order but i'm not about to do it until i have an effective way to keep them from being taken we don't want to treat our students like criminals nor do we want to make the system so obnoxious as to discourage students from borrowing and reading the books in the collection of course the college has its own library in fact we share the library of the university whose campus we're on that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about a small special collection paperbacks located in two bookcases in the esl language lab these have been purchased with either grant funds or out of the teachers' own pockets fancyname thanks for the suggestions but perhaps you didn't read the question carefully these books are paperback fiction children's and ya novels which believe me the university library does not have why would they moreover there's no point in sending these guys to a vast university library these students have very limited english at this point in their lives there is nothing in the academic library that they can read yet as they're still learning most of them are refugees like i said we're an esl program can you put them in an office or behind the lab desk on a rolling rack that way they can be given to students to look at and also monitored against theft photocopy the college id for each check out and maintain in a binder just like the old days in a library place a notice inside each book that students are resposible for returning the book and getting their photocopied id page removed from the binder be sure that unreturned nooks place a hold on their account like overdue library books and parking tickets also ask your campus library if they have any suggestions or out of date equipment that you might have Library Surveillance Public domain Book Lisp programming language Librarian English as an additional language College Education in the United States C programming language Objective-C Visual Basic Ohio Wesleyan University Credit card Plame affair Murdoch University Cornell University Graduate school Computer virus Seneca College Computer Information Technology Infrastructure Library PLATO C plus plus University of Maryland, College Park Homeschooling Boston College No Child Left Behind Act Buffer overflow Dublin City University The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Octopus card Emerson College Bridgewater State College University of Michigan Chinese University of Hong Kong CPU cache Microeconomics Identity theft Johns Hopkins University Language education Duke University San Jos__ State University Theory of conduct University of California Education in Japan Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Education in Hong Kong Multilingual Far Eastern University Article One of the United States Constitution Tax Object-oriented programming American University The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy PostScript Texas A&M University Annuity PHP Franklin W.
