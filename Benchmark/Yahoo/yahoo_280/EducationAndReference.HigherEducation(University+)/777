what should i put in my college essay well i disagree with puttin all the already known information such as ur age and and all dat information they already were informed of on your application the schools you are applying to are getting a whole bunch of people with the same credentials as you the essay is your chance to stand out from all of them if the essay topic is given to you then try to answer it the best you can while always making sure your not straying away from the topic but just put ur personal touch on the essay so dat it doesn't sound typical and therefore you stand out and the folks at admissions can see who you are past the grades if you have the to choose your own topic make it about something that has meaning to you but also something that you can write about that satisfies the word count requirement well hope that works since i know how hard it was to start my own essays if you have any more questions feel free to contact me SAT GED College admissions Education in the United States IB Diploma Programme Graduate school Grade (education) Law school Essay Singlish Education in Portugal Graduate Record Examination Social rule Sexual orientation Economics Education Theory of conduct A-level Bayes' theorem Subjunctive mood Tag David Hume Education in Romania Education in Japan Psychology Literature Family name Philosophy of language UCAS National Certificate of Educational Achievement Sound effect Law School Admissions Test Test (student assessment) High school Deconstruction Photography Quizbowl Software engineering Past teachings of Prem Rawat Mathematics Juris Doctor Catechism Education in the People's Republic of China Linux Infant baptism You Don't Know Jack English grammar Numerus clausus Jewish principles of faith Volleyball Enterprise content management Goodness and value theory The Origin of Species Aikido Objectivist philosophy Cryptography Probability Scientology beliefs and practices Free will Jazz Shit Simone Weil United States Academic Decathlon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chiropractic Condom __cole Polytechnique Proto-Indo-European language Philosophy of mathematics Baseball Science Affirmative action Contract College Domain Name System Patent Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Bernard Williams Miranda warning Medical College Admission Test Time Out of Mind Logic The nature of God in Western theology G__del's incompleteness theorem Randomness GNU General Public License Holocaust denial Computer Donald Davidson (philosopher) Single Transferable Vote Torture Canadian House of Commons Classified information Glossary of partner dance terms Education in Sweden Philosophy Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Ethics Jizya
