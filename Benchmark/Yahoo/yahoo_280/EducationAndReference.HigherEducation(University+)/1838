i'm interested in pursuing a nursing degree at a community college but i just got my ged i was wondering if i can just apply for a nursing program at a community college or is there like some sort of a course or something i should take before applying i know that there are some prerequisites you should take before the nursing course but do you take them before applying or after my question is not so clear is it check with the community college to see what their admission requirements are most likely once you're admitted to the nursing degree program you'll be required to take general education requirements like english composition math history sciences biology chemistry physiology and anatomy and social sciences check with an adviser at the community college for more degree requirements if the admission requirements for the nursing program are prerequisite courses see if you can apply as a liberal arts or an unclassified student best wishes on your studies and i commend you on desire to become a nurse nurses are special people Graduate school Education in Portugal Chinese University of Hong Kong Nurse Physical therapy Community college GED Juris Doctor Physician Advanced Placement Program College Medicine Seneca College UCAS SAT Georgetown University University of Pennsylvania Bachelor of Arts Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Hong Kong Johns Hopkins University University of Alabama Middle Tennessee State University Chiropractic University of Connecticut Lawyer Medical school Doctorate Athabasca University Texas Woman's University A-level University of California, San Diego University of Central Florida Education in Taiwan Education in Singapore Education in Romania Cooper Union American University IB Diploma Programme Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Kwantlen University College University of Victoria Trinity College, Dublin Grand Valley State University Education in Australia University of Maryland Baltimore County Birmingham-Southern College Paralegal Homeschooling University of Cambridge University of Hong Kong Stuyvesant High School City and Guilds of London Institute Classified information Northeastern University, Boston Education in Sweden Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences Gymnasium (Denmark) Far Eastern University Doctor of Philosophy Ball State University Hartwick College Pitzer College Law school University of Queensland Niagara University Cornell University Bilkent University Marist College The College of New Jersey Education in Malaysia Sonoma State University Medical College Calcutta Franklin W.
