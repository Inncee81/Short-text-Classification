is is possible to get accepted into a really great university if i slacked off and skipped in freshman year ok im years old its summer and im about to start th grade in about a month or so freshman year wasnt so good i blew it slacked off and skipped alot i still didnt get anything lower than a c though so i got a g p a unweighted and a g p a weighted really bad for me this year im really gonna step my game up no skipping doing my homework and working my a off im planning to take online courses for a couple of extra classes i was wondering if this with boost my g p a can i raise my g p a by earning about maybe more additional credits if possible how many credits do i need for my final g p a for college i was even thinking of taking an advanced placement course in computer science if i choose to do algebra how will this help also if i end up with great or execellent results even do community service and join a few clubs will my attendence record blow my chance of making it into a idealistic college maybe like university of miami or better to tell you the truth i don't think there should be anything on your transcript related to attendance i've seen my transcript and it says nothing about how many classes i didn't go to or anything like that i think what would really help you is to step it up like you said and dedicate your last three years to getting good grades so that potential colleges can see that you really are capable of studying and doing good as long as you pick up your act then i don't think it will be that hard to raise your g p a as far as the extra courses the community service and clubs i'd advice the last two options instead of the online courses just so that you can actually have some fun and time to yourself just stop being a slacker and you'll do fine i mean that in a good way Advanced Placement Program Education in Romania The Sims 2: University Secondary education in the United States College admissions Education in the People's Republic of China Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Education in Germany Dog agility Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology University of Massachusetts Amherst Trinity College, Dublin Brown University High school IB Diploma Programme Education in Sweden DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX A-level Secondary education in France Community college Worcester Polytechnic Institute Graduate school Student loan Hopkins School University of Central Florida Cooper Union Norway national football team The Amazing Race Hunter College High School Franklin W.
