feeling depressed in college these should be the best years of my life i go to a big state school my parents completely provide for me financially my only obligation is to pass my classes there are students at my school yet i feel so lonely i am packing right now and thinking of how i hate moving every year and for some reason it is making me emotional can anyone out there relate to being a depressed college student does anyone have any advice for me thank you so incredibly much how are you doing with classes i know when i felt sad during my college years were because i was doing bad in my classes and i feel like i can never graduate letting my parents down in the process if thats not it and you are just feeling lonely you should try making new friends with students i bet there are many clubs and organizations that you can join if you like sports join the club sports team or im team if you like literature i am sure there are book clubs and poetry clubs on campus its hard not to find one you like if that doesn't work it might be the fact a big state school does not fit your personally perhaps you need smaller classrooms where professors and your classesmates have more interaction with you i would suggest transfering to a smaller local college and continue your education there don't worry i know a lot of people that made this transition before Education in the United States Cornell University Brown University Students' union Washington State University York University Homeschooling Williams College Education in Germany Franklin W.
