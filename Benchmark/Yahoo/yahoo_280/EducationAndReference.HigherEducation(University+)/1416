advice for first year of college i moved several hours from home to start college i'm taking hours sociology comp anatomy and chemistry i'm worried that i'm going to be so focused on getting lost and not knowing anything about the campus that it will hurt my grades because i'll be too nervous to use the library or the help centers i really want to do well in college but i'm really nervous plus i am taking those two science classes which i'm not very good at i don't know anyone else that is going to the same school as i am i think i have a social anxiety disorder so i stress out about everything any advice also the college doesn't have dorms i'm not even kidding it has over students and the university in my home town only has all of the classes i'm taking are absolutely required because i'm trying to get into a specific program next fall and i need to show them that i'm committed and serious about it my councelor had to talk me out of taking a summer chem class and enrolling in microbiology s how about taking a visit of the campus before school starts to figure out where everything is and get more comfortable with it i'm starting college this fall not far from home but i am planning to just go and walk around and get the lay of the land before the first day of classes if you know where everything is beforehand it'll be more familiar when you show up on the first day you might want to change your classes for your first semester try scheduling them for your best time of day if you can and maybe start out with easier classes for the first semester so you'll have less pressure i'm saving all my math and science classes for later semesters so that i'll be more comfortable with college life and less likely to freak out lol also get in touch with your professors on the first day of classes say hello get to know them make friends with them as best as you can because for the most part they do want to help you and if you let them know up front what your concerns or other worries are about college life in general and their classes in particular they will be more willing to help you if they can the most important thing i think though is to just relax and don't let anyone pressure you into doing more or going faster than you feel ready for if you have to take five years to graduate when everyone else is taking three that's ok if that's what it takes to stay sane through the process there's no shame in going at your own pace and doing what you decide is best for you good luck Education in Germany University of Massachusetts Amherst Education in the People's Republic of China University of Central Florida Georgia Institute of Technology Graduate school Education in the United States Massachusetts Institute of Technology Tulane University Texas A&M University Brown University Freed-Hardeman University Georgetown University American University Smith College Middle Tennessee State University Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Ohio Wesleyan University Education in Taiwan Education in Romania New York University Concordia University Cornell University Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Florida Institute of Technology Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Hampshire College Bowdoin College Gwinnett University Center Education in Portugal Juris Doctor Emerson College Chinese University of Hong Kong Trinity College (Connecticut) Medical school Hunter College High School Hopkins School Anxiety Academic term Professor Education in France University of Szeged University at Albany University of Houston University of Alabama University of Tennessee Franklin W.
