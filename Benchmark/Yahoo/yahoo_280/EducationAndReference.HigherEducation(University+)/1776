if i dont know what i want to do what classes should i take i took a year off after i graduated and want to go back to school i just have no idea what i want to do with my life i thought about having my husband just supporting me but screw that i dont want to waste money on classes i might hate but would it be worth it to take a variety of classes im so lost in the college game i dont think i can even do algebra anymore lol i was in a similar boat when i went to college if you are going to a community college which is what i would suggest you can take all the classes you want that are of interest to you i went to community college and got a degree in liberal arts which is great if you plan on transfering to a larger school afterwards obivously you have to take the required math and english crap which you will take placement tests and then they will put you in a class that will be to your learning level but then you can pick classes that interest you if you go to a few classes and absolutly hate the class you can always drop the class just make sure you do it officially so you don't wind up getting an f for not showing up to class best of luck with your educational endevors Education in the United States Homeschooling GED Grade (education) Community college Education in Taiwan College Master's degree Craps Advanced Placement Program Secondary education in the United States Seneca College Anti-intellectualism Education in Romania Otterbein College Education in Germany Jaime Escalante Education in the People's Republic of China SAT Cooper Union Academia Associate's degree No Child Left Behind Act Emerson College Harvard Division of Continuing Education Quizbowl Georgia Institute of Technology Avenue Q Hunter College High School Education The College of New Jersey Stuyvesant High School Great Teacher Onizuka Franklin W.
