how competitive are these scores mcats verbal physics biology writing sample p gpa low b c of past stress disorder where do i find more information on this thanks stress due to traumatic event science gpa overall gpa due to past emotional stress i don't know much about the mcats i kind of stumbled on this looking for stuff about praxis but i found a site that said this each section is scored on a scale with the average somewhere around the mean varies slightly by section and test date writing sample scores are on a different scale j t for those who actually apply to med school the average mcat score is higher verbal reasoning physical sciences biological sciences and for those who are accepted and then matriculate at med school the averages are for verbal reasoning for physical sciences and for biological sciences bear in mind that many candidates are accepted with scores both above and below these average figures so it sounds like you're pretty much set on those scores it sounds very impressive good job i wouldn't know what the gpa would do though i imagine a letter explaining the problem would help good luck Medical College Admission Test SAT Grade (education) Intelligence quotient Medical school Graduate Record Examination Graduate school Education in the United States Normal distribution Regents of the University of California v.
