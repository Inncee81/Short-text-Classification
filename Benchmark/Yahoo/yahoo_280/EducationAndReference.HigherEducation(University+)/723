my parents want to wait a month to buy stuff for my dorm bad idea my parents want to wait a month after i move in to buy stuff like a minifridge microwave towels etc to see if i really need it i think its a really bad idea and i just want to get stuff now am i right oh so i guess its not that bad of an idea but my roommate isnt bringing a fridge or microwave either but the residence hall does have a kitchen heh i don't know where these people get their information i'm a rising senior i've had a minifridge all my life at college couldn't live w o it cold beer is like heaven plus you can put leftover pizza food microwaveable dinners in it as a freshman you probably have to buy a meal plan i think it's a federal law or something so you may not have much use for it i've had a microwave nd and rd years even though they are not permitted in the dorms who cares and it's a time saver money saver and life saver why pay bucks a meal at the campus cafeteria which probably is bad food when you can buy a progresso soups for that much i'll be in a suite setup this year with four other kids i have the microwave i'll be bringing a rice cooker to make my own food infinitely more cheaper than buying meals and my mini fridge even though the suite has its own kitchen refridgerator it deters your roommates from 'stealing' your food a friend of mine got one of these george foreman grills also banned in the dorms but who cares nobody really pays any attention to those rules and he loves it another friend uses her rice cooker since freshman year at least three times a week and we all have fridges some are over the housing policy's permitted dimensions heh of course i go to school in new york city four hours away from where i live the campus food isn't so great though the school has been improving it but its just not worth it when there are so many great eats closer to the dorm than the campus dining hall among other things like greater selection and variety my friends who have to fly to school from home i drive down w my parents rent a minifridge when they move in its the first thing they do you should wait for things to go on sale i got my minifridge for less than sixty bucks from sears on clearance plus employee discount and the microwave i got for ten bucks there's very little sense in buying it new anyway even if you do buy it new you'll be using it the moment you graduate and are living by yourself the whole thing depends really on where you go to school you should really ask current students to see if they really need things like a microwave a minifridge coffeemaker etc Freed-Hardeman University Cafeteria Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Kitchen University of Massachusetts Amherst Meal University of California, Irvine Georgia Institute of Technology University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Wal-Mart Phillips Exeter Academy Duke University New York University Georgetown University Dormitory Reed College Franklin W.
