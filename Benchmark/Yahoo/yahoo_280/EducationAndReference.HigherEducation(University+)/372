ivy league grad school i'm wondering how hard it is to get into ivy league or other top tier universities such as stanford berkeley duke etc for graduate school it would be in psychology or a related field now i know it depends on the program and i need to do well in my undergraduate and get research experience and all that but i want to hear from anyone who has or knows anyone who has gone into grad school at a top university coming from a 'not so prestigious' university the real ins and outs of the whole thing not just admissions data thanks i've done it although i started my undergrad degree at ucla i dropped out twice and ended up doing most of my coursework and graduating from cal poly pomona which is an okay state university but nothing special i then got a master's back at ucla that was probably the hardest to overcome the stigma of having been on academic probation there and then getting into the graduate program and moved on the a ph d at northwestern which has generally been considered the best school in my field for decades aside from testing really well and having great grades i had people with top level credibility write my references and asked them to address the issue of my earlier history when they wrote that i had always been capable of top tier work but due to circumstances which were now no longer a factor made other choices i got in Graduate school Juris Doctor University of California, Los Angeles Master's degree Education in Australia Stanford University Cornell University University of Pennsylvania Affirmative action California Polytechnic State University College and university rankings California State University Medical school Cal Poly Pomona University of Southern California University of California, Berkeley College University of Michigan Lawyer Harvard University Education in Romania Columbia University Public Ivies Rice University SAT Yale University University of California, San Diego Quizbowl Bowdoin College University of Virginia Brown University Johns Hopkins University Baylor University Education in the People's Republic of China Education in France University of Alabama American University Law school Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of California Physician Education in Hong Kong University of Arizona Graduate Record Examination Georgetown University University of California, Riverside College admissions Doctor of Philosophy Boston College Princeton University College of William and Mary Software engineering University of Notre Dame University of Chicago University of Central Florida Grade (education) University of Bristol University of Florida Education in Sweden Washington University in St. Louis State university Duke University Novosibirsk State University Master of Business Administration Northwestern University No Child Left Behind Act UCLA School of Theater Film and Television Education in Germany Emory University Chiropractic North Carolina State University John Lott Vanderbilt University Trinity College, Dublin High school Russell Group Cleveland State University Queen's School of Computing GED Law School Admissions Test University of Maryland Baltimore County California Mathematics University of Toronto College soccer Academia Indiana State University Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Education in Taiwan Bellarmine College Preparatory Higher education in Japan
