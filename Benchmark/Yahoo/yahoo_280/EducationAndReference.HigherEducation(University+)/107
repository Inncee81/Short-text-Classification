are universities really harder than comm colleges i am transferring from a comm college to uc davis this fall i'm a biology major and i excelled in all of my classes at the comm college i'm just wondering if i should expect it to be a lot different at uc davis the classes are hard however a lot of that is due from the change of freshman to junior level classes once you start taking upper level classes anywhere the expectations are higher don't worry too much i'm also a bio major who kick butt in community college i'm now a senior at university i've struggled with a few classes but the experience on a whole has been great for a select few classes or professors don't be surprised to work five times as hard for a b or c as you did for an a in community college i've also found that university professors and staff are far less helpful and compromising then community college teachers anyway make friends with people who have taken some the classes before for study hints don't procrastinate she types while her a p book mocks her and do not always listen to the buzz about a teacher being terrible however be mindful of those who have endured the torture beware that your community college gpa does not transfer so all your classes aren't worth much to the university you're starting over with only the hardest classes left therefore your university gpa can take quite a beating with just one or two killer classes sorry to end on a downer i'm sure you'll do great good luck on your first semester as a university student Grade (education) Education in the United States Graduate school Education in Germany The Citadel (Military College) Education in the People's Republic of China The Sims 2: University University of Central Florida The College of New Jersey Education in Taiwan Princeton University Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Social rule SAT Community college High school The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy University of California, Santa Barbara Trinity College, Dublin Smith College College Reed College California Polytechnic State University New Trier High School Medical school Middle Tennessee State University Piccolo Junior Saga Texas A&M University United States Air Force Academy King Piccolo Saga Tai Chi Chuan Hogwarts subjects Yearbook University of Houston Quizbowl College admissions Connecticut College University of Connecticut Chiropractic Arizona State University Experiential education Honey and Clover University of Arizona Angela Davis Education in Portugal Education in Romania Virginia Military Institute Time Out of Mind RuneScape quests Northeastern University, Boston Procrastination Brown University Harvard University College of William and Mary Education in Malaysia Education in Singapore Juris Doctor Test (student assessment) St. John's College, U.
