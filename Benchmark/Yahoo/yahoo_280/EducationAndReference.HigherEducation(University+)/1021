tips to improve at school if you fail your best subject what will you do to pass the next exams everyone has down periods in college you have to feel that school is the most important thing to you if you do not you will not have the drive to do whatever it takes no matter if it is your best subject or not look for jobs right now that you would qualify for without your degree find out how much they pay and then figure out how well you would live on that much money sometimes knowing your alternatives helps to give you back your motivation ya know this is what i do senior i never turn in an assignment late or incomplete work and i always try to do my absolute best i always have at least one other person check my papers which means that i cannot do it the night before use the writing center at your school to help you too but you have to finish your paper early and sometimes make an appointment i take tons and tons of notes to excess i bought a laptop to take with me too because i can type as fast as the prof can speak buy a digital recorder and tape the lectures and then listen to them right after class and right before your tests if your prof gives a study guide for each test do it and go over the top with answering it when it is complete take the hours it takes to memorize it along with all your notes by planning the day before your exam or more as your study day s which means no partying football games hanging out movies or even watching t v go somewhere that takes you away from these distractions if your prof does not give you a study guide then memorize your notes and listen to your lectures on tape if you do not understand something go see your prof the ta a tutor or the smartest student in class for help asap you cannot do this the night before a test alternatively you can google things for further clarification read your assigned readings and take notes from the book make sure to know all the terms in boldface and italics at the very least check out all the graphics too because the important stuff is highlighted by the authors in this fashion now i admit i do not do all my readings but if you learn how to figure out your profs to decide where the test material comes from sometimes you do not have to never miss a class unless you are vomiting or really could not make it no matter how hard you tried always showing up will put you in a good light with your teacher if participation is part of your grade always ask at least one question or make a comment during every class period even if you know the answer to your question at least you will recieve your participation points for the day thing that college students do not realize getting good grades is political your professors are more willing to give you a great grade if they like you if they know you and you give a care about them i do not kiss up to my profs but i take the time to talk to them outside of class about once a month during a semester i never hang around longer than minutes too you can ask them all kinds of things besides help on the subject such as their opinions about graduate school which classes would best benefit you for x career and they always love to talk about their current research the overall point is that getting great grades in college is a full time job and it is a great way to learn how to become sucessful in the real world by learning how to play the game of life you do not have to be a genius to do well in college but you do have to be a hard worker and self motivated this is not easy but you can do anything you want to do if you believe you can Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China GED Education in Germany Professor Education in the United States Grade (education) Education in Romania SAT Prostate cancer Pitaten Education in Portugal Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Teacher Juris Doctor A Course In Miracles Education Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Test (student assessment) Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Sims 2: University Quizbowl Past teachings of Prem Rawat Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban College admissions No Child Left Behind Act Current teachings of Prem Rawat Lawyer National Certificate of Educational Achievement Friends Great Teacher Onizuka IBM PC compatible Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Taiwan Princeton University Academia A-level Avenue Q Whose Line Is It Anyway?
