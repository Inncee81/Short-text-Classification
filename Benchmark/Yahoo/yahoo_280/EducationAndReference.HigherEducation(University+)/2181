if you take community college route then transfer to uc would i do four years of uc or two more years to finish the school would i lose some information if i take community college then uc school from my own personal experience and from seeing others that did the same thing you will have most of your classes transfer but at most you might lose one or two extra classes nonetheless depending on your situation the thing is that some of the final classes for your associates particularly the final electives can be so specialized that there's no way they'll work towards your bachelor for example one of my final classes for my associates in business administration was a history elective class called western civilization during the th century or something like that now in a perfect world i would've picked the best elective that would've transferred over to the university later on but schedule wise those other classes didn't work while this one did and since it was so specific it of course didn't transfer over to the university later on when i graduated so i had to take another elective at the university to replace it so again if you have all the time in the world to schedule your classes then more than likely you'll get a transfer rate otherwise there may be or classes that you'll end up losing Education in the United States Tulane University Master's degree Education in Germany Lawyer CPU cache Associate's degree Graduate school Western Kentucky University Community college Dentistry Chinese University of Hong Kong College Education in Australia Education in Portugal Bowl Championship Series Education in Taiwan University of Central Florida Georgetown University Master of Business Administration Redundant array of independent disks Architect Norway national football team Meaning Bluetooth Playoff Juris Doctor Athabasca University Torquay United F.C.
