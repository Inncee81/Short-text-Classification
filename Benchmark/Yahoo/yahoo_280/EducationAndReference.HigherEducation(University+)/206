dentist or pharmd please i need some help university admissions from where i come have started and i'm kinda confused dentistry or pharmd i hope you help me through with some of your experience or what you've heard is better and more exciting and which has a better future p s i'm a female dad wants me to study medicine he's a doctor and wishes to see me one too on the other hand mom and everyone else doesn't like that idea and i really feel confused and i can't figure out what i like anymore it's like i've been brain washed i've been getting high marks since first grade that's one of the reasons why dad wants me to study medicine i hope you kindly help me thanks a lot first of all both are extremely difficult practices so you should talk to various people who have just gotten their degree and what they had to do to get it talking to dentists or pharmacists who have gotten their degrees may have no bearing how the current status is with getting into those particular schools for example medical doctors like your father had a different time altogether with getting into medical school as with the particular eligible students now the competition is always stiff but the influx of foriegn applicants have made the process even more difficult to the point that those students are looking into other disciplines such as dentistry or pharmacy again speak to people in both crafts and how they got to their position many dentists fail in life not because they're not good dentists but because they can be poor businessmen dentists in private practice have to juggle issues of repaying bank loans establishing clientele and paying malpractice insurance in a never ending cycle and you thought dentistry was looking into people's mouths as for pharmacists they run through their own struggles also although you end up going to school learning about compounding and formulations insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies are looking to eliminate pharmacists as way overpayed pill counters and have implemented many ways to look to eliminate them aside from druggist activities people with a pharmd degree can look into aspects of drug development and clinical pharmacology for the development of new drugs in summation although people will always need dentists to a degree there is quite a bit of flexibility in the roles and possibilties of a pharmacist Dentistry Medicine Pharmacy Juris Doctor Pharmaceutical company Education in the United States Graduate school Doctorate History of medicine Apothecary University of Indonesia Education in the People's Republic of China University of Illinois at Chicago Publicly funded medicine Osteopathy Medical malpractice Psychiatry Medical school Alternative medicine General practitioner Homeopathy Education Master's degree Software engineering Medicare (Canada) Rudolf Steiner Tai Chi Chuan National Health Service Lawyer Education in Germany Pharmacopoeia University of California, San Francisco Extreme Programming Science UCAS Transsexuality Chinese University of Hong Kong Pharmacology Gender-neutral language Education in Australia Traumatic incident reduction Nitrous oxide College admissions Life insurance Health insurance College A-level Chiropractic Clomipramine Medical cannabis Insurance Grade (education) Traditional Chinese medicine Mercury (element) Temple University Terri Schiavo Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Health care in the United States Psychology Clinical depression Alexander Technique Education in Japan Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma University of Michigan Medicinal chemistry Education in Taiwan Food and Drug Administration Student loan Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Mortgage Baylor College of Dentistry Hypnosis Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Traumatic brain injury Psychotherapy Growth hormone treatment Meditation Affirmative action Bipolar disorder Education in Hong Kong Stroke Cannabis (drug) Division of labour University of Bristol
