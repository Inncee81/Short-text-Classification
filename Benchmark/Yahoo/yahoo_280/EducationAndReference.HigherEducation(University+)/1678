would u recommend someone to take science i math and english class no that's probably hours of credit you'll be swamped drop one of the science classes and take another class that will help you out with general education requirements or take an elective if you have already finished your gen eds the only exception i can think of is if you need those three science classes in your major and you need to take them all now to get to the next level of science but i think the only place that could happen is chemistry where you'd have to take organic chem physics and an analytical chemistry class together in one semester if you are stuck with that situation taking classes rather than would be the way to go Graduate school Chemistry Education in the United States Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Education in Romania NUS High School of Mathematics and Science Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Taiwan Stuyvesant High School Advanced Placement Program SAT Hopkins School North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Clements High School Education in the People's Republic of China Secondary education in the United States Gymnasium (Denmark) The Citadel (Military College) Doctorate Education in Hong Kong Physician United States Air Force Academy Education in Germany Florida Institute of Technology Columbia College of Columbia University Troy High School Education in Australia Hunter College High School Graduate Record Examination GED Medical school Education in France Physics Materials science New York State Department of Education Chiropractic Education in Portugal Hydrogen sulfide IB Diploma Programme Master's degree Science Linus Pauling Uppsala University Republic Bologna process Juris Doctor Virginia Commonwealth University History of chemistry Cooper Union Calculus Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences Secondary education in France Georgia Institute of Technology Grove City College Organic chemistry Professor Voter turnout University of Maryland Baltimore County Junior Certificate Education in Austria Dewey Decimal Classification Georgetown University Mathematics Simulation Bryn Mawr College Turkish education system Education in South Korea College Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Soviet Student Olympiads Baptist Lui Ming Choi Secondary School Montgomery Blair High School Chinese University of Hong Kong General Certificate of Secondary Education Civil Air Patrol Worcester Polytechnic Institute Trinity College, Dublin University of M__nster A New Kind of Science Dublin City University University of Coimbra Quantum electrochemistry Cerium(III) chloride Vienna International School Hydrogeology Education Genetic algorithm Analytical chemistry Logic St. John's College, U.
