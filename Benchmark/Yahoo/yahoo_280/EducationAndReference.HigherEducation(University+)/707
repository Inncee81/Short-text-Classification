organic chemistry labs in college what experiments and work is done in an organic chemistry lab i am trying to get an understanding of what to expect in lab thanks it's a lot of waiting for things to boil or dry or vacuum nothing complicated just be careful when you are doing experiments that are graded based on what you yield to not skimp and follow the instructions when you are doing multi step experiments you have to be careful cause it could be realllly hard to catch up if you make one mistake along the way but it's nothing more complicated than regular gen chem just more waiting and more fumes Vacuum Illegal drug trade Hydrogen Solar cell Chemistry Sulfuric acid Polymerase chain reaction Acetic acid Origin of life Scientific method Temperature Prostate cancer Science Ammonia Laboratory Bristol Grammar School Robert B.
