business research i currently am a junior at a small university in east texas i have a few research oriented courses under my belt and plan on attending either unt ut arlington or an ivy league for my doctoral studies my question is are areas such as career personality or entrepreneurship viable topics for a professor of business for my short college career i've been really interesting in the individual and career selection and start up businesses private businesses organizational behavior is a tertiary topic i also would like to dabble in i've read various journals and abstracts on topics in finance accounting economics and marketing and they really bore me i just don't have an interest in those fields another field that bores me is operations management is there any hope to find something interesting with the topics i have listed above i'm a little worried that you are bored by so many topics most people who go on successfully for doctorates have a strong intellectual curiosity which would mean that even if this is not your area of expertise you shouldn't discredit it furthermore all of these areas are related to one another i'm in marketing but got the idea for my dissertation from an organizational behavior class that i took okay having said that there is no such thing as a doctorate in business which has as its focus career personality within either management human resources or marketing you can do work that includes these topics but it is not a discipline on its own entrepreneurship is a little different it is a discipline which has been emerging for the past decade as one offered in business schools but i don't think that any of the better schools actually offer doctorates specifically in that field you generally get your doctorate in something like finance and do your research in entrepreneurial organizations to get a position in that area the one area you mention in which programs exist is organizational behavior there are a number of schools which offer this but make sure you go to a good one because this field is not one which is hurting for faculty so getting a job may be more difficult than in most business fields i also want to caution you to look more broadly into your choice of schools for a doctorate as it can make a huge difference unt is generally considered at least in my field to be one of the weaker doctoral programs they seem to put out a lot of candidates but many of them don't seem to be very well trained ut arlington doesn't seem to have a program in my field at all so i can't comment on how they are perceived in other areas as far as the ivies are concerned a few like columbia and wharton are highly respected for others many other schools including state schools like the university of michigan or in fact ut dallas and ut austin have stronger reputations than the ivies do don't get trapped into looking at the university's overall reputation and assuming that means a strong ph d program in business Graduate school Psychology Professor MIT Sloan School of Management Strategic management Juris Doctor Management University of Pennsylvania Economics Babson College Cornell University Business Entrepreneurship Education in Germany University of Michigan Columbia University Charter school Franz Boas Master of Business Administration Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Mathematics Entrepreneur Stevens Institute of Technology Doctor of Philosophy Chinese University of Hong Kong Leadership York University Education in the United States Marketing College Intelligent design movement Capitalism Education in Australia Strategic planning Political economy College and university rankings Education in the People's Republic of China Ivy League Philosophy of language University of Houston Futures Studies Sociology Education in Austria Far Eastern University Education in Japan Software engineering Privatization Cass Business School, London University of Texas at Arlington University of North Texas Parapsychology Music Academia Florida Institute of Technology Requirements analysis Physician University of Maryland Baltimore County Keynesian economics Philosophy Biology Finance Organizational studies Master's degree University of Chicago Graduate School of Business Neuro-linguistic programming Geography Social psychology Affirmative action Ross School of Business Computer Political science Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labor theory of value Noam Chomsky Organizational communication Plame affair Microcredit Health insurance Porter generic strategies Anthropology Innovation Pennsylvania State University Princeton University Medicine Science Asperger syndrome Second language acquisition Wall Street Massachusetts Institute of Technology Autism GED Philosophy of business Cultural relativism Microeconomics Academic publishing Hypnosis
