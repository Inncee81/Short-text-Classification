cordless battery operated shaver just stopped working what could be wrong i have a battery operated shaver that requires aa batteries it is not a rechargeable shaver so you just put in aa batteries for it to work suddenly the shaver just stopped running even with new batteries what could be wrong with the shaver is it the motor how long do motors last should i open up the shaver's housing i'm not bringing it to a repair shop because they charge too much to fix things the shaver is clean as i clean it regularly so it's not clogged i don't see any rust it requires aa alkaline batteries and i tried the brand new batteries already and the shaver won't work it's not the batteries i opened up the housing and noticed that there was a tiny bit of corrosion on a small metal part extends up from battery compartment i cleaned the corrosion and now the shaver works so it may have been the corrosion i'll have to keep watch over it thanks for the replies check if batts r in correct direction check for any signs of corrosion around the batt contacts possibilty of defect in switch if shaver head is removable remove it and try to turn it on again other than that the motor may have expired Motor oil Bicycle lighting Corrosion Battery (electricity) E85 Dishwasher IPod Drill Ford Ranger EV Razor Thermostat Switch Screw Battery electric vehicle Soldering USS S-38 (SS-143) USS S-35 (SS-140) Hydraulic machinery Bicycle brake systems Knife Nickel metal hydride Drill bit Cruising (maritime) Carburetor Contact lens USS S-44 (SS-155) Lawn mower Hard water Uninterruptible power supply Windows XP Bus models used in New York City Transit Sulfuric acid Radio controlled car Fire extinguisher Lead-acid battery Second Battle of the Atlantic Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Lithium ion battery Oscilloscope Hybrid Synergy Drive M16 (rifle) PlayStation Portable USS Thompson (DD-627) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Mars Exploration Rover Unterseeboot 505 Brazing Octopus card Watch Poker jargon Airsoft Light switch Rust USS Tunny (SS-282) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Tattoo Lionel Corporation Laptop Theory of conduct Elevator Stainless steel West Side Highway Violin USS Zane (DD-337) Hydrochloric acid USS Terry (DD-513) Tire USS S-37 (SS-142) Wind turbine Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Embedded system Bong The Shining (film) General Motors EV1 USS Pennsylvania (BB-38) Mercury (element) New England Patriots Technetium Disc brake Characters of Lost First aid Filling station Diode Mouse (computing) Locomotive Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mercury Cougar Escape from New York Steel Borehole Ion implantation Relay Aluminium
