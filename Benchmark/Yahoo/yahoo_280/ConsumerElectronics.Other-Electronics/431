why do some electronic devices hum even when they are turned off before you say it 'because their bored' yes very good but i beat you to it seriously though ive noticed it with some pieces of equipment in this case its a hi fi even though its off not on standby but properly off you can still hear a hum it is still on at the socket but other devices don t do this is it bad design electronically or is there a reason some devices do this your hi fi has a remote in order to allow it to turn the system on off the system has to have power to the remote circuitry it is also an older system because it uses a linear power supply with a transformer which is the thing that hums now if the above isn't true unplug the unit and find the thing that is humming Transformer Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Circuit design Alternating current Vacuum tube Capacitor Dimmer Residual-current device Universal Century Technology Fuse (electrical) Three-phase electric power Universal Serial Bus Electronics Electronic amplifier Jack plug Hard disk Screw Electrical generator Uninterruptible power supply Electronic power supply Operational amplifier Floppy disk Pirate decryption Power supply Musical Instrument Digital Interface Pickup (music) Spidey Super Stories Nintendo Entertainment System Electrical network Remote control Relay Computer Audiophile Windows XP BS 1363 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster High-voltage direct current Fluorescent lamp Debugging Electric motor Firefighter Embedded system Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Hearing aid Electric guitar X10 (industry standard) Loudspeaker Digital circuit Combine (Half-Life 2) SCART Solar power CMOS Information warfare CPU design Nuclear fusion Transformation problem Phase-locked loop RS-232 Transistor RFID USB flash drive Electricity meter PC motherboard The Inside Impedance matching Reliability engineering MOSFET Carburetor Oscilloscope Theory of conduct Radar Magnet Spacecraft propulsion Tamper resistance Solar cell Binary numeral system Server Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind VHF omnidirectional range National Electrical Code (US) Power strip Fuel injection Central processing unit Mantra Earthing system 8 mm video format Resistor Colony in Space Electrical engineering Surveillance Capacitor plague Nickel-cadmium battery Digital-to-analog converter Synthesizer Diode Richard Feynman Cosmic Era Mobile Units Fuel cell
