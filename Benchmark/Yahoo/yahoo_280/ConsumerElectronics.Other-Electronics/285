how do i lengthen a low voltage connection without losing power i have an xm radio that uses a v dc to v dc ma connector that has a foot wire i tried to lengthen the wire to over feet and got intermittent power problems what am i missing note i used speaker wire to originally lengthen the wire could this be the problem must be a weak connection because you could easily make that wire ' long before the voltage drop would be significant and the amperage draw is so low that speaker wire is actually bigger than you really need check your connections Universal Serial Bus RS-232 Oscilloscope Antenna (radio) Overhead lines Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Transformer Electric motor Welding Resistor Circuit design Impedance matching War of Currents Fluorescent lamp Vacuum tube Loudspeaker Thermostat Electric power transmission Incandescent light bulb Tesla coil Gas metal arc welding Switch Capacitor Alternating current Diode Decibel CMOS Electrophysiology Wardenclyffe Tower Transistor Thermocouple SCSI Battery (electricity) Voltmeter Ethernet Electrical wiring Poker jargon Overhead powerline TRS connector Series and parallel circuits Railway electrification system Conductor (material) BS 1363 Equine conformation Split phase Operational amplifier IPod Coaxial cable Naval mine Relay Peltier-Seebeck effect TGV Direct current Burglar alarm Voltage drop Dialysis High-voltage direct current Action potential MOSFET Switched-mode power supply Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Electricity meter High-voltage hazards Arc welding Fan (implement) Logic gate Mains electricity Spark gap Transmission line Non-native pronunciations of English Three-phase electric power Current (electricity) Electronic amplifier Ground (electricity) FireWire Low voltage differential signaling Central processing unit Spark plug Intravenous therapy Internet Audiophile Impedance Erotic electrostimulation Volt Phantom power Electricity distribution Magnet Advanced Technology Attachment Third rail Serial ATA Solar cell Mercury arc valve Electroshock gun Jack plug Langmuir probe Electrical generator DVD Linear regulator
