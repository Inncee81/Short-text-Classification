how to hook up vcr dvd recorder to t v with no cable box bought these components now i'm not sure how to hook it all up would like to be able to copy videotapes onto dvds the dvd recorder has a cable jack but the vcr does not thanks for your help all vcrs that i am familiar with have f type connectors the threaded ones that are usually associated with cable tv for input and output if you can run the rf output from the vcr to the rf input on the dvd recorder if you can set the output channel from the vcr usually there is a switch to set this to either channel or then set the dvd recorder to the same channel if you don't have the same type of connectors on both units then you will need a converter of some type since you say that the dvd recorder has a cable jack i will assume that this is an f type rf connector if the vcr has rca type output jacks for audio and video then you need an rf modulator these are fairly inexpensive and can be purchased at radio shack and some discount stores with a decent electronics department good luck SCART DVD Television RCA connector Videocassette recorder Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Laserdisc S-VHS Xbox VHS Jack plug S-Video Camcorder S__CAM S/PDIF Digital video recorder Sound Blaster High fidelity Copy protection XLR connector Macrovision Composite monitor Atari 2600 8 mm video format Amiga Commodore 64 Nintendo Entertainment System Musical Instrument Digital Interface Electronic amplifier Betamax Videotape Karaoke Home cinema High-definition television Acorn Electron Amstrad CPC Microphone D-subminiature Universal Serial Bus Compact disc Operational amplifier Computer RCA Ethernet TRS connector Gramophone record PlayStation Portable PAL USB flash drive DVD recorder Remote control Sega Dreamcast Frequency modulation Analog-to-digital converter Atari ST Cable television Embedded system DVD player Nominal impedance Mixing console TiVo DV AES/EBU Set-top box Betacam High-Definition Multimedia Interface Balanced audio Original Amiga chipset Central processing unit PC Engine NTSC Coaxial cable PHP Sound card Film Loudspeaker Nintendo GameCube Logic gate Desktop computer Atari 8-bit family MPEG-2 Transformer Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Synthesizer Light-emitting diode Digital Visual Interface Sinclair ZX81 Laptop The Walt Disney Company Home Box Office ZX Spectrum Video game crash of 1983 Digital audio workstation
