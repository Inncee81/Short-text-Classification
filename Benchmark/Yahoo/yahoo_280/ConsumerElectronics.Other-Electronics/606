can i use an adapter with more voltage output than the device requires will my device just take what it needs do you mean voltage or current if the voltage is higher damage could result to your device if you connect an volt adapter to something that requires volts you might damage it if you mean current that's another story if you connect a volt ma supply to something in place of a volt ma supply it should work fine the device will draw the current necessary if the voltage is correct Volt Capacitor Circuit design Diode Oscilloscope Switched-mode power supply Three-phase electric power Battery (electricity) Transformer Domestic AC power plugs and sockets CMOS Variable Frequency Drive Operational amplifier Electricity distribution RS-232 Current source Voltage regulator Incandescent light bulb High-voltage hazards Tesla coil Phantom power Fuse (electrical) Logic gate Light-emitting diode Digital circuit Circuit breaker Voltage source Resistor SCSI Analog-to-digital converter Logic families Transistor Universal Serial Bus Split phase Linear regulator Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Spark gap Electrical generator High-voltage direct current Impedance matching Hall effect Potentiometer Decibel Vacuum tube Linear particle accelerator Power supply Electric motor War of Currents Fluorescent lamp Zener diode Phase-locked loop Uninterruptible power supply Power (physics) Lineman (occupation) Electric power transmission Electronic amplifier Relay MOSFET Radiation hardening Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Welding power supply Mains electricity Solar cell Thermostat Electrophysiology Electricity Ohm's law Ceramics Liquid crystal display Loudspeaker Oxygen sensor Adapter Microphone Transmitter Apollo 13 Mercury arc valve Particle accelerator Electrical network Nickel metal hydride Electrical wiring Gas metal arc welding Wind power Short circuit Central processing unit Power cord Semiconductor device Schottky diode Spark plug Erotic electrostimulation Output impedance Digital-to-analog converter Electrical element Current (electricity) Van de Graaff generator Series and parallel circuits Direct current Voltmeter Negligible Electronics
