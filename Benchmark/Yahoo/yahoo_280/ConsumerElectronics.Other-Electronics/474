downsides of mp players made in china i was planning to buy an mp player that is china made which has similar features with that of an ipod even had a built in camera mostly these gadgets are relatively much less expensive compared to that of an ipod so i was worried that it might not last for a year or worse for a month just basing on the concept that high price equals high quality and cheaper price equals cheaper quality i am not saying that china products are cheap and of poor quality i just think that it's too much of a bargain that these manufacturers are selling a video player just like an ipod but at a lot less money i just wanna know if it would really be worth it to buy one do you guyz have any idea on the disadvantages of these mp players do you have any disappointing experiences owning one i hope you could give me some specific details on the downsides of these gadgets thanks a lot mine has been working for a year the headphone suck i had to replace them and the battery sucks the quality seems fine though for what i paid for a gig model no camera though but plays amv video that i convert myself Digital photography Walkman IPod IPod shuffle Laserdisc Apple Computer Microeconomics Gross domestic product Airsoft ITunes Music Store Wal-Mart IMac Radeon Gramophone record ITunes Creative Zen DVD Sport utility vehicle Hydrogen economy Inflation Monopoly (game) Tariff Apple Macintosh High-definition television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PE ratio Binoculars Free trade Capitalism IPod nano Compact audio cassette Bulk vending Camcorder Mutual fund Capital accumulation Strap-on dildo Audiophile Atari ST View camera Yugo Poker jargon Nintendo Machinima Nintendo DS Digital cinematography Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Inkjet printer Publicly funded medicine Tax Video game crash of 1983 Bicycle lighting Handheld game console Blackjack Solar power Temasek Holdings Digital rights management NVIDIA Sega Saturn Law of value Health insurance Game Boy Advance FireWire Sega Ford Motor Company USB flash drive Personal rapid transit Final Fantasy XI Outsourcing Computer and video games IBM PC compatible Overclocking Digital cinema Computer Videocassette recorder ATI Technologies PlayStation Portable Paintball Leica Amstrad CPC Plastic American individualist anarchism Digital audio player Citigroup RuneScape economy Television Loss leader Sears Holdings Corporation CPU design Illegal drug trade Headphones Price discrimination 8 mm video format Pharmaceutical company
