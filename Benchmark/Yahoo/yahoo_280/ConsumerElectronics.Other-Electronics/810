which has more features in a calculator ms or ms please mention the additional features in either case i guess you're talking about the calculators manufactured by casio the fx ms does have a lot of functions including solving equations vectors matrices factorial quadratic cubic functions degrees radian calculation etc other features include two way power functions dot matrix line display digits plastic keys two way power functions dot matrix line display digits plastic keys multi replay function equation calculations differential calculations matrix calculations vector calculations solve function line display fraction calculations integration calculations combination and permutation statistics stat data editor standard deviation normal distribution calculations regression analysis base n calculations conversions logical operations complex number calculations calc memory engineering symbol calculations scientific calculations metric conversions conversion pairs variable memories the casio s is not as advanced as the ms the features of the s include line lc display characters functions scientific constants complex number calculations logical operators two dimensional statistics algebraic input logic v p a m base n calculation engineering symbol calculations solar cell with auxiliary battery Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Complex number Polynomial Calculator Linear regression Orthogonal matrix Normal distribution Artificial neural network Mathematics of general relativity Ordinary differential equation TI-89 series Pi Vector (spatial) Discrete Fourier transform Quaternion Computer State space (controls) Digital circuit Mathematics Standard deviation Timeline of mathematics Trigonometric function Correlation Matrix (mathematics) Continuous Fourier transform Explosive material M__bius transformation Hamiltonian mechanics C plus plus Real number Solar cell Linear algebra Linear transformation Exponentiation Central processing unit Determinant Combinatorial species Maxwell's equations Kalman filter Dynamical system Fibonacci number Finite element method Newton's identities Operator Tensor Linear differential equation Exponential function Quantum computer Quartic equation Gravity Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Common Lisp Polynomial interpolation SAS System Newton's method PlayStation 3 William Rowan Hamilton Regression analysis Atari 8-bit family GNU Scientific Library Partial fraction History of computing hardware Slide rule Basis (linear algebra) Heat equation Exterior algebra Unicode Polarization Covariance and contravariance Large numbers Uses of trigonometry Maximum likelihood Factorial Function (mathematics) Joseph Louis Lagrange Algebra Bayesian inference Square root Manifold Collision detection Fast Fourier transform Lorentz group Trigonometric identity Multivariate normal distribution Projective transformation Calculus Areas of mathematics White noise
