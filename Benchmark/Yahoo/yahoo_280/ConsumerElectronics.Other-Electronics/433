what is the difference between meter and meter radios one is higher than the other meters is a vhf frequency mhz to mhz meters is just above cb radio mhz to mhz the meters represents a full wavelength of the frequency higher being lower Very high frequency Ultra high frequency Amateur radio Shortwave bands NTSC Radio Ionosphere Citizens' band radio Superheterodyne receiver Shortwave TV-FM DX 6 meters Loudspeaker Pentium 4 Frequency modulation FM broadcast band Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Wi-Fi Global Positioning System VHF omnidirectional range WHK-AM Distance Measuring Equipment Radio frequency interference Radio station Electromagnetic spectrum Federal Communications Commission Emergency position-indicating rescue beacon General Mobile Radio Service Athlon 10 meters Transmitter DDR2 SDRAM High frequency ZigBee Crystal Palace Transmitter Ethernet Electromagnetic radiation Contesting Oscilloscope Marine VHF radio Microphone Optical fiber Celeron Radeon High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program Software-defined radio Harmonic series (music) Mayday Cordless telephone Microwave FM broadcasting in the USA Digital audio broadcasting Karl Guthe Jansky Low-power broadcasting Joint Tactical Radio System Laserdisc Mediumwave Overclocking Telephone Sound Transformer GSM frequency ranges WWV Terrestrial Trunked Radio Digital cable In-band on-channel Radar Mobile phone radiation and health Overhead powerline Medical ultrasonography Call for help Global Maritime Distress Safety System Distress signal SETI High-definition television Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Instrument Landing System DDR SDRAM Radio Luxembourg Taxicab Pentium III Longwave Optical coherence tomography KQED Antenna (radio) Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Subcarrier North Bay/Jack Garland Airport Microwave oven Weatheradio History of radar Broadband Internet access Nintendo 64 Transistor Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Hydrogen line Impedance matching Crystal oscillator Grote Reber
