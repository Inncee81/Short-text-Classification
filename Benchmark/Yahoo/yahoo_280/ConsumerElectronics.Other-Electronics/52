how effective are air ionic breezers i know they work but the air which passes through them is not much so how much of a positive effect are they are they worth the money based on my experience and research the ionic breeze models of so called air purifiers are overpriced underperformers they do remove a small percentage of particulates mostly dust from the air and can give the air a smell that some people consider a clean smell however they move so little air through them that they're not very effective at all to really clean the air you have to move the air through the cleaner hepa air cleaners high efficiency particulate arresting are considered an industry standard they will remove particles as fine as of an inch with efficiency a hepa cleaner with an ozonator will kill bacteria and mold and hepa filters can also be impregnated with chemicals which will clear the air of noxious fumes like ammonia hepa is an air cleaning technology used by among other things hospitals semiconductor manufacturing nasa and atomic plants that to me is a sharper image than the ionic breeze purifiers which do nothing but generate static electricity Air purifier Electrostatic precipitator Air ioniser Ozone Ammonia Vacuum cleaner Air pollution Particulate Air filter Cleanroom Vacuum Dry cleaning Air conditioning Welding Earth's atmosphere Water purification Fossil fuel power plant Natural gas Solar cell Water (molecule) Hydrogen economy Nuclear fallout High-voltage direct current Energy development Drill bit Ozone hole Atom Ceramics Wind power Gas metal arc welding Catalytic converter Nuclear power Carburetor Biodiesel Hard disk Haloalkane Bong Helium Explosive material Gas mask Hydride Solar power Spacecraft propulsion Semiconductor fabrication Laser Plutonium Sun Ricin Coal Water Light-emitting diode Isotope separation Diesel engine Ozone layer Microscopy Arc welding Hydrogen sulfide Beryllium Copper Ion Electrolysis Carbon dioxide Acetic acid Fuel cell Chlorine Cathode ray tube Electric motor Refrigerator Environmental concerns with electricity generation Anthrax Town gas Industrial wastewater treatment X-ray Thermal power station Lionel Corporation Plastic Pebble bed reactor Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Electron Ice core Battery (electricity) Chemical warfare Quantum mechanics Fan (implement) Internal ballistics Atomism Brewery STS-50 Tank Sodium hypochlorite Dairy Emission standard Vacuum tube Ultraviolet
