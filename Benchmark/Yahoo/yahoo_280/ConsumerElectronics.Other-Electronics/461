mm male to mm female adapter when fully plugged in there should be audio output sound music etc coming out from both the left and right speaker headphone etc right the reason i ask is because i have one that when used doesn't have audio output from both the left and right when it's fully plugged in if i moved the adapter out of the phone a little in a certain place then there's audio from both sides this is a replacement b c the st one did this too the product description doesn't say whether or not its stereo or not it's from meritline com this is annoying b c when if i get it to work w audio output from both sides and it slightly moves then there's sound from only one side or none then i have to move it again so nothing can really be moved to keep the audio output coming from both sides unless it's very carefully the product page http www meritline com earphone plug adapter transfer mm plug into mm small plug html it has bands rings i'm guessing w phones the bands would be for listening and the microphone but aren't the rings bands insulators from what i know the metal tip is the left channel audio the middle metal part is the right channel and the bottom is the ground the headphones i use don't have a microphone they're just regular headphones for music so shouldn't the adapter work the headphones i use have a mm jack which is the purpose of the adapter the headphones are stereo also the adapter is for standard mm headphones to be used on a phone that accepts mm headphones what u describe and the web page match that is a stereo plug does the headphone have the same configuration it could be just a mono headset is the headphone the same size as the adapter plug maybe u don't need the adapter Jack plug Headphones Microphone IPod TRS connector Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Binaural recording Loudspeaker Amstrad CPC Stereophonic sound Bluetooth Walkman Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Spark plug Gramophone record RCA connector Tungsten Handheld Apple IIGS Audiophile 8 mm video format MP3 Xbox N-Gage D-subminiature FM broadcasting Digital audio broadcasting Modem 3D audio effect Karaoke Nintendo DS Sega Dreamcast Digital audio workstation Mixing console Common Unix Printing System Surround sound Sound Blaster Sound design Telephone exchange Game Boy Nominal impedance Danger Hiptop SCART Game Boy Advance SP Nintendo Entertainment System Musical Instrument Digital Interface Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Electrophysiology Bose Corporation Secure Digital card Movie projector Copy protection Subwoofer Compact disc Sound reinforcement system Transistor Compact audio cassette Oscilloscope High fidelity Disc jockey Dolby Digital Grateful Dead PC Engine XLR connector Transformer Atari ST DIN connector Vacuum tube Advanced Audio Coding Stereoscopy Web browser Laserdisc Atari 8-bit family Sound card Balanced audio Radiotelephone Manual transmission DVD Synthesizer Universal Serial Bus Television Radio Surveillance Videoconferencing Glossary of partner dance terms HyperText Transfer Protocol Equal-loudness contour Commodore 64 Digital audio player Speech recognition Shure Incorporated Tapwave Zodiac Sinclair ZX81 Computer bus Enigma machine BS 1363
