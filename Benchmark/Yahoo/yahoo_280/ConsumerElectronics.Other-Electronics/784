can i use an v charger with a v battery i have a stayer bce p v cordless drill with a duff battery charger can i use a v or v charger with my batteries alternatively where can i obtain a stayer or equivalent v charger thanks i am in london uk voltage is important trust me if the polarity is correct v shouldn't be a problem because battery chargers generally are unregulated but v would most definately be too much actual output on a v charger is porbably closer to volts i would only use a charger designed to charge the same battery chemistry though such as ni mh or ni cd some chargers also use sensitive voltage triggers to prevent overcharging if you use a charger that is designed for a higher voltage device you woiuld need to time the charging cycle instead of doing what most americans do and leave it on the charger Nickel-cadmium battery Nickel metal hydride Bicycle lighting Circuit design Diode Capacitor Oscilloscope Volt Battery electric vehicle Transformer Incandescent light bulb Lithium ion battery Electrical generator High-voltage direct current Ford Ranger EV Impedance Electrophysiology Lithium ion polymer battery Power (physics) Switched-mode power supply Electricity Turbocharger Solar cell Vacuum tube Digital circuit Switch Electric motor Three-phase electric power Tesla coil CMOS Liquid crystal display Direct current Microphone Action potential Airsoft Dodge Charger Memory effect Universal Serial Bus San Diego Chargers Operational amplifier SCSI Electroshock gun Phase-locked loop Thyristor Membrane potential Transistor Alternating current Decibel Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Radiation hardening Floppy disk Current (electricity) Dosimeter Wind power Thermostat Resistor Piezoelectricity Logic gate Loudspeaker Lead-acid battery Analog-to-digital converter RS-232 Phantom power Hybrid vehicle Electronic amplifier Alternator PlayStation Portable Power supply Electric boat Logic families Particle accelerator Welding Toyota Prius Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Thermal power station Gas metal arc welding Impedance matching Current source Hubble Space Telescope Central processing unit Digital-to-analog converter Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Mercury arc valve Van de Graaff generator Polarization MOSFET Solar car USB flash drive Semiconductor device Maxwell's equations Spark gap War of Currents Superconductivity Negligible
