cricket cell found one lost my own could i use the one i found i found a cricket cell shortly after losing my own would i be able to use it if so how soon after that account is inactive or is there no need to wait i'd like to use it instead of having to buy me new phone but if i can't i'll toss it how'd you feel after you lost your phone this is probably how this phone's owner feels now if i were you then i'd turn it in by calling the number to the cricket phone company which i just found out is cricket and hey you never know they might give you a phone just for turning it in it's really the right thing to do besides if the phone owner doesn't find it soon they'll probably end up cancelling it anyway so you wouldn't be able to use it Cricket Sydney Riot of 1879 North American Numbering Plan Ocean's Twelve English cricket team Taxicab Surveillance Test cricket Telephone tapping History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) West Indian cricket team Telephone Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Telephone directory History of Test cricket (to 1883) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Japanese mobile phone culture Payphone Private branch exchange Time Out of Mind The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Mobile phone About a Boy Full Metal Panic?
