can anyone recommend a calculator brand and model i need a calculator that has differentiation integration and a linear equation solver of up to variables thanks i used to have a casio fx ms i remembered it has a differentiation and integration solver Calculator Derivative Numerical analysis Finite element method Ordinary differential equation Analog computer Calculus Maxwell's equations Mathematics Polynomial Computational fluid dynamics Heat equation Operational amplifier Linear algebra Linear differential equation Casio Laplace transform Partial differential equation Examples of differential equations Hamiltonian mechanics Planetary orbit State space (controls) Linear equation Separation of variables Computational chemistry Computer algebra system Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Mathematical model Multiple integral Lars H__rmander Operator Black-Scholes Exact solutions in general relativity Dynamical system Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Distribution (mathematics) Mathematics of general relativity Linear regression Complex number History of computing hardware Covariance and contravariance Numerical ordinary differential equations Sturm-Liouville theory Linear transformation Bessel function Recurrence relation RLC circuit Fundamental theorem of calculus Hydrogeology SciPy Differential operator Linear programming Nonlinearity Supply and demand Expected value Exponential growth Nondimensionalization Inverse problem Navier-Stokes equations Chaos theory TI-89 series Integration by parts Tensor Exponential function PID controller Graphing calculator Taylor series Integral Cubic equation Trigonometric function Continuous Fourier transform Stochastic process Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Joseph Louis Lagrange Artificial neural network Pharmacokinetics Slope Boundary condition Fourier transform Determinant Radar cross section Trigonometric identity Fluid dynamics Microeconomics Engineering Lagrangian mechanics Holomorphic function Kalman filter Normal distribution Slide rule Constraint programming Two-body problem Equation of motion Manifold Timeline of mathematics Hilbert space Natural logarithm Matrix exponential Computer simulation Sobolev space
