how can i determine quality of charge on my aa or aaa bateries meters always show corect voltage even when to some extent batteriy tester shows fully charged cells by how quickly it flicks to voltage voltage itself reads ok even when cells are nearlyu dead is there a method using meters to determine quality of charge nope i am assuming you are talking about the quality of charged rechargables and the answer is no there is no meter for this right off hand but there is a way to test it it voltage doesn't directly have anything to do with charge on a cell its only a consequance of constant load so a battery that is almost dead would have a slightly lower voltage then one with a full charge for batteries in most devices there is something called a dropoff voltage and depending on the device this can be not very low so batteries don't last long in these devices but its the draw of current that reduces the voltage and this can easily be determined by figuring out how much current the device draws then you devide the batteries max hourly current by this figure and if you get a lot less time then the batteries are advertised for then you know your batteries are not being charged properly Battery (electricity) Nickel-cadmium battery Circuit design Lithium ion battery Capacitor Oscilloscope Action potential Solar cell Nickel metal hydride Diode Volt Electrophysiology Voltage source Welding Transformer Electric motor Toyota Prius Wind turbine Vacuum tube Electricity meter Liquid crystal display Langmuir probe Direct current Bicycle lighting Electronic amplifier Membrane potential Battery electric vehicle Thermal power station Explosive material Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Electroshock gun Solar panel Three-phase electric power Voltmeter High-voltage direct current MOSFET Energy storage Extreme Programming Light-emitting diode Circuit breaker Impedance Memory effect Electrical generator Radiation hardening Renewable energy Hydrogen economy Hall effect Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Internal ballistics Variable Frequency Drive Uninterruptible power supply CMOS Oxygen sensor Digital photography Output impedance Microphone Peltier-Seebeck effect Loudspeaker Phase-locked loop Analog-to-digital converter Naval mine Lead-acid battery Thermostat Alternating current Airsoft Maxwell's equations M16 (rifle) Tesla coil Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Hybrid vehicle Lithium ion polymer battery Fuel cell Spark plug Service life Semiconductor Wind power Electricity PlayStation Portable Firearm Galvanometer Logic families Universal Serial Bus Semiconductor device Hybrid Synergy Drive Flash memory Incandescent light bulb Power supply Switch Potentiometer Impedance matching Anode RC circuit Ohm's law
