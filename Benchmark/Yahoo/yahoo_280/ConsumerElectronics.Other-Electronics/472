what is so special about blue ray technology is it here to stay or go the way of dat players is it really better than hi def or does it take a signal meter that can read and see the difference what tv's does it work best on i really think it is just a passing fad that will disappear just like dat players and tapes digital audio tape first the technology question it s got more storage than hd dvd which gives the publishers more options a blu ray dvd can hold gb for a single layer disc vs gb for hd dvd that means that potentially an hd film plus the extras and special features and potentially or more hours of data think games alternate endings previews etc could fit on a blu ray disc this is a similar format war to what existed in the late s and early s vhs vs beta beta was a much higher quality format that offered a superior picture coincidentally it was also a sony technology as is blu ray but it lost out because the vhs format was less expensive in an age when price mattered and the entire concept of watching movies in the home was new so the new questions are is the viewing public willing to pay more for the player and the films to get a little better quality and potentially more features is the computer industry going to drive the technology having the potential to store gb on a single disc could make a difference in archival and data backup and could potentially drive the cost of blu ray down is either format going to last long enough to win the war the third question is kind of like your fad question there s no doubt in anyone s mind that high definition tv is here to stay there s also no doubt that people want to watch rented or purchased movies in hd the question then is how are they going to want to get them there is already talk of places like blockbuster online or net flix renting films via high speed internet download just as mp s are well on their way to replacing cd s a device similar to an hd dvr would be in the home and the film would download the viewer would be able to rewind fast forward and pause just like a dvd or dvr but after a certain timeframe the film would render itself unwatchable purchase of films in this manner is also being looked at the issues that exist there are piracy protection and download speeds to download a gb hd film including the dvd content would take hours or more through dsl and adoption of the technology will be slow to non existent if the film pauses and breaks up as the download continues during playback so the answer to your question is worth hundreds of billions of dollars to the various industries the people who make the tv s players blank media the film studios who make the movies the high speed internet service providers and everyone else involved in the industry Gramophone record MP3 Digital photography Enterprise content management Sound recording Digital rights management 8 mm video format MiniDisc Warez Camcorder Sony Broadband Internet access PlayStation 3 Karaoke Film Walkman ITunes Music Store Atari 8-bit family Windows Vista Commodore 64 Mixtape Wheel of Fortune Xbox 360 Nintendo Revolution ITunes Betamax Cable television PlayStation Portable Sega Dreamcast Macrovision Computer and video games Video CD Digital video recorder Microsoft Super Audio CD Xbox Television Digital Subscriber Line DualDisc Oscilloscope 8-track cartridge Nintendo GameCube ZX Spectrum Pornography Ebook Macromedia Flash Digital Audio Tape Online music store Modem Betacam Amstrad CPC Asynchronous Transfer Mode Super Nintendo Entertainment System Videotape Redundant array of independent disks Hard disk Ethernet S-VHS Computer Movie projector Photography USB flash drive Magnetic tape QuickTime Video codec Phonograph PlayStation 2 High fidelity Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Machinima Audiophile Vorbis Windows 2000 SCART CD-R Secure Digital card Windows XP Google Nintendo Gmail BBC Bluetooth Open source culture Podcasting Modchip
