user reviews of hearing aids they are largely pointless hearing is very subjective everyone has a different hearing loss and everyone responds differently to having a hearing loss every person with a hearing loss will respond differently to a hearing aid in the same way that i might like a bmw but you might prefer a lexus so from what i have seen web sites that try to compare hearing aids do a poor job i can find you a patient of mine who thinks the company i work for makes the best hearing aids in the world as i do but i can probably find another patient who had a bad experience and remember bad news always travels faster than good the true acid test is to get a hearing test and then have the hearing professional demonstrate some real hearing aids programmed to match your loss if the place you go cannot do this for you walk or run away then negotiate a free no obligation no fee trial of your hearing aids for at least a month see how you get on with them in the real world don't be afraid to shop around consider starkey audibel siemens resound widex oticon avoid phonak really avoid miracle ear or magnatone MP3 Hearing aid Insurance Audiophile Social rule Hearing impairment Clinical depression Food and Drug Administration A Course In Miracles M__ni__re___s disease Prostate cancer Duesberg hypothesis Decibel Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Podcasting Phonak Health insurance Bipolar disorder Economic inequality Biology and sexual orientation Baldness treatments Unemployment Milton H.
