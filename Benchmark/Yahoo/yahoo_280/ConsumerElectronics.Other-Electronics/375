flat cable help i'd be impressed if any one knows what i'm talking about i have a yamaha rs and i just got the aieb expansion board the first step in installation is to unplug the flat cable out of its connecter how do i do that flat cable or ribbon cable will most likely look like several wires next to each other in a neat row side by side usually grey in color but this can vary at both ends it should have a plastic connector for wider cables this is usually similar to molex keep in mind though that ribbon cable can also be a totally flat solid conductor in this case usually it should be brown or green in color and the end of the cable snap or slide into small plastic recepticles if this is the case review your intructions because these can be set in place by friction alone or with a clasp similar to the clasp on a all metal watch if you have the latter of these cables then the ends should have small brass conductors similar to what you would see on an old nes cartridge these are also prone to tearing so please be careful Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Drill bit Atari 8-bit family Ethernet Ribbon cable Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Coaxial cable IPod BS 1363 25-pair color code Television TIA-568A/B Typewriter SCART Floppy disk Xbox Ground and neutral Amstrad CPC IBM Selectric typewriter Seismic retrofit Spark plug High-voltage direct current Advanced Technology Attachment Solar cell Wire Bassoon Zipper Power cable Guitar Internal ballistics Universal Serial Bus Handloading Oscilloscope Loudspeaker Terminal ballistics Fuse (electrical) D-subminiature Transformer Glass Sega Saturn Circuit design Enigma machine Serial ATA Knitting Category 5 cable Printed circuit board Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Space elevator Electric power transmission Rail terminology Harp Casting Microphone DVD Skateboarding trick Welding Violin Marching band Jack plug Arcade cabinet Explosive material Trombone Super Nintendo Entertainment System Masonry Bicycle brake systems Mouse (computing) Dog agility Lightning rod Overhead powerline Gramophone record PlayStation Portable Earring RS-232 Computer cooling Electricity pylon Commodore 64 Glossary of climbing terms Saxophone Sinclair ZX81 RCA connector Sundial PlayStation 2 USB flash drive Game Boy Advance Optical fiber Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Antenna (radio) Electricity meter Dice Game Boy Material properties of diamond Three-phase electric power Plastic Dot matrix printer Rail tracks
