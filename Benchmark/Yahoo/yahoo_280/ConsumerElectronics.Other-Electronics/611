is it possible to do this with a dvd can i make some kind of program that i can burn onto a dvd which would allow me to play music files in a dvd player example if i had a bunch of mp music files in a folder on a dvd i would need some kind of dvd player compatible program to play these is it possible some dvd players have the ability to play mp 's just check your to see if your does i don't think you can have them in a folder because the dvd player has to see that the files are in mp format to bring up the music playing menu of course if you are using a computer dvd player it is not any different than a cd ITunes DVD Object Desktop Windows Vista ILife PlayStation Portable Windows 2000 File format Mac OS X Macintosh Finder Musical Instrument Digital Interface Disk image Stardock Mod (computer gaming) Karaoke Digital rights management System/36 System 6 Gmail Screenshot File system Macromedia Flash System 7 (Macintosh) History of the graphical user interface Comparison of media players Marching band Windows Explorer Cue sheet File Allocation Table Digital audio player Jon Lech Johansen Windows registry High-definition television Blu-ray Disc SonicStage CD recorder Mac OS history AmigaOS Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire DualDisc Xerox Star Start Menu MegaMan Battle Network 3 LiveCD Atari DOS Icon (computing) Library (computer science) MSN Messenger Fischer Random Chess File folder IPod MP3 ZX Spectrum Adobe Photoshop WordPerfect Spotlight (software) Computer Computer file Knoppix DVD-Audio Directory Source code Spatial file manager Video game music QuickTime Windows Me Video CD ZIP (file format) Universal Disk Format Module file Super Audio CD Hello world program Windows Media Video Resource fork DeCSS Laserdisc Mac OS Enterprise content management System/34 Menu (computing) Partition (computing) Regional lockout OpenOffice.org PlayStation 2 Lotus 1-2-3 Datatype Web page Podcasting Modchip Television Mouse (computing) C programming language Backup VHS DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution HFS Plus Apple Computer OS/2 Trusted computing
