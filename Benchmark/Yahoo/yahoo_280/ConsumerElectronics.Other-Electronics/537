new air conditioner feature i have this air conditioner and it has a remote on the air conditioner it says artic glacier on the remote there is a button it says follow me and when i push the follow me button a weird little face appears on the lcd of the remote can someone please tell me what the follow me feature does thank you very much i have figured out the answer i appreciate your answer too jc thank you the air conditioner sits in the window and yes you are right is a single unit when i press the follow me button on the remote and is on the remote only it will tell me the temperature via remote so if i go outside and take the remote with me it will tell me the temperature outside not what i have the air conditioner set too and also when i press that button a little kinda smiling kinda frowning face appears on the remote still working on what that is but i halfway got it thank you much i tried to look up information on your air conditioner but i could not find it all i can do at this point is offer you a guess on what that feature does i will first assume that this air conditioner is a single unit like a window unit or one that sits on the floor if this is the case then my guess is that the follow me feature will turn off the air conditioner unit when you leave the room and then turn it back on when you come back all by sensing the remote which would mean you would have to keep the remote on you that's my best guess if it isn't that try searching for the instruction manual online i'm sure that'll have the answer you are looking for hope that helps Mouse (computing) Windows XP Danger Hiptop Prank flash Modem Aerial (dance move) Solar power Professional wrestling holds Poker jargon Wheel of Fortune Windows 2000 Photography Canon T90 Password Ecco the Dolphin The Visitation Guilty Gear Escape from New York Angel One (TNG episode) Xbox Syphon Filter HVAC Sega Dreamcast The Doctor Dances Japanese toilet Nintendo Revolution Saints and Soldiers ITunes Jumpstart 3rd Grade IPod Screenshot X10 (industry standard) IP (complexity) The Chemical Brothers Forth programming language Datalore (TNG episode) Visual Basic Physical paradox Eggerland series Whose Line Is It Anyway?
