mxr chorus problem i have the mxr stereo chorus pedal and whenever i plug it in i get a lot of noise as if i plugged in a high gain distortion flipped it on and had no volume on my guitar essentially i have a large amount of hiss is there anything i can do to eliminate this thanks it sounds like you have either a broken or a shorted wire in the cable to the pedal normally the problem is near one end or the other it's nor hard to repair this type of problem maybe you feel you can fix it yourself if not take it to a shop it shouldn't be an expensive fix Effects pedal Gramophone record Tony Banks (musician) Electric guitar Effects unit Zakk Wylde Bicycle brake systems Jack plug Electronic amplifier Harp Audiophile Piano Sound recording Loudspeaker Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Guitar Domestic AC power plugs and sockets FM broadcasting Vacuum tube Laserdisc Gas metal arc welding Microphone Bass guitar Headphones Transformer Fuse (electrical) Universal Serial Bus RCA connector Musical Instrument Digital Interface High fidelity IPod Welding Modem Hi-hat Atari 8-bit family Diving Spark plug Sound effect Multitrack recording Carburetor Digital photography Tom Morello Coaxial cable Fuel injection Hearing aid Back to the Future Advanced Technology Attachment Enigma machine The Church BS 1363 Digital circuit Commodore 64 Seismometer Ethernet The Jam Reel-to-reel audio tape recording Earthing system Mattress Dither Naval mine Matthew Bellamy Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Tire Phonograph Microeconomics Dimebag Darrell Operational amplifier Drill bit Stereoscopy Motorcycle Electric power transmission Helicopter Manual transmission Cable television Pedal steel guitar Bicycle Magnetic cartridge TIA-568A/B Personal computer Time Out of Mind GunZ The Duel Submarine communications cable Overhead lines Gothic rock MP3 Radio controlled airplane Guitar/synthesizer Radar Embedded system Knife Grunge music Wah-wah High-definition television Mutual fund Electrophysiology Federal Standard 1037C Electro-Harmonix D-subminiature Walkman
