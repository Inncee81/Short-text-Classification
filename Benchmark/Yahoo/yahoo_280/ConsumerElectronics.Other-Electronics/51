how can i get rid of background noise caused by the power cord on my laptop i use my laptop like a big i pod playing music on it through a simple mixer amp when the laptop is unplugged the sound is unaltered but when plugged in an intermittant buzz hum can be heard simply leaving it unplugged is not an option what you should do is plug the laptops power cord into a surge protector that has an emi rfi noise filter the noise you are hearing is probably coming through the electrical lines into the notebook and then translated via interference to the audio signal there are quite a few surge protectors with noise filters on the market so i'm sure you'll be able to find one that fits your needs well i didn't include a link to an example one only because i am not sure of what else you are going to plug into it but again i believe you will find one easily i hope that helps Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Laptop Radio frequency interference Audiophile Power strip Universal Serial Bus Bass guitar IPod Hearing aid Jack plug Mixing console BS 1363 Sound effect Loudspeaker Microphone Gramophone record Mouse (computing) Electric guitar Modem Decibel X10 (industry standard) Low-pass filter Electronic amplifier Stereoscopy Hard disk Synthesizer Disc jockey Headphones Transformer Effects unit Television TRS-80 Software-defined radio Spark plug Laserdisc Oscilloscope Nirvana (band) Signal-to-noise ratio FM broadcasting Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Personal computer Radar Analog-to-digital converter Sound recording Commodore 64 Roxette Digital-to-analog converter Wi-Fi Compact audio cassette Fuse (electrical) Weighting filter Bluetooth Electronics Federal Standard 1037C PowerBook Electronic filter RCA connector Diode Static inverter plant Sonar Morse Code Dolby Laboratories NTSC Power cord Telecommunication Karaoke Atari 8-bit family Ground (electricity) Apple Macintosh FL Studio IBM PC compatible Electric motor Balanced audio DIN connector Dolby noise reduction system Vocoder Operational amplifier The Church Hearing impairment Kraftwerk SCART Buddy Guy Kenwood Electronics Dither Circuit design Sound Compact disc Super Audio CD Subtractive synthesis Effects pedal Sound card Phase-locked loop Desknote Stereophonic sound Phonograph Protoss B-47 Stratojet
