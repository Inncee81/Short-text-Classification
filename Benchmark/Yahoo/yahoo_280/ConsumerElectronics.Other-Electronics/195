my cd player separate is broken but i don't want to dump it could it be mended and if not recycled i have a phillips separate cd player that is very old i think maybe years old and served me very well until last year when it started stopping a cd when in the middle of playing it and then sometimes not playing it at all i would love it get it mended does anyone know of a company that repairs cd players any info at all re this if not can it be recycled and where should i take it i'm in bristol england another question if i do need to get a new one is it more enviro friendly to use a stereo separates system or to play music through an mp player or through a laptop thank you i had a kenwood one that stopped reading cds properly so i took it apart and turned the little screw on the back of the laser head slightly clockwise not too much only about a th of the way round and it strengthened the beam and made it read them fine don't know if this would work with yours but if you have a dvd player you could just use that you just need a cable that's long enough to go from the player to the stereo and plug it in the same way as the cd player did as long as it used the standard red white audio leads Compact disc Laserdisc DualDisc DVD Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis High fidelity Copy protection Gramophone record Timpani Pioneer Corporation Sound recording Movie projector IPod Musical Instrument Digital Interface Universal Serial Bus Snooker Volleyball High-definition television Contract bridge Xbox Carburetor Multitrack recording MiniDisc VHS Blu-ray Disc Digital audio player Jack plug Windows XP Compact audio cassette Game Boy Tag Television Super Audio CD Microphone Walkman Violin $ale of the Century Lighting Monopoly (game) Seven-card stud The Beatles discography Car audio The Pet Sounds Sessions Kenwood Electronics Audiophile D-subminiature Sega Dreamcast Phonograph Floppy disk NTSC Buffalo Bills Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Double bass Wheel of Fortune Baroque chess Sega CD R-Type Mahjong S-Video New York Giants Poker jargon CD-R Oscilloscope 8-track cartridge Mouse (computing) Mao (game) Clarinet Stereoscopy Rugby union I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Chicago White Sox Phonograph cylinder Thermal power station Nintendo Entertainment System SCART S/PDIF Tic-Tac-Dough Outpost 2 Floyd Rose Cello Drill bit Mazda 323 Enterprise content management Dolby Laboratories English cricket team Battlefield 2 Billiards Aluminium The Amber Spyglass DVD player New York Knicks Pump It Up Laser Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory
