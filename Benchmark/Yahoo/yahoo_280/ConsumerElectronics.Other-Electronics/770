free cable i recently purchased high speed internet to replace my slow dsl service i am a usual ota over the air user so i have never had cable after the guys ran new cable into my house and hooked up my modem i decided to hook it up to my tv for fun to my surprise i had basic cable then i took it to another level i bought a cheap dvr from a friend who wanted to get rid of it it has an hd tuner when i hooked it all up to my inhdtv i found i received channels including hdtv channels i tripple checked my account and verified i am only paying for internet how is it that i have cable the only problems i have is getting my dvr to load the correct time and tv schedule should i do anything about it or just see how it goes not so just because you get internet through your cable company it doesn't mean you get basic cable also the signals travel through the same coaxial wire but they are entirely different types of signals the cable guy can turn on off tv and or internet service at your cable box he has accidentally left your tv service in the on position morally you should call and tell them so they come turn it off what you do is up to you also i don't know why you would get extra and hi def channels just because you hooked up a dvr with a hi def tuner i think they just hooked up the full package and didn't realize it when they ran in your internet sometimes that happens when a technician gets your account confused with someone else he's doing that day happens more than you think eventually they may find out and shut the other services off it's up to you if you want to wait until that day or go ahead and call them to do the right thing now Cable television TiVo Digital video recorder Broadband Internet access High-definition television Ethernet Oscilloscope Modem Digital Subscriber Line Home Box Office Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Teletext Xbox Telegraphy IBM PC compatible Integrated Services Digital Network Direct broadcast satellite Digital television Broadband Internet fraud Poker jargon Television Set-top box Cable modem Embedded system Voice over IP Telephone DVD Spyware The Amazing Race Loudspeaker Television in the United States Bluetooth Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Satellite television Coaxial cable Media in Canada Power line communication Phreaking Windows XP Carburetor RS-232 CPU cache Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis British Sky Broadcasting SCART Microsoft Atari 8-bit family DOCSIS Action potential Visual Basic Austar Chorus Communications TGV AmigaOS Telephone exchange Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATI Technologies GSM services System/36 Etisalat Cheating in Counter-Strike Commodore 64 Airport Spam (electronic) Private branch exchange BBC Amiga Pirate decryption Transmission line Sega Dreamcast Atari ST StarChoice Python programming language LiveJournal Gross domestic product IP Multimedia Subsystem Amateur radio IEEE 802.11 Java programming language Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Professional wrestling holds Digital audio broadcasting Cray-1 Railway signalling Customer relationship management Redundant array of independent disks PlayStation 2 Wind turbine Freeview Web hosting Soap opera
