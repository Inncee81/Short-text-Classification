what is the difference between a neon sign and a led sign i plan on placing a sign on the window the sun shines a lot on the window what would be better to get what is the difference please help thank you so would you go with a http www signwholesale com product info php cpath products id or b http www jantecneon com mm merchant mvc or c http www signwholesale com product info php products id as far as visibility goes both are highly visible neon has a nostalgia about it so if your business is also nostalgic i suggest neon neon is more expensive and requires proper maintenance when it goes bad led signs would probably be recycled if they went bad after the warranty unless you can purchase a maintenance agreement neon is a gas lamp which requires a high voltage ballast to light the ballast is similar to the ones used in flourescent lighting the ballast will require service and the neon tube itself might need service from time to time if it gets cracked this requires someone who knows how to work on this kind of sign led signs use what are called light emitting diodes light emitting diodes have a very long life compared to other kinds of lamps the best way to protect an led display is to keep the lettering moving or flash the display periodically don't just leave it lit steadily unless you don't wish to change the message on it led displays do have one drawback their electronics are more likely to be damaged by power spikes than the neon circuits would so the led display should be used with an appropriate surge protector or in a building with surge protection built into the breaker box for the led display make sure there is a high brightness to it and good contrast in other words brightly lit leds on a pitch black colored background red and orange colored leds or changing colors such as red yellow and green would probably get the most attention Fluorescent lamp Lighting Diode Incandescent light bulb Traffic light Vacuum tube Bicycle lighting Neon Laser Color Plasma display Compact fluorescent lamp Neon lamp Cathode ray tube Neon sign Electrodeless lamp Light Mouse (computing) Fluorescence Solar power Liquid crystal display Welding Semiconductor device Stage lighting Oscilloscope Xenon flash lamp Organic light-emitting diode Mercury-vapor lamp Transformer Ultraviolet Solar cell Photoelectric effect Aurora (astronomy) Christmas lights Relay Fuse (electrical) Helium Xenon Light pollution Laser diode Rail terminology Sodium vapor lamp Geissler tube Color temperature Spark gap Ballast (electrical) Ceramics Transmitter Digital Solar variation Black body Service life Circuit breaker Circuit design Fire alarm control panel Nuclear power Operational amplifier Street light Gallium arsenide Plasma (physics) Electric light High-voltage direct current Sega Saturn Pedestrian crossing Electronic amplifier Transistor Spacecraft propulsion Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Gamut Piccadilly Circus Radiation hardening Citgo Infrared Battery electric vehicle Animal communication Light gun Color blindness Railway signal Current source Ionizing radiation Gmail Enigma machine Phosphorus Thermographic camera United States dollar Haloalkane Flashlight Game Boy Diamond
