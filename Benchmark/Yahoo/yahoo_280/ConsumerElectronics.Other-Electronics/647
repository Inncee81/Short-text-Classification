do batteries run longer when they are frozen no they'll run longest when they're warm freezing them increases their capacity for the duration that they remain cold but doesn't help and in fact hinders extraction of their current if you keep them cold until you use them you'll better preserve whatever charge exists in them once you start using them however you want them warm so that you can extract the greatest percentage of current they hold you can never extract all of the juice in a battery you're only drawing it down to some percentage of its capacity you want that capacity to be the greatest while you're storing it for use but you want to be able to decrease that capacity as you draw down the current to squeeze the most out of it let's say that the battery will never discharge more than of its capacity if the capacity is when cold and when warm will be units of the former and units of the latter you'll get more units out of the battery if you can decrease its capacity as you're using it there's also aspects relating to the amount and flow of current that are addressed by the physics of hot and cold and electron excitability but i'm definitely not the right person to address that for a casual answer Battery (electricity) Lithium ion battery Water (molecule) Energy development Action potential Solar power Future energy development Renewable energy Heat Nickel-cadmium battery Nuclear power Drowning Wind power Circuit design Vitamin C Fuel cell Carbon dioxide Carburetor Aurora (astronomy) Capacitor Thermal power station CPU cache Nickel metal hydride Plasma (physics) Energy Ocean thermal energy conversion Current (electricity) Cold fusion Langmuir probe Water Fluorescent lamp Permittivity Supply and demand Global warming Diode Solar cell Entropy Technetium Brewery George W.
