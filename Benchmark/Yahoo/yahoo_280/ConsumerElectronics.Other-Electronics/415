can i connect a v device to a v power strip that rating is a max voltage rating you will be fine be sure not to overload the strip with more amperage draw than it or the receptical is rated for most home circuits are rated for around to a check the strip for the maximum draw Circuit breaker Fuse (electrical) Circuit design Diode Capacitor Resistor Relay High-voltage direct current Transistor Oscilloscope SCSI Universal Serial Bus Volt Battery (electricity) Electrical generator RS-232 Current (electricity) Power strip Federal Standard 1037C Central processing unit Electric motor Operational amplifier Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Tesla coil Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Voltage source Transformer Short circuit Loudspeaker Variable Frequency Drive Antenna (radio) Power (physics) Incandescent light bulb Vacuum tube Three-phase electric power Impedance matching Digital circuit Output impedance Logic gate Solar cell Residual-current device Input impedance Third rail Voltage regulator Digital-to-analog converter MOSFET Inductor Potentiometer Ohm's law Carburetor Switched-mode power supply Power line communication Phantom power Alternating current Linear regulator BS 1363 Gas metal arc welding Dimmer Electrical wiring Electrical element Overhead lines Electricity distribution Current loop Extension Cord Electronics Low voltage differential signaling Direct current Liquid crystal display 2003 North America blackout Comic strip Static inverter plant Hydraulic machinery Spark gap CMOS 7400 series Analog-to-digital converter Voltmeter Light switch Current source Light-emitting diode Peltier-Seebeck effect Accelerated Graphics Port Overclocking Power factor correction Zener diode Standing wave ratio General Packet Radio Service Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Decibel Lithium ion battery Stage lighting Ring circuit DMX (lighting) Programmable logic controller Synthesizer Digital Visual Interface Overhead powerline Electrical network 100BASE-TX Logic families
