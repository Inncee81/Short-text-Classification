sandisk sansa e who has one and what do you think of it i was attracted to this mp player because it has gb of flash memory and its only i have a few questions to anyone who owns one or knows about it it has a microsd slot is there a limit on the size of the card i will probably get a gb to start with will it support hd sd cards what is the actual battery life on this unit does it have playlist setup features like the ipod can i use it with itunes just let me know what you like dont like pros and cons of this device im looking for a replacement for my gb nano how would you compare this device to an ipod nano in my opinion its more bang for the buck considering the nano is for an gb model do you think the sansa is better how is the sound quality i have an e which is the gb version i actually chose it over the nano because it was cheaper at the time i was coming off a rio chiba and all my music is in wma format going to apple would've necessitated converting all my music to aac to be played on the nano the sansa will not work with itunes would be nice if it could but apple probably won't let that happen the battery life is pretty good i only kept track of it once and it was like hours i use it during my afternoon commute and a couple of evenings a week and only charge it about every two weeks about microsdhc i answered another question about this and found that sandisk plans on releasing a new firmware for the sansa connect a different model that will support microsdhc so it's within the realm of possibility microsdhc could come to the e series from what i have found the biggest microsd card you can use is gb in a year of ownership i haven't needed to use a microsd card in fact i am only using gb but i'm weird i use the fm radio periodically i have used the fm radio recorder twice i have used the voice recorder once and only to see if it worked the sansa e series plays video it is easy to use sandisk's software to convert the video to the motion jpeg format the player uses but it is hard to get video in the first place all videos and podcasts seem to be made with the ipod in mind so it's hard to get that content for a sansa i ended up having to screenscrape a video by using camstudio and that technique doesn't always work so the extra features are nice but not all that useful the sansas are good players but i think if someone is already using an ipod they should probably stick with apple IPod nano Walkman Vorbis Apple Computer Digital audio player MP3 FairPlay Podcasting Secure Digital card IPod shuffle PlayStation Portable Apple Macintosh Flash memory QuickTime Online music store Floppy disk Disc jockey Nintendo DS Atari ST Digital rights management Atari 8-bit family IMac Memory Stick USB flash drive Apple IIGS Gramophone record CompactFlash Sound Blaster Archos Verizon Wireless H.264/MPEG-4 AVC FireWire Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DVD Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mouse (computing) Game Boy Apple II family SonicStage Winamp MiniDisc Xbox PlayStation 3 Radeon Advanced Audio Coding Video game music Rhapsody (online music service) Windows Vista RealNetworks Computer Apple Newton Music radio Amiga ATI Technologies Poker jargon Macromedia Flash Extreme Programming Multimedia Card Laptop Tungsten Handheld Apple typography PC Engine IPAQ Memory card High-definition television Redundant array of independent disks SmartMedia Nintendo 64 We Belong Together Commodore 64 Sound card Computer and video games Game controller PlayStation 2 PowerBook Iriver Musical Instrument Digital Interface WNNX (FM) Laserdisc This Week in Tech Streaming media Handheld game console System 7 (Macintosh) Common Unix Printing System Slot machine Creative Nomad Universal Serial Bus Sega Dreamcast
