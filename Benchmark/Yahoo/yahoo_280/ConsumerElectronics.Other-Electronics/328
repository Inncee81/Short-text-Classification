how come the volume button on a radio makes the sound go louder i am sure there is a very easy explanation for this but how does it work i have no idea you see you're asking a serious question so i'll give you a serious answer let's start with you how do you go louder answer you move a greater volume of air through your vocal chords want proof stand in front of a mirror with your mouth about an inch away and gently go hahahahahahahahahahahaha as gently and quietly as you can see any moisture on the mirror maybe a little but not much now repeat the experiment and this time go hahahahahahahahahahahaha as loudly as you can turn up the volume see the moisture on the glass proof positive that more air came through the volume control is well named because it refers to how much inside a radio the radio waves are converted into electrical impulses which vary in step with the radio wave and are connected by wires to a loud speaker actually the wires are connected to a magnet in the back of the speaker so that the magnetic field now varies in step with the electrical impulses the magnet in turn is near a piece of metal or other magnetic material which moves back and forth in step with the changing magnetic field so we now have electrical impulses turned into a mechanical action back and forth or in and out motion the last step is connection with the speaker cone made of thin material that pushes the air in front of it again in step with he magnetic material and we hear sound inside you your vocal chords are the speaker cone the wires connected to them are nerve cells running from your brain which sends electrical signals that duplicate the sound your brain wants you to make you also send signals to the lungs to apply a greater or lesser volume of air across the vocal chords to control loudness in the radio some of the electricity tells the speaker exactly what movements to make to reproduce a sound and some electricity tells the speaker how loud to make it send more electricity it gets louder send less and it gets softer its all about the volume of power being supplied in the radio the signals for what sound to make and the signals for how loud to make it all come into the speaker as one pulse of energy the exact ways of doing this vary from one piece of equipment to another in some the amplifier the part that sends out the power and pulses to the speaker runs wide open all the time the volume control acts like a flood gate that controls how much gets through to the speaker what happens to the unused power it turns into heat and is vented into the air in this method the volume control is really an attenuator which is to say a device that reduces power literally an attenuator that is off blocks nothing at all all the power gets through this is why old fashioned radios had volume control knobs that actually were hot to the touch otherwise some equipment actually builds up more power to make things louder the volume control tells the equipment to make more power i hope this helps for more detailed information and helpful illustrations see this http electronics howstuffworks com amplifier htm i hope this helps Radar Oscilloscope Synthesizer Electric motor Sound recording Radio Light Electrophysiology Solar cell Welding Electronic amplifier Seismometer Spacecraft propulsion Digital circuit Circuit design Transistor Electric guitar Tesla coil Phonograph Violin Capacitor Digital Diode Hearing aid Audiophile Transmitter Movie projector Piezoelectricity Relay Gramophone record Floppy disk Stage lighting Electronic filter Nuclear magnetic resonance Decibel Switch Antenna (radio) Electrical wiring Sun Electronics Mouse (computing) Naval mine Audio level compression Functional magnetic resonance imaging Electricity Optical fiber Vacuum Coaxial cable Laser Carburetor Railgun Stereophonic sound Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Echo chamber Fluorescent lamp TGV Sound Lightning Directed-energy weapon Magnetic field Musical Instrument Digital Interface X10 (industry standard) Color Internal combustion engine Speed of light Fusion power Mixing console Electromagnetic radiation Federal Standard 1037C Alternating current Potentiometer Energy development Ethernet Semiconductor device Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Marching band Internal ballistics Effects unit Current (electricity) Resonance Urinary incontinence Electronic organ
