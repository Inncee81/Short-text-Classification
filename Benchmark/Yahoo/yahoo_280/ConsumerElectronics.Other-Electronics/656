wireless power output i have a really week signal in my house and i have a linksys wireless range extender there i was wondering how i could make my own antenna amplifier to help boost a little bit of both reciving and sending i am aware that there is a legal limit and that doing this will not help as much as i think but i would like to try it out so if there was a way to make like a watt amp for the antenna that would be nice thanks i can get a signal in multiple places but the place i have the repeater is the best signal and it still isnt much the only other place i can think of putting it is hanging it out the window the wireless signal is comeing somewhere but the odd thing is that of the time im the only one using it i get like unbievible speeds when good signal kbps and i havnt been able to track down the house its coming from if it is maybe you can accomplish something by amplifying the signal but would it be easier to try combination of the wires with wireless access point for example you can have your router in the basement and connect it with network wire to access point on the second floor Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 Wireless access point Antenna (radio) Modem Electronic amplifier Cellular network Loudspeaker Cable television Operational amplifier Radar Router Broadband Internet access X10 (industry standard) Bluetooth Federal Standard 1037C Transformer AirPort Transmitter Telegraphy Universal Serial Bus Xbox Amateur radio Oscilloscope Global Positioning System Decibel Internet Audiophile Communications satellite Electrophysiology Television Citizens' band radio Power line communication TGV Instrument amplifier DVD Software-defined radio PlayStation 3 Central processing unit Bass guitar Telephone Code division multiple access Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Electric motor Very Long Baseline Interferometry Wardenclyffe Tower Overhead lines VHF omnidirectional range Transistor RS-232 Crystal radio receiver Sound recording General Packet Radio Service Coaxial cable PlayStation Portable Tesla coil Telephone tapping Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Wireless mesh network SCART MIM-23 Hawk Voice over IP Kenwood Electronics Circuit design Phase-shift keying Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Amplifier Digital Subscriber Line VFO Resistor Time-division multiplexing Morse Code History of radio Direction finding IS-95 Ultra wideband WiMAX Wireless Cisco Systems Galileo spacecraft Computer Wardriving Electric guitar History of radar Satellite television Mobile phone radiation and health Verizon Wireless Global System for Mobile Communications Analog computer Computer network Space-time block code Field-programmable gate array Vacuum tube Apollo Guidance Computer
