will foreign bought gadgets work in the uk i am off to tokyo in a few days and wondered if electrical bits and pieces bought in tokyo would work over the in uk i am thinking along the lines of mp players mobile phones etc i appreciate i may have to buy uk pin plugs cables once i get home but apart from that would there be any difference as for the mobile phones i understand tokyo is tri band so am i right in thinking an unlocked mobile from tokyo would work in the uk the things you have to check is not the number of pins on the power plug but the voltage it runs on uk is v on the mains ac and the frequency per second rated in hertz which the uk is other places may run on hertz but some places sell converters for that also you can buy step down transformers for volts ac but below that or above v it starts to get expensive Analog-to-digital converter Transformer Diode Three-phase electric power Universal Serial Bus Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Modem Electric power transmission Digital circuit Electricity distribution Electrical resistance Decibel Variable Frequency Drive Musical Instrument Digital Interface SCART Fuse (electrical) High-voltage hazards Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Oscilloscope Capacitor Radio Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Enigma machine Airsoft Microphone RS-232 Mains electricity Toyota Prius Circuit design Impedance matching Digital-to-analog converter War of Currents Electric motor Operational amplifier Transistor High-voltage direct current Electricity pylon Antenna (radio) Sinclair ZX81 Solar cell Sega GSM services Switched-mode power supply Audiophile X10 (industry standard) Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital Visual Interface Fluorescent lamp Battery electric vehicle Embedded system Telephone Photoelectric effect NBC Loudspeaker Battery (electricity) Cruising (maritime) Power cord Ohm's law Electrical generator Telephone tapping Athlon Incandescent light bulb Nominal impedance Gross domestic product Power line communication Wi-Fi Lineman (occupation) Rapid transit Spark gap Vacuum tube Bluetooth Power (physics) Adapter Electric power Electricity meter Overclocking Resistor Thermostat Nintendo Entertainment System Jack plug Overhead powerline Power strip Impedance Chess strategy and tactics IS-95 Ford Motor Company InterCity Express Broadband Internet access Low-pass filter Athlon 64 Virgin Mobile Central processing unit Power supply Cellular network Uninterruptible power supply
