some websites say you can recharge your regular batteries have you done this i have a few battery chargers and i'm thinking of sticking some of my non rechargeable batteries in it just to see what happens has anyone ever done that i accidentally stuck my rechargeable alkalines in an nimh charger if i remember correctly and they were ruined now i'd like to try to charge my non rechargeable alkalines i've seen special charges on the internet for this purpose but i'd like to try the chargers i already have there have been products claiming to recharge regular alkaline batteries out for years even before real rechargeable batteries basically they don't work all batteries work by chemical action the chemistry inside a rechargeable battery has been designed to be reversed when a current is put through in the reverse direction this returns the chemicals to their original state ready to be used again the chemistry in a regular alkaline battery has not been designed to be reversible running a current through them in the reverse direction will not restore the chemicals to their original state it could cause the batteries to leak or catch fire it's not safe Nickel-cadmium battery Nickel metal hydride Battery (electricity) Bicycle lighting Battery electric vehicle Alkali Game Boy Advance SP Lithium ion battery Fuel cell Toyota Prius Dodge Charger Lithium ion polymer battery Airsoft PlayStation Portable Laptop Artillery Hybrid vehicle Automobile Electric boat Ammonia Halo: Combat Evolved Fire extinguisher Hydrogen peroxide Hydride Hot Wheels San Diego Chargers IPod Base (chemistry) Lead-acid battery AlphaSmart Protoss Water purification Thermal power station USS S-42 (SS-153) Hydrochloric acid Electrode Cincinnati Bengals Action potential Ford Ranger EV New York Giants USS S-37 (SS-142) Internal ballistics Chemistry Oplan Bojinka Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Plutonium Dishwasher Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder National Weather Service Headlight Nintendo DS Dosimeter M60 machine gun ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity Incandescent light bulb Hand grenade Autonomous building Anode Mars Exploration Rover Glossary of American football Smoke detector RuneScape skills Vacuum tube Apple Computer Electrophysiology Universal Serial Bus Shell (projectile) Explosive material Lewis Urry USS Silversides (SS-236) Xbox 360 Enzyme Error-tolerant design Torpedo USS S-38 (SS-143) Pittsburgh Steelers Second Battle of the Atlantic Lumber Virgin Mobile Honda Insight Alkaline Trio Sulfuric acid Electrical generator Manual transmission Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Unterseeboot 505 USS S-44 (SS-155) Molecular nanotechnology Ionizing radiation Green Lantern Sulfur Technetium Energy development RX-78 mobile suit series Walkman Michael Faraday Cosmic Era technology
