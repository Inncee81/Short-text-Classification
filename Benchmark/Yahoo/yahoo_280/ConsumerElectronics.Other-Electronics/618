i'm making an emergency kit for my house what all should be in it i am going to make an emergency kit for my home what should be in it just in case a hurricane or some natural disaster hits and power is lost or we are trepped what should go in every kit thanks for your time and all answers are greatly appreciated the first thing you should always have is a flashlight most of you probably already do blankets if you have children you should have more than one because you need to keep warm and it is dangerous to sit for a long period of time in a running car first aid kit my kit has band aids large bandages medical tape neosporin peroxide alcohol pads ace bandages and burn cream hand warmers these are little packet things that you can get at most places that sell camping gear food i carry mre's meal ready to eat you can get them at most military surplus stores water in a lot of climates if you are stuck for a while the water will freeze but most of the time it should be fine chains if you live where there is a lot of snow chains might be something you want to carry just in case a tow strap if you get stuck you want to make sure if anyone stops to help you that they can pull you out they won't always have the equipment for that so having one on hand helps extra socks hats gloves and coats you might not always have your coat with you during the day but if you are stuck it will be super cold come night time extra socks will be needed if your feet get wet if you have a baby extra diapers wipes and formula these are always nice to have on hand even if it's not an emergency situation here are the items you should always have available fresh water on average assume you'll need at least two quarts of water per day per person that's the minimum you should store for drinking don't forget about your pets too store water in clean plastic containers bottled gallon jugs of water from the supermarket are good choices food human beings can live for quite a long time without food as long as they are adequately hydrated however it's important to your health and comfort that you keep some food on hand for emergencies opt for canned goods which have a reasonably long shelf life and are generally safe from rodents or bugs choose items that are palatable cold as you may not have fuel for heating you might also consider survival packs or military packaged meals that are sold in sporting good or army surplus stores warmth if the power goes out you may need to provide some warmth for your family stash a few blankets in your box as well as some waterproof matches you might even want to consider some extra warm clothing such as sweatshirts or jackets hats gloves and scarves are a good idea if your climate gets cold in the winter sanitation basic hygiene and sanitation should still be maintained include some antiseptic gel premoistened wipes and toilet paper tools don't forget the basics like a flashlight extra batteries pliers hammer nails and radio a compass might be useful if you intend to spend some time on foot you should also pack a can opener and a knife a flare and a whistle can be used to signal rescuers so include them in the kit basic first aid equipment like bandages splints tape and pain relievers should also be part of your emergency supplies remember food expires batteries die and moths can eat through blankets check your supplies once a year to ensure that everything is safe and maintained replace anything that's old non working or expired one flashlight electric torch with batteries spare batteries one pair trauma
