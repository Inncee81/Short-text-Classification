why does paypal need my phone number i want to sign up for paypal but if i give them my phone number will they call my house or something i don't want to get any calls from them so not sure thanks when a non paypal member wishes to make a purchase they are presented with mandatory fields to enter their telephone number for paypal members this option may be turned off indeed there is a warning that turning it on may have a negative effect on conversion to sale ie people don't always want to give their number why can't i turn this off for non paypal members the option does not control the information on the billing page the phone number is mandatory for credit card payments just like a credit card company would call to see if a transaction is valid we sometimes do the same thing and contact the customer to verify they actually initiated the transaction the option in the profile controls the final payment page where a customer is asked for a phone number if it is set to on Internet fraud PayPal Credit card Phishing Electronic money Something Awful Data retention Electronic commerce Surveillance Phone sex EFTPOS GSM services Octopus card Skype Credit card fraud Bluetooth Micropayment Plame affair Password Telephone exchange Gmail North American Numbering Plan Insurance Automatic teller machine MetroCard The Amazing Race Minitel Auto insurance Plame affair timeline Smart card Telephone tapping Database management system Customer relationship management MapleStory Bank Mergers and acquisitions IP Multimedia Subsystem Digital rights management E-gold Phone fraud Telephone card Bank fraud Telephone Vending machine Probation officer Payphone VeriSign EasyGroup Advance fee fraud Subscription business model Credit score Western Union Wachovia Vertical service code Surreal number Lawyer Vodafone Ocean's Twelve Social rule Telephone directory Microeconomics Minimum wage Euro Online shop Direct marketing Debit card Emergency telephone number Database marketing XML MSN Messenger Mail Winning Streak Monetary policy Legal tender Record label Musical Instrument Digital Interface Stock Loyalty program Identity theft Modem Article One of the United States Constitution Credit history Best Buy Toll-free telephone number Filling station John Kerr Citigroup Telephone numbering plan United Kingdom corporation tax Phreaking Liberty Dollar Poker jargon Verizon Wireless Mortgage Taxation in the United States TransUnion
