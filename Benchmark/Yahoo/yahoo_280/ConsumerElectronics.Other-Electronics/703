can i use a blank dvd r disc to store mkv and mp files i've tried to burn my video files onto the disc so i could watch them on a bigger screen but it doesn't work i've given up btw if anyone knows how to burn the files on to watch with a portable dvd player that would be awesome anyway i am now trying to just store the mkv and mp files on a blank cd but cds don't have enough space on them i noticed that dvd r discs hold gb so i'd much rather put my files there would it still work i hope my explanation isn't too confusing thanks for your answers yeah why not all you need to do is open your dvd burning software and select data dvd as your template then you drag and drop i do this with my shows all the time to conserve space even though i have over tb episodes of shows esspecially dual audio mkv files anime and full motion video can be storage intensive just remember to take insane care of them because mp and mkv modified mp divx xvid are very touchy on error correction and a very minor scratch can make a video completely unusable learned the hard way this is why the dvd format was designed for mpeg layer video because it is a much more forgiving format this has a lot to do with keyframes which are set by your encoder when you encoded yoru files DVD Video codec Floppy disk Laserdisc MP3 ITunes Digital rights management CD-ROM DivX H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Disk image Blu-ray Disc Copy protection Gramophone record XviD Warez Ebook Macromedia Flash Digital audio player IPod MiniDisc PlayStation 3 QuickTime DualDisc CD-R Sega Dreamcast Super Video CD Ripping Movie projector Video CD Hard disk Ogg PlayStation Portable NTSC Creative Zen ZX Spectrum Screenshot Compact audio cassette USB flash drive MPEG-2 Xbox 360 Apple Computer Enterprise content management PC Engine PlayStation 2 AmigaOS Windows XP AVI Nintendo GameCube OpenDocument Digital video CD recorder Podcasting Acorn Electron High-definition television Atari 8-bit family Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Apple II family JPEG DVD-RAM Mouse (computing) Library (computer science) Moving Picture Experts Group GIF Windows 2000 NTFS File format Computer virus TiVo Sega Saturn Advanced Audio Coding Super Audio CD PNG Redundant array of independent disks Xbox Knoppix Poker jargon Television XML Commodore 64 Walkman Data compression VHS SMPTE time code WavPack Virtual memory MP2 (format) File Allocation Table Digital video recorder
