someone help with finding my zune palyer so recently i was watching on tv and there was this story of finding lost ipods so thsese undercover detectives went to a store claiming to have found an ipod and the cashiers checks in the serial and it gets out the name of the owner nuber and house address but my problem is that my zune player was stolen and i was just asking if its possible to track it just like how the stolen ipods are found by tracking them is there any way i can get can get back my zune player just like those ones who lost their ipods and got them back i have an account for the zune and the player zune has an account and it doesn't make sense for me to have it when its lost one thing that always helps is to contact the manufacturer in this case microsoft so they can enter your information into the a file granted it will only be really helpful if you have the serial number but if someone else calls in with that model and s n it would also be noted they may not call you back but you call call in periodically to see if the person that stole it called in for support IPod ITunes Apple Computer IPod shuffle IPod nano Digital rights management Redundant array of independent disks Digital audio player Podcasting Domain Name System Death Note Windows XP FairPlay Hard disk MP3 Walkman Creative Zen Computer virus IPod photo Vorbis Online music store MiniDisc Apple Macintosh USB flash drive Copy protection QuickTime Musical Instrument Digital Interface CPU cache Universal Serial Bus Gramophone record Apple typography The Inside Phishing Password Collision detection XML Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act IPod mini Bluetooth Library (computer science) Internet fraud Object-SQL mapping Identity theft Blackjack E-mail RealNetworks Unified Modeling Language Mach kernel Plame affair Gmail Automatic number plate recognition RFID AmigaOS FireWire Mouse (computing) The Daleks' Master Plan Diablo II: Lord of Destruction File Allocation Table Sender Policy Framework Sin City Ocean's Twelve Anonymous remailer Blue screen of death Steve Jobs Bank fraud Poker jargon Advanced Audio Coding Database management system Microsoft .NET Floppy disk Atari 8-bit family MSN Messenger Game Boy Advance The End of the World (Doctor Who) Virtual memory Intellectual property Chess terminology Compact audio cassette Whois Flat file database Glossary of partner dance terms Audio data compression Database normalization Patent RuneScape cheats James Hanratty DVD Prostate cancer Day of the Daleks Steam (content delivery) A Simple Plan Trademark IMac Apple II family Mafia (game) Database Napster (pay service) Compact disc
