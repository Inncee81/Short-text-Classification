i heard audio cable requires break in is there any objective data support this claim thanks t green i am looking for objective published data of audio cable physical electrical properties before and after long usage that supports this claim hearing test data or claims does not count because it is subjective and many variables player receiver amplifier speakers are included thanks t green i have read some articles about audio cables and how they need to be broken in installed in the right direction etc i have also read articles about how this is ridiculous basically a wire is a wire a conductor that has no directional properties nor do the properties change with use unless you put more current through the wire than it can handle in that case it could get hot melt the insulation and perhaps if it gets hot enough to melt or partially melt the wire i would put most of the claim of certain wire properties as snob appeal or the manufacturer taking advantage of some people who are not technical and are willing to pay exhorbinant prices for claims that cannot be substantiated from wiki many of the most outspoken subjectivists including reviewers columnists and pundits lack engineering training technical knowledge and objective credentials and most will fully admit a lack of understanding as to the technical merits of what they are analyzing but nevertheless praise a product's innovation and performance based on perceptual jargon counterintuitively subjectivists claim but cannot substantiate that wires are directional and therefore give better sonic performance in one direction subjectivists often claim that home theater sound is inferior to high fidelity sound even though double blind tests have shown that this is wrong many subjectivists believe that the sound from records is superior to the sound from home theater subjectivists often look down on home theater sound even though many subjectivists accept fm radio as high fidelity DVD High fidelity Sound recording Radio Compact disc Spark plug Musical Instrument Digital Interface Printed circuit board Electrical wiring Nintendo GameCube Phonograph MP3 Electrophysiology Gramophone record Windows XP Transistor Transformer Ethernet Appeal Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Cable television Synthesizer Universal Serial Bus Oscilloscope Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Car audio Movie projector Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Causality Antenna (radio) Ceramics Coaxial cable Overhead lines IPod Telephone tapping Transmission line Circuit design WiMAX Action potential Headphones Television Postmodernism High-definition television High-voltage direct current Subwoofer Franz Boas Optical fiber Langmuir probe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Resistor Vacuum tube Digital Gas metal arc welding Microphone Audio data compression C plus plus XML Vorbis Solar power Information warfare Harp William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Morse Code Stereophonic sound Science Second language acquisition National Electrical Code (US) Electromagnetic radiation Podcasting Electronics Digital audio broadcasting Decibel IEEE 802.11 Scientific skepticism Wire Home cinema Modem Sound effect Nakamichi Sound design Engineering Visual Basic Mixtape Current (electricity) Explosive material DualDisc Tesla coil Alternating current Gross domestic product Floppy disk Jet engine
