digital radios are said to use ten times more electricity than the old analogues why what exactly is taking the extra power is this because we are in the infancy of digital or will we be stuck w ever more power hungry equipment w tv's i understand plasmas are ludicrously inefficient due to the screen technology is the rf stage also eating up exponentially more power as in digital radios is this likely to improve or is it a giant leap backwards in power and resource conservation if this is correct the amount of power used over a ten year life span of a digital radio would cost you more than buying many analogue sets that for all intents and purposes sound exactly the same and have other reception advantages over digital as well you might want to keep an eye on this if you think analogue mean tube or valve sets the brand new digital sets have been quoted as using times the power of modern solid state sets still being produced you might want to keep an eye on this if you think analogue mean tube or valve sets the brand new digital sets have been quoted as using times the power of modern solid state sets still being produced thanks for sending the further info below further research leads me to conclude that this is largely eco scare mongering and that although digital rf stages consume around watts compared to watts this in itself is insignificant from edward b subject re by analogue i didn't mean ancient valves message how many watts per channel is the amplifier capable of this has an awful lot to do with the rating as well if the older radio is rated for only watts output watts per channel and the newer radio is rated for watts per channel there will be a huge difference in how they perform as to power consumption the front end of a digital radio will draw a bit more current than a standard superheterodyne analog unit the complexity of the digital units would be the culprit there it takes more power to operate the front end asic fec and audio decoder circuits before the signal is actually analog from there the pre amplifier and power amplifier would com the digital radios are much more efficient than their valve tube counterparts vast strides were made with solid state especially where power consumption was concerned we have had to take a step backward to get digital since the processing chip sets are operating at extremely fast data speeds this causes the chip sets to consume more power with the advent of the volt cmos complimentary metal oxide semiconductor as opposed to the older volt cmos or even volt ttl transistor transistor logic chip sets we should see the power consumption of these unit come more in line with what the older solid state units did as with any newer technology there is a learning curve in this instance it has been very steep since we have already learned several valuable lessons with digital video in your case sky in our case directv and dishnet the older systems for these were hot and very inefficient the newer versions are cooler and more efficient they are not where we want them to be but we are getting there as with any high speed data transfer there is going to be a tremendous amount of heat simply due to the fact that the chip set is executing several million commands per second i own a pioneer xm radio system of the first generation the last generation delphi consumes approximately the power to get the same job done for example that also does not take into account the power capability of the amplifier stage obviously a higher powered amp will consume more power than a low powered amp Digital photography Gramophone record Kenwood Electronics Laserdisc Solar cell DVD Radio Application-specific integrated circuit Logic families Fuel injection Electrophysiology MP3 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Hard disk Bass guitar Synthesizer Teletext Resistor Floppy disk PlayStation 3 Movie projector Decibel Welding Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Original Amiga chipset Sound recording Bicycle lighting Electronics Electric motor Dynamic random access memory Atari 8-bit family ITU-T Compact disc High-voltage direct current Digital Cable television Television Wind power Sound Blaster Digital audio broadcasting Nuclear power Radiation hardening Amplifier Bluetooth Carburetor IBM PC compatible Software-defined radio Digital-to-analog converter History of computing hardware Amstrad CPC Capacitor Universal Serial Bus Code division multiple access Spacecraft propulsion DV Super Nintendo Entertainment System Future energy development Fluorescent lamp X10 (industry standard) Embedded system Laser Lighting Cray-1 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tesla coil Redundant array of independent disks Diesel engine Brewery
