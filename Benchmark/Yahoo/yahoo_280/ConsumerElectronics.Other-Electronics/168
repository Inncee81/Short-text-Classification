is there something i can connect to a generator that would provide steady power so i could plug a tv into it i only have lights connected to it now but they flicker and i don't want to plug a tv into it unless the power is steady you want a power conditioner unlike a surge protector which only cancels out dangerous spikes a power conditioner works to keep the power level constant taking care of both highs and lows i don't know about running one on a generator though go to a store that only specializes in home theater equipment their sale staff should be knowledgeable enough to help you find the right product stay away from best buy or circuit city they only carry monster brand which is just too expensive for the performance you actually get Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Jet engine Welding Spark plug Alternating current Three-phase electric power Laserdisc Impedance Energy development Fuse (electrical) Power strip Gas metal arc welding Transformer Thermal power station Paragliding Central processing unit Spark gap Wind power Nuclear power Solar power Capacitor Residual-current device Toyota Prius BS 1363 Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets PDP-11 Atari 8-bit family Personal computer Jack plug Circuit design Operational amplifier Electric motor Oscilloscope Armored Core Fluorescent lamp Circuit breaker High-voltage direct current Bicycle lighting ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity Laptop TransUnion Uninterruptible power supply RuneScape economy Motorcycle Electrical wiring Earthing system Ammunition Telephone exchange RKO Pictures TGV Explosive material MMORPG Arc welding Embedded system Nuclear reactor Rebreather Electricity meter Rail terminology Digital Equipment Corporation Universal Serial Bus Wi-Fi Transistor Digital circuit Membrane potential Relay Ordinary differential equation Epilepsy Diving Dimmer USB flash drive Motor oil Movie projector Hydraulic machinery Tesco Kitesurfing Solar cell Private branch exchange Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Sears Holdings Corporation RuneScape weapons Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Reading spark plugs for racing RadioShack Audiophile Lithium ion battery Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Trademark Tire Weight training Ground (electricity) Ford Motor Company Diving cylinder Nintendo Entertainment System Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Air gun Surveillance Vacuum tube CPU design Wal-Mart
