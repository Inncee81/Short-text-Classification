technical question about my stereo i have a disc rca stereo i know not great but it's a decent little unit the problem is it was working fine one day then the next time i don't know how long it was i went to play a cd no sound whatsoever it looks like it's playing the tracks but nothing on the radio tapes etc i thought maybe it was the speakers so i tried a different set still nothing i may have had some power outages someone suggested that they may have blown my transistors whatever those are the stereo is only years old i want to know if it would be worth taking it to a shop to have someone look at it fix it the unit cost about i know that's not much but right now i can't afford to buy a new one any advice from anyone the speakers it came with were the ones not working but also tested them with a different set of speakers still no sound i assume that there is some indication on the panel that it is reading the disc track track time whatever that would indicate a problem other than in the drive mechanism or control circuitry the transistors referred to are the audio output devices it there is no noise from the speakers at full volume level that is it that could cost more than have the value of the unit for each part alone look for a tech friend or another unit Gramophone record Stereophonic sound Vacuum tube Phonograph Compact disc Compact audio cassette Floppy disk Digital circuit DVD Mixing console IBM 1620 Electronic amplifier Jack plug Sound Blaster Operational amplifier VHS High fidelity Amstrad CPC Walkman Atari 8-bit family Central processing unit Oscilloscope Audiophile Synthesizer Movie projector 8 mm video format Sega CD MiniDisc Quadraphonic The Pet Sounds Sessions Microphone Television Electric motor MP3 Nintendo Entertainment System Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting CPU design Transistor radio Audio system measurements XERF CMOS Sony Reel-to-reel audio tape recording Universal Serial Bus The Beatles discography Effects unit Acorn Electron RCA Hard disk Relay IPod Phonograph cylinder Videocassette recorder Copy protection Liquid crystal display Logic gate USB flash drive RCA connector Pet Sounds Amplifier Electronics Analog-to-digital converter Automobile Kenwood Electronics Marshall Amplification MOSFET A Day in the Life PlayStation 3 NTSC Disk storage Mixtape Redundant array of independent disks Player piano Transformer Effects pedal Xbox 360 Moore's law Karaoke Semiconductor device Grateful Dead Radio Magnetic cartridge Apple IIGS Dolby Laboratories Embedded system Microprocessor Sinclair Research Ltd Chicago (band)
