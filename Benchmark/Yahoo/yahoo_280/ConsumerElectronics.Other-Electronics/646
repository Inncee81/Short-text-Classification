quick charge or regular recharge for nimh battery i have an energizer quick battery charger that fills up energizer nimh batteries in minutes i just bought a sanyo regular charger with sanyo nimh batteries but it takes hours to fill capacity is it better to use the regular charger or the quick one what is the difference other than one being faster than the other thanks as long as the chagers are working correctly there is no real difference other than length of time in the charging of the battery the issue with quick chargers is if they don't shut off when the battery is charged they will damage it the damage is caused by the heat of the higher current required to charge the battery faster as long as the quick charger shuts off correctly there is no problem Nickel metal hydride Battery (electricity) Nickel-cadmium battery Battery electric vehicle Toyota Prius Lithium ion battery Turbocharger Ford Ranger EV Bicycle lighting Airsoft Vacuum tube Television commercial Dodge Charger PlayStation Portable Action potential San Diego Chargers Hybrid vehicle Universal Serial Bus Internal ballistics Lightning Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Lightsaber Ionizing radiation Items in the Metroid series Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Incandescent light bulb Protoss IBM PC compatible Electrophysiology Radio controlled car Pittsburgh Steelers Digital photography Geomagnetic storm Solar cell Memory effect GunZ The Duel Thermal power station Uninterruptible power supply Halo: Combat Evolved IPod Game Boy Advance SP Diode Electric boat Laptop Armored Core Tribes 2 Welding Redundant array of independent disks BattleTech technology Electroconvulsive therapy New York Giants Hard disk Wind power Mobile phone Fusion power Carburetor Final Fantasy XI Electric motor Stroke Artillery Energy development Insulin Loudspeaker The Secret of NIMH Explosive material Second Battle of the Atlantic Apollo 13 Honda Insight Torpedo Galileo spacecraft Nuclear power Solar power Equine conformation Renewable energy Shell (projectile) GED Fossil fuel power plant AlphaSmart Mental illness Whew!
