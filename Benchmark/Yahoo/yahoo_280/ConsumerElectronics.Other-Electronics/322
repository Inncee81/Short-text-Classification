what causes the horiz output to blow when the set is on for seconds i have a magnavox flatscreen tv it worked for about seconds then blew the output i really need help bad age and type of set will also be an indicator the horizontal output transistor hot supplies drive to the deflection circuit and the high voltage power supply i am assuming the hot is the output u are referring to unfortunately this is one of the most difficult simple circuits to troubleshoot the input is driven at a specific frequency since the output is tuned to operate at that frequency if the freq changes the load changes and can blow the hot horiz oscillator problem if the deflection load changes that can blow the transistor shorted open deflection coil or bad tuning caps if the high voltage load changes that could blow the hot crt short dust dirt moisture the hot could just give up with no external help the process for changing the hot and bringing it back from the dead is tricky i have replaced a number of hots in one set before finding the real cause the best thing unless u feel technically competent is to take it in to a shop for an estimate u may want to put your money toward a new set Operational amplifier Oscilloscope Transformer Transistor Electric motor Vacuum tube CMOS Thermal power station Loudspeaker Voltage source Switched-mode power supply Cathode ray tube Central processing unit Digital circuit Logic gate Current source Switch Voltmeter Liquid crystal display Thermostat Three-phase electric power Capacitor MOSFET Dynamic random access memory Semiconductor device Low-pass filter Variable Frequency Drive Impedance matching Linear regulator Electrophysiology Antenna (radio) Inverter (electrical) Gas metal arc welding Computer Solar cell Relay Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Decibel Atari 8-bit family Embedded system Fuse (electrical) Nintendo Entertainment System CPU design Radiation hardening Wind turbine MOS Technology SID Battery (electricity) Alternating current Electrical generator PID controller RLC circuit Dimmer Field effect transistor Capacitor plague Electronic oscillator Logic families Incandescent light bulb Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Impedance Electronic filter Piezoelectricity Motorcycle Wind power USB flash drive Spark plug Electronic power supply Klystron tube Inductor Resonance TGV Static inverter plant CDC 6600 Thyristor Bipolar junction transistor Pulse-width modulation Turbocharger Sinclair ZX81 Linear particle accelerator RISC Welding Gramophone record Transmission (mechanics) Schmitt trigger Potentiometer Light-emitting diode Renewable energy Control system Carburetor
