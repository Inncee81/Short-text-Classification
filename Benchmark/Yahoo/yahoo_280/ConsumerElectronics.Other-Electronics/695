can the ultrafire c or aa led flashlight use li ion batteries li ions are not a force to reckon with they are only designed to be used in devices that can automatically shut off at critically low voltages at peak load and have to be charged in a smart charger reverse bias feedback controlled charge in simpler terms in a relatively simple piece of electronics like this a dead battery means exactly that a totally unchargable dead battery also they also leds are very forward bias sensitive and because the battery your mentioning is a v cell of them would most like be well over volts over max forward bias maximum forward voltage before your led either explodes or burns out and i have had them explode before also from the looks of them they are a little thicker then n cells and shorter then aa cells so they wouldn't even fit the flashlights casing Diode Light-emitting diode Bicycle lighting Nickel metal hydride Volt Incandescent light bulb Lithium ion battery Solar cell Circuit design Lithium ion polymer battery Phase-locked loop Radiation hardening Operational amplifier Electrophysiology Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Current source Langmuir probe Internal ballistics Transistor Action potential Membrane potential Airsoft Switch Flashlight Semiconductor device Thermal power station Wind turbine Lighting Transformer Decibel Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Switched-mode power supply Semiconductor Turbocharger Potentiometer Oscilloscope Vacuum tube Ford Ranger EV Mouse (computing) Anode RS-232 Voltage source Current (electricity) Universal Serial Bus Capacitor Battery electric vehicle Hybrid Synergy Drive Electronic amplifier Electricity Floppy disk High-voltage direct current Uninterruptible power supply Nuclear fusion CMOS Sega Saturn Explosive material Thermostat Electrical generator Linear particle accelerator Solar car Circuit breaker Artillery Electric motor AIM-9 Sidewinder Particle accelerator Power supply Spacecraft propulsion Cartridge (firearms) Fluorescent lamp Federal Standard 1037C Headlight Electromotive force Memory effect Oxygen sensor Electrolytic capacitor Logic gate Enzyme Spark plug MOSFET Resistor Electrochemical potential Tesla coil Impedance matching Power (physics) Bipolar junction transistor High-voltage hazards Electrometer Galileo spacecraft Directed-energy weapon Voltage regulator IPod Photodiode Lead-acid battery Toyota Prius Hybrid vehicle Ceramics
