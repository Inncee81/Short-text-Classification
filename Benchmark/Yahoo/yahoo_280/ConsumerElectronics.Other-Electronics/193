can putting my batteries in a freezer prolong its life i buy the good batteries but they die so fast i don't use them that often and i always make sure i turn off my electronics if not in use what in the world could be making them die so fast i heard from somewhere that batteries can last longer if placed in a freezer they didn't say how long anyone ever tried this i tried but didn't work what could i be doing wrong i'm always having to buy new batteries for my cd player tape recorder and alarm clock putting batteries in the freezer or refrigerator doesn't necessarily prolong their life alkaline batteries stored at room temperature self discharge at a rate of less than two percent per year so normally refrigerating or freezing them will only help maintain their charge by a tiny amount hardly worth the effort of chilling them however if alkaline batteries are stored at higher temperatures they will start to lose capacity much quicker at degrees f they only lose about per year but at degrees they lose per year so if you live in a very hot climate or are storing your batteries in a very hot location it may be worthwhile for you to store your alkaline batteries in a refrigerator instead nimh and nicd batteries self discharge at a much faster rate than alkaline batteries in fact at room temperature about degrees f nimh and nicd batteries will self discharge a few percent per day storing them at lower temperatures will slow their self discharge rate dramatically nimh batteries stored at freezing will retain over of their charge for full month so it might make sense to store them in a freezer if you do it's best to bring them back to room temperature before using them even if you don't freeze your nimh batteries after charging them you should store them in a cool place to minimize their self discharge Nickel-cadmium battery Nickel metal hydride Lithium ion battery Toyota Prius Water (molecule) Battery electric vehicle Ice cream Bicycle lighting Brewery Lithium ion polymer battery Thermal power station Action potential Fuel cell Diode Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Ford Ranger EV Thermoregulation Temperature Circuit design IPod Incandescent light bulb Solar power Jet engine Motor oil Nuclear reactor Fossil fuel power plant Kitchen Climate of the United Kingdom Heat Overclocking Urban heat island Wind power Renewable energy Carbon dioxide Hydrogen economy CPU design Second Battle of the Atlantic Haloalkane Hydride Lead-acid battery Urinary incontinence Cold fusion Solar cell Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Explosive material Nuclear power Tag Ozone depletion Capacitor Nuclear fusion Severe weather terminology (United States) Airsoft Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ammonia Bipolar disorder Capitalism 8 mm video format Ice Steven Wright Bong Wind turbine Milk Terraforming Air conditioning RISC Ozone hole Sento CPU cache Windows XP Stuttering Hybrid vehicle Daylight saving time MP3 Axial compressor Transistor Electrophysiology Basement Food preservation Effects of global warming Laserdisc Ocean thermal energy conversion Heat index Poker jargon Fire fighting Refrigeration HVAC
