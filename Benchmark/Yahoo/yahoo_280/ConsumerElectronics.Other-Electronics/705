how to check the voltage rating and capacitance of mylar capacitor note the indicated label is not clear many multimeters have capacitance checkers for value the voltage rating however you really need to be able to read on the part what can you read on the label also what is it being used for Capacitor Impedance Oscilloscope Capacitance Circuit design Series and parallel circuits Action potential Membrane potential Operational amplifier Diode Electrophysiology Low-pass filter Analog-to-digital converter Volt Electrical element High-voltage direct current RC circuit Transformer Submarine communications cable AC power Electrolytic capacitor Power factor Microphone Tesla coil Dynamic random access memory Dielectric Capacitor plague RS-232 Power factor correction Electric power transmission Digital-to-analog converter Phase-locked loop Output impedance Vacuum tube Electric motor Ammeter Voltmeter Resistor VFO Transmission line Crystal oscillator Resonance Tetrode Colpitts oscillator Electronics Mylar Loudspeaker Inductance Voltage source Kirchhoff's circuit laws Switched-mode power supply Static inverter plant Low voltage differential signaling Battery (electricity) MOSFET Dielectric constant CMOS Gmail Potentiometer Logic gate Switch Integrated circuit Fluorescent lamp RONJA Electrometer Transistor Electricity meter Advanced Technology Attachment Incandescent light bulb Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Ferroelectric RAM Varistor Clamp meter Digital Permittivity Central processing unit RL circuit Voltage drop SCSI Telegrapher's equations Antenna (radio) Van de Graaff generator Ohm's law Soft error Universal Serial Bus Maximum power theorem Inductor Electronic components Federal Standard 1037C Netlist CPU cache Linear regulator Rectifier Corona discharge Overhead powerline Field effect transistor Inertial guidance system Electrostatic loudspeaker Read-only memory Electrical network
