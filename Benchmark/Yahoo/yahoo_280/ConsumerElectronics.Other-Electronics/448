old radio from crystal research i just came across an old radio it s called metronoma from crystal research laboratories inc the model is mp pa it has tube inside like the old tv s had wire s going to something that look like a speaker i don t know old the radio is but looking at the inside i would say it goes back some years if anyone has some information about this radio please let me know i have one of these it's not a radio it's an early electronic metronome used by musicians the single tube is a d thyratron that sends timed pulses to the electromechanical knocker on the back panel that's what looks like a speaker there's a knurled knob on the back that varies the spacing between the sheet of balsa wood in the knocker and the electromagnet giving a sort of volume control the dial on the front is calibrated in beats per minute there's also a small neon lamp on the front panel that flashes with every beat these are collectible and quite rare they were introduced in the late forties and still made as late as it sold for bucks when new i've seen 'em go for as high as now Oscilloscope Television Transistor Solar cell Thyratron Loudspeaker Ionizing radiation Liquid crystal display Electric guitar Laser Phonograph Synthesizer Relay Galileo spacecraft Metronome Xenon flash lamp Transmitter Cold cathode Plasma (physics) Telephone exchange Electromagnetic radiation Morse Code Neon lamp History of radio Spacecraft propulsion Modem Bass guitar Pinball X-ray Radio Fluorescent lamp Lightning Printed circuit board Cathode ray tube Guitar Teleprinter Electronic music Nuclear explosion Central processing unit Electrophysiology Neon Electronic organ Enigma machine Floppy disk Effects unit Light-emitting diode Computer Radio controlled airplane Spark gap Electrical wiring Semiconductor device Carburetor Antenna (radio) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Magnet Escapement Solar power Model aircraft Welding Timeline of invention Digital circuit BMW M5 Nuclear magnetic resonance Electronic filter Pickup truck Clementine mission Ionosphere Radio control Fuel injection Electrical engineering Crossbar switch Magnetic core memory Marshall Amplification Fender Telecaster Electronic amplifier Helium Delay line memory Drum machine Lightsaber Integrated circuit Game show Digital Lighting Tesla coil Phase-locked loop Potentiometer Punch card Mechanical television Incandescent light bulb Electric motor Diving regulator Professional wrestling match types Microphone Light Particle accelerator Crystal radio receiver Key telephone system
