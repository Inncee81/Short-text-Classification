whats wrong with my houses airconditioning the upstairs and downstairs temperatures are way different to get a decent temperature upstairs you have to set it to freezing which makes the bottom floor unbearably cold when the bottom floor is the percect temperature the top floor is way to hot whats wrong if it is a central air conditioning unit meaning it has cold air coming out of the vents on the floor or wall then close the vents off down stairs a little this will force the airflow upstairs to even it out if it's a wall or window a c then try putting it in an upstairs window cold air falls and hot air rises but in the case of one window a c you are dealing with extreme heat in one location and extreme cold in another i suppose if the thing is cold enough to be freezing then you might even be able to use a fan downstairs and a fan upstairs to circulate the air good luck HVAC Stairway Solar power Air conditioning Hot air balloon Furnace Diving suit Fire fighting Thermoregulation Climate of the United Kingdom Thermostat Thermal power station Bristol Grammar School Brewery Carburetor Basement Desert Temperature Upstairs, Downstairs Hyperthermia Severe weather terminology (United States) Jet engine The Star Wars Holiday Special McMansion Lift (force) Water (molecule) Teen Girl Squad Computer cooling Turbofan Diseases of the honeybee Axial compressor Deep lake water cooling Motor oil Water Firestorm Autonomous building Sento Wind Weather lore Fuzzy logic GunZ The Duel Nuclear fusion Heat The Brady Bunch Insulation Fan death Geyser Forge Seismic retrofit Spark plug Trombe wall Radon Lighting Convection Fog Mr. Freeze Pacific Ocean Engine cooling Central heating Saturday Night Live Sea ice Glossary of firefighting terms Ocean thermal energy conversion World War Three (Doctor Who) Two-stroke cycle Degree Fahrenheit Swamp cooler Radiator Urban heat island Poker jargon Professional wrestling throws Passive solar Casting RMS Titanic Chimney Dance Dance Revolution Atlantic Ocean Zoning Dodge Neon Marathon (computer game) Climate of India Carbon dioxide Fan (implement) Ice cream Chatsworth House Bread Ice Thunderstorm Scramjet Steam engine Blood (computer game) Kitchen Meteorology Cryogenics Fossil fuel power plant Piccolo Junior Saga Exploration of Mars Cold fusion Houseplant The Midnight Sun
