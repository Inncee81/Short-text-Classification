how can i get rid of stagnant water under my house i discovered that there was a leak coming from my drain and the pipe had came loose i have fixed that now but there is a big puddle of water in my basement and it has become stagnant and the smell is coming through the vents of my air conditioner is there anything that i can use to clean up the water and get rid of the smell go to a rental place and rent a wet vacuum and vacuum the water up or rent a small pump and pump the water from the basement to the outside this would probably be easier as the pump has a hose and you could just put the hose out the window and not have to carry a vacuum container upstairs to empty outside Vacuum cleaner Vacuum Basement Siphon Glossary of firefighting equipment Home repair Carburetor Bong Glossary of firefighting terms Hydraulic machinery Solar power Kitchen Thermal power station HVAC Thermostat Diving regulator Energy development Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Rebreather Scuba set Sewer Steam locomotive nomenclature Domestic water system Fire fighting Newcomen steam engine Irrigation Air conditioning Drainage Ocean thermal energy conversion Vacuum tube Pump Concrete Plumbing fixture Cavitation Fossil fuel power plant Water supply Soldering Fire hydrant Fire engine Flush toilet Brewery Oxyacetylene Glossary of wildland fire terms Frogman Dodge Neon Manifold vacuum Dairy Japanese toilet Water purification Toilet humour Wave power Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hydroponics Beamline The Brady Bunch RuneScape Mini-Games Automobile Hydrogen peroxide Wildfire Dredge Toilet paper Venturi effect E85 Suction Timeline of steam power Heat Solvent Fuel pump Jam (TV series) Water hammer Menstrual cup Three Mile Island Baby bottle Dry cleaning Submersible pump Automobile emissions control Swamp cooler Aerial refueling Cannabis cultivation Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Dialysis Rail terminology Carnivorous plant Kitesurfing Portable stove Battery (electricity) Power station Archimedes' screw Monopoly (game) Fluid pressure Grog Eldfell Fire extinguisher Rocket fuel Marathon (computer game) Diving suit Carbon dioxide Abortion Sewage
