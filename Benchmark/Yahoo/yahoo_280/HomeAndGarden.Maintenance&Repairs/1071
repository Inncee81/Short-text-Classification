my son put a hole in my screen door and i was woundering if anyone can tell me how i can fix it my self also for as little as possible as this is not my own house just a crappy rental depending on the size of the hole and if the flywire is steel or nylon fibre if it's only a little hole in nylon just use a soldering iron to melt a patch over it if it's big for a few dollars you can buy flywire from the hardware and a roller to roll the beading around the edges back in after removing it to remove the flywire however if the flywire is steel you could get a length of similar sized wire and simply stitch it back together like you sew material together looping from one side to the other after tying it off at the bottom then tie it off at the top Textile manufacturing terminology Textile manufacturing Knitting Mattress Drill bit Wire Screw Knife Soldering Climbing equipment Earring Suture Glossary of climbing terms Rope Guitar Sewing machine Brazing Rail tracks Metallurgy Welding Casting Tire Floppy disk Brewery Undergarment Professional wrestling throws Harp Glass Diving suit Steel Poker jargon Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Solar cell Strap-on dildo Seismic retrofit Dice Elevator Electrical wiring Movie projector Iron Bookbinding Rolling-element bearing Violin Kimono Shoe Roller chain Bong Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Radio controlled airplane Knitting needle Gas metal arc welding Stainless steel Hand grenade Dyneema Hot air balloon Nylon Brush Modchip Plastic Surface-mount technology Solder Geodesic dome Electric guitar Glossary of nautical terms Fibre Channel Sail-plan Dinghy Lawn mower Sailing Bicycle frame Disc brake View camera Wood carving Sewing Windows XP Overhead lines Antenna (radio) Sling (weapon) Tin can RuneScape quests PCB layout guidelines Naval mine Professional wrestling match types Spark plug Boat building Super Mario Bros.
