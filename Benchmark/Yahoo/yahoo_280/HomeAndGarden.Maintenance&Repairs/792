how do you replace a stop valve with a water tight seal i'm kind of in a crisis now i went to replace a kitchen faucet and noted that the supply lines were too small i got more at the hardware store hooked them up and then noticed that there was a leak at the stop valve for the hot water so i went to replace that and could not make a water tight seal here's what i did put the nut on the pipe put the sleeve in the nut put teflon tape on the valve threads screwed the valve onto the nut screwed the supply line onto the top of the valve there was still a slow leak where the nut met the valve so i stupidly left the water on and tried to tighten when the geyser started after the valve came off the pipe so how do i prevent that from happening again you have described a compression type fitting first make sure the pipe copper i assume is smooth and has a straight edge put the nut on the pipe put the compression washer don't use a plastic one metal is better on the pipe skip the teflon not needed will actually not allow you to tighten it enough screw the valve onto the nut tighten using a wrench on both the fitting and nut make sure the pipe is up into the new valve and is resting against the inside of it screw the supply line on compression fittings are a pain the main challenge is getting the fitting tight enough Screw Hydraulic machinery Spark plug Tire Glossary of firefighting equipment Wrench Sleeve valve Diving regulator Carburetor Flush toilet Bolted joint Tap (valve) Plumbing fixture Diving cylinder Drill bit Seismic retrofit Violin Trombone Diving suit Domestic water system Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Floyd Rose Vacuum tube Electrical wiring Plastic Siphon Thermostat Pump Screw thread Energy development Samovar Glossary of climbing terms Rail terminology Scuba set Professional wrestling holds Fire hydrant Guitar Air brake (rail) Irrigation Novelty (locomotive) Reamer Knife Solar power Snorkel Mattress Rebreather Basement Two-stroke cycle Internal ballistics Space shuttle main engine Clockwise and counterclockwise BS 1363 Oxyacetylene Fuse (electrical) Rifle Borehole Brewery Containment building Cookware and bakeware Textile manufacturing Timpani Baby bottle Glossary of partner dance terms Dialysis Trumpet Soldering Fire fighting Apollo 13 Motor oil Gas compressor Kitchen Swingout Teflon Steam engine Welding Tesla turbine Pulse jet engine Air gun Hydrogen economy Poker jargon Anchor Harmonica Honda Prelude Jet engine Chevrolet Corvair engine Water supply Stage lighting Ice cream Die (manufacturing) Vise (tool) Floppy disk
