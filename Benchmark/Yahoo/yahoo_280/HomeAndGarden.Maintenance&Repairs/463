hot switchplate i have a switchplate that has an on off switch for the outside porch light and a foyer chandellier dimmer when the chandellier is on the switchplate gets very hot could this cause a fire how do i correct this issue freakboynv is the closest the aluminum plate that sits just behind the switch cover is designed to dissipate heat that is generated by the dimmer it is common to have a warm switch plate if there is a dimmer even if you are not dimming to any great degree the most common dimmers usually are rated to around watts add up the wattage of each lamp that is in the light fixture to discover the total watts you are attempting to control if you are too high change the lamps to a lower wattage or buy a dimmer with a higher rating the higher ones however can be a bit pricey if you find that you are drawing less than the normal watts i would not worry too much if you remove the plate you will be able to read the rating that is stamped into the aluminum heat sink on the dimmer note when new the aluminum dimmer heat sinks are about the same size as a single switch plate sometimes when there is more than one item in a box it become necessary to break off the perimeter tabs of the heat sink to be able to fit it in with other items as the tabs are removed the overall wattage rating of the dimmer is decreased thus you can't run as much wattage as it could when the heat sink was complete i you are not sure go the store and look at a new one so you can get an idea of how they look new compaired to what yours looks like Dimmer Light switch Incandescent light bulb Stage lighting Transformer Lighting Transistor Bicycle lighting Headlight Central processing unit Fluorescent lamp Welding Tire Gas metal arc welding Sun Seismic retrofit Circuit design Solar power Internal ballistics Mercury Atlas 6 X10 (industry standard) Vacuum tube Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Aluminium Compact fluorescent lamp Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring Carburetor CPU design Thermal power station Oscilloscope Electronic amplifier Floppy disk DMX (lighting) Brewery Switched-mode power supply Loudspeaker Heat M16 (rifle) Cookware and bakeware Electric motor Jet engine Light-emitting diode Drill bit Solar variation RISC Compact disc Steam engine William Murdoch Pebble bed reactor Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Resistor Plate tectonics E85 Stove Urban heat island Plasma (physics) Electrodeless lamp Surveillance Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Harmonica Screw Renewable energy Carbon dioxide Laser Mouse (computing) Kitchen Tank CPU cache Disc brake Rail terminology Steel Sewage treatment Bong Fume hood Nuclear fusion Mars Exploration Rover Thermoregulation Eye Ford Ranger EV Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Heat sink Solar system Password Bicycle Digital photography Spacecraft propulsion Spark plug Messerschmitt Bf 109 Audiophile German car number plates Redundant array of independent disks Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Ozone depletion Sodium vapor lamp Armored Core
