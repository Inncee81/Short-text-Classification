how do i get rid of hiding cockroaches i only have small ones and they hid near the kitchen sink i learned this trick growing up and living in apartments in southern ca use boric acid its a powder consistancy you can get it at a dollar store or super market usually it comes in a container with a tip on it so its easy to dispense put some where ever they are hiding they walk thru it and then track it to their nest and it kills all of them or at least keeps them out of your place i used to put a thin line in the back of all my cabinets in the kitchen and bathroom and then put shelf paper over it loosely making sure to leave a gap over the powder that way they walk under the paper be careful not to spread it all over because it is poison you don't want to get it on your dishes or food or pets i used to also pull up the carpet around the edges and put a line around there it worked really well i had pets and small children and nothing bad ever happened good luck i hate roaches Hamster Kitchen Japanese tea ceremony Boric acid Cockroach The Shining (film) Knife Handloading Chicken Shaggy dog story Plastic Drill bit Skateboarding trick Canary Garfield Richard Chase The Dalek Invasion of Earth Illegal drug trade RuneScape quests Internal ballistics Milk Aladdin (1992 film) Chili con carne Procter & Gamble Characters of Naruto Chatsworth House Tea Toilet humour Fancy rat Great Teacher Onizuka Tofu Foodborne illness Fecal incontinence Hand grenade Ranma __ characters Hogwarts Floor Directory Plastic bag Bread Fire extinguisher Tobacco Dairy Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cantonese cuisine Euphemism Married... with Children Domestic rabbit Japanese toilet Bedbug Chopsticks Ant Glass Chemical warfare Toilet Cookware and bakeware Toilet paper Cartridge (firearms) Vermicompost Hemp Gaia Online United States dollar Ramen Sears Holdings Corporation The Pet Sounds Sessions Japanese cuisine In-N-Out Burger Dollar store Oplan Bojinka Carnivorous plant Equine conformation Boron Columbine High School massacre Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Textile manufacturing The Two Doctors Floppy disk Luck Episodes of Lost (Season 1) House Battle of Tarawa Dishwashing Craps First Battle of the Atlantic Tag Animal Crossing Brewery Blood (computer game) Pulp Fiction Spandau Prison YuYu Hakusho Paper towel Timon and Pumbaa Magic (illusion) Bart Sells His Soul Jute Neopets Pizza Pitaten Glossary of climbing terms Spidey Super Stories
