what should i do if a voltage detector goes off when i hold it about inches above the stove top this past weekend i was doing some work on the cabinets in my kitchen and had my toolbox sitting on the stove when i heard my voltage detector going off i took it out and cleared off the stove and held it above the stove and it went off it will continue to go off for about inches above the stove what could be causing this i have never been shocked by it or anything it sounds like your range doesn't have a good ground your range could be energized and you're just not feeling a shock 'cause you're not grounded while you are touching it try metering from bare metal on your range to the ground or neutral slot big slot on a nearby recepticle if your showing significant voltage you should look into grounding your range those induction voltage detectors have a knack for picking up static charges and giving false alarms too Tesla coil Microphone Circuit design Mass spectrometry Electrophysiology Loudspeaker Lineman (occupation) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Piezoelectricity Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Phase-locked loop Capacitor Naval mine Stove Federal Standard 1037C Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Terran (StarCraft) Kitchen Lightning rod Transformer Protoss X-ray Radio Residual-current device Screw Resistor CMOS Solar cell Volt Zerg Static (superhero) Analog-to-digital converter Electroshock gun Neutrino Combine (Half-Life 2) High-voltage direct current Electric power transmission Decibel Ground (electricity) Lightning Heckler & Koch G3 Nuclear explosion Welding Electricity meter Electric shock Ground and neutral Commodore 64 National Electrical Code (US) Land mine Wind turbine Alternating current Static inverter plant Clementine mission ATLAS experiment Voltmeter Thermal power station Stave church Fire alarm control panel X-ray astronomy Knife Second Battle of the Atlantic Three-phase electric power Mercury Cougar Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Action potential Switched-mode power supply Directed-energy weapon Shaggy dog story Van de Graaff generator Oscilloscope Electrical breakdown Ultraviolet Table saw Bass guitar Gas metal arc welding Electricity pylon Galileo spacecraft I'm Alan Partridge Sensor Railway electrification system Electronic amplifier The Time Machine Lynyrd Skynyrd GunBound Gramophone record Single-phase electric power Earthing system Audiophile Particle accelerator AC/DC Semiconductor device Cherenkov radiation Portable stove Electricity Wheatstone bridge Relay
