help i am changing my dryer from a prong cord to a prong cord thought it would be easy but it seems there were only wires connected with the prong and the prong has black hot green ground white neutral and red hot the prong only has black red and white i only have places to hook the wires so what should i attach and where because the black and red are both hot and positive wires can i put them together help we figured it out actually the only reason i asked about connecting the two together is because i saw it as one of the answers on this site to another members question therefore saying that the question or i am dumb dumb dumb is really uncalled for the whole reason for this site is for people to ask questions they need the answers too if you notice i asked first before doing anything thank you all for your answers we hooked the red and black on either side of the white and then the green ground was hooked to the frame of the dryer as the instructions on the dryer stated have a great night i can not believe the idiots that answer questions when they have no clue about what they are answering a prone plug is not volt and not hooking the green wire up why bother to change the plug tape two wires together is not a good thing either the red and the black wires go to the outside terminals the center terminal will have a shiny or copper strip of metal attached to the chassis of the dryer remove this strip from terminal and put the white wire to the center terminal remove the strip of metal from the dryer chassis and put the green wire under this screw on the old three wire to the dryer if for any reason the wire connected to the center was to be damaged and lost connection the outer case of the dryer the door and everything else that you could touch could become live with volts this is the reason for the new codes that require a four prone four conductor plug Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Spark plug BS 1363 Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring Residual-current device Snooker Oscilloscope Ground and neutral Circuit design RS-232 Distribution board Rigging Ethernet Electrical wiring (UK) Telephone exchange Overhead lines Transformer Climbing equipment Wire wrap Universal Serial Bus Tesla coil Split phase High-voltage hazards Wire Black pepper Soldering Third rail Earring Vacuum tube Violin Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Ground (electricity) Alternating current Electricity meter Resistor Electricity distribution Enigma machine Harp Strap-on dildo Professional wrestling match types Radio controlled airplane Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Vehicle registration plate Tire Advanced Technology Attachment Lighting Drill bit Printed circuit board Atari 8-bit family Switch Textile manufacturing Power cable Floppy disk Casting Telephone switchboard D-subminiature Incandescent light bulb Overhead powerline Capacitor National Electrical Code (US) Conductor (material) Upholstery Computer bus Antenna (radio) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Airport Glossary of climbing terms Sinclair ZX81 Mattress Comanche Earthing system Tobacco Knife German car number plates 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rail terminology Nintendo GameCube Point-to-point construction Flag Prong Volt Naval mine Computer forensics Thermostat Boy's surface
