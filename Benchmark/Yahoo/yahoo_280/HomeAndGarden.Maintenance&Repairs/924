there is a special light that purifies water it looks like a small flourescen light what's it called i understand that it is an ultraviolet light thanks but i cannot connect to your suggested web site it's a uv emitting florescent tube go to the site below and it will take you to other sources Ultraviolet Fluorescence Compact fluorescent lamp Light-emitting diode Photoelectric effect Electrodeless lamp Fluorescent lamp Electromagnetic spectrum Laser Vacuum tube Light Mercury-vapor lamp Xenon flash lamp Solar power X-ray tube Diode Galileo spacecraft Sonoluminescence Planetary nebula Mercury arc valve Synchrotron radiation Welding Color Planetary habitability Cathode ray tube Incandescent light bulb Ionizing radiation Special relativity Neutrino Sun Particle accelerator Photon Neon lamp Biophoton Speed of light Cat's Eye Nebula Blazar Spectroscopy Vitamin Electromagnetic spectroscopy Ozone depletion Titan (moon) Electromagnetic radiation Neon sign Nuclear weapon design Black hole Photomultiplier Stage lighting Xenon Cassini-Huygens X-ray Semiconductor device Lightstick Photocathode Phosphorescence Ozone hole Neutron Gamma ray Water purification Psoriasis Chemoluminescence Gamma ray burst Solar variation Diamond simulant Titanium Video camera tube Gravitational radiation Cavity magnetron Doppler effect Sunspot Blue Man Group Transistor Gamma camera Isotope separation Air pollution Quantum optics Traser Comet Electromagnetism Moon Ultraviolet catastrophe Printed circuit board Irrigation Gas lighting Sunlight Photosynthesis Open cluster Antarctic krill Maser Thermionic emission Nuclear explosion Plasma (physics) Black body Oscilloscope Cross site scripting Cerium Photometry (optics) Color temperature
