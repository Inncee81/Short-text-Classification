any advise on r home ac charging pressures too many variables to guess what the pressures should be is as normal as you want two things to be correct at the same time the superheat and the subcooling with correct superheat you should have after at least five minutes a cold sweating suction line it should sweat to the compressor there should be no sweat on the compressor but the suction line should be sweating up to it the top half of the compressor should be warmish not hot the bottom half should be 'kinda hot' you can put your hand on it but you'd rather not with correct subcooling you should have a liquid line that is slightly warmer than the outside temperature about ten degrees warmer as the previous answerer says touch some metal that's in the shade with the back of your nuckles and then touch the liquid line if it feels the same you might be over charged if it's significantly warmer you might be under charged if you can't get them right at the same time default to correct superheat all of this assumes somewhat 'normal' operating conditions on the inside and to on the outside getting freon levels correct is an art Jet engine Thermal power station Phase change heat pump Axial compressor Refrigerator Air conditioning Bong Haloalkane Turbocharger Vacuum Carbon dioxide Humidity Supercharger Thermoregulation Turbojet Electrophysiology Turbofan Motor oil Steam engine Gas compressor Explosive material Water (molecule) Ocean thermal energy conversion Hot air balloon Temperature Mars Exploration Rover Carburetor Urban heat island Fossil fuel power plant Casting Violin Sauna Water Saturn V Steam explosion El Ni__o SR-71 Blackbird Diving suit Poker jargon Turbine Common cold Fire fighting Spark plug Global climate model Brewery Thermostat Breastfeeding Siphon Hypothermia Toyota Prius Sun Internal ballistics Hydrogen Heat equation ELO rating system Dehydration Severe weather terminology (United States) Nuclear fusion Mattress Space shuttle main engine Hypoglycemia Audio level compression Obstetrics Hydrogen economy Rail terminology Solar power Heat Redundant array of independent disks Boiling Fast bowling Climate of the United Kingdom Quark-gluon plasma Weather front IPod Cray-1 Ammonia Welding Plasma (physics) Decompression sickness Microeconomics Renewable energy Fuzzy logic Suction Fluid pressure Sweating Cavitation Atmospheric pressure Bladderwort Stirling engine Nuclear power Abortion Operation Petticoat Phase (matter) Glossary of wildland fire terms Billboard Hot 100 Lithium ion battery Glossary of firefighting equipment
