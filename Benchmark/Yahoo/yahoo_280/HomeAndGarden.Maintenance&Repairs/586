i just bought a house with yellow vinyl siding how durable if i change it's color to white thank you do i still need to prime it first you can paint vinyl siding but wont' outlast the original color obviously one good thing your doing is keeping to a lighter color dark colors are bad and vinyl already conducts alot of heat and darker color will just add to this conduction another characteristic is that is contracts and expands rapidly when you paint vinyl you can but not recommended to use traditional latex paints traditional paint will only last few years if that you need acrylic in the paint mixed with urethane helps the paint expand with the siding and are best to use to get the best bond you have to clean the siding this means soap and hard work if you prefer a pressure washer can be used but it won't get all the grime and it can force water behind the siding if you do use a pressure washer clean from top angle spraying down to reduce the water infiltration remove all mildew with oxygen bleach this won't hurt the vegetation and ground water around it can use bleach rinse well or paint will not stick do not paint in direct sun causes exessive drying you do not need a primer and dont' recommend because the surface is basicly already primed the primer is just like traditional paint and may not contain the urethane resin needed to expand and could actually harm your new paint regardless if you use the proper top coat but coats of paint is necessary for a complete job it will last about years if done properly Paint Plastic Casting Mattress Epoxy Upholstery Primer (paint) Bong Manicure Dishwasher Brewery Tattoo Laser engraving Acrylic paint Sewage treatment Lacquer Textile manufacturing Spark plug Coffee Aluminium Internal ballistics Motor oil Gesso Menstrual cup Color theory Car washing techniques Washing machine Pottery Carburetor Cookware and bakeware Campfire Sodium hypochlorite Soap Wood Sento Titanium Ammonia Knife Drill bit Fancy rat Fire extinguisher Fire fighting Disinfection Bulk vending Stucco Tin Cast iron Japanese toilet Diamond Seismic retrofit Billiards Condom Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Water purification Thermal power station Tooth Acetic acid Gramophone record Motorcycle Friction Water (molecule) Water Hemp Varnish First aid Sunglasses Leather Hard water Soldering Paper marbling Rum Fluorescent lamp Carbon dioxide Solar power Corrosion Vinegar Wok Watercolor painting Wassily Kandinsky Sun Hard disk Pastel Drawing Car handling Dundas Square Handloading Garden Strawberry Heat Fuel injection Chromium
