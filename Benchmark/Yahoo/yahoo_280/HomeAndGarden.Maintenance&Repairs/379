is this basement support problem a minor one my family is moving across the country to chicago and i spent one weekend there looking for houses our favorite house showed a few problems on inspection and since we couldn't be there it is hard to determine the severity of those problems our big concern is the finding in the basement of sag noted at main beam in basement crushing is noted on main beam at bearing point of steel posts drop in structure noted on both upper living levels toward center of house recommend further review and corrections as needed by qualified contractors which may include carpenter and structural engineer as luck would have it i happened to take a picture which captured the crushing at one of the posts you can view it at http i tinypic com mjcy jpg the house is years old with the second story added at some point afterwards so obviously the weight increased and they might not have added extra support any advice does it look sound like a dealbreaker you can add a couple more support posts but remember you're going to have to cut out some concrete anf dig out some dirt and pour a fotting for the support post to sit on then you'll need to fill in to floor height the support post must be captured inside the concrete you'll need to ask at the city office where this house is once the new posts are in you can begin the process of jacking up the support beam to get your floors leveled out it's a long and slow process or should be or you'll crack the walls and such upstairs if the sinking is bad you will notice that doors will stick and not want to open and close properly one thing that i also noticed in the picture is that the handrail leading down to the basement is not legal the spindles can not be more than apart did the inspector mention that in his report maybe that's not an issue there but i know here you would not get an occupancy permit the way it is Basement Stairway Seismic retrofit Air-raid shelter The Basement Tapes Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Drill bit Concrete Equine conformation Wood Opportunity rover Hard disk Elevator Poker jargon The Shining (film) Downing Street memo Textile manufacturing Timber framing Bad Wolf Linked list Prisons in the United States Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Straw-bale construction Suspension bridge Reinforced concrete Sento Violin Volleyball Oscilloscope World Trade Center The Suffering (game) Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Quotation mark Scientology beliefs and practices Article One of the United States Constitution MS-06 Zaku II ISO 9000 2000 Australian Grand Prix Animal Crossing Expert system Faster-than-light Bristol Grammar School National Football League Lighting Motorcycle Speed limit George W.
