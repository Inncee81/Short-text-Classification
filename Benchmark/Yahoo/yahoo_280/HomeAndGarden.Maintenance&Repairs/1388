how safe advisable are resettable fuses i'd love to hear from some electricians on this one we are currently renting an apartment in town that we're using as an office it's in a lovely old building but the electrics are very old it still has a fusebox and not a lot of outlets we keep extra fuses on hand and haven't actually blown one yet but i'm wondering about investing in some resettable fuses such as the one shown here http www drillspot com products connecticut elec view pak vpkmb a mini circ breaker s are these safe to use any precautions is a the highest amperage they come in thanks in advance btw since we don't own the place replacing the fusebox with a breaker box is not an option i have and still do use fuses similar to the one you have shown in my experience i find them to be as safe as the standard screw in fuse a is the highest that i have seen but there may be ones with higher ratings and of course as with any overcurrent device do not replace one with a higher rating hope this helps Fuse (electrical) Circuit breaker BS 1363 Residual-current device National Electrical Code (US) Circuit design Incandescent light bulb Distribution board Alternating current DVD Hand grenade Ring circuit Nuclear fusion Connecticut Ground and neutral Earthing system Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets M16 (rifle) Resistor Three-phase electric power Armored Core Professional wrestling throws Power strip Oplan Bojinka Secure Digital card Screw Bluetooth Biodiesel Redundant array of independent disks Carburetor Drill bit Fusion power Short circuit Floppy disk Gmail Universal Serial Bus Electrician Panzer II Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Oscilloscope Alcohol fuel Electrical breakdown Wonderful Town Appliance classes Charles Ives High-definition television Nuclear weapon design Ampere Electrical wiring (UK) The Inside Harmonica Current (electricity) Annuity Vacuum tube The Dark Tower (series) Langmuir probe Pump It Up Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Nintendo 64 Airbus A380 Items in the Metroid series Free trade Seismic retrofit Lineman (occupation) Economy of Colombia Nuclear power Propeller Starfleet ranks and insignia Paintball AIM-9 Sidewinder Transformer MTV2 Optical fiber IPod Violin Quarashi Economy of Russia Europlug Tic-Tac-Dough 2003 North America blackout Wireless Application Protocol Hearts (game) Temperature Compact disc Common Unix Printing System New York City Plame affair Mouse (computing) Son Gohan Blood (computer game) Sexual abstinence Species Mountaineering Fusebox (programming) Kitchen Apartment Amateur radio
