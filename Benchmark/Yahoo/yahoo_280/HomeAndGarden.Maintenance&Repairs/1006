central air problem with new house i just moved into a new house to rent the power just got cut on yesterday yesterday evening i cut the central air on so that it would cool it down real nice as i was going to unpack some boxes i left and came back a couple hours later and it still wasnt that cool it was hot outside but the vents were not blowing out air as hard as i think they should have i called my landlord and hes suppose to help this evening but im just wandering what could be the prob depending on how your a c is wired your outdoor unit may be isolated electrically check to see if the outdoor unit isolating switch is in the off position and turn it on with the power completely isolated to the house there are no normal circumstances that should create this issue a c units are a sealed system and having them sitting idle without power supply doesn't make the freon leak or anything like that cars do have this problem though so it's hard to answer this one the only thing i can think of is if you have three phase power supply to the machine and one of the phases has lost it's supply anyway i'm only guessing out loud here you will have to see what the landlord can come up with i'm afraid good luck Transformer Thermostat Vacuum tube Haloalkane Refrigerator Thermal power station Residual-current device Air conditioning Cray-1 Internal combustion engine Electric motor Overhead lines Diode Solar power Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pebble bed reactor Loudspeaker Casting Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Drill bit Ethernet The Inside Electricity meter Hydraulic machinery Heat Stirling engine Jet engine Poker jargon Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Welding C programming language IP (complexity) Labor theory of value Gas metal arc welding Hearing impairment Fossil fuel power plant 2003 North America blackout Circuit design GunBound Capacitor Electrical wiring (UK) Fuel injection Leasing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis B-47 Stratojet Heinkel He 100 Energy development Fuse (electrical) Mercury Atlas 6 Engine cooling Estoppel Battery (electricity) Extreme Programming Cheating in poker Singlish Oh My Goddess!
