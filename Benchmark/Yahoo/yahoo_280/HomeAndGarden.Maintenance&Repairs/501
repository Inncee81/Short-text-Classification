can anyone help with leaking basement i have a tri level yesterday morning i came downstairs to discover water two feet out just about all the way around the basement walls we have old field tile out front instead of drainage pipe but i don't think this is the problem as it has not rained and it seems that the water is coming from the bottom of the wall i never had this problem until the street department dropped a load of asphalt at the intersection now i'm not sure what to do i spent all day yesterday cleaning water out of the carpets and part of the day today it had seemed to stop but an hour ago i came down to check on it and i was back to square one with water seeping out into the rooms again any suggestions could be sprinklers or a pipe busted outside underground Basement Irrigation Drainage Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Fire Sprinkler Air-raid shelter Dundas Square USS Tunny (SS-282) Carlsbad Caverns National Park Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Roof Combine (Half-Life 2) Home repair Glossary of firefighting equipment Shaggy dog story Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina London Underground Airport Lake District Lake Nyos USS Trigger (SS-237) Chatsworth House Eutrophication 2005 Maharashtra floods Ridge Route Thermal power station Kitchen Stairway Siphon Light-frame construction USS S-37 (SS-142) Three Mile Island 2003 North America blackout USS Seadragon (SS-194) Flush toilet Japanese toilet Firefighter Bristol Grammar School Good Morning, Vietnam Max Payne Energy development Daniel Pipes Independent Subway System USS S-44 (SS-155) Ionizing radiation Equine conformation USS S-38 (SS-143) Seismic retrofit Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Geodesic dome USS Waters (DD-115) Blood Simple Skateboarding trick Rail terminology International Phonetic Alphabet Water purification Renewable energy Oceanic trench Battles of Lexington and Concord USS Tautog (SS-199) San Francisco Municipal Railway The Beatles discography Sewer Domestic water system Carpet Hebden Bridge Vacuum cleaner 2004 World Series Architecture of the California missions Great Lakes Storm of 1913 The Wall Pipe organ Operation Market Garden I Want to Hold Your Hand St. James railway station, Sydney USS West Virginia (BB-48) Water History of Chicago California State Route 85 Motorcycle Canal lock Desert USS Arizona (BB-39) HVAC Chair Inferno (Doctor Who) Water pollution Tractor Dam 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anchor USS Hancock (CV-19) Taikyoku shogi Retaining wall Hollywood, Los Angeles, California USS Yorktown (CV-5) Milpitas, California USS S-32 (SS-137) Hydraulic ram
