new house help with alarm system i moved into a house that has an alarm system however the panels have no model number of any kind for me to look up online how to use the system in particular i need to change the alarm code i know i can just call an alarm company but i'd like to do this myself if possible any advise karen do not give the above poster any information please contact me via email and i will explain why using the email through yahoo does not reveal your email and i don't want any further information from you i will just expand on why i am saying this i can't email you first because of your settings but do not try to get help from that person it is likely a criminal do not give him any information at all he might be giving out credible business information yet he is telling you not to contact the number for that business you don't know if he is even connected to that business and he is covering his tracks by doing it anonymously on yahoo all under the guise of being busy takes much more time to figure this stuff out via email than one direct phone call and for a busy guy he appears to spend an awful lot of time on here answering such questions and doing the same on other sites as well according to his profile but that isn't the only cause for concern in short your personal safety and property might be at risk if you give him any information he is seeking information from you in a very sneaky way and it might very well be a scam if you have already given him information please contact the alarm company immediately and review the events with them so that they can advise you and protect your home and your safety sorry this is not well organized but wanted to get this posted asap be careful i have also reported this to yahoo and his post will hopefully be erased soon edit if the above poster was being honest with us he would not say that karen shouldn't call him because he pays for it first of all if you look at the website it offers a toll free and a regular phone number which appears would not cost him anything second he said she could call if she was within his service area third if she is not in his service area she cannot call call won't go through if he was paying for the toll free line he would know that Plame affair Advance fee fraud Surveillance Internet fraud Something Awful Gmail Karl Rove E-mail spam Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Phishing Voice over IP UK telephone numbering plan RuneScape cheats Stopping e-mail abuse Anonymity Plame affair timeline Password Spam (electronic) John Lott Data retention Blog Ocean's Twelve Telephone numbering plan The Standard Theory of conduct Burglar alarm Advertising Extreme Programming Fark.com Call centre Internet privacy Neopets E-mail 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Katelyn Faber Pretty Good Privacy Webmail GSM services Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Telephone tapping National Kidney Foundation Singapore Journalism ethics and standards Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Independent Media Center Credit card Yahoo!
