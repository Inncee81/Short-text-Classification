electrical question what does it mean when after plugging into an outlet there always seems to some sparks is there a short in the wiring or is it normal if theres some issue can it be fixed by homeowner or should a contractor be hired thanks ahead of time if it doesn't trip the breaker when it does this then it probably is just a bad outlet change the plug itself turn the breaker off first if this doesn't work then call a professional if you are uneasy around electricity then i would contact one anyway they would all charge a service call which ranges anywhere from Circuit breaker Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Fuse (electrical) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Distribution board Spark plug Ignition system Electrician Switch Ring circuit Circuit design Jack plug Reading spark plugs for racing Electrical wiring (UK) Overhead lines Contact breaker Thermal power station National Electrical Code (US) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Power strip Battery electric vehicle Power line communication Ground (electricity) Three-phase electric power Distributor Relay Spark gap Poker jargon Ground and neutral Capacitor Maxwell's equations Electrical breakdown Toyota Prius Professional wrestling throws Torpedo Enigma machine Lightning rod Eight ball Mortgage Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Mains electricity Carburetor Jumpstart 3rd Grade Earthing system Habitat for Humanity International Tesla coil IPod D-subminiature Bayonet Diode Tire Internal combustion engine Electrophysiology Light switch Alternating current Ampere Electricity Radio controlled airplane Thermostat InterCity Express EastEnders Home improvement Naval mine Appliance classes Telephone Telephone numbering plan Fan (implement) Kitchen Burglar alarm Glow plug Downing Street memo High-voltage hazards Membrane potential Armored Core Artificial pacemaker Universal Serial Bus Telephone exchange Europlug Breaker Morant Electricity meter GunZ The Duel Rei Ayanami Killian documents Static (superhero) Volt Watchdog (television) Registered jack Impedance Modem X10 (industry standard) Ford Ranger EV Citigroup Spacecraft propulsion Space disaster Cruising (maritime) Schuko Strap-on dildo Vacuum tube
