propane gas to heat a dryer or an electric dryer we have a propane gas line hookup in the laundry room the question is why would i buy a gas dryer over an electric one it does not seem to save that much money thoughts does anyone use a propane gas line for their dryer vs natural gas if you have a decent rate for your electricity then a propane dryer will not save you much in the way of utilities in some areas the cost for electricity is high and propane may be cheaper there are other reasons to have a propane dryer an electric dryer takes a amp circuit if your wiring is old you may not have the capacity for this another reason could be that a previous owner had a natural gas dryer when they moved to this house and decided to convert to propane instead of buying a new one if you already have an electric outlet sized for a dryer in the laundry room and your electric rates are suitable i would go for the electric if the outlet is not there call an electrician to get a price to install a new circuit and make sure it will work with your service equipment before you commit to an electric dryer Hydrogen economy Three-phase electric power Propane Natural gas Solar cell Electrical wiring Thermal power station Petroleum Electrical generator Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Gas metal arc welding Circuit breaker Fuel injection Kitchen BS 1363 Fuse (electrical) Manitoba Hydro Autonomous building Transformer Future energy development Enron Corporation Relay Electrical wiring (UK) Cruising (maritime) Alcohol fuel Printed circuit board Gas turbine-electric locomotive Residual-current device Grid energy storage Sewage treatment Battery electric vehicle Nuclear power phase-out Central processing unit Welding Electric power transmission Hydroelectricity Split phase Alternating current Renewable energy Wood fuel Fossil fuel power plant High-voltage hazards Thermostat Locomotive Biodiesel Nuclear reactor Oscilloscope Digital Subscriber Line Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus High-voltage direct current Pacific Gas and Electric Company Electrician Nuclear power Airsoft Futures contract Seismic retrofit Pebble bed reactor Heat Fuel cell National Electrical Code (US) Breathing gas Vacuum tube Gas turbine Air conditioning Soldering Sport utility vehicle Light rail Circuit design Incandescent light bulb Fire extinguisher Optical fiber Power line communication Energy development Filling station Loudspeaker Fluorescent lamp Paintball Power station Balloon (aircraft) Scuba set Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Internal combustion engine Thermocouple Arbitrage Oxy-fuel welding and cutting MOSFET Temperature Gas tungsten arc welding Transistor Overclocking Analog-to-digital converter Spark gap
