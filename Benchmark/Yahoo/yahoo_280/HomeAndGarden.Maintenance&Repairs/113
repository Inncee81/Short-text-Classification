storm door sags when open have to lift to close tight i just finished installing a larson storm door everything went smoothly however the door will not close tightly unless i stand on the outside and lift it up into the frame i'm assuming this is due to having not so sturdy of a door jam and the fact that this is a heavy storm door is there a way to shim the hinge side up a bit i'm thinking of removing the door threshold to make more room and the weather striping on the bottom to see if that work last resort would i be able to remove all the hinge side screws and pry the door up inch before redrilling and fastening screws thanks there is a way to adjust the fit to the opening check with home depot or lowe's or go online to www homedepot com or even www lowes com and get it written out for you there are screws in the hinge that adjust the door to hang right it's a simple adjustment i just can't explain it without showing you sorry about that you shouldn't have to take the door down to get it adjusted just perfect Drill bit Upholstery Door STS-61 P-61 Black Widow Knife Wrench Swingout Tire Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Stairway Glossary of firefighting equipment Equine conformation Amateur telescope making Undergarment Lighting Propeller Snooker Hydraulic machinery Violin Strap-on dildo StarCraft: Uprising Table saw Shotgun Window Professional wrestling throws Sailing Clinker (boat building) Aerial (dance move) Seismometer Floyd Rose Radio controlled airplane View camera Rigging Dinghy 2005 Atlantic hurricane season The Shining (film) School bus Bottom bracket Elevator Mountain bike Diving regulator Sundial Draw poker De Lorean DMC-12 Canoe Derrick (lifting device) Carburetor Harmonica Rail tracks Textile manufacturing Horse Brassiere Sextant Houston, Texas Bong Autogyro Secretary desk MTR USS Tunny (SS-282) Wood carving Windows XP Internal ballistics Combine (Half-Life 2) Transformer Guilty Gear Glossary of climbing terms Station wagon Dog agility Screw thread Steering Brewery The Parting of the Ways Oscilloscope Timpani The Champions Lift (force) Sail-plan Photoelectric effect Seismic retrofit Zippo The Far Side BS 1363 Pontiac Trans Sport Car body style Glossary of partner dance terms Japanese tea ceremony Recumbent bicycle Barometer Glossary of nautical terms Dishwasher Drill Car handling Sluice Solar variation Circuit breaker Ship
