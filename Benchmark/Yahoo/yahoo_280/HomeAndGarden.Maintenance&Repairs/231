how is it possible for a shower drain to back up and flow out of a kitchen faucet i'm in a nd story apartment in a story building i cleaned my shower with comet one night the next morning i go to the kitchen sink and when i turned it on there was a pause like air in the lines and then the greenish water that went down my shower drain the night before came spitting out i understand that many sinks tubs all drain to the same place poor ventilation can cause a back up but my question is how can the shower drain possibly be linked to the incoming water supply isn't the incoming water outgoing waste water completely two different systems that are not ever linked are you absolutely positive it was the same water if someone was working on the pipes or water pressure was lost in the night there would be air in the lines and usually a lot of crud that has settled in the water lines will blow out when it's first turned on it can look pretty nasty if you think the drain water line cross connection is real first try to re create the incident run some water with food coloring or something in it down the shower drain and see if it appears at the sink ther next morning i think it was just some kind of wierd coincidence even if somebody through igrorance or on purpose connected your water lines with your drain lines water would just go directly from the water lines down the drain lines you'd hear it running the two systems are totally different the waterlines are under pressure the drain lines run by gravity and have vents to avoid pressure buildup if the problem continues have the landlord get somebody to look at it Domestic water system Siphon Kitchen Tap (valve) Coriolis effect Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sewage treatment Autonomous building Furnace Dialysis Jet engine Thermostat USS Seadragon (SS-194) Dymaxion house Rebreather Solar power Dam Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Carburetor Energy development Cruising (maritime) Sento Japanese toilet Sewer Irrigation Scuba set Glossary of firefighting equipment Water supply Fire hydrant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Social rule Central heating Diver rescue Air conditioning Neutrino USS Tang (SS-306) Flush toilet Canal lock Customs and etiquette of Japan Dishwashing USS Waters (DD-115) Diving regulator USS Tunny (SS-282) Motor oil Renewable energy Zuiderzee Works Glossary of firefighting terms Operation Market Garden Ship Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Shaggy dog story Basement Water tower Second Battle of the Atlantic Septic tank Dishwasher Sauna Dairy Circulatory system USS Whale (SS-239) Modem Erie Canal Seismic retrofit Lake Welding Swimming pool Bidet Sailing Two-stroke cycle Derbyshire lead mining history 2003 North America blackout Soldering Geography of Africa Final Fantasy magic Moon Air pollution Blood pressure Intracranial pressure Urinal Brewery Dog agility TGV USS Wahoo (SS-238) Novelty (locomotive) Naval mine Hydraulic ram Battery (electricity) Swimming Water resources 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Urinary incontinence Progressive tax Hydropower Fluid pressure
