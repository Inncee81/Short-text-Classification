the house suddenly smells of 'cap guns' sulphur well it's am and we've all awoken to a smell permeating through the upstairs rooms it can best be described as the smell of a fired cap gun possibly sulphur we have had building work done rendering on the exterior of the house and the smell seems to be strongest in rooms nearest to the wall where this was done um should we be alarmed update the smell is getting steadily stronger in other words someone hasn't just lit a match as the smell would have dissipated by now well the gas man has been and said it's definitely not gas while this is relieving to an extent i do wonder whether 'non gas' can be harmful i can see no sign of smoke and electrics work fine this just seems odd now could there be a sewer line or vent in or near the wall where the smell is strongest if so it may have been damaged during the work also some cities test the sewer pipes with smoke to find leaks and the smell could be getting into the house thru the sewer vent Kitchen Tank Fire fighting Smoke test Geodesic dome Combine (Half-Life 2) Seismic retrofit Syphon Filter Natural gas Trench warfare Thermal power station Basement Cartridge (firearms) Explosive material USS Tunny (SS-282) Chimney Air pollution M16 (rifle) Japanese toilet Fire extinguisher Glossary of firefighting terms Scenes from a Memory Automobile emissions control The Legend of Zelda series enemies Urinary incontinence Sewage treatment Fire Smoke detector Glass Oxyacetylene William Murdoch Gasoline Firefighter Firearm Heat Hydrogen peroxide Alcohol fuel Bong Shell (projectile) Hand grenade Volcano Amber Ultraviolet Tobacco Electrical wiring Sewer Capacitor plague Traumatic brain injury Autonomous building Plame affair Torpedo Blood (computer game) Natural Selection (computer game) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tobacco smoking Ceramics Bullet Cannon Smoking ban USS Johnston (DD-557) Hurricane Rita Cigar Battles of Lexington and Concord Chemical warfare Bus models used in New York City Transit Automobile Nuclear power HVAC Carbon dioxide Fred A.
