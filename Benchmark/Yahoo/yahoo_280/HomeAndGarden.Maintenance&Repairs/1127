any maintenance experts on kids have just smashed the glass in my front door not the first time this used to be a safe neighberhood how do i fix it a slightly expensive but very effective way to prevent that from happening again is to replace the glass with thick lexan not plexiglass lexan is almost impossible to break and is used to bullet proof cashier windows etc in thicker gauges if needs to be securely installed because the wood will break before the lexan does even a baseball bat won't go through it in fact if it is installed correctly it will do more damage to the bat wielder than to the door as an example i watched a student on a security tape take a bat to a school door glass that had been broken several times the last time it was broken the maintenance group installed lexan instead of tempered glass the student broke both wrists and cut his head with the bat when it rebounded off the lexan the children's parents were not sympathetic to his injuries Glass Drill bit Mattress Batting average Columbine High School massacre Sammy Sosa 1919 World Series Baseball Gary Sheffield Table tennis Floppy disk Traumatic brain injury Laws of cricket Fast bowling Spark plug Ty Cobb Rais massacre Twelve Swords of Power Textile manufacturing Window Windows XP Terminal ballistics 1957 World Series Baseball statistics Lexan Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Single bullet theory Andr__s Galarraga Nalgene Door M60 machine gun R110B (New York City Subway car) Baseball bat The Shining (film) Washroom Wood Babe Ruth Batting (cricket) Polymethyl methacrylate Tai Chi Chuan Fire extinguisher Weight training Knife Motorcycle helmet Windows Vista Patch (computing) Paddle (spanking) Shield Golf The Brady Bunch Cathode ray tube Softball Cartridge (firearms) Solar power Rail tracks Los Angeles Dodgers Violin Max Payne Knight Rider Plastic Crime prevention through environmental design Naval mine Elevator Hank Aaron Bedbug Jam (TV series) Wayne Corporation Table saw Shaggy dog story VHS The Doors Porsche 993 Solar cell Stopping power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Dishwasher Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder New York Knicks International League Aikido Repetitive strain injury Safe-cracking Diving suit Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) School bus G-Man (Half-Life) Lee Harvey Oswald About a Boy Srebrenica massacre De Lorean DMC-12 Bicycle helmet Nuclear power Heckler & Koch USP Optical fiber StarCraft: Uprising Blood Simple Escape from New York Lou Gehrig Airbag
