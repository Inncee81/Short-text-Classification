could a clogged sprinkler valve cause wall leaks in my home we just recently purchased a year old home we have been having some plumbing issues right off the bat the dishwasher does not drain well the sprinklers stayed on all night the night before last turned off the timers which did not work so i turned off the backflow which did work sprinkler guy is scheduled to come out to repair the valve today however this morning woke up and water was dripping from an interior entryway cant tell where it was coming from since it was dripping from the casing could this all be related i turned off the outdoor water valve and the dripping stopped all very odd if a coincidence thanks in advance thanks to those who have answered so far the house was vacant for a month maybe two it is a two story home i opened the backflow again for a bit then closed it and dripping has stopped unsure if that did the trick or turning off the the outside valve though it sounds like there is too much of a coincidence that the wall leak occurred just when you tried the sprinkler system i surmise that the sprinkler shutoff valve is between the leak and the sprinkler system that would definitely increase the pressure at your leak when the valve is shut off you will likely have to get into the wall and hopefully repair just a leak worst case is bad pipes thin wall copper begins to leak after some ageing particularly in un environmentally unfriendly areas Irrigation Glossary of firefighting equipment Siphon Fire hydrant Three Mile Island Home repair Heart sounds Glossary of firefighting terms Flush toilet Drip irrigation Fire Sprinkler Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Thermal power station 2000 Australian Grand Prix Urinary incontinence Domestic water system Rebreather Tire Containment building Meat Loaf Plumbing fixture Basement Dialysis Hurricane Rita Heart Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Space shuttle main engine Carburetor Coffee Diving regulator Kitchen USS S-44 (SS-155) Sleeve valve Water hammer Hydraulic machinery Seismic retrofit Elevator Programmable logic controller Diving cylinder Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster USS Tunny (SS-282) Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Oxyacetylene Trombone Steam engine Variable valve timing Four-stroke cycle Atrial septal defect Carlsbad Caverns National Park Half-Life Aortic valve stenosis Solar power Embedded system USS Wasp (CV-18) Furnace USS S-37 (SS-142) Mosquito Urinal Team Fortress Classic USS S-38 (SS-143) International League Bong USS Yorktown (CV-5) Manifold vacuum Apollo Command/Service Module Portable stove Cardiac cycle Dundas Square Firefighter Autonomous building Final Fantasy magic Plame affair Automatic transmission Welding Aortic dissection Fuel injection Air brake (rail) Hebden Bridge Christmas tree Snorkel Aortic insufficiency Spark plug STS-86 Cannabis cultivation STS-61 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Battles of Lexington and Concord Newcomen steam engine Blood Simple Dalek (Doctor Who episode) Thermostat Combine (Half-Life 2) The Amber Spyglass Intravenous therapy Nirvana (band) Hydroponics Soldering Babe Ruth
