my little sister flushed a paper towel down the toilet how can we unclog it i have a bathroom in my bedroom my little sister was in my room playing on the computer and had to use the bathroom well she didnt realize that i was out of toilet paper she found a roll of paper towles under the sink i use them to clean and used one of them the problem is that our toilets are very sensitive this happened days ago their is nothing visablly stuck in the toilet i plunged it and it went down but the water still wont go down when we flush it rises to the top and i have to turn the knob to shut the water off before the toilet over flows after i shut the water off i go away for about an hour the water slowly drains from the toilet and then i turn the water back on let it fill up and try flushing it again i'm assuming that the paper towel got cloged somwhere further down than what i can see i dont want to tell my mom quite yet becuase my step dad will yell at both my sister and i i'm years old shes how can i avoid needing a plummer i've tried plunging and that isnt seeming to work should i wait a while and then try plunging again somebody said that within time the paper towel will dissolve and it'll unclog is that true we have a lot of bathrooms in my house so its not that big of a deal if mine isnt working for a few more days its an inconvience but i didnt always live in a house where i had my own bathroom anyways should i keep trying to re flush after the water fills up or should i just let it sit i think liquid bleach will corrode the fibers in the paper towel the fibers at this point are already weakened from soaking in water bleach will weaken them even further and fast too i think this because i've seen what straight bleach can do to a sponge good luck Menstrual cup Japanese toilet Toilet Toilet paper Urinal Bathroom Flush toilet Textile manufacturing Fecal incontinence Married... with Children Washroom Tampon Paper Siphon Sewage treatment Toilet humour Sento Menstrual cycle Brewery Poker jargon Diaper Shaggy dog story Sanitary towel Cannabis cultivation Water Coriolis effect Towel The Brady Bunch CPU cache Thermal power station Dishwashing Fire fighting Manicure Rebreather Dormitory Upholstery Draw poker Psycho Dialysis Toilet-related injury The Shining (film) Ron Weasley The Inside Wood pulp Nirvana (band) Bleach (manga) Composting toilet Kitchen Blood Simple Sauna Carburetor Domestic water system Paper towel Mattress Aerial (dance move) Soldering Hamster Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Disinfection Friends Drag racing Trisodium phosphate She Loves You Drainage Sewer Cruising (maritime) Starsiege: Tribes The Family from One End Street Autonomous building Ammonia Piccolo Junior Saga Urinary incontinence Thomas Crapper The Fairly OddParents Corrosion Make money fast Euphemism IRT Flushing Line Ocean thermal energy conversion Dairy Equine conformation Bristol Grammar School Recurring South Park characters The Curse of Fenric Tag Massage Water purification EastEnders Big Brother (Australian TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Basement Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Tattoo
