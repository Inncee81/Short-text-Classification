ac soot problems my ac unit keeps blowing out black soot through the vents i've had the unit cleaned numerous times i've even had the duct work changed out all to no avail all these fixes were only temporary every hvac tech that comes out says nothing is wrong with the system so my question is where could the black soot be coming from it's a heat pump so i have no heat exchanger that could be cracked any advice would be a great help sounds like it could be some type of fungus or dust the only way to tell is to take a sample to lab for analysis you can call your health department and ask them if they can recommend a lab to do the testing Thermal power station HVAC Medicine Air conditioning Drug test Computer virus Ocean thermal energy conversion Breastfeeding Motor oil Portable stove Three Mile Island Polymerase chain reaction Pebble bed reactor Jet engine Massachusetts Institute of Technology Diesel engine M60 machine gun Space shuttle main engine Software testing Dairy Fume hood Cocaine Medical laboratory Thermostat Casting Asbestos Carburetor Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Swamp cooler Stirling engine Wind turbine Nuclear power Prostate cancer Diseases of the honeybee Cancer Gas turbine-electric locomotive Carbon dioxide Heat Internal ballistics Fungus Solar power Particulate Soot Brewery Coming of Age (TNG episode) Internal combustion engine Oscilloscope Sterilization (microbiology) Heat exchanger Town gas Aerosol Chernobyl accident Rifle Loudspeaker Cryptanalysis Reading spark plugs for racing C programming language Hanford Site Economics Radon Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Laser Web crawler Renewable energy International Phonetic Alphabet Pneumonia R46 (New York City Subway car) Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Kerosene lamp Stomach cancer Richard Stallman Jumpstart 3rd Grade Labrador Retriever Spectroscopy Expert system Autonomous building Business continuity planning Terran (StarCraft) Fossil fuel power plant Gold Bob and George Upholstery Pet skunk Two-stroke cycle Central heating History of cryptography Nuclear thermal rocket Drill bit Diabetes mellitus Commodore 64 Ultraviolet Cavitation Lightning Glossary of climbing terms Overclocking Vowel Hydrochloric acid
