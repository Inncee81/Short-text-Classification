my a c isn't coming out through the vents it has taken many hours to even get my apartment to cool off a little bit yet it never gets to the desired temperature too see if there was any cool air even blowing i checked the huge vent with filter and there is air but there is no air coming from any of the other vents in the cieling i was wondering if anyone could help tell me what to check or do my maintenence guys for this apartment are gone for the weekend and we are dripping with sweat right now thank you as the other poster suggested check the filters and then check the registers to see if they are open in rare instances dampers are installed in ductwork to close them off these would be in the attic or crawl space if the a c was working before i can't imagine how the dampers would have been moved but it might be worth checking i have heard of a problem where a balloon was sucked into the furnace and covered the ducting you may have something blocking the ductwork as an experiment open the furnace door and see if air movement improves to your supply outbound registers you will be bypassing the filter and possibly the evaporator coil if air flow improves you may have a blocked evaporator coil this can be cleaned with a solution found at your hardware store you will need to turn off the furnace open the evaporator coil compartment and clean it off HVAC Furnace Thermal power station Thermostat Fume hood Air conditioning Solar power Carburetor Bong Fossil fuel power plant Cannabis cultivation Loudspeaker Motor oil P-47 Thunderbolt Jet engine Incandescent light bulb Dialysis Dodge Neon Refrigerator CPU cache Irrigation Vacuum Autonomous building Futurama (TV series - season 5) Casting STS-87 Apollo 13 Transformer Passenger car Battery (electricity) Modem Vacuum tube The Ark in Space Turbofan Brewery Dairy Automobile emissions control Convair B-36 Hot air balloon Two-stroke cycle Weather lore Carnivorous plant Water STS-62 Rebreather Renewable energy Three Mile Island Collision detection Poker jargon Blast furnace Basement Windows XP Glossary of firefighting equipment Sweating Hyperthermia Thermoregulation Federal Standard 1037C Environmental concerns with electricity generation King Khalid International Airport Mattress Diving regulator Explosive material First aid Passive solar Water (molecule) Steel Kitchen Piano Town gas Blood Simple Turbocharger Residual-current device Hong Kong International Airport STS-61 Electric motor Wind power Transmission Control Protocol Mercury Atlas 6 Axial compressor Space shuttle main engine Pebble bed reactor RuneScape Mini-Games 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate SR-71 Blackbird C programming language Phase change heat pump Stove Digital circuit Circuit design Gas tungsten arc welding Climate of the United Kingdom
