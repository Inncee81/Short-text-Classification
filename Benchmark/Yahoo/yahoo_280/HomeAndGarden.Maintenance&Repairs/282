i bought a house this year that has a large well under the back patio concrete what are some ideas what to do with this i have little experience on these things should the well be filled in or remove the stone that surrounds it the stones wouldn't really hurt anything in the ground would they what would be the cheapest option the well doesn't have any function it looks very very old first the stones will not hurt anything if filled in except may settle and you will have to add more the next part is this may be a sistern they were used to store rain water is any downspouts connected i have two sisterns and they are great for watering garden and yard you may have municpial water and it cost you or have a draught then you will wish you kept the well or sistern i would not worry about it just keep a good cover on so knowbody gets hurt then after a period of time see if you still don't need it you can ask question in your neighborhood if anybody has run short on water history if filling add big and small gravel so it settles tightly Basement Lechaina Hash table Mach kernel Extreme Programming Diving Piccolo Junior Saga Seismic retrofit Poker jargon Urinary incontinence Airport Concrete Internal ballistics Gravel Elis Prefecture CPU cache Dundas Square Kitchen Theory of conduct Kerikeri Self Portrait Drainage Rathfarnham Japanese tea ceremony Thermal power station Hydroponics Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Alhambra Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Palace of Westminster Big Dig Hydropower Irrigation Roman road Pittsburgh Steelers Bratislava Castle Deflation (economics) Stonehenge Novelty (locomotive) Cruising (maritime) Sewage treatment Oscilloscope Capernaum Retaining wall 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Campfire Database management system Canal lock Blood on the Tracks Go (board game) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Erie Canal Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Leaf Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Desert Electrophysiology Anchor Origin belief Textile manufacturing Bart Sells His Soul Florida Keys Affton, Missouri Autonomous building Humphrey Bogart 1957 World Series XML Toronto Subway and RT The nature of God in Western theology Windows XP Panama Canal Locks Economics Sento Drill bit Nuclear power Christiansborg Palace Drama Prefecture Mississippi John Hurt Solar cell Philosophical skepticism Target Corporation Laserdisc Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Armored Core MAME Aerial (dance move) Microeconomics Floppy disk Anarchism and society Knife West Side Highway Philosophy of language Go strategy and tactics RuneScape Mini-Games Shot of Love Hangi Derbyshire lead mining history Animal Crossing Wind turbine
