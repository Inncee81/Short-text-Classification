my lawn mower wont start i bent my blade a few weeks ago and the grass wouldnt shoot into the bag and it would stall out i changed the blade and now it wont even start some white smoke comes out of the exhaust and wont turn over you said you bent the blade was there a screeching sound or one that just died out i straighten crank shafts and that sure sounds like what you may have done i don't know what engine you have when you changed the blade did you turn it over possibly causing oil to get all over the filter not to mention other places oil isn't supposed to go you say it won't even start but then you say some white smoke comes out of the exhaust and won't turn over what i would do is have someone take the lawn mower and tilt the handle back including the deck where you can see underneath it a bit away from the unit then have them pull the cord watch the blade if it doesn't do a smooth revolution it's bent by that the blade will look like it 's wobbling do this a few times to make sure because only someone that is use to it will recognize that i have a crank shaft straightener so look for this all the time when i hear what you are describing other wise you have got oil all over the place or your crankshaft done bit the dirt if it is broke you can't straighten it i charge very little for this other's shops i have heard charge out the wazoo for it if you need to get hold of me can walk you through the process Lawn mower Motor oil Helicopter Steam engine Internal combustion engine Professional wrestling holds Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Canoe Jet engine Aerial (dance move) Thermal power station Friends Carburetor Mower Lawn Briggs & Stratton Turbocharger Knife Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tractor Four-stroke cycle Time Out of Mind Radio controlled airplane Supercharger Swingout Katana Sport rowing Hockey stick Snooker Bong Ford FE engine Woodworking Wind turbine Drag racing Table tennis Poker jargon The Legend of Zelda series enemies Shaggy dog story The Marshall Mathers LP USS Trigger (SS-237) Yu-Gi-Oh!
