central heat vs portable heater here is the question during the winter my electric bill jumps from to dollars my electric central heater is very old made in like the 's and my thermostat doesn't even come close to working correctly if i could get new ones i would but i rent so i can't change them because it is so hard to keep the heat at a constant temp and the high cost of heating i was thinking of getting like two portable heaters one for the living room and one for the bedroom would that use less electricity than the old half broke central heat thanks sasha but i don't have fans in the house but portable fans might work right well the landlords covered two of the vents with tile and one with carpet so the bathroom has no heat and my son's bedroom has no heat i was thinking of cuting them so heat went through cause the tile and carpet get really hot do you think that would help oh and as for the outlets that is a good question because my roof has holes and water bleeds through the walls and an entire wall in my bedroom the outlets went out because of the water i don't think i should use portable heaters then but i'm afraid to use central heat because of the heat on the covered vents the floor and tile get really really hot the landlords have known about this for over a year we are just trying to get through it till febuary when we can move but i have a young child and i don't want him to be cold this winter yes the portable circulation fans will help if you don't have ceiling fans the portable space heaters would probably use the same or slightly less electricity than the main air handler electric heat if you decide to go that route make sure you do your research and get a good ul rated heater even one with the tip over protection these portable space heaters are often what cause fires in winter if the drapes touch the coils for example make sure you follow the manufacturers recommendations for clearances around the units i've used a portable heater for supplemental heat before but i could never get it adjusted right to give me a good constant temperature you would probably have to find an expensive one with a remote thermostat to make it maintain comfortable temps so what's my recommendation if it were me i would talk to the landlord and try to get him to do something about the broken down unit or just live with it it may be as simple as a bad thermostat and cost like bucks to replace it i don't think the portable heaters are worth the safety risk and you still won't have real comfortable even temps what do i do in my cold room in my house i bought a watt halogen lamp that i turn on when its cold i get the light and heat radiating from the lamp and it does as good a job as anything while i am in the room Solar power Furnace Thermal power station Autonomous building Kitchen Carburetor Heat Fan (implement) Basement Lighting Welding Transformer Wind power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Temperature Solar panel Bathroom Asbestos Spark plug Apollo 13 Sento Seismic retrofit Fire fighting Passive solar Electrical wiring Cruising (maritime) Glossary of firefighting terms Refrigerator Glossary of firefighting equipment Solar cell Slow cooker Process control Fluorescent lamp Drill bit Central heating Diesel engine Headlight Renewable energy Pebble bed reactor Vacuum tube Hard disk E85 Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Bicycle lighting Energy Fossil fuel power plant Oscilloscope Tire Burglar alarm Stove Radiator Light-emitting diode Tesla coil Poker jargon Hydrogen economy Rail terminology Alcohol fuel Loudspeaker Dundas Square Portable stove Haloalkane Soldering iron Passenger car Vacuum cleaner Upholstery Steam engine Ocean thermal energy conversion Nuclear power Chevrolet Corvair Energy development Jet engine Wood fuel Water heater Ra (board game) The Brady Bunch Sauna Hot air balloon Electric motor Diode Volleyball Diving suit Equine conformation Tank Thermoregulation Ironing Mattress Bi-metal Plasma (physics) Thermocouple Surveillance Internal combustion engine Diving Battery (electricity)
