why does my ac fan turn the opposite direction i just replaced the capacitor you switched the connections between two windings which reversed the phase difference and causes the starting torque to be the other way swap two wires coming from the motor and see if it doesn't make things right again Electric motor Capacitor Circuit design Switch Transformer High-voltage direct current Diode Electrical generator Logic gate Hybrid Synergy Drive Three-phase electric power Electrophysiology TIA-568A/B Antenna (radio) Railway electrification system Alternating current Manual transmission Hybrid vehicle Traffic light X10 (industry standard) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Turbo-Hydramatic Action potential Automotive lighting Microphone Electronic amplifier Enigma machine Ethernet Residual-current device Inductor AC power Variable Frequency Drive Capacitor plague Power factor correction Radio controlled airplane Drill bit Tesla coil Chevrolet Corvair engine Torque Power factor Potentiometer Helicopter Mitsubishi 3000GT Thermostat Transistor Overhead lines EMD F3 Rail terminology Automobile self starter Impedance matching Wind turbine Rigging Steering Oscilloscope Steam engine Fan (implement) Lawn mower Railgun Flux Transmission (mechanics) Special relativity Swingout TGV Locomotive Fluorescent lamp Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Wrench Printed circuit board Impedance Electrical element Battery electric vehicle Split phase Railway signal Magnet Toyota Prius Spin (physics) Model aircraft Electric vehicle Suspension bridge Precession Textile manufacturing Mazda RX-7 Operational amplifier Nonblocking minimal spanning switch MRAM Computer Torque converter Telephone exchange Sailing Ford Thunderbird Series and parallel circuits Car handling Phoebe Halliwell Differential (mechanics) Holden Camira Service life Single-phase electric power Continuously variable transmission Elevator Glossary of partner dance terms
