how to remove deck sealer from vinyl siding have waited way to long to ask this question but still need to get this done i applied deck sealer a couple of months ago using a garden sprayer as recommended but unfortunately came to discover that i got much of the spray along the siding of my house and have yet to find a good solution to remove the small specks of dark brown deck sealer without damaging my siding what suggestions do you have i would try a power washer with attached soap dispenser foam a good high quality detergent on the siding and rinse with high pressure you may have to use a scrub brush as you have left the stain on for a few months on another note next time you seal the deck wet the house down first before you begin spraying then it is easy to wash off right away Car washing techniques Soap Upholstery Detergent Casting Mattress Dishwashing Manicure Washing machine Hand washing Car wash Sento Dry cleaning Shampoo Textile manufacturing Laundry detergent Japanese toilet Menstrual cup Wok Bulk vending Oscilloscope Spark plug Staining (biology) Fire extinguisher Hard water Vinegar Bong Motor oil Fire fighting Laundry Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Thermal power station Draw poker Flue gas desulfurization Hydrochloric acid Tire Glossary of nautical terms Seismic retrofit Sugar beet Plastic Brush History of Victoria Eczema Soap bubble Diseases of the honeybee Fluoride therapy Hygiene Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Tattoo Sperm Whale Poker jargon Canoe Glossary of firefighting equipment Pepper spray Lawn mower Sewage treatment Toilet paper Lionel Corporation Printed circuit board Arcade cabinet Water purification Irrigation Western blot Yu-Gi-Oh!
