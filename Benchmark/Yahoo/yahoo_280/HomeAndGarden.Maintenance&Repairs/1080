cfc bulbs flicker when celing fan is off i replaced all of my bulbs in my home with cfc bulbs aside from the misrepresentation on the packaging supposed to give off the equivalant of a w bulb yet the rooms are much darker now the bulbs i installed in the celing fan fixture in my living room flicker when the celing fan is not on the bulbs are in tight i double checked when i noticed this flickering the fan is made by hunter and has a remote control to control fan speed and to turn on off the light it does not have a dimmer function it is also on a way switch the flickering never occured with standard bulbs and never occurs when the fan is on high regardless what direction the fan spins in nyphonejacks yahoo com light also flickers when fan is in low speed cfls do not play well with any kind of electronically controlled socket fixtures with photo sensors or timers do not work well either the electronics that take care of the switching mess with the frequency of the electricity supplied to the socket the effect is reduced as the load on the device increases when your fan is on high it is pulling enough current to bring the frequency back in working range for the cfl normal bulbs are not sensitive to the frequency to a point but florescents are most cfls indicate on the label that they are not suitable for an electronically switched fixture Compact fluorescent lamp Fluorescent lamp Light-emitting diode Incandescent light bulb Electric motor Headlight Alternating current X10 (industry standard) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Dimmer Transistor Lighting Stage lighting Vacuum tube Transformer Fuse (electrical) High-voltage direct current Mouse (computing) Haloalkane Relay Solar cell Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Light switch Radiation hardening Oscilloscope Traffic light Bicycle lighting Loudspeaker Universal Serial Bus Switch Super Nintendo Entertainment System Electronic amplifier Wind power Gramophone record STS-62 Carburetor Digital photography Antenna (radio) Ozone depletion Light pollution Jack plug Electrical wiring (UK) Universal Century Technology Embedded system Airbus A380 Bass guitar Electrical generator Semiconductor device Floppy disk Wind turbine Seismometer Ozone hole BS 1363 Programmable logic controller Oxygen sensor Digital circuit Modem Decibel Electricity meter Hall effect Bluetooth Apollo Guidance Computer Circuit breaker Rotor machine Residual-current device Thermal power station Spark gap Central processing unit Electrodeless lamp Washroom Computer Circuit design Welding USB flash drive Nuclear magnetic resonance Analog-to-digital converter Street light Phase-locked loop Switched-mode power supply MOSFET Acorn Electron Fuel injection Elevator Jet engine Torpedo Equine conformation Explosive material
