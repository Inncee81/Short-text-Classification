kitchen fluorescent not working replaced the bulbs already and the light switch still not turning on gets power and still not turning on could it be that the ballast is bad the whole lighting fixture looks fairly new also is there a way i can check the ballast to determine if it is bad or not get yourself a circuit alert tester the kind that looks like a fat pen and beeps or lights up with electricity about bucks check the black wire going to the ballast which is essentially a transformer that tells you if you have power going to the ballast assuming the correct voltage is there then use the circuit alert tester to check the red and blue wires where the lamp plugs in you can even put it next to the metal tabs that touch the pins on the bulb if there is no power then the ballast is bad be sure when testing the red or blue wires that you are not near the black wire which may give a false reading as for the ballast get the same one and be sure it is rated for the proper voltage correct amount of bulbs and and match the old as far as it being a t or t the ballast will say what bulbs to use i e f f and just wire it the same way and ballasts have wiring diagrams on them too you'll need wire strippers and small wire nuts Fluorescent lamp Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Incandescent light bulb Lighting Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Light-emitting diode Fuse (electrical) Electrodeless lamp Mercury-vapor lamp Vacuum tube Oscilloscope Compact fluorescent lamp Spark plug Electrical wiring (UK) Three-phase electric power X10 (industry standard) Transistor Circuit design Dimmer Diode Series and parallel circuits Gas metal arc welding Resistor Operational amplifier Switched-mode power supply Ultraviolet Electrophysiology Switch Enigma machine Antenna (radio) Headlight Alternating current Liquid crystal display Light switch Spark gap Ballast (electrical) Residual-current device Electrical generator Hall effect Capacitor High-voltage direct current Electric motor Relay X-ray Christmas lights Impedance matching Color temperature Digital circuit Overhead lines Rail terminology Thermostat Welding Bicycle lighting Rail tracks TGV Battery (electricity) Mercury arc valve Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster RS-232 Electrical element Electrician Photometry (optics) Central processing unit Tesla coil Electricity meter Security lighting Action potential Digital Railway signal Solar cell CMOS Neon lamp Universal Serial Bus Volt Inductor Typewriter Split phase Carburetor Wire Wire wrap Logic gate George Westinghouse Circuit breaker Professional wrestling match types Inductance Amateur telescope making Thermal power station Ring circuit Power strip USB flash drive
