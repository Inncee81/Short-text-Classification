why does my kitchen faucet leak while the washing machine is running almost every time the washing machine is running or even the shower the kitchen sink leaks not a small leak but about the amount of water comes out compared to on moderately it also makes a very loud vibration noise for a few minutes and then stops however the faucet continues to leak i've seen some really odd things happen with worn out single control faucets like cross flow between the cold and hot lines but never anything quite this bizzarre if it is a single control faucet perhaps the capsule inside the faucet depends on adequate pressure to keep it sealed and when other faucets or the washer is running there's not enough pressure a simple test might be to run the hot water in this faucet until it gets hot then start up the washing machine or the shower and feel the supply tubes on this faucet if there is cross flow the hot water tube may become cold or the cold water tube may become hot depeding on which way the pressure differential occurs in a good faucet that's turned off the hot side should stay hot and the cold side should stay cold beyond that call ghostbusters Tap (valve) Sento Plumbing fixture Siphon Tire Thermal power station Spark plug Hydraulic machinery Japanese toilet Welding Tap water Rebreather Diving regulator Drowning Sauna Stirling engine Pulse jet engine Cruising (maritime) Internal ballistics Casting Fossil fuel power plant Bong Sailing Carbon dioxide Transformer Flush toilet Electrophysiology Vacuum Compiler optimization Electric motor Vacuum tube Diode E85 Urinary incontinence Dishwasher Internal combustion engine Heat Bidet Mercury Atlas 6 Spacecraft propulsion Traumatic brain injury Customs and etiquette of Japan Soldering Thermostat Jet engine Home repair Digital circuit Transistor Billboard Hot 100 Pebble bed reactor Energy development Motor oil Menstrual cup Seismic retrofit Scuba set Washing machine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Mercury 4 Kidney Brewery CPU design Microphone Portable stove Fuzzy logic Rail tracks SR-71 Blackbird Reading spark plugs for racing Cray-1 Fire fighting Solar power Tattoo Fecal incontinence Dialysis Submarine Hard water Freedom 7 USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Residual-current device USS Tunny (SS-282) Three Mile Island Ocean thermal energy conversion Nuclear meltdown Cookware and bakeware Iowa class battleship Washroom Space shuttle main engine Axial compressor Coffee Naval mine Swimming
