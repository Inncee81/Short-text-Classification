if we hold the wii remote horizontally would it affect the sensor i was wondering if the sensor would be affected since if we are holding the remote horizontally our hand would block the sensor completely the sensorbar and sensor in the front of the wiimote is only used for pointing at the screen so teh wiimote knows its location in relation to the screen the actual information is sent via bluetooth so it isnt affected no matter how you hold the wiimote Mouse (computing) Touchscreen Geographic information system IMac Armored Core Digital photography Nintendo Revolution Burglar alarm X10 (industry standard) Digital camera Pixel Touchpad STS-114 Anemometer Traffic light Dance Dance Revolution Railway signal Backstroke Galactic Civilizations Danger Hiptop Graphics tablet Bass guitar BlackBerry Radar Glossary of American football Yohoho!
