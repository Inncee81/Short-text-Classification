legend of zelda twilight princess i am thinking of this being my next wii game do you think it is worth buying does it take advantage of the great things the wii remote can do it's something worth buying it was a really good game you swing the wii remote to use your sword and you use the nunchuk as a shield it does take advantage of the things the wii remote is capable of doing when you do buy it though stock up on some aa batteries it takes on average or more hours of game play to beat the game it really eats up the battery life all in all i thought it was an excellent game but don't save in the big cannon room if you get to that part then you will know what i'm talking about if you haven't already read about it though they probably already fixed the bug in the games now but you can never be too careful Princess Zelda The Legend of Zelda series Link (Legend of Zelda) The Legend of Zelda series characters The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker The Legend of Zelda series races Zora The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker characters Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Master Sword Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Zelda II: The Adventure of Link Nintendo Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Legend of Zelda series songs Moblin Poker jargon The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Super Mario 64 Koji Kondo RuneScape quests Ganon Agahnim Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Starsiege: Tribes The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time places Game Boy Advance Yoshi The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe RuneScape weapons Super Smash Bros.
