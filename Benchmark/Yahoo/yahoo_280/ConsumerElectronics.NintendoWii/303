attention wii players parents which accessories do you use the most for which games when i buy nintendo wii for my and year old what accessories should i plan to start off with which games require what accessories do i need two of each accessory or will they take turns to play i see it has wireless capability do i need to have a wireless connection set up at home or is this just an added feature help i want them to be able to play a variety of games right off but just the basic console starts at so we'll have to build up the really cool stuff over time also any opinions on the best games for elementary middle school age groups thanks gamers hiya i'm a wii owner and i think i can help you out right now there aren't very many must have accessories but you'll want to get a extra wii remote and nunchuck as most games where they'll be playing together would require them each to have their own controller as for kid friendly games i suggest mario party and mario strikers charged these are both player games that people of all ages can enjoy you can even play with your kids all kinds of people are enjoying this console the console also comes with a pretty good game wii sports which i still play even after owning the system for months mario strikers charged does have online play but there's no way to communicate to whoever you're playing with so there's no need to worry about who your kids are meeting online as for how to get online you can set up a wifi hub in your house but if you're not using it for anything else it can be kind of expensive the other option is to buy a usb adapater that plugs into the back of your computer and shares the internet connection with the nintendo they'll sell this wherever you buy your wii online connectivity is completely optional though and you don't need it to play games but there are some neat features that use internet access such as the virtual console which allows you to download vintage video games straight to the wii and of course there's games out that allow you to connect with friends from all over the country you don't really need a memory card right off the bat as games are saved straight to the system memory cards just allow you to keep saving after you run out of space i don't know any one who has run out of space you'd have to own pretty much all the games out and half the vc games to do that anyways good luck Computer and video games Nintendo Revolution Nintendo DS Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Nintendo Entertainment System PlayStation Portable Game Boy Advance Game Boy Xbox Super Nintendo Entertainment System Handheld game console Sega PlayStation 2 Nintendo 64 PlayStation 3 Video game music Sega Dreamcast Universal Serial Bus IPod TurboGrafx 16 Multiplayer Super Mario Bros. 3 Super Mario 64 Mouse (computing) PC Engine Windows XP Game controller Mario Neopets Wi-Fi Atari 2600 Internet Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Commodore 64 Atari 8-bit family Super Mario remake series Computer role-playing game ROM image Super Mario Bros.
