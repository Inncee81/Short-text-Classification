what wii accessories do you recommend i recommend get a wii fan stand because it will keep your wii cool so it wont over heat and it has a cool led glow also you should try buying rechargeable batteries that come with a charger instead of buying the nyko charger i bought a charger with rechargeable batteries for and i already had spare rechargeable batteries so if you dont have extra batteries you can buy a pack of rechargeable batteries and the best thing is that you can also use the batteries for a mp player or watever u want and it saves you a couple of extra bucks i didnt get the nyko charger because you can only use the battery pack for the wii controls and the rechargeable batteries i got can be used for anything Battery electric vehicle Bicycle lighting Nickel metal hydride PlayStation Portable Ford Ranger EV Hybrid vehicle Xbox 360 Turbocharger Hybrid Synergy Drive Radio controlled car Memory effect IPod San Diego Chargers Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Nintendo DS Game Boy Dodge Charger Airsoft Lithium ion battery Electric boat Toyota Prius Armored Core Autonomous building Laptop Roomba Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Mouse (computing) Negro league baseball New York Giants Game Boy Advance SP IPod shuffle Handheld game console Ironing Halo: Combat Evolved Lithium ion polymer battery AlphaSmart American Football League Dosimeter Fuel cell Hydrogen economy Lincoln LS Vacuum tube Hot Wheels RX-79 Series Walkman Torpedo Apple Newton Buffalo Bills Lead-acid battery Game Boy Advance Sega Game Gear HP-35 Thermal power station Star Wars: Battlefront Nintendo 64 Creative Zen Solar power Cruising (maritime) Apollo Lunar Module Solar cell Green Lantern Mariner 2 Lead British Rail Class 419 Oscilloscope Internal combustion engine Roush Racing Mariner 1 Guardians of the Universe Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara General Motors EV1 First aid Submarine Cosmic Era Superweapons RX-78 mobile suit series Sega Dreamcast Air gun Miami Dolphins MSA-0011 S Gundam Pump It Up Jennifer Lopez StarCraft Secret Missions Atari ST Overclocking Tire Manual transmission G-Man (Half-Life) Game Boy Micro New England Patriots Halo 2 Handspring Energy Liger Wipeout (game) Discovery One Cincinnati Bengals Nickel Wheelchair
