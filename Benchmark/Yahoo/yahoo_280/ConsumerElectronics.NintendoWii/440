i have been told that you can download old nintendo games for use with the wii is this true one of my friend's children is getting a nintendo wii for theire birthday i was told that we could download old games from the n snes etc for free but i do not know where from please help i've got a wii and i'll tell you this it's called the virtual console and you can download games to your wii but you can't download every single one and you have to use wii points which come from cards that cost you money for some games you can use your wii remote to play or a gamecube controller it can plug into the wii but for some you need the classic controller the only thing that's good about having the virtual console is the pure fact that you can have a different control setup some games like the legend of zelda cost a whole card which can be to bucks i forget which it is it's best to just buy the old systems and games and play them on what they originally played on for instance super mario rpg would be played on the super nintendo you can get most of these systems for a very low price but do not get the gamecube as the wii is backwards compatable with it Nintendo Nintendo Revolution Nintendo 64 Nintendo GameCube Super Nintendo Entertainment System Game Boy Advance Nintendo Entertainment System Computer and video games Game Boy Nintendo DS Computer role-playing game Console wars History of computer and video games The Legend of Zelda series Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars Sega Nintendo Power Xbox Super Mario 64 Link (Legend of Zelda) TurboGrafx 16 The Legend of Zelda Koji Kondo The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time E-Reader PlayStation 2 Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Yoshi PlayStation 3 History of video games (16-bit era) Nintendo iQue Game controller Super Mario Bros. 3 Super Mario remake series Super Smash Bros.
