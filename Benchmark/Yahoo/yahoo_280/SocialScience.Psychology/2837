what causes love at first sight i'm trying to understand what makes your knees shake your brain to malfunction and your mouth say stupid things psychologists say that love at first sight depends on our psychological state at the moment in some case we won t even notice those charming eyes in another they can make a lasting impression on as also they say that it takes about seconds to fall in love or precisely speaking to estimate whether the person is worth to fall in love with by the way psychologists claim that men fall in love first very many factors act in the situation of falling in love from the first sight these are our ideals intuition or fast logic imagination etc when you fall in love at the first sight you are usually ready and willing to fall in love less possibility that it will happen if you are tired stressed solving problems in you mind of cause the main part in falling in love is given to the appearance voice gestures smell one person intuitively searches in the other the qualities and the feature to complete him herself of causes beautiful people attract attention the most but sometimes it s wrong to fall in love with them easily because those people are experiencing much attention from the people of the other sex all the time and your delightful reaction may simply have no answers but if you suddenly fall in love with quiet unknown person and see that it s mutual that may mean even that mother nature has chosen a partner that genetically suits you a lot in this case it is like aha match when someone happens to fill up all the necessary categories like tall blond blue eyed looks good has a style and nice manners likes me by the way some theories say that we fall in love not from the first sight but from the first smell scientist claim that we pay much attention to what our eyes and ears tell us but on the subconscious level the way the person smells play a very big part in his or her expression on us although we don t recognize it Human Unconscious mind Autism Social rule Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Asperger syndrome Infantilism Goodness and value theory Philosophy of language Sexual orientation Psychology Transactional analysis Theory of conduct Traumatic brain injury Social psychology Gender role Carl Jung Cognitive science Sin City Microeconomics Neuro-linguistic programming Theodicy Extreme Programming Human sexual behavior Philosophy of perception Free will Ontological argument Supernatural Species Sexual attraction Hypnosis Religion Humphrey Bogart Empathy Alexander Technique Milton H.
