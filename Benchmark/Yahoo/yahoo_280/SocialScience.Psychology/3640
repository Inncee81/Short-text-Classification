what does my dream mean ok so i had a dream last night that somehow my little sister died and i was really sad and regretful thats all i can remember in waking life though our relationship is pretty normal most dreams are associated with the events that occurred throughout one's day the brain will often times jumble and reorganize these events and emotions you experienced and try to create something that makes sense your sense of regretful ness may be associated with something totally unrelated to your sister but it manifested itself into part of a memory dreams are mere re representations of events and emotions i once dreamt i was chasing my little brother with a gun trying to shoot him when i awoke i was horrified that i would have ever had that thought upon further reflection i knew that i had gone hunting for the first time in the recent days preceding the dream and that i had just spoke with my brother who had moved to another state for school try to remember your interactions and dreams can become fun when you break them down into their original elements of course the dream you had is upsetting to you but just remember it was only a dream Lucid dreaming Dream Out-of-body experience Philosophical skepticism One Tree Hill (TV series) Scenes from a Memory Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Miss Saigon Sleep Clinical depression Shen Gong Wu Fancy Crane Sigmund Freud Knots Landing Jon Secada Narcolepsy 50 First Dates Cordelia Chase Sin City D__j__ vu Asperger syndrome Cliff Richard Emotion Mind Bob and George Cognitive science Narcissism Dream Theater T'Pol Traumatic brain injury Autism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Consciousness God Emperor of Dune Sydney Bristow Schizophrenia Kain (Legacy of Kain) Pitaten Reality Year of the Spider The Invisibles The Ashlee Simpson Show Jewish bereavement Angel Sanctuary Memory Timeline of heavy metal EastEnders Artificial consciousness Carl Jung Robert F.
