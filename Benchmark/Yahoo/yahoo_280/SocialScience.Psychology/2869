how to feel confident in oneself i really wanna be confident because i know true beauty is confidence but idk how like what makes u girls feel pretty like i get sooo offended when ppl calls me ugly but when someone saids im pretty i believe it i guess its lik i only thinnk im pretty when someone tells me and feel ugly when someone saids that expecially a guy i get so tired of trying to impress every guy like i know every guy has types but yea it just hurst me when im walking and there like ugly but how can i gain confidence or feel pretty the best way to feel confidence in yourself is to set realistic but challenging goals and achieve them you should have a balance of long term and short term goals so that you are completing some goals now and understanding realizing that you are a successful person with a lot of skills and accomplishments but also have long term goals so that you have things to look forward to once you start succeeding at things you will begin to have mastery at things and really see how good you are at things this will raise your confidence in yourself when your confidence is boosted you will hold yourself in a much better way your posture will be better your back straight your head held high and you will feel as if you are more beautiful both inside and out you won't care if people call you ugly because you know how wrong they are and they probably won't call you ugly anyway confidence makes you more beautiful because you carry yourself with a lot more dignity Jon Secada Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory About a Boy Poker jargon Tai Chi Chuan Aerial (dance move) Friends Spice Girls Time Out of Mind The Contender (television series) Fast bowling Norway national football team Water polo Buddy Guy Art Swingout Anne Rice Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Expert system Scenes from a Memory 2000 Australian Grand Prix Alex Ferguson Scientology beliefs and practices Yoga Sutras of Patanjali New York Giants Blonde on Blonde Beauty Asperger syndrome Diving Avenue Q Battle of Kursk Milton H.
