problems being alone ever since i can remember i have had trouble being alone i've asked my family if they knew why but they just said you've always been that way i always seem to do fine when i'm with people i'm very people oriented and i get energy from people but since my wife died over a year ago i've been alone most of the time since i've been on disability and i am still not cleared to work essentially i just get restless i don't have any trouble when i 'm out with people no anxiety anything i'm assuming a lot of it is post trauma and all from my past sometime i've been seeing a psychologist since november and i've shared things with him and essentially he has no idea about most of the things i've shared pretty much beyond his scope but i like him and he's good makes little sense to me i read the betrayal bond and it said that this is common in trauma victims nearly everything in the book was true of me i seemed to have many similar issues thanks volunteering it's funny that people have suggested that i deliver meals on wheels i'm getting meals on wheels most of the things that there are volunteer positions for are things i can't do for myself so how can i do that my church nobody called nobody came over when my wife died i'm not asking them for anything i offered my help to them i do participate in one volunteer group where we help people clean up after storms they are ok with me providing comic relief so that works it was once a week and now once a month not enough to meet my needs for fellowship not everyone is cut out to be alone i come from a large family and i was in the hospital alone for long periods of time so i have learned to love it but not everyone is maybe what you should do is find some place to volunteer during the day while you wait to get cleared for work that would give you something to do during the day which would also cut down on the time that you're alone i also think that maybe you should get a pet so that you're not alone if you like cats get a cat as they don't' mind being alone during the day when you go back to work it has been found that pets can contribute a lot to the mental health of people who are a lone i know that if the dog that i have now is not with us in three years when my youngest goes to school i will get one because i like being alone but not all the time try that it can't hurt EastEnders Social rule Scientology beliefs and practices Time Out of Mind Alcoholics Anonymous Shaggy dog story Sin City Clinical depression Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Adult attention-deficit disorder Traumatic brain injury Little Britain Infantilism Pitaten Medicine Dog Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Transactional analysis Philosophy of language Plame affair Hurricane Katrina disaster relief W.I.T.C.H.
