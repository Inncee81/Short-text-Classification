what do you know about suicide and people that do it i grew up thinking that people that tried to commit suicide were somehow very different from me i never believed suicide would be an option i guess i was happy and couldn't imagine pain that would lead one to suicide i don't believe in heaven or god so death seems like such a last resort to me despite all this i took an overdose yesterday i was upset about not having enough friends and my girlfriend and i are broke up now so i've lost that foundation without sophie in my life i don't feel like i have much direction and despite having two parents and sisters that love me and dollars in the bank somehow doesn't console me you haven't considered that an attempt at suicide as well as actually carrying it out are signs of a cry for help and an act of selfishness as if you were telling everyone look you have hurt me now i am going to hurt you back it solves nothing you will not be around to see and or enjoy the pain your suicide will have brought upon those whom you left behind so is it worth it you do not sound like you're years old so this can not be all end all for you every life is full of disappointments and let downs and hurt and pain if you step outside yourself and watch the television news or browse the web take a look at people who are in war torn countries starving frightened who would live a limb to have your problems rather than their own if you can be objective for just one moment and compare yourself to any of those people you'd see how selfish and ridiculous you're thinking that should console you enough Kurt Cobain EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Pitaten The Inside Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Knots Landing Kodocha Suicide Simone Weil About a Boy Nine Inch Nails The Catcher in the Rye The Shining (film) Night (book) W.I.T.C.H.
