how does parenting affects a child's behavior and development ive tried talking to my parents about arguing fighting or disputes affecting how we my siblings and i have turnt out i dont know wether my parents cant admit they did alot of things wrong but they wont admit that the way a parent brings up a child makes them who they are today well if i fill in the blanks you'll understand more my parents accidently started a family together before they really knew one another and in my opinion way too young after a few years my brother ended up becoming very violent and none of us have been very independant not to mention my other brother acts like a two year old when he is a teenager growing up was hard because our parents have never really gotten on my dads attitude is that only money is important and nothing we ever do is good enough my mothers atttitude on life is that because she had a bad upbringing that life is just a pile of crap how do you think this wou it's that old nature vs nurture debate how much of our personality is in our genes and how much to we learn all of the research shows that it's both many people who grow up in abusive homes will go on to be abusive themselves then again some recognize the hurtful cycle and break it really you have to recognize that while your family life isn't perfect your parents probably did the best they could people rarely raise a family with the idea that they will just mess the kids up your folks were young and yet stuck it out many many couples in the same situation would have divorced your brother acting like a kid well that might just be part of him being a teenage boy my brother was the same way until he turned it's a big step that you recognize what is going on in your family you might not be able to change people but you can make notes for yourself the best way is to write them down hopefully in a journal or something that you can look back on write down how you feel and what sorts of things you would want to change with your own family then you can hold yourself to it teenage years are rough on both the teenagers and the parents i'm not sure how old you are now but it does seem that when you get older and start to develop your independence that you may find your relationship with your family members improving Infantilism Friends Fathers' rights Divorce Domestic violence One Tree Hill (TV series) Laura Schlessinger Theory of conduct Nature versus nurture Autism Kodocha Pitaten About a Boy Child sexuality Gender role Sexual orientation Extreme Programming Pedophilia The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Poker jargon Goodness and value theory Social psychology Good Times Nicomachean Ethics Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Moral Politics The Giver Marriage Kender Transsexuality Polyamory Children of God Sex and the City Adoption Great Teacher Onizuka Asperger syndrome Transactional analysis Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Humphrey Bogart Narcissism Phoebe Halliwell Megan Griffin Jiddu Krishnamurti Second language acquisition Simone Weil Homophobia Alcoholics Anonymous Motion picture rating system My Parents are Aliens Evil Adolescence Germaine Greer Social rule Homosexuality and Christianity The nature of God in Western theology The Body (Short Story) Rocko's Modern Life Days of our Lives Women in Islam Code: Lyoko Incest Boston Public Dead Like Me Earth Girl Arjuna Religion and sexuality The Catcher in the Rye Abortion debate Creationism Homeschooling Hey Jude Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Doug David Reimer Fruits Basket Teenage pregnancy Economic inequality Peter Griffin Fathers' rights movement in the UK Human nature
