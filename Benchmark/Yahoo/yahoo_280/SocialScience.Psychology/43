does the word crazy been overused lately by society nowadays people use the word crazy for everything i wouldnt mind it at all but some people seem to label others as crazy when they think other person are different in some way of the majority it's an overused term that's pretty much become a compliment to me if someone doesn't think it's crazy or remember me six months later for something i did one day only it wasn't creative enough if it was done with the public in mind if it's personal i don't care what the public thinks in fact i generally disregard their opinions i prefer the term freak or performance artist for when i do stuff like things i'm thinking about doing this weekend like wearing cat ears a tail while walking on stilts and breathing fire it's at least four or five times a month i do something like that in public or go to a club when i perform it never ceases to amaze me how few people have seen the stuff i do yet how common i consider my skills to be to me watching someone hang from hooks is a fairly common occurance so is having one's lips sewn shut for a show or breathing fire no i don't live in a circus but the average person either says i'm either brave or crazy i personally feel that the average person is unexposed compared to what i've seen there are a lot of narrow minds that only a slight wind can blow i don't understand why that's still the case in this world of telecommunications where everything is everywhere at once but i see minds ripe for blowing with merely a nail a spoon and a routine called the human blockhead everywhere except fetish circuit where the new and unexpected is expected Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Major League Baseball television contracts Nine Inch Nails Milton H.
