why do people assume theories are correct before looking at all of them people have said that the universe is expanding into itself thats a theory and its great to try and see if its the right one but whenever i hear other people talk about it its like they say this is whats happening they dont even bother to identify that its a theory the same with the universe expanding into vacuum although this is the one that i think sounds more logical it isnt just theories about the universe though its theories about how the big bang started what religion is correct why george bush started the iraq war people learn about a theory then try to pass it off as fact wouldnt it be more logical to treat all theories equally until enough information is collected to support a hypothesis why do people behave like this people don't behave that way they believe that way you have to remember that what people believe becomes their truth to them that's just as plausable as the fact that they are here so of course they're not going to introduce their argument as anything less than a concrete one Logic Natural deduction Causality Propositional calculus Big Bang Philosophy of language Luminiferous aether Mathematical logic Cosmological argument Randomness Theory of conduct Fine-tuned universe Dark energy Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Modal logic Bayesian inference Entropy Halting problem Creationist cosmologies Philosophy of mathematics Intelligent design movement Forcing (mathematics) Fermi paradox Philosophical skepticism Light Bah__'__ Faith and Science Possible world Culture Human G__del's incompleteness theorem Scientific method Debugging George Lakoff Falsifiability Curry-Howard Cardinal number Willard Van Orman Quine Lie Paul Feyerabend Faster-than-light Speed of light Mathematics Conspiracy theory Logical positivism Combinatory logic William A.
