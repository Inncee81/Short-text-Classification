i get so mad when i don't get my way i throw a fit storm around and throw my phone or whatever else i can get my hands on i just get so filled with rage and it can just be something as insignificant as my friends not want to do what i want to do i can't negotiate i just get crazy my family sezs i have anger management issues but i don't they tell me i'm spoiled and self centered and need to get into reality i'm an year old female and wonder if i'm just immature or what i don't want to see a shrink but i do think i need to work on this sometimes when i get mad i take it out on my family instead of the person that made me mad any ideas on what i can do i knew it ruins my relationships help i have had anger issues in the past it's something that you need to want to fix you are still very young but you have to except when people don't want to do what you want to do remember as harsh as it sounds it's not always about you i had to realize that in order to start getting past my anger issues talking to a professional does help just because you go talk to someone doesn't mean that you are crazy take it from me you want to seek help before it gets out of hand my anger got so angry that one day i put my fist in a mirror my very low point was when i struck my boyfriend my anger started out just as yours does it will get worse if you don't seek help now it ruins relationships and it pushes people away the ones you care about most i was lucky that my boyfriend stuck by me and helped me get help go talk with someone your anger is only going to bring you down and in the end you'll be alone remember just because you are talking to someone doesn't mean that you are crazy that's why it took me so long to get help i didn't want to be viewed as crazy and when my doc put me on medication i felt crazy but i have gotten past it all and am much happier i don't have my anger issues anymore and i am without the meds Kodocha Avenue Q Characters in the Smurfs Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Phoebe Halliwell Anger management Friends One Piece minor characters Spider-Man 2 The Shining (film) Milton H.
