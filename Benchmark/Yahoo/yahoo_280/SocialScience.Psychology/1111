how to overcome big dilemma i was suppoed to take a toefl exam during the weekend but it was postponed because the computers were not working they told us that we would recieve calls from the exam to be able to rescheduel our exams but i never got any calls i've tired e mail and that did not work also iam leaving to go to europe this weekend this is my senior year i gotta take the test before i leave but i don't know what to do i don't believe that they will penalize you in any manner because of their own ineptitude i suggest that you just email them and tell them when you will be available to take the test at a future date trying to force them to allow you to take the test before your european trip is probably not possible try to affect a compromise by telling them that you will take the test when you return Plame affair Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Karl Rove E-mail Gmail Graduate school The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie TOEFL Architect Extreme Programming SAT Advanced Placement Program Stomach cancer Jeopardy!
