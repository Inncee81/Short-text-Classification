what do you think my friend refuses to forgive and forget the past he still holds grudges about things that happened and even years ago what does this say about him i'm trying to put everything into perspective but i just can't see how someone is so unwilling to let go beneath it all what does this mean i am very frustrated and confused he poisons our friendship by not letting go of trivial things i have tried talking to him but he insists he has a right to not forget the past i just don't get it if he would move on and understand that the present is far more important then our friendship and his life in general would be so much better however he refuses to do this i do think it has something to do with his ego does anyone know what i can do before i give him and stop speaking to him what can i do to make him see in my opinion unable to accept things as they are and move on some individuals cannot let go some hold onto for one reason i will share with you is that if they let go of anger pain sorrow happiness to the extreme sadness to the extreme manic moments break downs of any kind they will lose what little ground to stand on they possess this is theory not actually fact this lifetime studies there are no real right or wrong answers it seems that what we see in others really truly is what we see in ourselves we learn by watching and acting out so my point is some individuals are incapable of looking forward without looking backward unable to allow the past to fade so the future can come to the forefront this is a small insight hope it gives you more food for thought what do you feel about this what do you truly feel about the events you described above interesting question love to come back and see what others think Pitaten Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Philosophy of language Nicomachean Ethics A Course In Miracles Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scenes from a Memory Humphrey Bogart Time travel Simone Weil Theodicy Avenue Q Social rule The Death Gate Cycle Goodness and value theory Philosophy of space and time David Hume Socrates Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sant Thakar Singh Friends Meaning of life Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Human Jiddu Krishnamurti Sub-Zero Jon Secada Traumatic incident reduction Merit Ranma __ characters Sin City Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Supernatural Sin Transactional analysis Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Kodocha Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Amber Spyglass Sydney Riot of 1879 Altruism Alcoholics Anonymous Four Quartets Utilitarianism Reaction to the assassination of John F.
