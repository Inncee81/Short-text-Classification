when blind people dream do they see i mean do they see images and the world like when we dream or do they dream in sound thats a good question i don't know anyone who is blind but i assume that if they could ever see anything before and then lost their vision then they could see in their minds and dreams but if they were born blind then i don't suppose they can see in dreams because their minds couldn't conjure up images that it has never been able to know Philosophical skepticism Saga (band) Color blindness Philosophy of perception Jon Secada Hide and Q (TNG episode) Lucid dreaming The nature of God in Western theology Blindness Minority Report (film) Demon Out-of-body experience Karen Horney John Berryman Philosophy of mind Direct realism Milton H.
