am i anti social or just introverted i've lived alone for years i'm divorced and my kids are all grown and gone in the past year i have been in a serious relationsip with a divorced man that has kids ages they don't live with him but are there everyday until school starts next week we have plans to move in together in october as the time gets closer for me to move in with him i'm spending more and more time alone at my own house most days i find all the kids and the noise overwhelming i have been avoiding taking part in some of the activities they do during the day saying i'm working in my home office which is not entirely un true i dread having to deal with all the family visits and the constant talking that teenagers will do i love my boyfriend very much and i know this is part of his life that i'll have to accept do i feel this way because i'm just not used to having that many people around or is there something wrong with me perhaps you are simply having doubts about giving up a life you have become accustomed to you've been on your own for years and must have established a routine and a comfort with living on your own even though you love your boyfriend moving in with him will be a significant change seeing the amount of involvement he has with his children must be a major eye opener you aren't just moving in with him you are adding four relatively young children into your life not looking forward to being step mom to four children after you've already done your parenting does not particularly indicate introversion or anti social tendencies it suggests ambivalence about wanting to take on such responsibility at this stage in your life probably something you and boyfriend need to talk about before you make the big move good luck Social rule Transsexuality Laura Schlessinger Fathers' rights Friends EastEnders Marriage Narcissism Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Grief Asperger syndrome Pitaten Carl Jung Kender Divorce Humphrey Bogart The Smoking Room Phoebe Halliwell Cliff Richard The Contender (television series) Alcoholics Anonymous Sant Thakar Singh Infantilism Jon Secada Charmed Extreme Programming W.I.T.C.H.
