problem staring at women looking at porn has caused me to sometimes inappropriately catch myself looking at women too long where i tend to stare and get caught i don't like the fact that i started doing this and its led me to avoid talking to women because i feel bad that i do this to them how can i stop this behavior try to look at women simply as people not women we actually have personalities not just bodies you might want to imagine women as men or try to imagine their bodies as just a blur that might work if not you might want to so a hypnotherapist a friend of mine did it and it worked good luck Milton H.
