ever had a dream crushed i've tried for a really long time to keep my expectations low so i wouldn't be as disappointed when something fails this time i really applied myself and due to circumstances beyond my control what i began is now ending abruptly this is really personal so i'm trying to keep it as vague as possible any encouraging words yep lots of times over and over like i keep head butting purposly into a brick wall lets see my mother would make this happen every chance she got however she couldn't help it she was bipolar just recentaly i was all ready to move to a house we were sure we were going to buy but because of something beyound my control in my husbands past which is now eating up our present and causing havoc and fights we will probaly never have a house we will never have anything more then we have now why because laws are unevenly applied because you get the justice you can afford because of the stereo types that if a man divorces a woman must be a deadbeat dad so yes i know lots on this subject trust me it keeps happening to me however i keep dreaming after this last one i don't think i am going to dream anymore Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Theory of conduct Divorce Social rule Bulk vending Grandview, U.S.A.
