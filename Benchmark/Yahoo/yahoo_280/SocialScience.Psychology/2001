comfort object for adults i know that children have security blankets and maybe that is the most similar thing i can think of to this situation i have a friend who is apparently using her pillow as a comfort object she is in her 's it's not like she drags it around or anything but she definately needs the pillow to sleep she says that the smell and texture and coolness of the pillow and pillowcase make her feel better when she is stressed out i'm looking for more information on this online for her i dont think that this is necessarily a bad thing i just think its something that needs to be looked at and i'm having trouble finding anything online maybe because i dont know exactly what to call it all info on comfort objects or security blankets is based on children any constructive advise opinions a she asked me to find out more about this she's doubting herself and i wanted to show her that she is not the only one b she freely admits that she is not a fully functional adult there are many other issues that she deals with the fact that she was too afraid to post this question herself is proof of that c thanks to those who have already responded i will be showing her the answers e she also sucked her thumb as a child and often times wakes up in the morning sucking her thumb which she is very embarassed about and that is how all of this started i saw her sleeping like that crashed on my couch to be honest i also have a comfort pillow it is something about the smell and softness coolness of it i have no idea why its always been this way with me i still need it when i am sitting on the couch etc but don't need it however when i was a kid i couldn't walk room from room without dragging that thing around Mattress Upholstery Pillow Milton H.
