is there any difference between learning and education the difficulty here seems to be in definitions for many people who use the english language the terms seem to be ubiquitous and interchangeable but they may do well to note that the topic this was posted under is psychology learning is a circumstance where different behaviors are more likely to occur as a result of the reinforcement for those behaviors in order for this to happen the behavior in question must be something the organism can do humans can't learn unassisted flight there has to be a discriminative stimulus that prompts elicits the behavior there has to be a reinforcement of the behavior that affects the organism however the subject may also be subject to superstitious behaviors during the course of the learning as these are self reinforced so they may interfere or aid the learning process education is a collection of systems usually meant to provide learning to humans as a system of bottom up top down or a combination practice unfortunately as most education systems fail to take learning into consideration they are often systems that employ current trends or fads without consideration of the basis of the learning principles this is further complicated as education is often provided based on localities and therefore funded by governmental systems that may require substantiation of their budget in order to continue funding therefore many areas forgo the process of learning altogether and teach to the test in order to achieve desired funding results rather than use any accepted behavioral or cognitive process at all Psychology Cognitive science Behaviorism Radical behaviorism Developmental psychology Social psychology Second language acquisition Education in the People's Republic of China Economics Sexual orientation Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Education Neuro-linguistic programming Microeconomics Science Race and intelligence Object-oriented programming Economic inequality History of science Hypnosis Causality Music Alexander Technique Animal cognition Cognition Drug addiction Human sexual behavior Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Happiness Scientific method Artificial consciousness Stuttering Audiophile SAT Learning disability A Course In Miracles Many-worlds interpretation Philosophy of mathematics Intelligence quotient Medicine Graduate school Scientology beliefs and practices Asperger syndrome Milton H.
