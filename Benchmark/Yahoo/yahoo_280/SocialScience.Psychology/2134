question about dark secret thoughts shortly after i heard about people that were admitting to having dark or secret thoughts regarding tragedies such as the thoughts centered around the desire for major catastrophies to happen or the death of loved ones etc there were websites where people would actually share the secret thoughts they have my co workers were having a discussion after the bridge collapse in minn and i brought this up they do not believe that people have these types of thoughts and i told them about the website i saw shortly after the w t c attach they do not believe me does anyone recall hearing about this and if so would you happen to know of any of the websites i do not know of the websites you are talking about but i am familiar with the concept of the dark secret thoughts you mention i think that in most people's minds they are just momentary little mental transients passing through if we become consciously aware of them at all we recognize them for the unwanted mental garbage they are scoff at their absurd outrageous nature and mentally channel surf on past them to something else when they don't make it through to the conscious level at all then this grading and rejecting process is done subconsciously in some minds they pass through more slowly and some people are tempted to dwell on these thoughts when they occur and hold onto them for a while out of dark fascination but would still never consider actually acting on them these may very well be the people who have these websites you are referring to however in a basically negative mind such as that of a genuine sociopath these thoughts may not pass through at all but rather stop and take root in the fertile ground they find there then we get something like the columbine atrocity the oklahoma city bombing or the wtc attack Unconscious mind Milton H.
