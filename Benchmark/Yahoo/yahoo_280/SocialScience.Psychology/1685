i have to think over times before i go out does this mean i have agoraphobia i think like how do i look am i wearing the right clothes i hope i dont look too made up i hope i am not simple what will people think when they see me how do i react among people does my hair look good etc etc etc do you also have these thoughts before going out do i have agoraphobia or social anxiety could be social anxiety of some sort technically agoraphobia is a fear of meeting strangers or more specifically of finding yourself in an embarrassing situation from which you can't escape it sounds to me like you want to go out and do things and meet people but you're concerned with how they'll perceive you rather than the situations you'll find yourself in i suppose you could also have some sort of mild obsessive disorder but since i'm not a psychologist i can't say for sure you'd have to talk to someone who could diagnose you accurately if it's actually preventing you from going out or delaying you significantly then you might want to see a therapist about it likely they'd prescribe an anti anxiety pill for you if you'd rather not take pills for it then therapy in general will help you obviously therapy's nothing to be embarrassed about so go for it if you feel it would help good luck Agoraphobia Phobia Anxiety Stuttering Obsessive-compulsive disorder Panic attack Avoidant personality disorder Transsexuality Clinical depression Asperger syndrome Bipolar disorder Cognitive therapy Psychotherapy Autism Borderline personality disorder Psychoanalysis Charles Darwin's illness Post-traumatic stress disorder Traumatic brain injury Homophobia Hikikomori Dissociative identity disorder Reparative therapy Prostate cancer Anorexia nervosa Psychiatry Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Social rule Transgender Behavioral therapy Traumatic incident reduction Narcissism Ex-gay Social anxiety -phobia Antidepressant Controversies in autism Chronic fatigue syndrome Baldness Child sexual abuse Clomipramine Empathy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medicine Neuro-linguistic programming DSM-IV Codes Dog Autism rights movement Multiple sclerosis Urinary incontinence Sexual dysfunction EastEnders Hypnosis Space The nature of God in Western theology Fibromyalgia Parkinson's disease Orgasm Autistic community Schizophrenia Neurosis Paranoia Agent Rape Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hypertension Humanistic psychology Existentialism Magical thinking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Monk (TV series) Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Psychosis Gender identity disorder Diazepam Eating disorder Meditation Karen Horney Sexual addiction Alexander Technique Shyness Tocopherol Buspirone Maprotiline Milton H.
