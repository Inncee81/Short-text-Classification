is my house haunted i always visit my country every summer where we have a house there and all my family lives in it together on different floors it's only ten years old and we're the first people to live in it the thing is once our vacation there was over my mom confessed to me that the house there was haunted i have to admit i was startled because it would explain so much she told me that most of my aunts there have experienced sightings and sounds of a little girl bouncing a ball they both have kids and they were sleeping at that time so it would be impossible one of my aunts actually saw the girl playing with the ball on the other side of the hall there have also been other sightings were some people would see people walking from the corner of their eye and when they looked back they nothing was there and they were alone in the house my mom also revealed to me she heard voices of a man calling here name at night what kind of haunting is this is it a haunting how serious is it it sounds like these spirits are harmless they don't want to leave the house and they are stuck in this realm either because they died senselessly and were not ready or have unfinished business sounds strange but i know of a few people who asked me to come to their home spirits were in the house this one woman told me that they hung out in this one particular room the house was old and the woman who owned it was up there in age too but wanted answers so my husband who was doing remodeling work mentioned that i have had a little experience with this when i went into this room i felt nothing and told the woman maybe she mistakened this for another room or they are toying with me when i began to walk into this other room i felt faint and unlike me to ever sit down i had to sit down these spirits were curious about me after they evaluated me they were okay that i was there my daughter who was age at the time like me can sense things and began to talk and giggle to something the woman said there is a little girl spirit in here who must be talking to your daughter we walked in the room and my daughter pointed saying this is my new friend the spirits actually saved this woman's life by turning the outside street lights blue one night flickered and made banging noises from the cellar there was a shortage in a wire that caused the cellar to catch fire and the spirits somehow tried to grasp their attention and saved the house from burning down goofy as it sounds try to talk to them ask how you can help them and why they are there you may also want to say a prayer for them sometimes they don't realize they are just spirits now and need help to cross over you may want to say a prayer that angels come take them home see if that helps any but as for the term haunted i would say haunted is a word people use for spirits lurking there are good ones and bad ones and usually if they are surrounded by white they are good anything surrounded by darkness shadow dark clouds these are bad ones this is how you can tell the good ones from the bad hope this helps some ps did you ever see ghost whisperer with jennifer love hewitt if so notice many spirits here are not always brought in homes by the home itself but could come in with an item in the home or something that was pre existing on the land under the home maybe an item left behind or an antique purchased that may have brought them in The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Scenes from a Memory The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders RuneScape quests Phoebe Halliwell One Tree Hill (TV series) Blood (computer game) Dead Like Me Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories The Inside The Haunted Mansion The Death Gate Cycle YuYu Hakusho The Phantom Manor Knots Landing Tag Cliff Richard Jennifer Lopez The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sin City The Unquiet Dead The Empty Child The Subtle Knife Blood on the Tracks The Time Machine Milton H.
