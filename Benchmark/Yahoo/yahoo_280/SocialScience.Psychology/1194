what makes yawning contagious there's a new commercial on us tv that features people yawning it compells me to yawn too why is that everybody yawns from unborn babies to the oldest great grandparent animals do it too but why exactly do people and animals yawn no one knows for sure but there are many theories ideas about why people yawn one is that when we are bored or tired we just don't breathe as deeply as we usually do as this theory goes our bodies take in less oxygen because our breathing has slowed therefore yawning helps us bring more oxygen into the blood and move more carbon dioxide out of the blood yawning then would be an involuntary reflex something we can't really control to help us control our oxygen and carbon dioxide levels sounds good but other studies have shown that breathing more oxygen does not decrease yawning likewise breathing more carbon dioxide does not increase yawning hmmm now what another theory is that yawning stretches the lungs and lung tissue stretching and yawning may be a way to flex muscles and joints increase heart rate and feel more awake other people believe that yawning is a protective reflex to redistribute the oil like substance called surfactant say sur fak tunt that helps keep lungs lubricated inside and keeps them from collapsing so if we didn't yawn according to this theory taking a deep breath would become harder and harder and that would not be good but there is one idea about yawning that everyone knows to be true it seems contagious if you yawn in class you'll probably notice a few other people will start yawning too even thinking about yawning can get you yawning how many times have you yawned while reading this article we hope not many Yawn Drowning Lung Carbon dioxide Pulmonary alveolus Respiratory system Liquid breathing Breathing gas Heart Emphysema Infant respiratory distress syndrome Hyperventilation Rebreather Biochemistry Hemoglobin Pneumonia Apnea Explosive material Breath First aid Scuba set Shock Fetus Reptile Asthma Artery Urinary incontinence Photosynthesis Circulatory system Homeostasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Muscle Bronchitis Acute respiratory distress syndrome Exercise Blood Hiccup Sperm Whale Reflexology Lung cancer Intracranial pressure Weight training Carbon dioxide sink Tai Chi Chuan Suicide methods Equine conformation Brain CO2 retention Pulmonary embolism Massage Eye Sleep apnea Myocardial infarction Skeletal muscle Red blood cell Mosquito Diving cylinder Petroleum Prostate cancer Haloalkane Stroke Cancer Breastfeeding Gas exchange Chemosensor Hypercapnia Carbon monoxide poisoning Welding Diabetes mellitus Aquatic ape hypothesis Oxygen toxicity Ecology Cocaine Kyoto Protocol Human lung Air pollution Human physiology Carbon Internal combustion engine Aikido Sleep Coronary heart disease Titanium Biosphere 2 Fecal incontinence Anxiety Water (molecule)
