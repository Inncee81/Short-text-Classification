what do you see when you analyze your own life just off the top of my head and looking at my life right now which probably isn't much since i'm just i see myself as a person who has things handed to him too easily as a person to when it comes down to crunch time can't get whats most important done it's a rough time right now since i just failed semester of college haven't told my dad about that been heart broken and i'm starting to find my self to be a really anti social person and when i look to the core of me i find myself to be a shallow and non sincere person i feel like i need more depth in my life like i'm missing that big dramatic experience that makes me an adult well anyways thats what i see analyzing my life off the top of my head what do you see when you analyze your own life success failure happiness sorrow etc i'm curious to hear from both older people as well as the young thank you for your input first of all you need to realize you're pretty much like most young men your age then you need to give yourself a break failing is miserable add to that the disappointment that your father will feel and you decided to beat yourself up about it nothing new there you should failing is terrible but as bad as that is evaluating your life as a failure is disconcerting because it is how you view you as a person that's not good write down five things per day that you do well begin to change your presence of mind in a more positive direction where your pencil will lead you might actually surprise you everyone needs kudos and lots of it at your age if no one else gives them to you do it yourself i would bet that you're quite a fine young man when all is said and done i would also bet that you're one of the few who is willing to go introspective which gives you a gigantic leap towards that depth that you feel is eluding you at this time in your life no worries dude you will get there i am sure of it Theory of conduct Social rule Shaggy dog story Poker jargon One Tree Hill (TV series) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sydney Riot of 1879 Pitaten Coming of Age (TNG episode) EastEnders Scenes from a Memory Kodocha Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Microeconomics Extreme Programming The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Undergrads Jon Secada The Inside Storytelling Charles Goodyear Current teachings of Prem Rawat Time Out of Mind Knots Landing Nicomachean Ethics Ben Johnson (athlete) Teen Girl Squad The Fairly OddParents Milton H.
