do boys really mature later than girls is this true i remember when i was i could sit with my parents and listen to them have adult conversations all day and not be bored i'd watch cartoons once in a while but just for fun not that i couldnt watch anything else i actually prefered watching maury or days of our lives even then at i started wearing a beginner bra i got my period and the internet it was compuserve back then wow was a daily part of my life but now that my cousin is and is living with us for a while i am confused he still walks around and talks to himself about a show he watched or jumps froum couches and pretends that he is superman gets mad if he doesn't watch sesame street in the morning and the list goes on is this normal do all boys his age behave the same well i know the answer here is no but do other boys act like this do you think it has something to do with their mental development or maybe the way that the parents treat them it depends on the boy and the girl some boys act more maturely at a younger age as do some girls for me growing up i was a bit more mature and focused than my peers i did well in school was able to do boring tasks for long periods of time without complaining or going nuts i attribute this to the environment in which i was raised my parents helped me gain skills to succeed as an adult personally i think a lot has to do with the way the child is treated at a young age if a child is allowed to roam around freely and not answer to anyone over a long period of time maybe this child will develop more slowly if a child is socialized with adults and adult like behavior at a younger age then i think this child will mature more quickly makes sense right in fact adolescents who describe their parents as treating them warmly democratically and firmly are more likely than their peers to develop positive attitudes toward and beliefs about their achievement and as a consequence they are more likely to do better in school and the positive impact of authoritative parenting on achievement creates a healthy sense of autonomy and more specifically a healthy psychological orientation toward work Infantilism Narcissism Child sexuality Second language acquisition Hikikomori Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Sexual orientation Autism Puberty Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Karen Horney Breastfeeding Child Intelligence quotient Hearing impairment Social rule Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye Psychoanalysis Controversies in autism Adult attention-deficit disorder Psychology Borderline personality disorder Childlove movement Social psychology Growth hormone treatment Spanking Milton H.
