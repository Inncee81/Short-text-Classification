do you ever feel like your life is going to end soon i have had a rough couple of weeks just when i think things will get better something worse comes along first i lost thousands of dollars then found out i couldn't have kids and have to get surgery went online to post an opinion so now i'm kicked of that forum i can't make friends online or in real life all my friends and family members have abandoned me i'm pretty much hated where ever i go just recently something tragic happened in town and it hurt that nobody i knew called to see that i was ok i found out i was the only one who didn't receive even one phone call ouch yes i often feel this way too i find it very annoying concerning the lack of phone calls and get well soon gestures i too have had to deal with this phenomenon it used to drive me crazy but then i finally realized that i was the one who was unapproachable not because i was rude but because i was misunderstood i was different joey was different this made me feel very insecure as i grew older i learned that when people got to know me they liked me i then tried to start conversations hoping people would start liking me and talking to me more over the years i have gotten better at just being myself around people i finally got comfortable enough to ask some of my new friends why did it take so long for us to click to my surprise i got the same answer more than once it wasn't that we didn't like you it was that we didn't understand you what i have found is that the thing s that make you and me different are exactly the things people like your so unique that people are unsure of how to take you but when they do get to know you they can't get enough of you One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Friends Pitaten Knots Landing God Emperor of Dune Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Jon Secada Theory of conduct The Smoking Room Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Earth Girl Arjuna The Ashlee Simpson Show About a Boy Milton H.
