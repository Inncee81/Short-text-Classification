please tell me what you know about salvia my year old daughter has fallen into a pretty wild crowd and mentioned that all the kids are doing it now that they were able to find it at the warp tour last week i remeber seeing somthing about it on the news a while ago and i remember it being discussed by parents who'd lost their children to the drug be it by side effects or poor judgement she even told me that she tried it and hated it so much she gave it away after she hallucinated i read about it on line but would really appreciate some insight here i already have some concerns with her smoking pot although i do believe it is somewhat of a right of passage she is a really good kid and i am honored that she knows she can tell me anything without being judged i just cannot stand the thought of her getting caught up in something she can't get out of and by trying the salvia i am wondering what else she will or has tried i used to laugh when folks would say that weed was a gateway drug but honestly it is the good news on the bright side salvia divinorum has been found to be completely non toxic in that it doesn't cause organ or cell damage you probably wouldn't be any worse off smoking iceberg lettuce than this stuff just the normal health risks of smoking anything this was determined when mice were given copious amounts far beyond what a human would ever possibly be able to use and they were just fine another good thing is that it's probably not a gateway drug tests on mice have shown that salvia divinorum is anti addictive for the most part mice given the option of pressing button that dispensed cocaine continued pressing the button indefinately mice given the option of pressing buttons one dispensing cocain and the other salvia divinorum eventually stopped pressing either button altogether i have read some online articles suggesting that salvia divinorum treatments could be developed for crystal meth and cocaine addicts for this reason i doubt anybody in the treatment field has taken the idea seriously though of course a lot of people like your daughter get so scared off by the salvia experience itself that they never want to use it again also it doesn't seem possible to die from an overdose as i said it's non toxic and no amount seems to cause physical damage add to that the fact that you'd pass out and be unable to continue using it after a while and you have a beautiful combination of circumstances making it impossible to die from overuse the trip only lasts for a couple of minutes depending on the strength of the extract you smoke then you're pretty much back to your normal self it's kinda convenient that way if you smoke the leaves plain it won't do much of anything if you smoke the extract that uses about times the number of leaves' active chemical in one hit then you have a out of this world hallucinagenic trip x extract is usually more than enough for an average person further it's legal almost everywhere except for a handful of countries and a few states in the us so no laws are probably being broken yet the bad news the lousy thing about this plant is that it can make you lose all understanding of what you're doing you can lose self awareness but still be able to interact with the world around you that means you could throw yourself out of a window unintentionally stab yourself try to dive into concrete stare at the sun attack somebody eat something inedible try to merge with objects believe you can fly etc etc etc this is why you need a sitter and most certainly be careful i imagine that any deaths resulting from salvia use interestingly none have been reported would be due to unintentional self harm during a trip if you've tried it you'll know how unable you are to comprehend or control anything you're doing on a rational level or even be consciously aware of it for most people of course use should be harmless more bad news is that there's no long term knowledge about what effects this has on the human brain nobody really knows if there are flashbacks if the active chemical salvinorin a gets metabolized into something else that creates long term effects if people lose touch with reality or anything nobody knows and that's scary sure it could just as likely be completely benign and harmless in the long term but we just don't know one family in new england had a son using salvia who killed himself they of course believe his suicide was caused by his salvia use while it could very well be the case there are also a lot of people who claim that salvia divionorum has significant short term anti depressant effects lasting from days after smoking it so i take the idea that salvia divinorum use can lead to suicides with the same grain of salt i use for people who claim prozac causes suicides prozac or salvia very well may exacerbate depression situations in some cases but overwhelmingly both have been found to be positive for people in this regard but still we can't rule out the role of salvia in the hopeless perception of one young man one more thing i should mention is that nobody knows what the effect on the brain really is except that it's a kappa optioid receptor antagonist that it has a direct effect on our consciousness and perception of self awareness i practically just wrote a thesis lol i hope it helps though Hypoglycemia Cancer
