feel so lonely feel so lonely these days no one who understands me people have always thought of me as a loser and i believe i have been one in many ways the part that hurts the most is that the people i love also believe so there is this incredible sense of loneliness n emptiness which always sort of gnaws at my inner self in a self destructive way nobody to share my feeling with no friends no one to talk to life is so frustrating there is no charm in lfe no willingness to fight no inspiration no goal no motivation no love amazingly worthless life do others also ever feel this way or is it simply me wish someone could help me this is almost everyday for me too kinda like that hank williams sr song i think my problem is working so hard and always studying i never really have any free time to socialize and i don't have any friends either however i try to move forward and not let my feelings get me down i also listen to joel osteen he's awesome and he makes me feel better about myself i'm sending a few links to some great website maybe you should check them out Cliff Richard Rich Mullins Theory of conduct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jon Secada Transactional analysis Anger management Billy Joel The Emancipation of Mimi A Day in the Life Religious Society of Friends The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Current teachings of Prem Rawat Past teachings of Prem Rawat W.I.T.C.H.
