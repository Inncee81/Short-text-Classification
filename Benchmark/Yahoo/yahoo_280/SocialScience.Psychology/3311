why is losing weight so hard and why did i get upset about this i find losing weight to be one of the biggest battles there is and it is not easy it is hard i hate to work out because i get discouraged and working out results take forever it seems my sibling called because she wanted to come over and work out i have a gym in my complex and for some reason that pissed me off or made me mad and i got annoyed with her what is a good way to like working out because to be very blunt i dont like to i dont like being pushed by other people either my question is why do some people have such a hard time with weight how can some people eat and eat and eat and dont gain weight and other people gain too i wonder why i got upset with my sibling also i do realize that every social event should not be revovled around dinner desserts and snacks thanks for you answers well first off you've gotta get that chip off your shoulder nobody likes having to start losing weight the boring workouts the aches pains blah blah blah find an exercise that's fun for you don't get all pissed because you sister cares about her body and since you re not using the gym why can't she some people have high metabolism rates others are waaaaay less fortunate that doesn't mean to just throw your hands up and say well that's it i can't eat all the good sweet stuff drink the fattening drinks lay around the house and stay thin i might as well just accept the fact the i'll be fat foreverrrrrr stop whining get off your duff and do some exercises go for a walk not a stroll with your sister that you so easily get annoyed by get a bicycle ride it for an hour or so break a sweat get your heart rate up go for a swim do some laps across that free pool you have i struggle with weight on a daily basis but as long as i recognize that i can't live that's right live like the super skinny people account for my own actions when it comes to eating and exercising it's alot easier to keep down to a healthy weight this is a lifestyle not a fad you gotta live the way you need to not just crash diet every months for the rest of your life diets never work commitment does now log off turn off your computer go get some workout clothes on since you seem to have some extra time on your hands and go do something you'll thank me someday Weight training Dieting Little Britain Swimming Anorexia nervosa Poker jargon Atkins Nutritional Approach Humphrey Bogart Bodybuilding Obesity Kodocha Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Exercise The Ashlee Simpson Show Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Garfield FoxTrot Breastfeeding Super Size Me Swimming pool Piccolo Junior Saga Diving Binge eating disorder Blood (computer game) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Hypoglycemia Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Survivor (novel) Vegetarianism Pitaten Veganism Eric Cartman Shaggy dog story EastEnders Babe Ruth Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Theory of conduct Hamster Kim Possible The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Ron and Fez The Apprentice 2 Meal Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Piece minor characters Chocolate Osteoarthritis Fancy rat Skateboarding trick Knots Landing Jon Secada Chronic fatigue syndrome Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog One Tree Hill (TV series) Sugar substitute Fecal incontinence Terri Schiavo Alcoholics Anonymous Tocopherol Tooth enamel Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Fruits Basket The Amazing Race The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Guinea pig Bicycle Prostate cancer Eddie Guerrero Urinary incontinence Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Vegeta Triathlon Jackass: The Movie Singlish Sola fide 2000 Australian Grand Prix Low-carbohydrate diet Mattress Hansel und Gretel Weight loss Alcoholic beverage Domestic rabbit Swingout Clinical depression Teen Girl Squad Kimi Finster Coronary heart disease Cuisine of Denmark
