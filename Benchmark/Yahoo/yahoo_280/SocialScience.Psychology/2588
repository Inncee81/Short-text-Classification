do you think myspace is overrated yes or no if you want to give reasons why please state thanks i'm not the least bit interested in having a myspace account i prefer to not follow the bandwagon and do my own thing that is meet friends in real life the old fashioned way i think younger as well as older folks should do an experiment log off for a day or two maybe even a week or month and try to meet some friends in the external world maybe they will find they have been missing out there's so much more to life outside of a computer get out people even a publicist i used to know has a myspace page to promote her book how lame is that it's not only just for social networking but also to promote personal projects i think people should create their own web pages not myspace for that i would myspace just doesn't seem like the right place to boast about book accomplishments i can accept it more for teenagers and somethings because they are still young and having fun but the older folks need to grow up i know someone over who has a page along with someone else who's younger and to see nearly friends announced just seems so silly it's like they're in fifth grade and saying look here i'm popular i've got friends real mature it's probably covering up for their lame lives because anybody who is extroverted would surely devote their energy to meeting actual friends in person classes work church social engagements charity functions etc and the list goes on the info on some myspace pages appears too cluttered why people would want a cookie cutter social life is beyond me there are so many ways to socially network offline and seeing people face to face is a far better option it's reality yes it's a shallow way to make friends it's also a cowardly way to make friends it's time teenagers need to start meeting people in person instead of hiding behind your computer screen to save embarassment MySpace LiveJournal Social software Social network Theory of conduct MMORPG Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Windows XP Cross site scripting Alcoholics Anonymous Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide HTTP cookie Azumanga Daioh Internet fraud Neopets My Life as a Teenage Robot B3ta Infantilism Hospitality service 2channel It's Walky!
