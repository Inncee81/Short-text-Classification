no dreams i know everyone has dreams everynight but sometimes they just don't remember them well i can't remember any of the dreams i have had like the last time i had a dream was years and years ago some people have very vivid dreams but i don't seem to remember them why is that some people are just better at remembering dreams than others some researchers believe that certain people have a genetic disposition to forget their dreams as they come out of their sleep and you're more likely to remember a dream if you wake up in the middle of it try this first thing when you wake up try and remember what you dreamt of don't focus too hard but just try and get a feeling i e if you had a good dream you'll feel warm and nice gauge the mood you're in i find that snippets of dreams will drift back to me during the day but again it's more of a feeling than 'knowing' what you dreamt of start off with this to help you build up a dream memory Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Cliff Richard Scenes from a Memory Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Philosophical skepticism Sleep Shaggy dog story Jon Secada 50 First Dates Narcolepsy Mattress Pitaten Haibane Renmei The Shining (film) Social rule Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q Time Out of Mind Futurama (TV series - season 5) False memory The Amber Spyglass Parsifal Nightmares (Buffy episode) Turiya The McGuire Sisters Sleeping Murder Code 46 D__j__ vu Sigmund Freud The Emancipation of Mimi Saga (band) The Rutles Hypnosis Kender Long-term memory Insomnia Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Psychosis Vera Lynn Singlish Leo Wyatt Muraqaba One Tree Hill (TV series) The Pet Sounds Sessions Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carrie Jacobs-Bond Humphrey Bogart Sampling (music) Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Milton H.
