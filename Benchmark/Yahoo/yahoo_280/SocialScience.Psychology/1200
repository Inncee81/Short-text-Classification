how do i get over certain fears i have some weird fears like for instance i cannot get on thrill rides at an amusement park simply because i'm terrified of that free falling sensation you get on rollercoasters or anything with a large drop i will go into a sheer panic on these rides until it's over my boyfriend loves these rides and doesn't want to go on one without me and i feel like i'm spoiling his fun by clamming up and refusing i'm also afraid of parrots i can talk to them as long as they are in their cages but i've been bitten so many times if i try to pet one my heart starts racing and i jump at the slightest movement they make which of course makes them nervous and more likely to bite me i love birds though and i'd like to own a parrot at some point how do i get over these things being afraid of thrill rides is not abnormal it is the fear that usually makes it fun for most people for you self preservation is simply stronger and overrides the risk taking that is required by those of us who can enjoy these types of rides for example i am terrified of heights most would say this is abnormal however people do fall off of ladders and roofs and get injured and even die since it doesn't interfere with my daily life it is not abnormal for me i can fly in an airplane because i feel safe in an enclosed space but i will never climb onto the roof of a house as for the parrot problem you are having a normal reaction to having been bitten it really hurts when they bite the best thing for you to do if you really want to own one is to find a local breeder who has an extremely tame one who would be willing to help you overcome your fear of being bitten you may never get over it though have you thought about owning a cockatiel they are intelligent birds and can learn to talk yes they can bite too but it doesn't hurt like a parrot Diving Kim Possible Piccolo Junior Saga Equine conformation Roller coaster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Anxiety Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Knoebels Pitaten The Amber Spyglass Tenshinhan Alcoholics Anonymous Milton H.
