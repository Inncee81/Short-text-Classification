marriage problems hi i have been married for years and we've known each other for over i grew up in the usa then moved to central america where i studied and married we don't drink smoke or cheat on each other sex is great but we are constantly fighting about bs and we know it but in that moment it seems so necesary to fight i don't feel he appreciates me for me and he feels the same he's i'm we don't have kids we like kids just not while we are sharing a apartment with his cousins is there any free counseling we can go to in the dc metro area do you have any advice is there any advice you can give us we've talked about divorce several times but we love each other and want to have kids of our own we've both had psychological problems in the past he really doesn't trust psychologist and i take the what i can from them he speaks spanish and he's learning english any questions i'll try to answer you say you are sharing an apt with his cousins could this be a problem i would think you would want to be on your own sometimes we fight over stupid things when the problem is really right in front of us and we just don't know it think about it ask him how he feels about it and hopefully you can agree to disagree on something without having it blow up into a big fight communication is the key to any good relationship hope this helps some Laura Schlessinger Friends Humphrey Bogart Trailer Park Boys Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Polyamory Marriage Psychology Current teachings of Prem Rawat Divorce Transactional analysis About a Boy Past teachings of Prem Rawat Incarnations of Immortality EastEnders Brian Griffin Sub-Zero Theory of conduct Homosexuality and Christianity Kimi Finster Billy Joel Avenue Q Henry Fonda Hollyoaks Liam Gallagher True Crime: Streets of LA Phoebe Halliwell Sharon Tate Great Teacher Onizuka Plame affair Transsexuality Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Miss Saigon Sex and the City Nancy Witcher Astor Causality Neighbours Infantilism George Costanza Eastern Orthodox Church The Catcher in the Rye Singlish Recurring South Park characters Richard Feynman The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Boston Public Sexual revolution A Course In Miracles Theodicy Jennifer Lopez Ex-gay The Invisibles Characters from Arrested Development Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Breastfeeding Altruism Alcoholics Anonymous Asperger syndrome Mystique (comics) The nature of God in Western theology Pitaten Charmed 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Care Bears Kodocha Waylon Jennings Human sexual behavior Ken Keyes, Jr. Alan Keyes Radio Yerevan The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Novel Series finale Teachers (film) Lauren Bacall Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Shaggy dog story Kender Consciousness English grammar Same-sex marriage Knots Landing The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie W.I.T.C.H.
