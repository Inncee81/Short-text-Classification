can you please tell me if this one is good enough for a loved one i wrote it thank you the night had fallen the sky dark and cold fatigued i felt yet spirited and truly bold with an angel did i speak with halo big and bright my heart still pounding like a child faced with fright i tried to reach her soul so close and yet so far futile it seemed like one who couldn't reach the star my mind wouldn t budge and my heart kept pushing on then the diva called so my mind went blank suddenly it happened i froze where i stood where else could it be that i had never been twas as if unreal that one really would feel an angel or a god from deep within shook my head peered through the haze is this really it or my mind playing tricks my being gave way staring at the gaze pinched myself checked my heart if it ticks yes it is i cried yet no one turned to see am i still alive can i touch and hold it too the smile said it all my heart now was free i held out my arms it s not a dream its true she held me but my knees gave way foolish i felt yet my heart felt otherwise the smile was enough spoke but couldn t say this is heaven who cares i came to get my prize deevoonay ye toh your rhyme scheme lacks consistency it's aa bb cc then the rhyme scheme is lost altogether then it resumes ab ab i'd suggest grouping the first six lines in pairs couplets then group the rest in sets of four i'm not sure what you intend to do with pushing on and blank i'm assuming this is a work in progress as far as whether it's good enough for a loved one well the quality of the poem is inconsequential what matters is how personal it is from what i'm reading it could be about anybody if you're writing for someone make it about him her Jon Secada Poker jargon The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Milton H.
