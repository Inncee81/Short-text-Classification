how can we get our brains to function more effectively when we are born we have too many axons on our neurons while a baby is learning to walk or eat they are not doing so because they are building a set of skills yes the connection between more frequently used neurons becomes stronger but on the whole the axons that are not being used wither and go away so that the random firing of unnecessary axons does not trigger neuron response long walk for a short drink what it means is this if you don't use it you loose it if you fail to stimulate your brain you actually become more stupid as time goes on if you don't need to don't bother if you spend your time developing useless talents then those are the ones that you'll have a greater inclination for rather than more useful ones such as a young girl learning more about make up than study skills who then does poorly in school seems obvious but it still happens all the time Neuron Brain Action potential Long-term potentiation Clinical depression Retina Biological neural network Multiple sclerosis Eric R.
