anyone got over their fear of height i am totally afraid of height since i was young i am also afraid of crossing a long bridge and be at the front of a canoe in a river someone has to be infront of me this is because when u r at the front of a canoe u can get to see the horizon honestly when i get to see much distance i get afraid i always have to hold on someone's hand orelse i lose control i do not want to be afraid of height forever since i can remember i was afraid of height i think i was born with this problem i really want to hear from people who got over their fear of height hopefully i will make up my mind someday and really face my fear of height i hope i am serious about this strangely i had almost the opposite problem i'm yo for the first years of my life i climbed anything everything trees hills mountains grain silos etc i had no real fear just a healthy respect but as i got older i put on weight years ago i went up a trail in high winds without hiking poles wearing cross trainers that have virtually no tread the trail became more exposed sloped away from the hill i shoud have stopped gone back but i ignored my growing fear until it turned into an irrational terror i really did become frozen with fear i had to lie flat on the trail every par of my body pressing in to the ground eventually i was able to think rationally enough to realise i would feel better getting off the trail so i sat up slowly edged down the trail on my bum when the trail got a little easier i got up walked back to my car but i have had several attacks since i know it's an irrational fear sometimes i also have a rational fear too i have eventually reduced not broken the fear by hinking the same trail doing it right lost weight wearing trail shoes taking hiking poles doing it in good weather i'm still not cured but last xmas i went hiking in new zealand was ok on some decent hikes up various mountains you have to find the rational trigger of the irrational fear as i love climbing mountains i have an incentive years ago i couldn't even stand on the edge of the grand canyon i live in az used to hike the gc times a year i'm doing a week long backcountry gc hike at thanksgiving this year Yosemite National Park Hiking Shaggy dog story Appalachian Trail Mountaineering Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Glossary of climbing terms Bryce Canyon National Park Gliding Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Sierra Nevada (US) Long Path The Amber Spyglass Cross-country skiing Car handling Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Tire Skiing Punt (boat) Volleyball Grand Canyon Slide Mountain (New York) Comanche One Tree Hill (TV series) Fast bowling Piccolo Junior Saga Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Dog training Avalanche Horse Cascade Range Yosemite Valley Operation Market Garden Diving Mountain bike Trail Eddie Guerrero Recumbent bicycle Stairway Milton H.
