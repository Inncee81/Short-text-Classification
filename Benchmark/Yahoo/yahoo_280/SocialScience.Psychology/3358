can you name a childhood experience that scarred you for life when i was years old i saw a man gun down a couple walking out of a resteraunt from my bed room window when i was i woke up and saw my dad put a gun to my mom's head on my sister's bed and previous to that i used to see my dad beat my mom in the kitchen and he knew i was in the corner crying and he held a knife to her neck once they got divorced the day that i woke up and saw that though and i watched the police take my dad away to jail now my mom hits me and still does she makes me feel like crap and blames me for everything i'm years old now she's probably the most negative person in my life but i don't tell anyone my dad doesn't even know she hits me i'm too scared to say anything to anyone though because i don't know what will happen if i do or where i will go i'm always scared to go home from school or work but i feel like if i don't i'll have no where else to go Shaggy dog story The Marshall Mathers LP Sin City The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) EastEnders Grandview, U.S.A.
