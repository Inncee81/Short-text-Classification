a guy told me that i wait for people to screw me over before reacting what should i learn from this the other day i was at a pub w some friends and got to talking w guys probably in their early mid s i'm in my mid s lately i've been trying to change and become more confident and assertive and less of a pushover trying to take advice on this board the one guy kept joking that he could probably read me and tell what kind of person i am one thing that kinda stung was when i said that i make people sorry if they screw me over or rip me off and he said eh you seem like the type that lets people do something to you before you react or make them sorry i can tell i tried to claim that i didn't even though what he said had more of a grain of truth in it but he said nah i can tell why do you think he thought this it's not that i care what this guy thinks of me it's more that i care about not looking like a pushover since i've been trying to be less of a pushover that gets stepped on so easily what should i take away from this experience okay what i think the guy meant is that i wait too long to react or stop a bad thing from happening which pathetic as it is that somewhat cocky guy's words were true a very recent example is one i wrote about on this site before this guy avoided me for like weeks had his friends pretend that i had the wrong when i called him i waited a whole weeks to break up with him i figured he was cheating but i didn't want to accuse him until i had proof yeah i did get my proof eventually but in the meantime i looked stupid the guy thought that i was stupidly naive blind to it the whole time b c i waited too long to react another time is when i could tell that a friend wasn't being a true friend to me but i kept quiet about it ignored my intuitions waiting for the friend to steal from me a few times before finally severing the friendship what i mean is i think i've waited too long to react or stop something i've pushed aside my intuitions to appear nice to john d i did not talk about my personal life to this guy it was very light small talk more about media and politics than anything he asked about my dating status i said i was single made a crack trying to be all confident bravado about how i don't like boyfriends and how i dumped my last one and serves him right aka the cheater i wrote about before that's when he said with a slightly flippant tone eh i see you as being the type that waits for someone to do something bad to you before you get mad as if i'm at least semi pushover the point is i don't want people to see thru my bravado see me as a pushover this guy didn't know details about my life still said something that rang clear hurt my feelings the reason it hurt my feelings is b c the truth hurts being viewed as a pushover is the biggest possible insult to me right now they gave you an honorable insight into yourself and you are most wise to have paid attention to what they said wisdom hails from exactly that actually getting centered enough within ourselves to sensibly notice our reflection that others around us cast back at us any reflection back at us about ourselves seems like some kind of violation or threat though took me forever to calm down in that particular response that automatic defensive alarm is natural and universal though repeated exposure to that phenomenon toughens us in time and we get steady enough to more rationally assimilate the feedback you want to assimilate feedback now as for what they said in their reflection of you there are numerous reasons why we might allow people to take advantage of us or for why we appear to be that kind of person the truth is that behavior of allowing people to screw us over is very recognizable especially to people who had to overcome the tendency themselves i would take heed of their feedback assume that they may have a valid point in human relationships there is a push shove thing going on all the time some people become masters at pushing and shoving and manipulating and controlling and persuading others i personally consider that behavior to be dishonorable but it exists and it is necessary to learn as much as possible about those aggressive behaviors our minds and even somewhat our bodies have built in defense mechanisms for behaviors directed at us that we consciously or subconciously perceive as aggressions those defenses though are primitive knee jerk behaviors and they creat a physiological stress cascade within us that actually blinds us makes it impossible to learn or comprehend or perceive our surroundings lucidly people who become masters of aggression learn how to play off those knee jerk responses so it's important to find a way to overcome them to become more aware of the moment and more aware of what's really happening in all seriousness zen meditation and self hypnosis are what i found to be most effective at breaking the knee jerk grip over our awareness of the moment becoming the master of your own behaviors so to say begins with breaking that autonomic response system once you are more aware of yourself in any given moment what occurs around you in that moment also becomes more sensible to you you'll begin to really hear the insults the put downs the manipulations and other passive aggressions aimed at you spend a great deal of time learning how to be aware of the moment and observing what others or really up to then work on building up the grace to respond effectively in the beginning when you first start to catch the aggressions and invasions and offensive behaviors aimed at you you will be angry in a hot flash just don't respond and practice instead in your head more balanced responses your goal is assertiveness assertive responses is what your companions were telling you you lack assertiveness training is extremely helpful study most seriously about assertiveness at first as i said there is a powerful urge to engage in tit for tat behavior like fencing but the more assertive that you become the less effect aggression has on you and in time you'll learn to rise above such primitive behaviors of others and not pay any attention to it whatsoever other than in a wry amused way but trust me you should not pretend to be above it all now and forego the hard work of assertiveness development because without truly having exposed yourself in sensible exercises of exposure and observation your mind and body's defense systems will continue to autonomically jerk up a storm and cause you unhealthy blinding stress whether you admit it or not Extreme Programming
