divorced mom with selfish teenagers why is it that my children never seem to care what i want as far as respect and common curtisy when i have done nothing but the best for my children since birth always have been there involved in school make sure they have eveything they need work hard to keep a decent roof over their head put my own needs and love life aside the sad part is i can not get them to do a thing around the house but they willingly do things at their fathers without being asked i ask to spend time with them and they always have something better to be doing i just don't understand their father has never been there financially for them never worried about spending quality time with the kids when they were younger they forget me on mothers day and birthdays and remember him and are just plain hurtful why do they treat the parent that was always there showing them love and respect like dirt and the parent that never found time for them with respect i never spoke bad about their dad it is obvious that you are really hurting my heartfelt sympathy in answer to 'why' it's the old issue 'absence makes the heart grow fonder' kids make up stories and idealize the absent one and they are 'with you' the majority of the time and have 'trained' you to act in certain ways toward them and to respond in certain ways not out of malice they just 'know' how to do this and you're too busy putting food on the table and a roof over their head to be able to navigate that particular path i love the analogy that tweens are like dogs love to see you loyal friendly cuddly and obedient i e do not like being called 'bad puppy' and therefore are trainable unfortunately at the teens the dog becomes a cat the cat could care less what you want whether you are accepting or not will cuddle on its own time and is going to do its own thing most of the parent teaching courses including the self help books are pretty lame but you might get lucky check with your local family services office and see if some classes are being offered if you are in a large enough city check out single mom's support groups some churches used to provide some informative classes may i also suggest buy bill cosby's himself vhs or dvd and observe it closely now a lot of what he talks about is 'what not to do' so you learn by doing the opposite there's a bit about 'his wife changing the rules' i e get up and fix the kids breakfast that is not only funny but has superb teaching points in it by the way arbitrary 'changing of the rules' always causes great tumult in the family system Kodocha Humphrey Bogart The Fairly OddParents Social rule Shaggy dog story Our Gang Theory of conduct The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ten Commandments Doug One Tree Hill (TV series) About a Boy Infantilism Bill Cosby Laura Schlessinger Little Britain Beavis and Butt-head Boston Public Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Fathers' rights Kurt Cobain W.I.T.C.H.
