i am so confused i am and i have to pick between a career and a boyfriend potential husband what should i do my boyfriend lives abroad and if i move there now i won't have a good job as i do now but i really love him not sure what to do love is the hardest thing to find in this world there are many paths in life career wise if you are able and willing you can find new career paths wherever you go when you are young when it comes to love you only get one chance usually with the right one lots of wrong ones for most people in that search for the right one what you do have to consider though is if you wind up resenting your bf for what you have to give up it will poison the relationship in a hurry so if you choose to go with him you have to let go completely with the opportunity that you turn down never hold it against him even if he turns out to be one of the wrongs resentment harms you as well even if things go wrong if you tried your best and it was an honest effort on all sides then it was a chance worth taking when it's all said and done take out a coin make heads represent one decision tails the other throw it in the air before the coin hits the ground you'll know which side you want it to land on the one you want it to land on is the one you should make Shen Gong Wu Social rule Charmed One Tree Hill (TV series) Current teachings of Prem Rawat EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Coin flipping Dead Like Me Theory of conduct Theodicy 1957 World Series Professional wrestling throws Jon Secada Phoebe Halliwell Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Poker jargon T.A.T.u.
