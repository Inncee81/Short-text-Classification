why does sometime i feel not being part of life is hard to explain but my life it's been complicated let's start with my guilts of my past i don't have a diploma not to say that i've been for my classes many time and didn't stay to finish i have goals i won't accomplish nothing 'm lazy in many way's and feel down a lot i don't know why i lie so much and did wronge to baby mom and lost her not only but she took my daughter that crushes me daily not being able to see my daughter growing up not only but also sharing with my daughter i haven't kept a job for a whole year and also i have an addiction problem i walk on a tredmeal and dont seem to go know were why thank you danny one thing i can say is that i'm glad that you have goals that you want to accomplish and that you haven't totally given up the first place i would start is the addiction problem that you have unfortunately you didn't give mention to what type of problem so we are limited there i know you read my answer on another question and perhaps the information i gave would apply to you here you have to want to stop whatever it is that your doing and you have to do it for you trying going to meetings find friends that into clean fun and activities and don't quit quitting it will be a continuous struggle but as long as you work on it with the proper help and support system you can do anything if you find yourself wanting it keep yourself occupied with something else eventually the cravings urges will supress and in time it will get easier and easier getting your ged will take some studying but again another positive goal that will help you move towards other positive changes lazyness is a frame of mind you can change it by setting your mind to it and depression my play a part as well drugs will assist in bringing you down mentally and physically which brings us back to having love for your daughter is a good thing and know that it is crushing you is also a good in the sence that you do still care about things and perhaps you could use that to further motivate yourself once you've kicked the habit you should find it easier to find employment and perhaps the willingness to actually go and be productive who knows perhaps making strides and accomplishing these things may change the mind of your ex perhaps not to the extent of getting back together but maybe some visitation even if it has to be supervised at first last as far as the treadmill goes it's a stationary walking machine your not intended to go anywhere lol sorry had to this response is has been quite serious i hope you truely work hard at sobriety and towards your goals and in the end find the happiness your searching for btw i think this will help with your mother as well i know don't want to disspoint her either and care about her i hope you know that by hurting yourself it hurts others around you i'm confident that if they saw you working to make these changes that should you require a support system that she they would be there for you another positive in this is that you are taking responsibility for your actions it's good to see that your not putting the blame on others i would like to think there is hope for you yet good luck Alcoholics Anonymous Pitaten Theory of conduct Social rule Knots Landing Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) GED Days of our Lives Shaggy dog story Kodocha Jon Secada Everwood Boston Public Addiction Milton H.
