who admits to liking porn no one seems to admit actually enjoying watching it but there is so much on the net now that everyone must have a little look now and then and please don't say that it's a guy thing i have a hard time believing that personally i don't mind as long as its real and i don't mind admitting it either so many people will go aaaarh i'd never do that and then go home and do exactly that whats with the false modesty i like it probably too much haha but it's stimulating for me and i don't see anything wrong with it ok well there's some of it that is just way too out there for me but i just don't watch that stuff i think many women are still under the impression that they need to be ladylike and just aren't comfortable enough with themselves sexually to be comfortable watching it Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Dualism (philosophy of mind) Motion picture rating system Child pornography Jehovah's Witnesses Teen Girl Squad Friends Shit Sin City Strap-on dildo Pornography Avenue Q Ex-gay W.
