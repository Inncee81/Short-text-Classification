what are modern psychologists saying about the james lange theory william james said we feel sorry because we cry angry because we strike afraid because we tremble this was supported by danish physiologist carl lange i'm not a psychologist but i work in the mental health field as a child psychotherapist i'll give you my opinion the theory's base is in causality most people back then and now believe that our behaviors are responses to emotional experiences the inverse notion that emotional experiences are instead responses to the behaviors james lange does not help us understand what compels us to behave as we do why would we cry if not for an emotion to trigger it why would we run from danger if not for some sort of emotional mechanism to tell us it's a good idea to do so it really makes no sense even to modern psychologists this theory is largely rejected nowadays and even if it wasn't it wouldn't help us understand how to help people with emotional and behavioral disorders the theory almost applies to people with panic disorder panic disorder involves physiological symptoms i e heart breathing rate increases and related behaviors i e social withdrawal which in and of themselves cause emotional responses in people but even this isn't entirely consistent with the theory emotions behaviors and thoughts are not linear in causality but rather cyclical interrelated and mutually reinforcing Panic attack Psychotherapy Emotion Hypnosis Autism Anxiety Behaviorism Transsexuality Narcissism Clinical depression Psychoanalysis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychosis Causality Sexual orientation Empathy Mental illness Anorexia nervosa Controversies in autism Borderline personality disorder Science Schizophrenia Neuro-linguistic programming Homophobia Sigmund Freud Ethics Motivation Meditation Cognitive therapy Radical behaviorism Stress (medicine) Human Charles Darwin's illness Homeopathy Brain Chronic fatigue syndrome Addiction Dissociative identity disorder Antisocial personality disorder Asperger syndrome Reparative therapy Second language acquisition Cognition Obsessive-compulsive disorder Grief Superstition Determinism Culture Internet troll Medicine Religion Self-harm Transactional analysis Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Vulcan (Star Trek) Drug addiction Psychiatry Autism epidemic Franz Boas William James Child sexual abuse Epidemiology Sleep Psychology of religion Stuttering Bipolar disorder Personality psychology Goodness and value theory Drug abuse Phobia Unemployment Unconscious mind Consciousness Near-death experience Human sexual behavior Kundalini Gestalt therapy Orgasm Friedrich Nietzsche Logic Theory of conduct Adult attention-deficit disorder Carl Jung Happiness Microeconomics Traumatic incident reduction Adolescence Evil Game theory Stroke Infantilism Philosophy of language Biology
