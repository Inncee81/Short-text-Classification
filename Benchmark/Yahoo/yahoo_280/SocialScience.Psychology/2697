is this anxiety or gut feeling i get this heavy weight in my chest that seems to push against my chest when it comes to relationships with a boy or just a boy in general it stays there for a while and it feels like a bad burden and its bugs me even though im just sitting there doing nothing then after a while it stops and i feel free again well anything that involves a weight in your chest is pretty much anxiety the real question is whether this represents irrational anxiety that you need to get over or if this is intuition warning you you are having a classic fight or flight response to the stimulus of relationships with a boy you might want to think about why you respond that way what are you afraid of is it the romantic attachment part or does the idea of friendship with a boy cause the same response hope this helps good luck Anxiety Milton H.
