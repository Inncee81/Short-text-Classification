why do i hate to fly heres a little backgroung info the first time i remember flying on an airplane was when i was to orlando to stay with my grandparents actually my grandpa and my step grandma and to go to disney world i was a little disney kid who thought that mickey donald and those guys were all real we were there a week and on the day we left we were at the place now downtown disney and then we went to the airport where my grandparents came to escort us and then just us were taken off to the terminal port we then left from orlando back to pittsburg and i remember not too far after i had a nightmare about the terminals ever since i havent liked flying even thought ive done it times since but once i fly back from a vacation thats the last time i fly for a while and i have learned the truth about disney and how its the work of animators and intelligent minds and disney world is no more than a star theme park plus im not real close to those grandparents lol lars but i am not bothered by being up in the air and enclosed spaces the mind is a very complex place why we think one way or another is a mystery scientists are trying to figure out it could be that you have a phobia of flying if it bothers you that much don't fly but if you are hoping to get over this face your fear and continue flying maybe if you fly again you might find out what it is that you don't like about flying Walt Disney World Resort Walt Disney Orlando, Florida Spot the Dog Disney's California Adventure Magic Kingdom Hey Arnold!
