should i meditate by holding an image s i desire saying affirmations in my mind or doing none of these i get distracted easily by the endless chatter in my mind have found it very hard to quiet my mind stay focused on having no thoughts during meditation i'm a beginner meditation is simply learning to live in the moment when nothing distracts you and when you are not tied to the past or anxious about the future in meditation you become peacefully aware of your real self the more you use it the more aware you become when you learn to live life for each moment to enjoy and appreciate life to the fullest at that moment you suddenly become impervious to the myraid of doubts and fears that you've lived with all your life while there are many folks that seem to believe their particular mantra has magical power it really is the mindfulness that matters the mantra is just one of the vehicles you can use to get there i developed a simple nonsectarian practice but my background is in buddhism specifically jodo shinshu aka shin buddhism nichiren buddhism and the nonsectarian teachings of the bright dawn institute aka kubose dharma legacy here is the simple yet potent meditation technique that i use with some recommended resources as well specific posture does not matter if you are uncomfortable sitting on the floor you can sit on a chair with feet flat on the floor since i have medical issues i do a simple form of secular mindfulness meditation to relieve stress and anxiety this helps to reduce high blood pressure and the frequency of headaches it is a practice recommended by my primary licensed physician and is not encumbered by any superstitious nonsense i have actually studied a wide variety of religions and paths being more musically inclined i was initially attracted to the practices of jodo shinshu aka shin buddhism and nichiren buddhism with the combination of chanting a rhythmic phrase nembutsu or odaimoku and or sutra recitation to a visual object a scroll of amida or a gohonzon this is a more active form of meditation as compared to the silent form see below for that so i decided to create a nonsectarian alternative in that vein one practice that i find helpful in the vein of the way of oneness the realization of interdependence is to chant be one be peace in a position of gassho palms together in front of chest with fingers pointing upward a traditional gesture of respect to an object such as a dharma wheel or a drawing of enso a circle you can paint one on a while sheet of paper with a chinese style brush traditionally the circle is not fully enclosed just do a google search on enso to see examples as used in zen five minutes of this every morning before work does wonders for my blood pressure and stress level you are more than welcome to use the chant if you think you may find it possibly useful i use two forms be one be peace for those who prefer a four syllable mantra like namandabu or be one be love be peace for those who prefer the pace of a six syllable mantra like nam u myo ho ren ge kyo or na mu a mi da butsu people who like or are drawn to chant are attracted to the rhythm for me the purpose of any practice is to encourage self reflection internalizing this awareness and wonder gratitude awareness of the interdependent forces of the universe dharmakaya in shin this is symbolized as amida buddha which allows practitioners to perceive these forces as compassionate and caring thus allowing us to relate to them easier or as the gohonzon in nichiren buddhism which is a calligraphic representation of the ceremony in the air from the lotus sutra which is also a representation of the interdependent forces of the universe there are a couple of simple techniques for silent meditation as well you do not have to sit on the floor you can sit with erect back on a chair many people say try for minutes twice a day i say start with a simpler goal minutes twice per day the benefits include stress management and relaxation benefits which help the body increased mindfulness and focus and increased energy the mindfulness can be a benefit to your spiritual life but meditation also has non spiritual benefits here are two easy techniques breathing meditation check posture close your eyes and relax focus on your breath entering and leaving your body count breaths mentally one to four repeat don't fight a wandering mind but calmly direct it back to task sit for a minute afterwards mantra technique choose a personal calm word or phrase that you will repeat in your meditation it can be from your religion or something as simple as one or calm i use the nonsectarian be one be peace or be one be love be peace and as above in the breathing meditation listen to your breathing and let it relax you with each breath once you are relaxed mentally hear your calm word or phrase in your mind let it repeat in your mind don't fight a wandering mind but calmly direct it back to task sit for a minute afterwards that is all there is to these very simple but beneficial meditation techniques many people think that something mystical should happen during meditation most often nothing happens and nothing should be expected oh yes and it didn't cost me anything to learn nor were there any initiations involved some good resources on secular meditation are the calm technique by paul wilson as well as the relaxation response by herbert benson if you need more formal assistance or training then i would look into natural stress relief which was founded by former transcendental meditation instructors upset at the rising cost and ongoing superstition associated with tm they charge for their training compared with the that tm would charge you http www naturalstressreliefusa org also look at these websites on buddhism on the nonsectarian bright dawn teachings which have a heritage of shin and zen buddhism http www brightdawn org http www heartlandsangha org i hope these are helpful
