how do you trust your gut feeling when your gut says noooooo do you trust it or go ahead with the situation anyway thinking that it could be wrong x i didn't trust my gut feel recently and it was spot on i should have listened x here is a simple and universally effective way to know when to trust your gut first we must recognize that no matter what your other beliefs are you definitely have a body a mind and one more agency of perception some call that extra agent the soul or spirit psychologists call it the id or the ego i do not want to argue semantics here but i'm certain we can agree that there is another agency by which we perceive it is the part of us that refuses to give up that wants to survive even to the point of denying death i do not believe individuals survive beyond death but for simplicity i will refer to this agency of perception as the human soul the problems we experience and only recognize in retrospect are always because those three agencies were not congruent with each other when we look back on any particular situation where we didn't listen to our inner voices that is our guts not hallucinations of voices we see that there was always a warning an intuition a gut feeling that something was amiss when the body wants something but the mind sees potential for suffering because of it there will be a problem ask anyone who has had a horrible relationship that was based mostly on physical needs when the mind or egotistical self wants something but the body gets sick or makes us feel weak for the want of it we know that one of our protective sensory agents is warning us ask anyone who overextended their credit purchasing when the soul longs for fulfillment yet finds it not we see that there is something missing in either our construct of the world or the way the world actually works ask anyone who has experienced unrequited love whenever your mind body or soul disagree you will discover that there is a problem that problem may not immediately manifest but it always does we can avoid many woes by paying attention to this subtle warning whenever you body mind and soul all agree then you can trust your intuition or gut when you know in your heart your mind and your soul that something is right you can walk through hell with gas on your pants now i wish to make it clear that nothing i have said here requires belief in supernatural influence or imaginary deities i simply understand that some things are beyond our conscious understanding you do not have to let go of any belief system to try this method of verifying your gut intuition nor do you have to subscribe to any belief the human brain is an immensely complex mechanism it perceives many things that we are not conscious of in everyday life humans are remarkably adept at reading hidden information far beyond the superficial levels of reason this must certainly be where many superstitious beliefs stem from unexplainable feelings are often misinterpreted as signs of supernatural influence i do not exactly know the exact mechanism by which this method operates i only know it always works there are social clues from body language patterns of group behavior and numerous other subtle signs we can never be fully conscious of yet whenever one of our agents body mind or soul disagrees with any of the other agencies of perception we can be sure that something is not right it may be merely a particular function of mind that we perceive as a separate agency but that does not matter my discovery doesn t postulate the cause or source of these agencies i am only recounting experiential evidence for knowing when and how to verify trust in our combined intuitions here then are the crucial benchmarks for trusting gut feelings mind there must be justifiable evidence that the mind comprehends all evidence must reconcile with all known facts there must be physical emotional and intellectual congruence of hard data provable visible verifiable facts there must be a consistent intellectual fit with the mutually agreed upon real world model the mind perceives body there must be a healthy response of strength and vitality from the body any feeling of weakness or fear negates positive action and acceptance of other separate causes for action for many the body particularly the stomach is the sole home of the gut feeling however with only a little life experience and hindsight we can see that many purely physical longings are the pathway to problems we can know when the body truly agrees with a notion whenever the body responds with vitality we can know if the overall feeling is false whenever the body responds with weakness or fear for its survival either through social humiliation or actual pain it is true when we feel no hesitation or instability from the body soul there must also be the coherent congruent feeling on some profound level that any particular thing or notion is correct you can almost sense the location of this extra agency by imagining you are looking at yourself from above and behind your own head i will not proclaim that the human soul is actually located there nor will i proclaim that the individual soul is anything more than a particular wave function of consciousness all you need to do is honestly feel or listen to this extra agency if any one of these agencies in out of sync with any other there is good cause for doubt if all three human agencies for perception agree then it cannot be wrong further even if it could be wrong there is nothing we could do to resist such perfect motivation when the body mind and soul all agree then you will know to trust your gut i discovered this relationship between the three main agencies of human perception many years ago it is not part of any philosophy i have ever studied it certainly has no source in religion or other superstition it is a simple fact of humanistic principles there is a small but growing body of scientific evidence for these perceptual criteria however i do not expect anyone to try this method based on personal testimony anecdotal evidence or even empirical scientific facts any sensitive human can apply these principles to his or her life and see immediate positive results i have applied them for decades now they have never once led me astray many times this three agent mode of gut feeling has protected me from harm obviously i do not expect any financial reward for this answer i am not a preacher nor do i have anything to sell there is no theosophical argument being espoused there is no political agenda at stake there is no motivation here except to share this observation which has proved to be profoundly valuable i have only answered this question as well as possible in this limited format you can take this advice or disregard it as you wish when your body mind and soul all agree then rest assured you can act accordingly if any of these three do not agree then you surely will find misery
