why can't i remember certain moments of my childhood i can't seem to remember certain moments of my childhood like i'll vaguely remeber the situation but i can't i recall how old i was or what exactly happened like i can recall a second of a situation and these are usually good memories is this normal as a rule memory is tightly connected to emotions so if you don't remember specifics it's probably because it wasn't worth remembering and was just a common event other times it could be that you aren't ready to remember yet or that it was specifically hidden as a defense mechanism if you think this is the case you should seek a professional counselor not someone who calls themselves a counselor like a religious counselor unless that person can back it up with professional schooling degree False memory Exit counseling Social rule Dissociative identity disorder Hypnosis Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Traumatic incident reduction Amnesia Leo Wyatt Infantilism Philosophical skepticism Clip show Transactional analysis Autism Asperger syndrome School counselor Time Out of Mind Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist D__j__ vu Lawyer House of M Mnemonic Lucid dreaming Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Memory Sabretooth (comics) Child abuse Second language acquisition Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Wicca Androgen insensitivity syndrome Baseball Advertising Satanic ritual abuse Storytelling Stuttering Reincarnation Mental status examination Cognitive science Empire Burlesque Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Prenatal diagnosis Milton H.
