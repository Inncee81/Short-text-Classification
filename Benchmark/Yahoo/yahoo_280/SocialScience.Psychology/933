what should i do i let people walk all over me and i've convinced myself that it is for the best is it time for a lifestyle change i have had a similar problem in the past and i am still working at stopping it as well i am currently taking assertiveness training and it helps a lot basically you just have to learn to say what you mean in a non threatening manner and not feel guilty about it for example your friend wants to borrow your car again but refuses to give you gas money you are tired of paying for her to use your car and all your gas you simply need to say friend i can no longer let you borrow my car if she continues to ask just repeat what you have said until she stops if you add a reason that just opens the door for her to find another way to get you to agree to what she wants it will be tough but be strong Knots Landing The Amazing Race Sin City Inflation Rent (musical) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wonder Woman (television series) Schabir Shaik Trial St. Elmo's Fire (film) Great Teacher Onizuka Initial D EastEnders James Hanratty Mojave people Social rule Colony in Space Sydney Riot of 1879 Grammatical aspect Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Grandview, U.S.A.
