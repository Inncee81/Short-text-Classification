everytime they call they start an argument why does this person take out their crap on me they turn anything into an argument i will ask a normal everyday question and either i didnt say the right thing or i said it in the wrong tone they make up reasons to fight with me why they are polite with everyone else but with me they are this way this is an easy one this person needs to argue for some reason and you seem to be an easy target the simple answer is to limit all contact with this person they will either find a new target do some soul searching to determine what went wrong or continue to be the angry person that they seem to be it is so easy to not answer your phone and to hang it up once you realize you don't like the direction of the conversation this is not your problem and you shouldn't have to be exposed to this other person's negativity think of stepping away from that person as 'giving them space to deal with their issues on their own time' that is what i would do and what i have done in the past i feel i am the better for it if you really feel you need this person in your life then i suggest counselling Social rule Theodicy Theory of conduct Plame affair Bernard Williams Determinism Socrates Ethics Friends David Hume Turing test Philosophy of language Falsifiability Abortion debate The nature of God in Western theology Halting problem Autism Meaning of life Craps Francis Crick Expert system Second language acquisition Criticism of libertarianism Nicomachean Ethics Intelligent design Scientology beliefs and practices Zeno's paradoxes Sexual orientation Utilitarianism Asperger syndrome Infant baptism Philosophy Philosophy of space and time God Franz Boas Current teachings of Prem Rawat Fermi paradox Goodness and value theory Scientific method Appeal Psychology Economics Deconstruction Milton H.
