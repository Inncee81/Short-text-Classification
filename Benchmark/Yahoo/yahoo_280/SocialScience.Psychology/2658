i am managing african americans for the first time are there social differences i need to know about for example i once read in a college course that african americans usually don't look at the person that is speaking whereas whites do even though they are listening to what is being said are there other things i should be aware of and not take offense to like there are for other cultures while many may appreciate your sincerity i suspect that you're off to a bad start ignore the social differences implied by skin color and learn to understand each individual you manage as a person with his her own social differences differences that you must learn to respect and appreciate when you struggle to motivate communicate and evaluate take your role seriously and worry less about whether you understand the intricacies of current african american relations and more about whether you understand the challenges and frustrations of the employee with three children a troubled marriage and aging parents who have begun to slowly strain this employee's ability to cope financially with his her own familial obligations Autism Asperger syndrome Autism rights movement Black (people) Second language acquisition Transactional analysis Social psychology Education African American Social rule Universal pragmatics Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ethics Economic inequality Noam Chomsky Literacy Aphasia Strategic management Motivation Stuttering Education in the United States Dyslexia Corporate governance Japanese values Drama Polyamory African American Vernacular English Internet troll Goodness and value theory Voodoo Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual orientation Milton H.
