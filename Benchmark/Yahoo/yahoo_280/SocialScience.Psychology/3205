is it normal to have a fear of people holding knives i just want to see if anyone else gets scared the way i do well everytime someone is holding a knive i keep thinking if i say something wrong they'll stab me with it i mean i get really scared i mean once when i was with my friend she started chasing me with the knive but she was only joking i didn't think she was joking and i started crying and hyperventalating and i lost my voice by the way im im guessing a lot of people have this so is it normal or not not normal really your expressing insecurity about your own ability to handle dangerous situations your in an urban environment and grew up in one so people with knives axes chainsaws guns and other potentially dangerous weapons scare you because you are both not used to it and if they were too actually get upset with you then you have never had to face that situation or faced it once and are very afraid of a repeat sounds more like the first situation i'd suggest a few counter measures to overcome this fear and become more confident in yourself it might be kickboxing mace develop a counter measure a way to defend yourself people hold knives every day i personally use my pocket knife at least or times a day for one reason or another stabbing people is not one of those reasons a second thing to remember is if you walk a block you encounter at least a dozen potential weapons a loose block of concrete an old piece of car dogs a rock broken glass there are potential weapons all around you at all times so you either need to be with somebody who you feel protects you even when they are not with you or to learn a bit of self defense Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Ranma __ characters Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban O.
