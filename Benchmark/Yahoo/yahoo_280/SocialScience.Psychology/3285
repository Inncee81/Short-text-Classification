psychology a psychologist is planning to conduct a study that would examine pathological liars and the quality of their romantic relationships you have been asked to provide the psychologist with a recommendation for which research method should be used to gather data on the pathological liars and their spouses list five research methods five advantages and five disadvantages make your recommendation to the psychologist and explain the rationale behind your choice your response should be words i suppose one way it could be done would be to ask on a questionnaire how many fights they get into in a month quality here would be operationally defined as the number of fights the persons get into the more fights the lower the quality of the relationship one would have to compare the results from the 'liar' couples to a group of 'normal' couples in order to say anything about the results the advantage is that this could tell you how much tension there is a relationship which can be said to lower the quality however the study can't tell you the cause of the fighting it could only tell you that pathological liars and poor quality relationships seem to go together also it is not necessarily true that pathological liars get into many fights with their spouses they could have other ways of dealing with those things another way is to make a game that forces them to work together you could give the couple a peice jigsaw puzzle and ask them to put it together in an hour then you can watch them and rate on a scale of of how well they work together being poor and being great the advantage is you can see how well the couple works together under pressure which is how relationship quality is operationally defined here again however there is no causal link between pathological lying and relationship quality in the study yet another way one could do this is to come up with a lying scale those who are pathological liars are those who lie of the time when given the opportunity those who are 'normal' liars are those who lie from lastly those who are 'truthers' lie of the time by the way this is not a real scale it's just one that i came up with so it probably isn't that accurate you can then submit the questionnaire test to these three groups i e ask them how many fights they get into in an average month the advantage to doing this is that one can see the effect of lying a lot versus lying very little on a relationship clearer the disadvantage is it still cannot show causation in that it cannot show that pathological lying causes poor relationship quality fourthly you could have them take a relationship quality assessment test the test would ask questions like 'how fortunate do you think you are to be with your partner' and then the subject would rate it on a scale of the advantage is one could ask questions on many different aspects of a relationship and the examiner could see how they might correlate to pathological lying the weakness is that it still cannot show that pathological lying causes poor relationship quality lastly one could do a field study where the spouses allow examiners to evaluate how well the couple interacts in everyday situations i e in the home at a restaurant the examiners could watch the couple daily and record how well the couple interacts by recording how many times the couples smile at each other laugh during conversation watch a movie together talk to each other etc the strength is that it can show you roughly how well people act toward one another when compared to 'normal' couples the weakness is that since they know they are being watched they might act differently when the examiner is around i know it is more than words but i hope that helps i can be long winded sometimes Psychology Causality
