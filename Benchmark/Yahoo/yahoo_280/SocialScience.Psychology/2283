should we pay any attention to dream interpretations do dreams warn us about things or prophesy things about our future do they help us make decisions better or do they derive from our subconscious and therefore offer no help at all can they not really tell us what to do in the future since they only reflect our thoughts of here and now and our subconciouses couldn't possibly know what's going to happen in the future is dream interpretation a waste of everyone's time it is true that a web sight for dream interpretations is at best entertainment somebody can tell you what your dreams mean which can help you to understand how you feel they are metaphors from your subconscious mind thoughts that your conscience mind is blocking out and you are no longer aware of the subconscious mind has a better view of the future than the conscience mind because it doesn't have preconceptions or any bias also it records everything in your life and that is where your deepest thoughts and decisions are made Unconscious mind Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Consciousness Philosophical skepticism Free will Jiddu Krishnamurti Dream Sigmund Freud The nature of God in Western theology Conscience Ten Commandments Psychoanalysis A Course In Miracles Miss Saigon Christian eschatology Religion Minority Report (film) Time Out of Mind Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Out-of-body experience Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Hypnosis God Infantilism Jehovah's Witnesses Alignment (role-playing games) Karma Existentialism Miracle Gestalt therapy Neuro-linguistic programming Jewish Messiah S__ren Kierkegaard Biblical inerrancy Carl Jung Socrates God Emperor of Dune Edgar Cayce Supernatural Carlos Castaneda Artificial consciousness Magical thinking Philosophy of language Ludwig Wittgenstein Conceptual metaphor Transactional analysis James Hillman Jon Secada Simone Weil Relativism Harbinger Meaning of life Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Pashtunwali Prophet Novel Quantum mind Mind Law of value Children of Dune Problem of universals Person Causality Past teachings of Prem Rawat Theory of conduct Where Mathematics Comes From Objectivist philosophy Evolutionary creationism Book of Revelation Fernando Pessoa W.I.T.C.H.
