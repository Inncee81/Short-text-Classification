do you believe in color psychology what's up with people who paint everything brown and tan doodoo colors everywhere when i first started painting i just for some reason istinctivly used alot of browns and tans and red i think red can mean passion but not always in a good sense red is just a really deep color meaning deep feelings and emotions feeling very strongly about something the brown and tan i'd look back on my pictures and be like 'whats up with all the brown ' and i think it just means realness earthyness coming to grips with what is real not denying your emotions personally i was dealing with a loss going through a period of stillness after a catastrophe so i interpreted it like well i was passionate about something and then it got taken away sort of like blahness a feeling of emptyness plainess without this thing i was so passionate about so to me brown feelings of stagnation stillness in your life Love Color Art Color theory Blood on the Tracks Abstraction Philo Wassily Kandinsky S__ren Kierkegaard Storytelling Michel Henry Stoicism Emotion Immanuel Kant Physical attractiveness Pysanka Objectivist philosophy Dobermann Scientology beliefs and practices Ethics Theory of conduct Force (Star Wars) Supernatural Transsexuality Jon Secada Empathy Happiness Aes Sedai Traumatic incident reduction Friedrich Schleiermacher Synaesthesia The nature of God in Western theology Self-harm Satanism Evil Rei Ayanami Infantilism Qualia Out-of-body experience Bernard Williams Aesthetic Realism Tarot Homophobia Reincarnation Determinism Narcissism Lucid dreaming Diving Nicomachean Ethics Religion John Howard Yoder Lataif-e-sitta Emo Meaning of life William James W.I.T.C.H.
