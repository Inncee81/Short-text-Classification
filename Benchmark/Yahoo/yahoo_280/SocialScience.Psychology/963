is there a way to regain my brain as in potential this is the timeline when i was very little a psychologist told my parents they had a gifted child my dad received the news like if someone told him your son is gay and soon will be doing hardcore gay movies all the time he was ashamed of having a smart kid instead of one that comes dirty from playing on the loan he picked on me all the time with his i wish i had a problem boy not you my parents were suggested to send me to a different school with children of my like but since my dad wasn't too excited about it i said i did not want to by third grade i started trying to simpathize with him getting a b once in a while but it was not enough then the cs and by fifth grade d's and fs i got to really hate the way i was because i wanted my father to be happy about me now i am in college my friends say i got some brains there but i know is not even half of what used to be because back then things just made sense so easily is there a way or therapy to regain my brain unless you have a physical injury you don't lose your brain power its still there you just have to encourage it to become active the best way to do that is to start challenging yourself mentally the brain is a muscle the more you use it the better shape it will be as an afterthought you might start thinking of yourself as intelligent our own outlook has a tremendous effect on who we are and how we act maybe you could get some affirmation or self help books to aid you in your journey you have a lot to look forward to good luck p s although what your father did was terrible you might try to figure out why my first guess is he might have thought he wasn't intelligent enough to raise a son more intelligent than he was its his problem you weren't the problem Transsexuality Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents Recurring South Park characters Humphrey Bogart Little Britain Pitaten Intelligence quotient EastEnders Meditation Mental illness About a Boy Autism One Tree Hill (TV series) Traumatic brain injury Theodore Kaczynski Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Education in the United States Social rule Dualism (philosophy of mind) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Brain Milton H.
