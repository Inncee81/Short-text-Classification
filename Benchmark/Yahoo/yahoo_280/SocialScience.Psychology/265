a psychologist once told me that my mum and dad were not nice to me but i was really confused growing up even blamed myslef at times how did she notice it more than me you seem to be relying a lot on what your psychologist is saying to blame someone else is a way of staying in a problem you are taking away your power to get out of it to help solve the problem you need to understand it fully those people who did you wrong your parents were scared children once and act the way they did do because of their experiences it doesn't make what they do right but we all do our best with the understanding awareness and knowledge we have at the time if we had more of each we would do things differently Psychology Transactional analysis Social rule About a Boy Theory of conduct Milton H.
