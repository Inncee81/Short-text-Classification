what does this mean i have dreams when i'm sleeping of people trying to hurt me not kill me or anything just hurt me like hit me sexually abuse me etc why am i having these dreams or more like nightmares hi is it possible that the horrific things you are dreaming of could have happened in your early childhood the mind blocks out such horrific experiences when we are young to protect ourselves when you awake from a nightmare try writing the nightmare down and keep a diary about them see if the same people are in the dreams this might help you to understand more of why you are having them and might help to reduce the amount you are having hope this helps and i wish you the best of luck Lucid dreaming Dream Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Characters of The Sandman Nightmare Dissociative identity disorder Sleep paralysis Freddy Krueger Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Wes Craven's New Nightmare Insomnia Out-of-body experience Post-traumatic stress disorder The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Anger management Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Scenes from a Memory Jon Secada Phantasms (TNG episode) Nightmare (Soul Calibur) House music Consciousness Satanic ritual abuse A Nightmare on Elm Street (series) Oh My Goddess!
