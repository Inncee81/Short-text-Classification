i need help what's wrong with me i'm up in ny in school while my family's in georgia i was dating someone for only a couple months and i acted very cold towards him bc i found out just a few dates in that my aunt had term cancer i never told him he said he couldn't take how i was treating him so he broke up with me a couple weeks later she passed then my other close aunt died the same week sudden i flipped out and sent him a bunch of weird texts he never responded about once a month after i'd send him one asking him to talk he ignored me finally i called him and he said i no longer want anything to do with you anymore stop reaching out most normal people would feel that's closure but i still hope if i see him one day i can explain i'm not usually so desperate if this was one of my friends i tell them get a clue what's wrong with me why can't i let this go in my mind additional details also i was a virgin i think that might have something to do with it what about sending him a letter to get your closure just explain briefly what happened and that you just wanted a chance to explain so that you can put it all behind you and that you understand if he no longer wants anything to do with you but that you felt it was important to give an explanation but if you do that seriously leave it at that don't try dragging it on or getting a response the letter would be closure for you too Social rule Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct EastEnders K' The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Days of our Lives God Emperor of Dune Fancy Crane Michael Garibaldi Charmed Year of the Spider One Tree Hill (TV series) Milton H.
