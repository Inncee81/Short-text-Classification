do you lie about your life i know its not right but i have no job at the moment and am pretty depressed and suffereing bad anxiety yet again i tell people i am doing great when they ask i meet new people from my friends introducing me and i tell them i am studying and working part time and i am happy truth is im lying i don't lie about my life only because i'm such a horrible liar i always trip myself up because i can't remember what i said so i'm best off telling the pathetic truth however i think it's normal to respond with a good when people ask how you're doing regardless of how you're really doing i think your little lies are harmless if you're just telling people that you meet casually that you're going to school and working part time if you were to tell your family this then you might run into problems but it's no biggie to tell others this just be careful if someone finds out that you're lying they might think you're a bad person i don't know you too well but i wouldn't go so far as to call you a bad person you seem very sweet Social rule The Notorious B.I.G.
