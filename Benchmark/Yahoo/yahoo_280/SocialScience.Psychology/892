how can i become more social and confident there are many questions just like mine but those answers don't help me i've tried taking acting classes and speech classes school and work never really helped me get close to anyone i've tried going out on a limb and making an effort i've tried joining clubs and programs of my interests all the while i've stayed true to who i am inside yet i still have trouble with social situations i get all choked up and either say something stupid or nothing at all messing up what could have been a friendship sometimes people will ask for my number or email and they never call i'm already and i don't have anyone i can call a friend i'm in desperate need of help i wish i could give you a better answer than the ones you have read but i don't think we will be able to help you more when we are not around to see the way you interact however i do believe that as we grow and change we tend to be less tolerant and more judgemental my fiance sounds a little like you he keeps to himself most of the time and he is not confortable with more than a few people at a time that's one of the reasons why he is still a fiance and not my husband i'm very social so i want a small party people he thinks small is him and me i do think i have had some impact in him to where we go out more often and he doesn't feel so overwelmed by my family so perhaps you should try on line first and then meet them in person hope it helps Social rule Theory of conduct Ranma __ characters Surveillance American Psycho Infantilism Social psychology Jon Secada Singlish Scientology beliefs and practices Boston Public Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Laura Schlessinger Logic LiveJournal Liberalism Time Out of Mind Narcissism Altruism Kodocha Cindy Sheehan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Expert system The nature of God in Western theology Coercion Theodor Adorno Goodness and value theory Plame affair Hermione Granger Asperger syndrome Good Times Natural deduction Drama Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Past teachings of Prem Rawat Current teachings of Prem Rawat Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Stuttering Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Jumpstart 3rd Grade Nancy Witcher Astor Married... with Children Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Friends Avenue Q Indian English Blonde on Blonde Conservative Party (UK) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Emancipation of Mimi The Smoking Room Singapore gay equality movement The Ashlee Simpson Show Sant Thakar Singh Taxi Driver Negima EastEnders Sydney Riot of 1879 Sharon Tate Melanie Wilkes Barry Goldwater Shit Equine conformation Religion Autism David Hume GED God Emperor of Dune Nicomachean Ethics The Hobbit Pitaten Mixed martial arts Simon Commission Halting problem Extreme Programming Economics One Tree Hill (TV series) Coming of Age (TNG episode) Esperanto grammar New Deal The Wealth of Nations Electrophysiology Bill Maher Simone Weil Sociology Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses The O.C.
