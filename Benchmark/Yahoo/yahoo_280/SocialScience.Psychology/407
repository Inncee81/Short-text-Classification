needed your thoughts on this is it true that when people don't tell us something it means it was never meant to be told to us anyway hence we should never ask if that is true it means if people have to share something they will definitely share so if they are quiet it was never meant for us to hear it how do we balance this view when it comes to shy people who need to be asked or prodded or people who keep quiet thinking we might not be interested to know i am really confused sometimes its destiny that the person has to be asked sometimes you have to make that move to remind them if then they arent ready to tell you then you're not ready to hear it if they think we arent interesting thats exactly why we should ask once and twice tops Religious Society of Friends Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jon Secada A Course In Miracles Meaning of life Philipp Melanchthon Extreme Programming The Dalek Invasion of Earth Plame affair Juliet Scientology beliefs and practices Humphrey Bogart Mojave people The Death Gate Cycle Hearsay Boom Town (Doctor Who) One Tree Hill (TV series) Predestination Arjuna Consensus decision-making Avenue Q StarCraft Episode VI Athrun Zala Yin Shun Haven (TNG episode) Novel Theory of conduct True Crime: Streets of LA Datalore (TNG episode) Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Emotions (album) Sant Mat Rudolf Hermann Lotze Ayyavazhi mythology I Want to Hold Your Hand Psychosis Jiddu Krishnamurti Prisoner's dilemma Repentance Current teachings of Prem Rawat Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) W.I.T.C.H.
