my wife is a dread full lyre a short extra entry to question no doubt most answers will came across get the hell out of there we have seperated a number of times before and we always get back together because i see her as a person with a moderate to heavy level of depression and anxierty that for some reason makes me feel like i should be doing more to help her but this is of course futile should i be asking my self seriously what is in me that feels the need to attempt to change or move the stagnate my meaning being i know i will never change her and i know the saying god give me the strength to identify the things i can t change and the wisdom etc this is really damaging my life as i know this is having a detremental effect on my emotional well being i feel as a strong minded male that what i am living if it where some other male i would think that he lacked fibre and was a bit of a joke not that i don t feel empathy toward others it s just not a manly thing to do from my up bringing if you re read what you wrote you pretty much answered your own question i am not someone with a degree but i am sure someone who is would say your an enabler but at the same token i think you genuinely care or it wouldn't bother you so much someone who wouldn't give a crap would have split and that's it and there are plenty of people like that so i suppose you will have to decide one day one way or another and since i think you do care it'll be hard but it is something you just may have to do for your own happiness i think if suggesting counseling for your wife or she has and doesn't follow through etc then you may not have any other option you can't spend your life in chaos you will end up an old man one day bitter you gave up the best years of your life if you have children she needs to be in some sort of doctor care medication counseling something if the depression and or anxiety could harm or effect the kids badly good luck to you Theory of conduct Empathy Clinical depression Transsexuality The nature of God in Western theology Reparative therapy Goodness and value theory Alcoholics Anonymous Meaning of life About a Boy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anxiety Vegeta Humphrey Bogart Religion Divorce Transactional analysis Rei Ayanami Scientology beliefs and practices Episodes of Lost (Season 1) David Hume Anorexia nervosa Shit Theodicy Philosophical skepticism Psychotherapy Past teachings of Prem Rawat Samuel Goldwyn Evil Plame affair Milton H.
