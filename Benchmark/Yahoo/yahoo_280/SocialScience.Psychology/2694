i have no confidence and people take advantage of me i have like zero confidence and all people around me take advantage of me sometimes i feel like the worst one in the room like all people around me r better dressed and prettier than i am i study well for exams but because of my nerves i end up getting low marks my hands start shaking and i become really nervous people mistreat me because when they do that i shut up about it and say nothing so they continue mistreating me when i quarrel with someone i feel like i am the one who's wrong even though when i tell other people about what happened they tell me i am the one who's right i am always afraid of hurting someone's feeling so i end up being taken advantage of what should i do i wanna have self confidence and i don't wanna be nervous even when i drive my car i feel so nervous and afraid i need help please hi kate confidence is something you can learn very easily with a little bit of effort on your part you need to practise everything consistently and you will find within a few weeks you have a lot more self confidence in everything you do firstly you need to take your focus away from the things that are affecting your confidence and focus on things that make you more confident other people being better dressed than you you can dress yourself real cheaply and really really nicely if you spend some time looking around the bargain shops and accessorize properly it takes a bit of time but i've outfitted my girlfriend for under and she looked incredible about other people being prettier than you pretty is a subjective term and what is pretty for one person is not for another if you want to feel prettier then try a different style of makeup or different jewelery to help make you pretty use of make up and jewelery can help to take attention away from things you don't want people looking at to things you do want them looking at i e the bits you really like now you need to work on your body language and make yourself more confident http www unlimitedconfidence com self confident body language php will give you some info on how to do it basically stand tall and straight shoulders back chest out stomach in head and chin up looking forwards breath slowly and evenly from your stomach practise this a bit and you will find a position where you feel very confident then stand and walk like this all the time you will find that it feels odd to start with but persist over a few days or weeks you will find it becomes second nature and you stand like this all the time which means you will always have confidence with your exams and driving stop focusing on being nervous and start telling yourself how confident you are literally repeat to yourself over and over again something like i am a strong and confident woman repeat it all day every day if you have to it will have an effect hope that helps you out and wishing you every confidence and success jason Shaggy dog story Social rule Diving Milton H.
