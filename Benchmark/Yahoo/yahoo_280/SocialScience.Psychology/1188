hi i asked this question ok im telling my mom tommorw tht my bro sexually abused me but im not saying tht tht it trigger gay thoughts wil therapy cure me will it cure me of these thoughts so your a guy yes therapy will help you in removing that thoughts if it bothers you also it will help you overcome the pain and the betrayal about your situation it shows that your brother's actions stimulated you and you either enjoyed it or got too pained by it that you formed a different way of adapting to it for example what happened is too hurtful for you that your mind coped to it by thinking that what happened is something of the gay side something homosexual and since you repeatedly think of that instead of pain and hatred you are slowly deriving pleasure to it don't worry all that can be cured by therapy hope to halve helped and its a smart thing to tell your mother about it Sigmund Freud Ex-gay Transsexuality Milton H.
