training my body to not worry i've read that the reason we worry about irrelevant things is because somehow our body is tricked into thinking that it's ok to do so is this really true and if it is what are some techniques to train your mind body to not worry this is has been a major problem for me since i'm entering college very soon and i can't stop worrying about my career and life after college try this visualise yourself graduating from college receiving the cert and the employers queueing up to get you to sign up with them and remember to smile and you can do this exercise for every other thing that worries you turn the worry into a positive outcome that you would want to have and play it thru your mind think and it will happen Social rule Milton H.
