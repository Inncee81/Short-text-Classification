is there a way to explain this psychologically i come from an abusive home verbal physical emotional etc you name it and my father has cheated on my mother times that i know of and regardless my mother never left him and lets him treat her like crap he also emotionally blackmails me a lot and is the most sexist man you'll ever meet so anyway everyone including one of my teachers my confidante i swore to secrecy suggested i run away ie go far away to university which i did but i ended up becoming so homesick i took the trouble to go home practically every weekend which took up a lot of time and now i'm home for the summer but my point is i yearned for the same familiar comforts i don't know but i guess it was the only home i'd ever known and i kept wanting to return to it why is that thanks it is certainly not that i enjoy the environment then why and does this mean the past is meant to repeat itself i hope not i don't want to be like that i am hoping someone answers this better than i do i believe in prayer so i'll pray for you i would say that you are hoping things will be better everytime you go home you need your parents and you have a bad dad but you still long for a good relationship with him and your mom i don't know what this says about your future but i hope it's not bad i hope you can find a good relationship for yourself that is nothing like what you've grown up around know that your dad is not the example of a husband that you need to keep in your mind and don't attach yourself to someone that can't be the good dad to children this is a heartbreaking story but you are not alone in it maybe you should find someone similarly raised and find comfort in that common history and i agree with the answers that it's illegal and not right and the law enforcement should be aware of it and to take him away if they have to Social rule Scientology beliefs and practices Infantilism Domestic violence Divorce EastEnders Father Boston Public Joke Narcissism Intelligence quotient Autism Shit Gender-neutral language The Fairly OddParents Contract Grief Fathers' rights Consciousness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion debate Springfield Elementary School Polygamy Calvin and Hobbes About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Milton H.
