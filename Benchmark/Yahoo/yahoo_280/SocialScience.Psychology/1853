what my friend said was so disturbing i feel that my friend is struggling with her self worth and self esteem and keeps on throwing tantrums and venting her anger on others which i do not like initially we bought some food then we sat down she began talking to me about why i shouldnt care what people thinks about me as researchers have found that one who is confident do not need to believe in other people's opinions and i was like okay then after all her crap i was confused i dont know why its like firstly she needs to set an example first before telling me about all this crap right she told me to stop asking all those insecure questions like am i doing okay etc when she asks twice as much as compared to me she was saying that society is dying and that many people are becoming more and more self centered she claimed that if she saw a gangster bullying an old lady she will help then i told her i would rather call the police as i am a girl and am i no position to help since i'm not that strong she was like if i'm a guy i would help the old lady then i said if you were just a girl fighting with the gangster would spell trouble and it would be unwise to do that also she says that in our society everyone due to time constraints are getting more and more inward looking and that she feels bad about it she says that she is trying to change to find comfort that at least she tried her best to go against the flow she is very weak in her studies got like nd last position in class however when she understands one of the math chapter very well she boasts about it saying things like haha i can understand it well you cant and starts bragging about her successes i'm so bloody pissed and i'm feeling really sucky about it right now why well i'm asking why do i feel so disturbed by what she is saying and also i dont really know why i'm so pissed what kind of person is she listen carefully the way that you feel when you are talking with someone is probably the way that person wants you to feel if you feel confused when you talk to your friend she most likely wants you to feel confused she may see your friendship differently than you do you probably want the friendship to be mutual where nobody is the bigger one she may see it as a competition where somebody has to be the bigger one try this just plain tell her flat out that she's freaking you out if she tries to change the subject don't let her keep her attention on the fact that you have something important to say show her that you are calm and that you are not interested in arguing with her about it tell her what you like about her and let her know that you care but that you are concerned for her ask her if there is something bothering her that she hasn't told you she sounds frightened to me good luck Social rule Shit Milton H.
