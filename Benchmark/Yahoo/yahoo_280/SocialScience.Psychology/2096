you have all the self determination of a gnat or a bumble bee perhaps i mean the gnat wakes from its sleep feels hungry and goes to eat same as you the gnat sees something it likes makes itelf look desirable and likes something it sees same as you i mean the gnat is really only responding to external stimuli in just about everything it does same as you you can do a little bit more perhaps but not much having a baby all you can do is lie back and wait for it some of you can't even do that but none of you can make a baby why's that then well that's because nothing that's done is done by you in fact you're really not responsible for anything you do because you don't really exist as an individual so if you're not responsible for anything you do why not accept your place in the scheme of things and stop pretending otherwise why not lose your mad ambition and your wants and your so called needs and petty behaviour and relax and be who you were meant to be autumn when i say 'you don't exist as an individual' i did not mean you don't have any individuality what i meant was that each of us is only a small part of the one and we can do nothing other than what is already determined for us it is a myth to believe we have a separate mind of our own brianthesnailuk that's right matey there is pushing but it's not them doing the pushing there is working and eating and hoping but it's not them doing any of these things jessie money is earned movies are watched movies are made but it's not us doing the earning watching or making reba all these things would exist and progress will continue to be made but not by any individual because individuals do not exist so when a person wakes from his or her sleep that is not done by them but done by who when someone has a baby when they have to push it is not them pushing who is it that is pushing btw without the mother the baby wouldn't exist i think that classes as making the baby also had you not stopped to think that all we are is actually who we are meant to be stopped to think that maybe the questions we all ask ourselves the dreams and aspirations we all have make up who we are another thing just to read your question took a huge amount of determination a feat i doubt even a gnat in all its gnatty glory could complete Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
