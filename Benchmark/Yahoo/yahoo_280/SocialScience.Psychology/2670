why is it that when we sleep we have no concept of time why is it that we go to sleep and the next thing we know we are awake again and we have no concept of time in between that because time is of no importance during sleep and there are no relations to time similar to those when being awake when awake almost everything you do or experience is related to time when you sleep your subconscious is the only thing that keeps track of say how long you sleep if you wake up after three hours because of a loud noise you might not know what time it is or how long you have slept but if you know your body a little you will notice that you are still tired and you might even be able to estimate how much more sleep you need apart from that time is used for coding and other processes in the brain and coding is again used to coordinate things when asleep there is nothing to do or react upon the brain stops working well not completely and thus the concept of time also is paused Sleep Out-of-body experience Dream Hypnosis Lucid dreaming Narcolepsy Insomnia Sleep apnea Consciousness Sleep paralysis Unconscious mind Rapid eye movement Traumatic brain injury Time Sleep debt Philosophical skepticism Hypnagogia Urinary incontinence Psychosis Soul Unicron Siesta Phaedo Whale Sleep deprivation Binaural beats Polyphasic sleep Human Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Funeral Brain Drowning Apollo 8 Sin City Astral projection Philosophy of perception Animism Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Electroencephalography The Fourth Way Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Near-death experience The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Caffeine Orexin Cybertron Extreme Programming Empathy Cetacean intelligence The Subtle Knife Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Drag racing Methamphetamine Cyberspace Sleep disorder Diazepam Space opera in Scientology doctrine Modafinil John Cage The Amber Spyglass W.
