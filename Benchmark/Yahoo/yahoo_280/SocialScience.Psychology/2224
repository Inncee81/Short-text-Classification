what age do children have to be to have bipolar the reason i ask this is because i have a yr old son who has adhd and since they won't say he has bipolar we will say mood disorder instead yea right they don't live with him anyway if they can't be put under that disorder till a certain age then why are they put on the bipolar medications isn't bipolar a mood disorder whats the diffrence also why can't they just use the term childhood bipolar why are you so trying to on put a label on your son children tend to reflect the behavior of the parents and do you pay attention to your son also do you spank or abuse your son that will have a great impact on any child's behavior look at what is going on in his life is he getting everything that he needs is he board ask him how he feels and what he needs children need love attention and positive reinforcement to be happy and to develop properly forget about these stupid mental disorder labels and work with your son and show him love pills don't make you happy love and attention do give your son the gift of a chance at life and give him the basics and teach him how to live i don't really expect you to take my advice but i felt i should warn you you are headed for disaster with the frame of mind you are in i hope he survives puberty at the rate he is going he will probably be on here as many other kids are asking i am depressed and i don't know why am i bi polar or asking about how to stop cutting and suicide i have been where your son is and trust me you need to start loving him he is your son your baby don't give up now my mom and you sound very similar at least as i can remember i haven't spoken to her in years Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Bipolar disorder Clinical depression Borderline personality disorder Psychosis Autism Laura Schlessinger Procrastination DSM-IV Codes Transsexuality Schizophrenia Infantilism Narcissism Pedophilia Self-harm Psychiatry Spanking Sleep Schizoaffective disorder Intelligence quotient Stuttering Kurt Cobain Anorexia nervosa Controversies in autism Sexual orientation Recurring South Park characters Boston Public Obsessive-compulsive disorder Amish Friends Psychotherapy James Dobson Divorce Hypnosis Jon Secada Androgen insensitivity syndrome Asperger syndrome Social rule Insomnia South Park Methylphenidate Psychiatric hospital Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Antipsychotic Milton H.
