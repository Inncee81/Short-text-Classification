have to share a room but i'm extremely neurotic i'm going away to college in the fall and i do have to share a room with someone i'm worried that i will have trouble because i'm so neurotic that i have to have all of my things lined up and organized in specific order i'm the kind of person who will hang posters on a wall but wake up in the middle of the night unable to sleep because one of them is uneven i either need everything to be even and symmetrical or in total disarray if my things aren't exactly straight i can't look at them so i leave them lying around i'm aware that this is probably something i should seek counseling for but anyhow how can i make it easier to live with a roommate when i get so tense about things being out of order i obviously can't rearrange her things it sounds stupid but i really get tense when things are asymmetrical or crooked but i want to make things go smoothly with my new roommate any ideas good for you thinking ahead about how to deal with this you will want to get some counseling perhaps through the student health center if you don't get to do it before you arrive on campus but don't panic i had friends in school who found very creative ways to make the neat not neat roommate situation work one roommate set had an ultra neat roommate and another was completely the opposite they became great friends and chose to room together for all four years they found a way to make it work talk with your roommate frankly about this stuff and reach specific agreements there will probably need to be a 'neat zone' in the room for you but there might also need to be a 'chaos zone' where you agree not to complain about how a particular part of the room is kept or you might be paired with another neaty your roommate probably has something about themself they are nervous about you learning about too your issue might pale in comparison to theirs Avenue Q Miss Saigon One Tree Hill (TV series) Consensus decision-making Social rule Shaggy dog story Scientology beliefs and practices Friends Milton H.
