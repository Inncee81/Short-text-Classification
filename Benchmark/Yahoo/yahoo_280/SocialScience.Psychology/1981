why does one keep dreaming about an ex years later does anyone still dream of an ex in a loving way passionate caring laughing happy and wake up missing them so darn much even six years after they split up whats with that i want it to stop it makes me yearn for him like we just broke up yesterday and it took me forever to get over him how do i stop these stupid dreams that make me miss him so darn much feels like my heart is braking all over again i agree with the first answer and you probably never really got any closure in that relationship if you're now married and having these dreams be careful things like that don't get taken very lightly unless you have total open lines of communication with your significant other it's probably a phase you're going through and may pass someday as long as you don't obsess about it if yo do that then your subconscious will just keep things going for a really looooong time and basically make things waaaaay worse you broke up with this guy for a reason focus on that how hurt you were and the pain you felt for so long sometimes pain is a good thing it reminds us of situations that kinda lose detail as time goes on but pain is always just as sharp as the day it happens it aches just as bad it stings the same way it first did i hope this helps it helped me she broke my heart and that's what i can remember with detail enough to fend off those yearning feelings to reunite with her Jon Secada Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Cliff Richard Theory of conduct EastEnders Social rule Care Bears One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Teen Girl Squad Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Saga (band) Hey Jude Past teachings of Prem Rawat Transactional analysis Friends Utilitarianism The Supremes Oh My Goddess!
