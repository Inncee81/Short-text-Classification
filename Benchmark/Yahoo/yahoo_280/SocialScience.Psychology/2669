do dreams ever come true or are they merely chemical reactions in the brain etc dreams are a reaction to your life everything that goes on every day which your body and mind either won't or can't cope with at the time the mind tries to work out what to do at night where it is not so distracted by life and trying to find solutions i like to think they are there to help us anyway i had a dream only a few nights ago where i was standing on a cliff not near the edge or anything with an old friend of mine who said to me not to be afraid anymore she knew i was so scared of the place that i was but there was no need anymore after nearly two years of suffering very bad panic attacks i am finally starting to live my life again and i feel this dream was to reassure myself it was ok to have a normal life again and to go ahead without the fear Cliff Richard Panic attack Avenue Q Anxiety Jon Secada K' One Tree Hill (TV series) Lucid dreaming Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience 50 First Dates Vegeta Pok__mon Live!
