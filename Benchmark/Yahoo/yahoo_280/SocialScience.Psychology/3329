why do co workers get jealous of me and think i'm lazy when i'm not i've always take personal pride in the fact that i like work and feel a sense of accomplishment when i do my best on a job every job i've ever had i usually end up mastering my tasks i get good at what i am supposed to do then i find faster and easier ways to get the job done i work smarter not harder however there are always co workers who are working hard they are sweating their asses off doing their jobs and making sure the boss and everyone else around them sees them sweating figuratively and literally they are working harder but not necessarily smarter then they get jealous and start hating on me they'll give me dirty looks make snide comments under their breath about me being lazy or not doing my job and in some cases they will even complain to the boss how do you deal with this sort of jealous but hard working co worker that thinks you are not pulling your weight i used to work with cocky people like you no one likes arrogant co workers if they don't like you then they probably have a damn reason for it and it's not jealousy Theory of conduct Dilbert Friends Ranma __ characters Saruman Kodocha Characters in the Smurfs Final Fantasy XI Sweatshop Anarchism and society Social rule Boss (video games) Labor theory of value Theory X and theory Y Drug test 2000 Australian Grand Prix Principal-agent problem Labour economics Sub-Zero Aikido Capitalism The Smoking Room Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Piccolo Junior Saga Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Sin City My Hero Anne Rice Unemployment Jealousy Mobile Fighter G Gundam Blood (computer game) George Costanza Avenue Q EastEnders Charmed Idolatry Honey and Clover Professional wrestling slang Humphrey Bogart It's Walky!
