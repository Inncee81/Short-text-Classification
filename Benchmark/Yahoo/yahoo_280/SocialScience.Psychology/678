i know it's wrong but i'm kinda really attracted to my elder brother hi i'm a yr old girl i have a yr old brother he's really handsome he's been a heartthrob wherever he's gone i know it is very wrong to have such feelings but i find myself very attracted to him we share a wonderful relationship i've been open to him about my relationships and stuff i don't want to spoil all that i'm afraid of how he moght react if he ever got an inkling of what's going on in my head i really want to stop such things from popping up in my head but i can't i've tried to distract myself and i'm quite successful most of the time but everything rushes back to me once i'm back with him under the same roof he has a way with girls and i'm afraid i'm falling to it even though he hasn't done anything to make me feel anything more than a sister i'm not obsessive but my bf and my crushes all appear to vanish when i'm with him what do i do i can't live like this i feel so guilty about it i find myself being to his gf too these days what do i do well you've got the same genes as he so maybe you're a beauty too try to focus on making yourself the best you can be and don't settle for a bf that isn't equally exciting to you i do think you're a little obsessive but so are most crushes and so are many people under or so don't feel guilty about fantasies though it's probably not as rare as you think just a dose of reality however if you really act out and are always mean to his gf's etc you could put a dent in the great relationship you have with him appreciate his beauty and share affection and remember he might go through a number of girlfriends but you're his sister and always will be focus on building yourself up in every way and you'll probably turn out to be a heartthrob yourself just don't break too many hearts or it'll come back to you btw i know a woman who used to get it on with her brother to me that's not a healthy way to go so just stick to fantasies til you find a bf that's even hotter than bro Friends EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Ginny Weasley Cliff Richard Hall & Oates Calvin and Hobbes Social rule Knots Landing Days of our Lives Sin City W.I.T.C.H.
