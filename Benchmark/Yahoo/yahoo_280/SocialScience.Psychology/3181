i just had surgery a few weeks ago and i am plagued with depression is this normal i went through the surgery alone before i had it i asked the doctor if my mother could be my escort but he said no there's no need for an escort what i went through was extremely scary and i've been crying uncontrollably ever since i woke up from surgery even though i'm back home now i feel super depressed i don't know why my heart is just not happy and it hurts first of all your doctor needs to be reported if he told you that you could not have an escort you can always have an escort even when there is not a need for one that is ridiculous you should speak to someone about your depression you don't mention what kind of surgery so i am guessing it is something quite personal if you are depressed it needs to be handled right away before it gets out of control if you would like to speak on a one to one basis with someone anonymous feel free to email me through my profile sometimes just talking things out can help Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Pitaten Theory of conduct Dead Like Me Cindy Sheehan Plame affair timeline Shaggy dog story R.E.M.
