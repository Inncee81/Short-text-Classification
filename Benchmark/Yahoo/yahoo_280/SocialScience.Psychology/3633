recovering from failure i failed university twice went to community college garduated at the top of my class as the valedictorian now i'm in university again problem is i'll be almost when i graduate i don't think i look that different from average university students but i'm wondering if i will ever recover from my failures it's been such a long process and i think about my past every waking moment many times i can't focus on anything because i'm too busy victimizing myself i set goals all the time but after being excited for the first few seconds i begin to think about my previous failures once i think about my failures i can't focus and accomplish those goals in essence i'm always working from behind trying to recover from failures it's a vicious circle in which i simply accumulate more failures any suggestions insights advice congratulations on graduating with such high honors my advice would just be to use the failures as a way to motivate to do better look at the failures and say i'm not going to allow you to run my life use it as inspiration it always feels so good when you beat something that has been holding you back for so long as long as you don't let your failures act as a means of slowing you down you will do fine use them as a way to help improve yourself and your career at college Affirmative action Extreme Programming Weight training Sam Walton Graduate school Saved by the Bell Norway national football team New York Giants Cliff Richard Avenue Q Keynesian economics Grade (education) Iago Graduation Alex Ferguson National Football League Lore 2000 Australian Grand Prix Strategic management Dynamic Systems Development Method Alexander Technique Pittsburgh Steelers England national football team Economy of Russia W.
