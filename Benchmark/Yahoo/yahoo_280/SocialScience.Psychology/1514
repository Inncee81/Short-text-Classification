how can you deal with paranoia about two years ago i had a very disturbing dream and for three months after that i couldn't be alone for fear someone was out to get me i didn't tell anyone about it i would just always make sure i was with somebody i trusted and i felt better then would come nightime and i'd be all alone in my room completely vulnerable to the world it would regularly take me or hours to convince myself to sleep and usually only after some intense prayer and crying after a while it went away just like that but i think it's back now the past couple nights i have this strange feeling and vision that somebody always a man was standing in my door way with a gun i know for a fact that this is never true because my dog would go nuts but i every twenty seconds or so i have to open my eyes just to check this has decreased my rest so much the past couple days and i'm always tired does anyone have any suggestions i would try getting stoned you'll feel real sleepy maybe eat some ice cream and really wouldn't care anyway just kidding or maybe i wasn't at any rate try this technique when you are laying in bed breath in deep through your nose for seconds then hold it for seconds then exhale through your mouth concentrate only on your breathing let the pressure that you are under float off of you as you fall into the peaceful embrace of the slumber that you are missing out on you said that you pray so i will tell you this if you have faith then you know that god is there to protect and watch over you put your trust in him or her i don't know do you and know that everything will be fine good luck and don't waste your money on a therapist you can get past this no worries Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
