grrr how do i deal with stress it feels like everyone is annoying me right now i feel so crapppy and that third p is making me mad even but i know if i don't include it those little might show up grrrr those little r's are screwing with my mind i feel like screaming ah stress the major killer of my own life don't take this negatively but it seemed like it took me forever to learn how to deal with stress i think everyone handles stress differently i have always been impressed by people like my hubby that just seem to be able to go with the flow so easily and not let things bother them for me it took counseling to learn how to prioritize the things that bother me and also to handle people that annoyed me and impacted my life in a negative way i now take the time every day to make quiet time for myself and focus on me no this is not selfish i have learned that if i am not happy then i can't make those happy around me i practice meditation to help me relax and yes if i need to scream i do i have found that keeping your anger inside only kills you more but you also need to learn how to handle your anger in a positive way the same may not work for you because everyone is different but i just wanted to let you know that you are not alone with your feelings peace to you Force (Star Wars) Stress (medicine) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Transactional analysis Scientology beliefs and practices Tai Chi Chuan Happiness Insomnia Sant Thakar Singh Current teachings of Prem Rawat Scenes from a Memory Meditation Psychoanalysis Social rule Pitaten EastEnders Anger management Enneagram Aikido A Course In Miracles Jam (TV series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Milton H.
