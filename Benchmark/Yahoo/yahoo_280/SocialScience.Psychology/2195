the bullied that turns to bullying i used to be friends with this guy and he was bullied all the time now he bullies me if your bullied is it more likely you wont do it to others or likely you will why'd he turn to bullying if he was bullied himself thanks well it's very simple it boils down to the old ultimatum kill or be killed most people would choose to kill in real life those are generally not just two options available but when someone thinks that those are the only two choices they will choose to kill how is this relevant i'll explain your friend wants to be safe deep down and if he was bullied and hurt all the time he probably didn't like that and tried different ways of keeping himself safe probably those didn't work and he kept on getting hurt the bullies on the other hand probably seemed to living a much safer and happier life even though they hurt people so you have two sides the happy safe side that hurts people and the sad hurting side that doesn't hurt people it's illogical that those would be the truth always or that those would be the only two option but after years of seeing it abused people begin to think that those are the only two options kill or be killed hurt people and yourself be safe or be kind to other people and end up always being the one to get hurt kindness seems like the ideal but stupid option and out of fear and desperation people decide that they would rather kill than be killed if they are the bully maybe they won't get picked on and they will be the ones to lead a happy and safe life your friend has probably given up on kindness he tried it and it didn't work now no more mr nice guy he's going to be a bully and no one is going to be picking on him or hurting him any more people who are bullied and abused are more likely to revert to hurting other people through either overt force or manipulation and i'm sure we've all met sneaky hurtful people as well as upfront bullies it's sad but true that should explain why your friend turned to bullying but there are obviously many logical errors and he's only hurting himself and making the world a unsafe place to live in and causing more people to grow up and become bullies to end on a more happy note i should say that not only is unkindness contagious one bully causes another to be a bully but also kindness is contagious smiling at people random acts of kindness letting someone go first those are also contagious and ultimately love is more powerful than hate Pitaten Theory of conduct Kodocha The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Social rule Poker jargon Prisoner's dilemma Transactional analysis Humphrey Bogart EastEnders The Fairly OddParents Paradox Boston Public Epistemology Shaggy dog story Theodicy Sin City One Tree Hill (TV series) Vegeta Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Ozzy Osbourne Karen Horney Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an YuYu Hakusho Characters of Naruto The Death Gate Cycle Meaning of life Avenue Q LiveJournal Alcoholics Anonymous Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Recurring South Park characters Kasparov versus The World The Wotch Jon Secada Buffy Summers Coercion Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
