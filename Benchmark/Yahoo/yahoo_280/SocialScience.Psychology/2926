how would i know if my mind is playing tricks on me i think i'm being haunted by demons or by some dark and shadowy figure i've seen this eerie shape figment a few times now and i must admit i'm sorta freaked i first wrote it off as nothing to worry about but today i saw it again and it wasn't just an ordinary shadow the kind created by light this thing this dark devilish thing felt like the presence of pure evil or something i'm only able to catch a glimpse and then it suddenly disappears i know it must be my mind or my over active imagination messin' with me but what if it's not have i lost my freakin' mind honestly i'll be relieved if i actually have lost all my marbles tis better to be crazy than to be followed by the devil no what if i'm experiencing a little of both is it possible sigh i think i know what your talking about in the past i've though i've seen a dark shadow of a human in the corner of my eye but then if i turn to look it's gone i think it's your brain playing tricks on you it will pass start getting more sleep Bob and George Shaggy dog story Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Yoga Sutras of Patanjali YuYu Hakusho Time Out of Mind The Haunted Mansion Shen Gong Wu Phoebe Halliwell The nature of God in Western theology Kain (Legacy of Kain) Series finale Macbeth Alone in the Dark (series) Milton H.
