why do i get random thoughts stuck in my head most recent example subcutaneous transmisson i don't think i've ever heard or read this phrase i've no idea why it repeats over and over in my head any thoughts normal from what i know it happens to everyone just ask around the fact you try to hard to get away from it means you're probably focusing on it a lot making it a problem if you just recognize that it happens to everyone it will most likely go away and you'll feel relieved the worst part is when thoughts like what would happen if i stabbed this guy in the back that won't go away i get those sometimes and they're pretty scary because sometimes it feels like i might actually do it either way it's nothing welcome to life also just a side note and not to be insulting but it seems at least the way you researched it like you're saying this as if you feel something is specifically wrong with you almost as if you want to have a problem because you're putting a lot of emphasis on it i went through that stage once but some day you'll get over trying to be unique with your problems and look back on what you used to try to force on yourself and laugh sorry if i talk in circles Milton H.
