is there somewhere that i can go to find out about on types of cats and their behaviour fur type etc is there somewhere that i can go to find out about on types of cats and their behaviour fur type etc i am looking for direction to any website or comments from individuals who are cat lovers i am interested currently in persians himalayans and siamese but i am mostly looking for some guidance i became very interested in finding a gentle loving breed that doesn't constantly want to go outside and isn't too crazy athletic i found that for me the scottish fold is exactly what i was after if you get a fold it's parents must be one straight ear cat one fold ear cat if bred fold to fold the kittens will more than likely end up with polycystic kidney disease or a bone fusion problem a straight ear fold has the same sweet personality as the fold ear type the ears aren't that important unless you're looking to show plus straight eared folds will run at least a few hundred less folds are a bit timid they also like time to themselves a few hours a day they are love muffins and follow you around they are gentle and if you get another cat it should be the same breed or another that you have researched and learned it is gentle my little fold kitten was lonely my big cats wouldn't play with her i got her a persian himmie they love each other one of the best places to find cats is through rescues there are rescues that are breed specific i just got a himmie kitten and let me tell you while she is one of the sweetest cats i've ever had we have had nothing but health problems from day my vet says himmies are like that i would think a persian from a rescue or a good home breeder who is not over breeding you need to check out breeders would be healthier i suspect mine was from a mill a great way to research cats is online you can find personality and 'type' information from cfa cat fancier's assoc and from breeder information gosh i personally wouldn't recommend siamese thier care isn't high maintenance but more often than not thier personality is also they are really too smart for their and your own good there is also a site called petfinder com where you can adopt cats if you went online and looked up 'persian rescue' you could find stuff in your area there is also a magazine called cat fancy that is fairly easy to find wherever magazines are sold they profile a different breed each month people who get a 'designer' cat without researching the personality type can end up with a handfull of cat they just can't handle a good example is the bengal a beautiful animal with striking markings whose personality is about as wild as a housecat comes i mean they're tame and all but they are swing from the chandeliers' kind of cats well if you read all this hope it helped Cat Dog Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Fancy rat Manx (cat) Guinea pig Labrador Retriever Siamese (cat) Ferret Hamster Great Dane Theory of conduct Poker jargon Monster Rancher monsters Azumanga Daioh Care Bears Social rule Feral cat Humphrey Bogart Maine Coon Dobermann Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nuclear power Kitten Horse Gray Wolf Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Socialization Crossword Turkish Van Livestock Tasmanian Devil Human sexual behavior Arabian horse German Shepherd Dog Draw poker RuneScape quests Nutrition Diabetes mellitus Show cat Species Platypus Golden Retriever Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Turkish Angora Garfield Angora (cat) Serval Tiger Animal Liberation Front Rabies Breed standard Balinese (cat) Hearing impairment Canary Bengal cat Psoriasis Rabbit Zoophilia Breastfeeding Treecat Perl Pet store Iris (anatomy) Characters of Naruto Equine conformation Recurring South Park characters Mixed-breed dog Aerial (dance move) Tooth enamel Friends Surveillance The Amber Spyglass Girly Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypoglycemia Toxoplasmosis Shaggy dog story Keeshond Expert system Beagle Blood (computer game) Selective breeding Domestication Eugenics Kodocha Egyptian Mau Cats (musical)
