weaning a kitten i recently weaned my kitten who is now weeks of age and i was wondering how much water he should be drinking a day since he's getting kitten food he doesn't have many teeth yet so we're still wetting his food down with water also is it okay for young kittens to sometimes throw up since their stomachs are getting used to a different diet make sure there is always water available to your kitten if you're feeding wet kitten food then there is a lot of water in that so he'll consume less actual water but it should always be available if your kitten is eating dry food then he'll need more water as an adult he'll need about fluid ounce of water per pound of body weight and as a kitten probably more it is normal for a kitten to throw up once in awhile as long as it's not constant or excessive if it seems to be a lot or chronic then you'll want to consult your vet instead of wetting down the dry food you might want to consider switching to canned kitten food at least until his permanent teeth appear at approx weeks of age Breastfeeding Kitten Cat Guinea pig Garfield Protein-energy malnutrition Chocolate Dieting Domestic rabbit Tooth Ferret Elephant Urinary incontinence Hyperglycemia Bee Caffeine Dehydration Hamster Atkins Nutritional Approach Soft drink Coffee Diarrhea Raw food diet Fishing Botulism Ham Fancy rat Tocopherol Coeliac disease English unit Alcoholic beverage American Black Bear Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cheese Hypoglycemia Nutrition Coca-Cola Cooking weights and measures Stomach cancer Omega-3 fatty acid U.S. customary units Coconut crab Folic acid Tooth enamel Fecal incontinence Pepsi-Cola Pet skunk Vitamin C American Alligator Genetically modified food Obesity Lactose intolerance Milk Vitamin D Food Bread Dialysis Diving suit Squirrel Insulin Veganism Dietary fiber Garlic Kinkajou Diabetes mellitus Carbon dioxide Anemia Eating Ramen Homer Simpson Red Squirrel Low-carbohydrate diet Nerpa First aid Adjustable gastric band Shark Treecat Blue Whale Atomic Kitten Red Fox Paget's disease of bone Vomiting Capercaillie Fly fishing Sugar Halitosis Rabbit Cuisine of Brazil Brown Bear Metrication Fasting The Coca-Cola Company Water Sugar substitute Sperm Whale Anorexia nervosa Giraffe Bird migration Frog
