any special way to give a kitten a bath and not by wiping it with a wet rag either maybe i should re word this judging by the first answers how do i give a kitten a bath without using a wet rag i should explain these babies are basically orphans their mama is not taking care of them i am they are really dirty and homely looking how do i give them a bath it's a little different from giving an adult cat a bath kittens are just a bit shocked by the whole procedure and don't give you a hard time about it it will be most comfortable for you to use the kitchen sink especially if it has a sprayer you can put a towel on the bottom so kitty's feet won't slip run a small amount of warm water in the sink and stand the kitten in the water and gently wet down his body put one drop of dish detergent to see how much lather you get if you think it's not enough then one more drop don't pour it on and get the kitty so lathered up that you will be rinsing it for an hour use dawn dish soap and not a flea shampoo the fleas drown in the water anyway and there is no need to risk putting chemicals on the kitten dawn cuts grease and grime very well you won't get all the fleas they will go up the nose into ears etc to avoid drowning you just need to comb the kitten a lot to get all the fleas off lots of nice bath towels to massage the baby all over and get him very dry and keep the kitten out of drafts for a while to be sure he is very dry Shampoo Sento Sauna Breastfeeding Cat Menstrual cup Textile manufacturing Hard water Manicure Towel Drowning Soap Phoebe Buffay's songs Massage Hamster Chinchilla First aid Customs and etiquette of Japan Dishwasher Car washing techniques Dry cleaning Fire extinguisher Swimming Dishwashing Detergent Japanese toilet Hand washing Diaper Japanese tea ceremony Soap bubble Kitten Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Social rule Hyperthermia Childbirth Tattoo Ranma __ characters Urinary incontinence Joke Hello Kitty Dialysis Bathing Fire fighting Diseases of the honeybee Equine conformation Pedicure Hydrotherapy Sewage treatment Gay bathhouse Upholstery Cruising (maritime) Basic English Hypothermia Mattress Pottery Psoriasis Washing machine Garfield Wound Flea Feral cat Eczema Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Cuteness Carbon dioxide Happy Tree Friends Procter & Gamble Diving suit Hazing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Photography Cheese Sulfuric acid Toilet paper Characters in the Smurfs Brewery Water (molecule) Domestic rabbit Campfire Urticaria Body piercing Mosquito Fecal incontinence Paper towel Shaving USS Tunny (SS-282) My Little Pony Collodion process EastEnders Professional wrestling holds Washroom Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
