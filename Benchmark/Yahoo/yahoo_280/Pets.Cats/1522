whats wrong with my kitten she's about weeks old a stray that we adopted she had been the life of the party acting like a normal cat maybe a little more evil than most i came home from work today and she had gotten sick nothing strange about the mess now its like she's in slow motion she doesn't meow or wanna play she still follows me around and wants to be loved all the time but her zip is gone she eats and drinks and uses the bathroom i can't figure out what is wrong with her she won't clean herself either today is the first day this has happened do cats get sick like humans where she will get better in a few days i dunno but i'm worried she's my baby she's my kismet yep thats her name i sure would appreciate some advice plz first did you have her to the vet yet cats that are stray can harbor illnesses and not show any symptoms until they are really sick she needs to be vaccinated and wormed asap could she have gotten into anything that could be harmful maybe a chemical or a house plant i would recommend getting her into a vet right away take a stool sample with you that is no more than a few hours old they will want to check it under the microscope to see if she has any parasites do not feed her for hours only give her fresh water this will allow her stomach to rest after that time boil a small amount of chicken and rice for her to eat this is bland and easier on them just like humans after you get sick you don't feel up to par and are not very active have you given her any hairball remedy since adopting her since she is not grooming herself she may have a hairball that needs to work itself out rub about a half inch of the stuff on her paw she will instinctively clean it off and get it into her system this will help her pass anything that may be a minor blockage i would recommend brushing her several times a week especially during warmer weather and giving her the hairball remedy twice a week as a future preventative do you have a vet already if yes then call them most vets have an emergency number even if they can't see her tonight they may offer you some additional advice watch her closely until you can get her in if she woud seem to get worse take her in immediately be sure she is drinking water you can do a quick check for dehydration by pinching up the scruff of her neck it should go back into place quickly if it doesn't and kinda stays up she is most likely dehydrated that is a good sign of illness in a cat or dog it is also very dangerous so closely monitor her keep her inside cats are notorious for trying to escape to hide when they are sick collect a fresh stool sample and keep it refridgerated until the vet appointment try to keep her calm and comfortable so she doesn't get stressed out i hope this helps you and her out i commend you for taking in a stray i just hope you will follow through and get her the proper care prevention such as shots a fecal test and simple bloodwork are much less expensive than emergency treatment i would also recommend having her spayed asap since she is already old enogh for the procedure but will need her shots before having it done this will keep her from wanting to escape as much and will also prevent any unneeded litters Pet skunk Hamster Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Fancy rat Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diarrhea Ferret Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Kitten Hyperthermia Cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pneumonia First aid Garfield Dog training Medicine Thermal power station RuneScape quests Common cold Vitamin C Schistosomiasis Colorectal cancer Dairy Sin City Hypoglycemia Kodocha Equine conformation Characters in the Smurfs Hiking Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Malaria Raw food diet Poker jargon H5N1 Diseases of the honeybee Escape from New York Obstetrics Decompression sickness Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Certified Nursing Assistant Chicken Japanese tea ceremony Housebreaking Chronic fatigue syndrome Social rule Nepeta The Ashlee Simpson Show Sleeping sickness Menstrual cup Nutrition Diazepam Vomiting Diabetes mellitus Escherichia coli O157:H7 Pitaten Water Aerial (dance move) EastEnders Time Out of Mind Chocolate Cocaine Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Entamoeba histolytica Richard Chase Stroke Insomnia Taboo food and drink Rabies Tuberculosis Dehydration StarCraft: Uprising Ron Weasley Mattress The Shining (film) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March G-Man (Half-Life) Insulin Childbirth Coeliac disease Textile manufacturing Anxiety
