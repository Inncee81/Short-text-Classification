is my cat about to have her kittens her nipples are sticking out and they are hard most of the time she just lays on the kitchen floor i do not know when exactly she got pregnant but i know it was about weeks ago i have a boy cat not the daddy and last night he was running all over the place and chesed her a couple times he also tried to mount her is the a sign that the kittens are coming hey there you need to keep checking her private area for mucus or a bubble you need to keep a close eye on her and watch her behaviour if you notice anything out of the ordinary this could be a sign you can check to see if she is lactating if she has milk in her ducks nipples by just squeezing a little gently and if there is milk this could indicate that she is close to having her babies if he tummy has got increasingly hard meowing alot more and being very restless such as getting up and laying down and trying to clean her private area alot now she might be more friendly towards you but she might want to be alone if this is her first litter you need to make her a bed and watch her so as she does not try to hide somewhere and get stuck such as in draws or in your wardrobe she might stop eating hours before the birth but this isnt always the case it varies in every cat Cat Breastfeeding Guinea pig Kitten Nipple Mammary gland The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Elephant Friends Fertility awareness Hamster Platypus Fancy rat Sin City Ron and Fez RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dairy Shaggy dog story Prolactin Tasmanian Devil Chocolate Garfield Humphrey Bogart Menstrual cycle Situation comedy Domestic rabbit Conker's Bad Fur Day Pet skunk Phoebe Buffay's songs Richard Chase Big Brother UK series 5 Manx (cat) Urinary incontinence Trainspotting (novel) Toxoplasmosis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kakapo Little Britain Violin Cheese Milton H.
