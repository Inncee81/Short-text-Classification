what's the best way to get rid of fleas have cats hello i have two cats and they as well as my house are infested with fleas it's gotten worse this week as it's been really hot and humid here and i think the fleas are reproducing in the carpets upholstered furniture we've been vacuuming we've given the cats flea baths and the gel stuff that you put on the back of their neck and it's supposed to last a month neither has worked at all it seems i've heard that vacuuming with salt helps what should i do to get them out are flea collars the best for cats thanks for your suggestions so far i'd rather not use a flea bomb for the house because we have a lot of fish in huge tanks and i'd be nervous even with covering them up it does take time to work i gave poppy advantage about weeks ago and up until monday i was still seeing the occasional flea yesterday there was nothing don't bother with flea collars treat the cat go to your vet and get either advantage or frontline plus i went with advantage get yourself a flea comb and comb your cat at least once per day have a bucket with dish soap in it handy to dunk the comb in and to collect the hair fleas can't jump out of the slippery soap no point in combing them out only to have them jump back on your cat flush this down the toilet pour it down the sink or dispose of it away from your house treat your house options are a borate powder product or something that uses diatomaceous earth fleabusters bp fleago natural flea control bp or flea away natural flea powder de put about a tablespoon of this in your vacuum cleaner bag or you can cut up a flea collar to put in there just follow the directions which will vary by product but in general you'll sprinkle on the carpet and vacuum up and also sprinkle into cracks and crevices i chose fleago because it's less expensive than fleabusters i may also try flea away in time vacuum as often as possible before vacuuming stomp around the house this will bring the fleas to life because they'll think there's a tasty morsel out there then vacuum those little bastards up be sure to use your attachments to vacuum as many cracks and crevices as you can they love to hide out there wash any pet bedding in hot water and you'll want to be particularly diligent about vacuuming treating areas where your cat hangs out treat your yard even if your cat doesn't go outside fleas may enter your home if they exist in your yard there's a small chance that you or others may bring fleas in the house with you although this is unlikely get hold of some nematodes to spray in your yard i believe you only have to do this once per year these little creatures will eat the flea larva as one website put it these critters are too small to hug but they deserve it i had to order this online i wasn't able to find a place that sells them in my area and didn't feel like calling every place in the phonebook things not to do don't use any essential oils on your cat particularly anything with pennyroyal or eucalyptus they're toxic to cats don't use flea collars don't give your cat any garlic yeast formulations don't give your cat lemon baths you're going to want to continue treating your home as directed whether that be sprinkling once per week or once a month continue treating throughout flea season when it's warm you can stop during the winter months but start up again in the spring you'll nip them in the bud the key is to treat the environment not the cat if you do that you may never have to apply another flea product directly on them again Flea Diseases of the honeybee Sento Hamster Bedbug Upholstery Dairy Japanese tea ceremony Sin City Brewery Coffee Plastic Cat Tea Autonomous building Theory of conduct RuneScape quests Solar power Dilbert Thermal power station Garfield Mattress Dog training Menstrual cup Piccolo Junior Saga Equine conformation Blood (computer game) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tick Tofu Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Textile manufacturing The Amber Spyglass EastEnders Siphon Professional wrestling match types Shaggy dog story 613 mitzvot Sauna Chicken Guinea pig 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Dalek Invasion of Earth Soap opera Dry cleaning Toilet Carburetor Mosquito Richard Chase Tobacco Vampire Madonna (entertainer) Tattoo Shark Pebble bed reactor Cruising (maritime) Little Britain Water Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pet skunk Spidey Super Stories Chinchilla Fancy rat Menstrual cycle Gypsy moth Casting Satchel Paige Cuisine of Denmark Futurama (TV series - season 2) Kitchen Chocolate Kakapo I Want to Hold Your Hand Bulk vending Ranma __ characters Sea-Monkey Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Urinary incontinence Jewish cuisine Eucalyptus Manual transmission Ecco the Dolphin Common cold Fox hunting
