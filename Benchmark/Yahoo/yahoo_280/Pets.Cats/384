how much do i feed my cat and how often someone told me to feed her twice a day cup each time but she devours it and still seems hungry she is a pretty large cat small frame but fat so i was trying to put her on a diet i don't want to starve her though that seems about right if you want you can give her a treat in between or a little bit more befre going to bed she is not hungry cats will always ask for food they are creatures of habit if you do feed them constantly they will eat constantly ps cats should not have access to food all the time that is a misconception that cats will eat only when they are hungry they will eat all the time nature doesn't provide constant food easily therefore just have a routine like your own constant supply of food leads to overweight cats a reason why now you can find light food Hamster Garfield Binge eating disorder Cat Homer Simpson Little Britain Hedgehog Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Seabird Anorexia nervosa Domestic rabbit Fecal incontinence Dieting Vegetarianism Famine Super Size Me The Secret of NIMH Guinea pig One Piece minor characters Fancy rat Surveillance Taboo food and drink Comanche Breastfeeding Ron and Fez Livestock Breakfast Bedbug Calvin and Hobbes Dairy Ferret Biological pest control Abstraction (computer science) Bat Acorn Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Gray Wolf Brown Bear Monster Rancher monsters Food Kitten Tiger Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vampire Colorectal cancer Veganism Albatross The Amazing Race Domesticated turkey Chocolate Adjustable gastric band RuneScape quests Raw food diet Giant Panda Minor Harry Potter Beasts The Fairly OddParents Theory of conduct Goofy Discworld gods Hansel und Gretel Cookie Monster Roman eating and drinking Dave Lister Chicken Tasmanian Devil Hungry ghost Tooth Urinary incontinence Kitchen Hunger Vermicompost Hunting Chinchilla Fasting Friends Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coronary heart disease Prolog Stomach cancer Neolithic Revolution Healthy eating Excel Saga Environmental vegetarianism Acne Survival skills Dog Vitamin C Little Shop of Horrors Tooth enamel Food Not Bombs Weekly World News Meal Domestication Felis sapiens Ghost Festival Pet skunk South Park American Alligator
