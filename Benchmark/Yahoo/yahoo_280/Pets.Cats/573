how long is a cat's lifespan i let my cat out of the house in the morning and then let her in a few hours later does that decrease her lifespan she's three years old between to years is average given that the cat is healthy however that is just average and many cats live to over years of age if you let your cat outside it doesn't decrease her lifespan unless she caught a disease such as fiv which is only transmitted through deep bites from infected cats the only reason outside cats have a smaller lifespan is due to so many dangers killing them off such as cars dogs and diseases that don't have vaccines my mom has a cat that has been outside her whole life and is now so don't worry about it but keeping a cat inside is safer Life expectancy Rabies Feline immunodeficiency virus Toxoplasmosis Sickle-cell disease Herpes simplex virus Feral cat Pet skunk Feline leukemia virus Domestic rabbit Vaccine Ferret Heartworm Fancy rat Mathematical modelling in epidemiology Tick Vaccination Sexually-transmitted infection Diabetes mellitus AIDS Shaggy dog story Duesberg hypothesis Influenza DNA repair Livestock Breastfeeding Smallpox Foot-and-mouth disease Infectious disease HIV vaccine Rocky Mountain spotted fever Animal testing Taboo food and drink Gray Wolf Lion Chagas disease Manx (cat) Prostate cancer Pneumonia Canine parvovirus Measles RuneScape quests Doomsday argument The Fairly OddParents Louis Pasteur Tuberculosis Dairy Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hamster West Nile virus Parvovirus B19 Cirrhosis Senescence Malaria Quarantine Foodborne illness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insulin Disease American Alligator Dog Immortality Jam (TV series) Epidemic typhus The Secret of NIMH Phantom cat Safe sex Chickenpox Cystic fibrosis Life extension MMR vaccine Hepatitis Socialization Colorectal cancer Population history of American indigenous peoples Lyme disease Cytomegalovirus Hookworm Pekingese Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Decompression sickness Yellow fever Tooth enamel HIV Bioterrorism Schr__dinger's cat H5N1 Azumanga Daioh DDT Lassa fever Strap-on dildo Prostitution Swimming Feline Panleukopenia Common cold Escherichia coli O157:H7 Dieting Ebola
