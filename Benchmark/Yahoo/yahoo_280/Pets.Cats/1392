cats driving me crazy ok i have year old cats there my life i am recently married going on months and at my old house my cats always used their litter box no problem when we first moved about months ago to this apartment they used their litter box fine now they will use it but they will also use my couch cushions the corners every where and the worse thing is this only happens when we are home and really it only happens after i'v gone to sleep and my husband is watching tv i don't know if they are just trying to aggravate ofir if they have jealousy issues or what but i need it to stop i don't know how to disaplin a cat so that she'll learn and my husband goes into mad fits and throws them out of the house which i don't like please anything the dreaded kitty jealousy if they are using the litter box during the times you both are away you know they know where it is so i would say some kitty does not approve of the changes and if daddy is yelling it only justifies the actions of the kitty to the kitty so no yelling be firm and consistent mom you need to do the disciplining dad should try to be the loving support for the time of adjustment once maybe twice will be all they need i find that the plastic bags are the greatest way to their attention you can 'beat' the crap out of them with the bag and not hurt them the noise the bag makes is very impressionable Garfield Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Buffay's songs Sin City Friends Mattress Piccolo Junior Saga The Inside The Fairly OddParents Xiaolin Showdown Pet skunk Maison Ikkoku W.I.T.C.H.
