how do i train my yr cat to stop pulling up my carpet i have a new burberry carpet and she is addicted to pulling up the loops in the carpet she loves string i have given her sistic posts as well several toys to play with to deter her i have used a spray bottle when she is in the act but she's has already done the damage usually done when i'm sleeping near sunrise i've sprayed the carpet with pet organics no scratch from petco but the cat still insists on the pulling up the carpet i've also yelled no when she is lowering her head to start the act of pulling up the carpet but doesn't work either does anyone have any suggestions to help me out yes i had the same problem so i can certainly relate to your dilemma here are a few possible solutions to your problem i read about them and they worked for me first i would like to just ask if nothing works please please do not declaw her it is the equivalent to us having the tips of our fingers cut off down to the first joint many many cats suffer permanent pain from nerve damage it makes many cats unable to use their litter boxes because scratching the gravel hurts too much or if they still use it they are suffering also many cats start to bite this is because they no longer have their main form of defense this can make them bite out of fear and if heaven forbid she should get out get lost she will have no way to defend herself or to catch food anyway that said here are several suggestions i don't know if you have any of the carpet pieces left but if you do or if you can get a small piece this is what you do take a scratching post and nail a piece of the carpet around it put the post somewhere and bring the cat to it take her paws gently pull them down the post giving her the idea it worked for one of my cats if you do not have any carpet pieces left try this i know you said you bought her sisal posts they also sell scratching posts made with carpet around it that's for cats who obviously love to scratch carpets buy her or of those train her the same way every time you see her start to go for your carpet yell no and pick her up bring her to the post train again it takes a lot of dedication to train some of them away from carpets for one of my cats i had to buy a very small area rug just for her i didn't put it on the carpet she liked because that would have been too confusing i put it outside the room with the carpet so when she started on my carpet i picked her up put her on her own little rug it worked with my current angels i have come to enjoy the beautiful wood floors that were under my carpets best of luck to you Cat Piccolo Junior Saga Ferret Drill bit Carpet Pittsburgh Steelers The Inside Milton H.
