what should i do i paid a lot of money to have my cat declawed and found a claw tonight before anyone gets upset with me for having him declawed i want to explain he is double pawed and has an unretactable claw often times it would start growing into his paw and caused him a lot of pain he is a very difficult cat for others to handle although he was tranquilized he kept willing himself to come out it he is a very large part siamese alpha male the staff was afraid of him to the extent that i had to come in for most of the handling i had to take him from his cage and hold him while they unbandaged him it was a very tramatic situation for both of us we specifically took him in to remove primarily that claw he had issues with i was snuggleing with him tonight and found that the claw is growing back i am furious not just for the money we spent but for the pain and suffering he has had to endure he is also considered a companion pet and helps with my depression please don't write to tell me to take him to the vet duh i want to know what i should say when i call thank you for being supportive i did not make this decision lightly even clipping caused him so much pain the act of clipping when it was growing back he would limp around it killed me to see him go through that i love him so much now my heart is in my throat thinking about what he will need to go through again the whole reson we got it done in the first place was to eleviate his pain i have always had cats but he and i have a special bond he has a sister who had the same problem with her paws she had the same procedure at the same time she is easier to handle although not much and has no problems since i will call the vet tomorrow but i need to be very sure what i will say before i call thank you everyone for your suggestions this had nothing to do with bad behaviors although he does lol getting rid of him will never be an option for me i pray that he lives another years painlessly wow first of all i'm going to tell you that you did the right thing by declawing him alot of polydactyl cats those with the extra toes have problems with the middle toes they often turn sideways grow at weird angles and rub against the other toes i have a polydactyl and had to have her declawed too as far as what to tell the vet i would call and have them pay for you to take it to another vet when you properly declaw a cat there is no and i mean no way for it to grow back they actually amputate the first joint on the toe they have to do something and if they refuse threaten them with the better buiseness bureau you can call them and have them on these peoples behinds Cat Ferret Pet skunk Garfield Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog Domestic rabbit Pitaten Procrastination Friends Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Volleyball RuneScape quests Miss Saigon Goodness and value theory Ranma __ characters Trapping "Weird Al" Yankovic Brown Bear The Inside Callus Knife Veterinarian Rent (musical) Cheetah Great Depression Knots Landing Milton H.
