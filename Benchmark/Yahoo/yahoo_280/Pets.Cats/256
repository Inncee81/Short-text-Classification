my cat is going to explode everybody keeps feeding him i guess the neighbors is who that is i don't know what to do i hope he got them back by giving them fleas last night he was at the neighbors because we called and searched for him everywhere he doesnt like being inside he loves being outside during overcast skies or hot sunny days and he plays around early in the morning i just love that little rascal i agree with the person who said that you should talk to your neighbor simply explain that you are the owner of the cat maybe it was a simple misunderstanding and your neighbor thought your cat was a stray this does happen sometimes however i would not lie and say that the cat has a special vet prescribed diet if this is not true some cats do have these things to control health concerns even hairballs but starting off being dishonest will not benefit you your neighbor should simply respect that the pet belongs to a loving family and not feed it anymore or bring it into their home once this has been explained to him her that it already has a home additionally i'd like to add that if your cat is infested with fleas or not updated on shots you should immediately tend to this health concern treat your home by flea bombing it spraying carpet and bedding lice spray works well for upholstery that cannot be washed you can use carpet powders etc and shampoo your cat and use a flea collar for added protection you can also put the carpet powder into the bag of your vacuum if applicable and vacuum daily this will pick up eggs and the power will help to kill larvae and hatching adult fleas inside the bag helping to eliminate the spread and return of the flea problem this is something you should tend to as a caring owner because fleas can make your animal very ill i hope everything works out well Flea Diseases of the honeybee Beetle Pet skunk Chicken Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog training Domestic rabbit Feral cat Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Dog Ranma __ characters Mosquito Garfield Dairy Hamster Sea-Monkey The Amber Spyglass Upholstery Thermal power station Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape quests Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Linked list Crab louse Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus A Course In Miracles Malaria Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Colony in Space Egg (food) Customs and etiquette of Japan Fecal incontinence Anopheles Tick Baylisascaris Sento Carpet Breastfeeding Social rule Fire fighting Shaggy dog story Shotgun AFI 100 Years series Kakapo Seabird Prostate cancer Red Hot Chili Peppers The Ark in Space Internal ballistics Plastic Jon Secada Biological pest control Mattress Past teachings of Prem Rawat Carnivorous plant Aladdin (1992 film) Scientology beliefs and practices Insect Chronic fatigue syndrome Bubonic plague Chocolate Tea Little Britain Siphon Shrimp farm Animal rights The Subtle Knife Medicine Pediculosis Ant Livestock Richard Chase Phoebe Buffay's songs Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Fairly OddParents Kodocha Coffee Transformer Infantilism The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Blood (computer game) Shark Care Bears Organic farming Blog Ren and Stimpy
