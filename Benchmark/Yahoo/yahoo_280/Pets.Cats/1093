how do you tell the difference how do you tell the difference between a deformed leg paw and a broken paw that healed the wrong way month old momma cat with three kitties is in our rescue and its front left paw is turned inward and obviously cant bend the right way the vet said it was probably broken and healed wrong but another lady i volunteer with said she thinks its probably deformed the paw is a bit bigger than the rest of her paws no pain yelping pulling away when you touch it claws are out probably need to be cut shes been spayed and is just with her kittens until all are adopted out she is beautiful and just the sweetest cat her leg is most likely going to be amputated since she really doesn't press weight on it anyway and it seems like she'd be better of without it so yeah how do you tell the difference if you even can thanks oh okay i dont know if they did x rays or not i didn't ask i'll make sure to ask next week do you think they'd be able to fix her paw its not her whole leg just like her wrist and down i'm guessing if she has no feeling in it there is nothing they can do if she does has feeling left in her paw they can fix it i'm just going from what i know on animal planet lol hi honey the above poster is correct x rays are the only way to determine if it is an old break healed incorrectly or a birth defect Ferret Cat Guinea pig Professional wrestling holds Garfield Equine conformation Dog Kitten Pet skunk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Atomic Kitten Trapping EastEnders Kodocha Piccolo Junior Saga Domestic rabbit Maneki Neko Professional wrestling throws Little Britain Wood carving Diving Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Spanking Weight training Fencing Swingout Jon Secada Dog training Professional wrestling attacks Mark Calaway Behaviorism Galaxy Angel Killian documents The Invisibles Figure skating RuneScape quests Lathe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Debugging Characters in the Smurfs Van Morrison Theory of conduct Socialization Milton H.
