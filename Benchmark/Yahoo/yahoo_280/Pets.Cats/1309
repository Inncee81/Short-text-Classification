why doesint my cat like to be brushed she has long hair so she needs to be brushed every so often but she hates it when i brush her thats the only time she ever hisses and growls what shoud i do oh yes and that was a good idea but she doesint get tangles much i just brush her to keep them away ok also the sensitive skin one is a good idea to exept we also use soft brushes with her and they have the same effect not all cats like to be brushed here try this don t laugh put catnip on the brush put it on the flor let her get used to it then take the brush after a few days and brush over her body she can feel it but the brush will not be touching her body wear heavy gloves incase she tries to scratch or bite if she does you will not feel it and she will realize that what she is doing is having no effect on you then try brushing her cheeks only give her a pounce or two and praaaise her in time all of this should help ask your vet what is the best brush to use for a longhair Cat Nepeta Guinea pig Brush Comanche Milton H.
