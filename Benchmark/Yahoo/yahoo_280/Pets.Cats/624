advice for moving with cats i am about to move into a new apartment with my two cats my youngest one i'm not worried about however my oldest one who is about has moved with me before and does not adjust well i know that cats don't adjust well to change and need to recognize their scent in the new home however she doesn't adjust to the point of not using her litter box even after being shown where it is there is new carpet in the apartment i am moving into i'm looking for any advice that will help my morgan adjust without urinating all over the brand new carpet thank you territory means everything to a cat it is the source of food love and shelter so the perceived loss of territory through a house move can be very upsetting to them on arrival day keep the cats in their travel basket while you set up one room of the apartment with their familiar items bed blanket towel toys litter tray food and water you can then get on with moving everything in knowing that your cats are safe in one room later in the day when everything has been moved in you can allow them access to explore one or two other rooms of the apartment as you know they also rely very heavily on their sense of smell when they rub up against doorways or furniture they are very subtly marking their territory the new apartment obviously won't have the familiar communal scent of your old home which will add to any feelings of insecurity if they have a favourite blanket or something else they like to sleep on you could try wiping that over the paintwork at cat head height you could also try stroking them with a soft cloth and then wiping that over decorated areas as that will help reinstate their scent a feliway spray or a plug in diffuser will have a similar effect as it contains a scent said to resemble soothing cat pheromones use food and a regular routine to help your cats settle in small frequent meals will give you more contact initially and help to reassure your cats that all is well by knowing when and where feeding will take place they can anticipate the meal rather than worry about it this also helps them to relax and promotes a feeling of well being moving home can be traumatic for an indoor cat that may not be used to dealing with changes in the environment to the same extent that an outdoor cat will be slow careful introductions one room at a time with lots of reassurance will help the cats settle in if your year old is particularly nervous and you are very concerned about her reaction it might be an idea to board them in a friendly cattery before the move and keep them away from the new apartment until everything is unpacked and you've had chance to furnish the apartment with theirs and your scent the web article below will give you further advice and suggestions on making the house move as stress free as possible for your cats http www sniksnak com cathealth moving html good luck hope all goes well Hamster Dog Japanese tea ceremony Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Sento Kitchen Menstrual cycle Animal communication Fecal incontinence Kakapo Japanese toilet Mid-levels Urinary incontinence Bedbug House Mouse Sauna Stomach cancer World Wide Web Strap-on dildo Animal Crossing Upholstery Ferret Poker jargon Buckingham Palace Mattress Friends Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Traumatic brain injury Surveillance Cyberspace Combat stress reaction Charles Darwin's illness Skunk Basement Fire fighting Housebreaking Airport Rei Ayanami Miss Saigon Insomnia The Smoking Room Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Smoking ban Chatsworth House DDT Tlingit The Star Wars Holiday Special Tai shogi The Time Machine Chair Gay bathhouse Sears Holdings Corporation Thermal power station Felis sapiens Lighting Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Flea Abbey Oh My Goddess!
