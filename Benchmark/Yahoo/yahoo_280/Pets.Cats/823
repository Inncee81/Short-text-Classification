my cat is sick he's an indoor cat has gotten all the necessary shots and vet visits he's about or years old he's got a pretty healthy coat and he eats well he's been acting normal and we don't believe that he has lost any weight today we noticed he had a red lesion on his back it was oozing a bit and was inflamed we really don't think it's ringworm because ringworm tends to be dry and flaky he has a history of health problems however mostly bladder infections he also had a severe kidney infection before but it didn't do any damage he's on antibiotics permanently due to his kidney infection to prevent a future occurrence we're worried that the lesion may be a sign of cancer he's going to the vet tomorrow any ideas or help any lesion or lump is a cause for concern i'm glad you're taking him to the vet so you can find out what it is and get the proper treatment he's quite young for it to be cancer and in cats most cancer is internal rather than on the surface of the body so i don't think that's the most likely diagnosis let us know what happens Fancy rat Cancer Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Group A streptococcal infection Eczema Urinary incontinence Folic acid Pneumonia Diarrhea Diabetes mellitus Cirrhosis Radiation therapy Herpes simplex virus Domestic rabbit Hypertension Multiple sclerosis Lupus erythematosus Kaposi's sarcoma First aid Acne Rabies Tuberculosis Cervical cancer Guinea pig Ringworm Anemia Malaria Malignant melanoma Ferret Stomach cancer Decompression sickness Ovarian cancer Nephrology Schistosomiasis Medical analysis of circumcision Mesothelioma Tobacco smoking Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cephalic disorder Endocarditis Chemotherapy Myxobolus cerebralis Turner syndrome AIDS Chronic fatigue syndrome Spina bifida Dialysis Sickle-cell disease Ulcerative colitis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Crohn's disease Medicine Colorectal cancer Lung cancer Coeliac disease Diabetic nephropathy Common cold Circumcision Asthma Endometriosis Obesity Breast cancer Urinary tract infection Brain tumor Radiation poisoning Rocky Mountain spotted fever Conjunctivitis Heartworm Public health Dermatology Insulin Breastfeeding Coma Traumatic brain injury Tasmanian Devil Gonorrhoea Syphilis Stroke Tooth enamel Chlorpromazine Goodpasture's syndrome Anthrax Cat Lyme disease Sleeping sickness Kidney Health insurance Hepatitis Traditional Chinese medicine Manx (cat) H5N1 Aspergillosis Blood
