my cat is getting mean he was really lovey when we got him but now he's always attacking he lunges at my face and my husbands face and he bites and scrachtes our feet in the morning he jumps at my face comes under the covers to scratch and bite me and jumps on me until i get up and feed him he is worse with me and i think it might be to get my attention to feed him we adopted him a month ago and he is kind of skinny what i am wondering is could he be hungry and that is making him mean i feed him a can of food a day and he always has a bowl of dry food and water out what do you think is wrong and what should i do if your kitty was once a stray he probably gets crazy when he's hungry he might think he won't ever get food again my kitty used to do the same thing after we brought him home from the shelter he still doesn't even chew his food just gulps it down make sure you are feeding him the correct amount of food and maybe move his evening feeding to a later time so he's not as ravenous in the morning both my cats were super lovey dovey when i first brought them home from the shelter that wore off after about weeks and their real personalities came through it is a combo of the pain meds from being fixed the upper respiratory infections and just being thankful they aren't in a cage anymore when my one kitty was at the vet for days recently with a urinary blockage he was soooooo loveydovey for days or so he just kept kneading the carpet as he walked around glad to be out of a cage and back to a good home i guess if you feed him more that is why he is worse with you it isn't meaness as the others said it is an effective way of getting you out of bed it will slowly wear off in time as he gets older and more comfortable with his surroundings i would also take him back to the vet and make sure he doesn't have worms or diabetes worms would keep him skinny with a bloated belly and would be hungry because the worms would be taking all of the nutrients same thing with the diabetes it could cause excessive hunger and thirst just give the vet a call with your concerns and see what they reccommend Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat Breastfeeding Hamster Garfield Domestic rabbit Ferret Shaggy dog story Sin City Urinary incontinence Piccolo Junior Saga Theory of conduct Pet skunk Equine conformation Hyperglycemia Diabetes mellitus Hazing Chicken Dog training Poker jargon Shark Dairy Kitten Aerial (dance move) Gastroparesis Blood (computer game) Fecal incontinence Prostate cancer Professional wrestling match types One Piece minor characters Worms weapons and tools Bat Boy Food New York Giants Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Tobacco smoking Diarrhea Pneumonia RuneScape quests Chronic fatigue syndrome Dog Eddie Guerrero Heartworm Dietary fiber Ultimate Spider-Man Fish farming Nutrition Conspiracy (TNG episode) Pump It Up Insulin Social rule Diabetic neuropathy Stomach cancer Spider Ron and Fez Coeliac disease EastEnders Fasting Obstetrics Kakapo Vitamin C Captain Thunderbolt Days of our Lives Aladdin (1992 film) Garlic Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Skinny Puppy Russian joke Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Avenue Q Babe Ruth Drowning Kodocha Common cold Japanese tea ceremony The Amber Spyglass Milton H.
