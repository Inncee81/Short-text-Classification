help cat urinating again in house after urinary problem my year old cat neutered had bouts of urinary infections at the beginning of summer about weeks apart during that time he would pee just a little in about different places in the house and also used the litter box he never went anywhere besides the litter box until the infections i changed his food to a special formula which seemed to do the trick he didn't get another infection or pee in the house but he is starting to do it again and is not exhibiting any of the symptoms of an infection or problem i did clean the areas as much as i could with vinegar enzyme cleaners etc any ideas would be greatly appreciated thank you for all your great answers i brought him to the vet the first time and he did have any infections and only a few crystals when they tested it the second time i called the vet and he told me to try a urinary formula diet which i did the one i use is nature's recipe urinary health the vet gave him a diuretic shot and antibiotics to promote him to pee more and wipe out the infection he is not crying the way he did the first times and the urine is clear to yellow which when he had the infections it was very concentrated brown almost or tinged with blood so i don't know if i am dealing with a health or behavioural question i am calling the vet tomorrow it is important to note whether he had sand stones or mucous in his urine when he was ill for bladder stones there is a hill's diet s r that is good to feed them out of every weeks to dissolve stones forming in the bladder the rest of the time he should be on a urinary health diet purina u r is what i prefer it is great to promote urinary health and prevent mucous but is less fattening than hill's c d diet which is the hill's equivalent my mother's cat a neutered male as well had terrible trouble with bladder infection and blockages as well and his problem was sand in the urine and so forth we fed him u r for weeks then s r for a week and kept rotating as such and he did great until the day he died at the ripe old age of oh and don't forget regular exams at least yearly with urinalyses to keep tabs on his urinary health should he ever become blocked you're looking at big hospitalization bills or a dead cat so prevention is much better for both of you Urinary incontinence Urinary system Prostate cancer Urine Kidney stone Urinary tract infection Guinea pig Breastfeeding Vitamin C Hamster Ferret Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Fancy rat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Schistosomiasis Pneumonia Kidney Medical analysis of circumcision Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cancer Urination Penis Medicine Tobacco smoking Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Kitten Cirrhosis Autoimmune diseases Traumatic brain injury Nephrology Multiple sclerosis Protein-energy malnutrition Acne Cytomegalovirus Bearberry Gonorrhoea Nutrition Common cold Drug test Diseases of the honeybee Dialysis Raw food diet Folic acid Dog Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Group A streptococcal infection Certified Nursing Assistant Babe Ruth Coeliac disease Allergy Livestock Gastroenteritis Stroke Escherichia coli O157:H7 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Tick Al-Razi Medical prescription Vulvovaginal health Hypoglycemia Heartworm Interstitial cystitis Diabetic nephropathy Acute renal failure Little Britain Tuberculosis Housebreaking Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Diabetes mellitus Tooth enamel Gallstone Hydronephrosis Garfield Hepatitis American lobster Vegetarianism Hyperglycemia Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Benign prostatic hyperplasia Legionellosis Chocolate Menstrual cup Lassa fever Shaggy dog story
