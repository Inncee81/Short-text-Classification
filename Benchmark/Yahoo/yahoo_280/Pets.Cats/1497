week old kittens i have kittens and they are three weeks old there eyes opened about a week and a half ago a couple of them still have gunk around their eyes in the morning when they wake up i take a warm cotton pad and wipe it off is this normal or should i take them to the vet to get them checked out it is only happening to two of them thanks i have the mother she is here my cat had the kittens my cat is taking care of her kittens u obviously dont know shit she cant prevent them from viruses shes a cat the crusty eyes can be a sign of either parasites worms ear mites or an upper respritory infection or some sort of infection i would recommend taking them to the vet to have them checked out thoroughly just to be sure they are healthy they need wormed anyway and will be needing their first shots in a few weeks they will probably ask you to bring in a fresh stool sample from each kitten as well they will look at it under the scope to check for internal parasites they are very young so i wouldn't take any chances with their health a vet check is always a good idea most vets give a large discount for bringing in a litter of kittens since they all are getting the same treatment at the same time Guinea pig Pet skunk Fancy rat Kitten Diseases of the honeybee Medical prescription Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Heartworm Cat Computer virus Pneumonia AIDS Domestic rabbit Common cold Diarrhea Garfield Schistosomiasis Urinary incontinence Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Dog Hamster Manx (cat) Rabies Cytomegalovirus Stomach cancer Tick Influenza Toxoplasmosis Feral cat Asthma H5N1 Certified Nursing Assistant Socialization HIV test Cancer Breastfeeding First aid Body piercing Medicine Vitamin C Traumatic brain injury Items in the Metroid series Herpes simplex virus 2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore Rocky Mountain spotted fever Allergy Marburg virus HIV Coprophagia Dialysis Hypoglycemia Coeliac disease Cephalic disorder Fecal incontinence Hepatitis C Multiple sclerosis Childbirth Menstrual cycle Delta Goodrem The X-Files (season 1) Malaria Mumps Gonorrhoea Myxobolus cerebralis Snake Intestinal parasite Sickle-cell disease Diabetes mellitus Folic acid Divorce Escherichia coli O157:H7 Xiaolin Showdown Sexually-transmitted infection Parasitology Traditional Chinese medicine Foodborne illness Quarantine Vaccine Labrador Retriever Smallpox Sin City E85 Ebola RuneScape quests Colorectal cancer Schistosoma mansoni Chronic fatigue syndrome Syphilis Human feces Hymenolepiasis Duesberg hypothesis Veterinarian Atomic Kitten Cystic fibrosis Rotavirus Obstetrics
