would you put your cat to sleep if it was healthy okay so here is my dilemma we rescued some feral kittens and one of them was really sick i got rid of the fleas and wormed him but he was still skinny and not growing i took him to the vet today and found out he had flv i had to put him to sleep i am very distraught about this as it is and come to find out it's very contagous so my two eldest cats have already been exposed although vaccinated but we are keeping of his sisters who have also been exposed so in your opinion if the sisters test positive for flv but are normal and healthy would you still opt to put them to sleep it's not about exposure anymore i've read that the of cats develop an immunity to it and still lead normal lives and some may never have any complications with the disease would you wait until there were any complications before putting it to sleep so it could at least have somewhat of a normal life or would you do it as soon as the positive test occured btw the sisters are very active eating well growing and healthy i think many vets would recommend putting a cat to sleep as soon as it tests positive for felv but to be honest i would have trouble doing that if the sister kittens test positive for felv which is not a sure thing some kittens in a litter born to an infected mother will somehow fail to develop the disease they will have a short life most cats born infected with felv die before they are two years old i would have the kittens tested and retested a couple of months later if they are negative the first time if they are positive i would keep them till their health began its inevitable decline and they were no longer enjoying their life and then i would have them euthanized i don't think a complete isolation of cats who test positive for felv is necessary but i would keep them away from your other cats while they go through the phase of biting and attacking that all kittens go through they will have each other for company twenty years or so ago i had at different times kittens who were born with felv both died before they were months old i had other cats at the time who had had their felv vaccinations so i did not isolate the kittens none of my other cats ever developed the disease Cat Rabies Kitten Pneumonia Pet skunk Ferret Socialization Tuberculosis HIV Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Malaria Chronic fatigue syndrome Influenza Cancer Dog Tick Guinea pig AIDS Multiple sclerosis Feral cat Toxoplasmosis Coeliac disease Herpes simplex virus Chagas disease Heartworm Domestic rabbit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vaccination HIV vaccine Group A streptococcal infection Human papillomavirus Poliomyelitis Common cold H5N1 Louis Pasteur Mumps Sleeping sickness Psoriasis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Myxobolus cerebralis Streptococcus pneumoniae Mantoux test Smallpox Allergy Vitamin C Measles Hepatitis B Sickle-cell disease Infantilism Duesberg hypothesis Garfield Autism Ulcerative colitis Insulin Feral Pharmaceutical company Autism epidemic Vaccine controversy Tuberculosis treatment Legionellosis Asthma Sleep Rocky Mountain spotted fever Colorectal cancer Cirrhosis Ebola First aid Hepatitis Marburg virus Nutrition Kakapo Rotavirus Island Fox Tooth enamel Cephalic disorder Avian influenza Schistosomiasis Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Feline leukemia virus Mathematical modelling in epidemiology Friends The Amber Spyglass Narcolepsy Infectious mononucleosis Decompression sickness Stomach cancer
