how to make a cat like you let the cat come to you dont make sudden movements or noise wait until the cat is in a relaxed and tired mood dont pick the cat up try to encourage him with treats normally the cat is closest to who feeds it dont stare or look straight into its eyes this is treatening when you look at the cat look over its head or beside it not straight at it and yawn these are friendly gestures to a cat when allowed gently stroke behing the head and neck and put the back of your hand against his whiskers and gently move your hand up the side of his face dont even try to stoke his belly unless he invites you and then with extreme caution as cats are very protective of this vulnerable area and cant help but turn on you suddenly for taking advantage hope this helps give it time try ignoring him and see what happens Cat Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Diving Dog training Dai shogi Suplex Social rule Breastfeeding Maka dai dai shogi Professional wrestling slang Parade (military) Taikyoku shogi Tai shogi Kakapo Breaststroke Dai dai shogi Equine conformation Backstroke Salute Conspiracy (TNG episode) Professional wrestling holds Animal communication Gray Wolf Violin Poker jargon Cannon shogi Reflexology Norway national football team Drowning Mickey Mouse Traumatic brain injury Swingout Stroke Punt (boat) RuneScape quests Eye contact Conducting Tom and Jerry (MGM) Tenjiku shogi Fancy rat Snooker Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Casualty lifting Sin City Judkins shogi Customs and etiquette of Japan Boxing Tasmanian Devil Canoe Piledriver (professional wrestling) Care Bears The Amber Spyglass Tank Red Dwarf characters Guinea pig Shogi Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cheetah Front crawl Characters in the Smurfs Domestic rabbit Jam (TV series) Fast bowling Brown Bear Xiaolin Showdown Dog Strap-on dildo Kasparov versus The World Bicycle American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Massage Wa shogi Darth Revan Horse Vehicular cycling Milton H.
