worried about health of year old cat i have a year old cat named angelo he is about pounds but not really fat he's been the same size since age the vet always says he is healthy and i keep him indoors so i only take him for shots every years i also have female cats who are both up to date on shots more recent adoptions about a month ago i noticed a small sore on the outer lower corner of his mouth closer to the chin it looks like a rugburn on a human would it's not swollen it doesn't look infected mostly just dried blood and not even a lot of that i thought he got in a fight with one of the girls although they are declawed in front i've noticed that the sore is slightly bigger and now has spread under his chin not to the mouth or gums though no wounds or punctures again just dried blood i clean it with warm water i haven't seen him eating dry food lately but he will eat wet food he also seems to have lost a few pounds i'm taking him to the vet next week any ideas hi again no change in food or toys i know he's not happy about the most recent addition to the family though i'm not an expert but it also sounds to me like he may have gotten scratched that's the area where acne develops but that looks like dirt not dried blood because it's spreading i would get him to the vet you just never know and if it's something serious you may be able to catch it before it gets bad regarding the food he may be losing weight because of eating canned food even inferior brands of canned food are less fattening than dry foods as for why he's made a switch i'm not sure have you always offered dry and wet or is the addition of wet something new if that's the case it may just be that he likes it better if not he may have switched because his teeth are bothering him something else for the vet to check on or just because he's a cat and they do odd things sometimes but the fact that you can see the weight loss might mean he's losing too quickly yet another reason for a vet checkup good luck Cat Pet skunk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Fancy rat Ferret Hamster Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Guinea pig Atkins Nutritional Approach Acne Chocolate Dieting The Fairly OddParents Dog Oral sex Tooth Puberty Tire Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) First aid Anorexia nervosa Tooth enamel Vegetarianism Mouth ulcer 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Shining (film) Folic acid Prostate cancer Super Size Me Chinchilla Equine conformation Obesity Jam (TV series) Diving suit Nutrition Salad Fingers Tobacco American Alligator Snake The Inside Taboo food and drink Weight training Herpes simplex virus Sin City FoxTrot Ron Weasley Shark Ed, Edd n Eddy M16 (rifle) Computer virus One Piece minor characters Livestock Piccolo Junior Saga Dental caries Cocaine Ramen Happy Tree Friends Akatsuki (Naruto) Carbon dioxide Crohn's disease Kodocha Group A streptococcal infection Adjustable gastric band Hamburger Cheese Dialysis Toxoplasmosis Characters of Naruto Hypoglycemia Ebola Tofu Kakapo Menstrual cup Great White Shark Bodybuilding Comfrey Violin Garlic Milk Tocopherol Traumatic brain injury Coffee Macular degeneration
