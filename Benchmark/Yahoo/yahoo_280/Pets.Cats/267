cat pee smell on mattress okay i researched other answers on here but it isn't the same as my situation i just bought a new mattress a few months ago a week or so after i bought it my cat pee'd on it she has done it two or three times since my daughter also had an accident on it i have just bought a waterproof mattress pad for future accidents i tried using several enzyme products including natures miracle nothing has worked does anyone have any other suggestions everytime i try something it just spreads the stain and smell now it looks like my whole bed is stained and it is driving me nuts my cat is no longer allowed in my room and i can not afford to purchase a new mattress this one as it is cost me over please help thank you for your suggestions so far i would turn it over but it is a pillow top and it is only on one side i want to try vinegar and baking soda i heard that works well but i don't know the ratio and application technique i have posted a link for the vinegar question the real problem is that the urine has sunk into the interior of the mattress if you cannot reach all the areas by the materials you wish to use you will not eliminate all the odors but you may be able to get rid of most and you will have to keep your cat out of the bedroom as they are prone to return to the scene of their 'crime' in time hopefully the scent will be reduced to almost nothing and nature's miracle has an orange scent the reason is that enzymes take time to work as they work by breaking down the odor causing chemicals in the urine cats will avoid orange scents in other words it will work if it reaches all the areas but it is not something that works in an instant Mattress Enzyme Perfume Plastic Ron and Fez Alcoholic beverage Sulfur Menstrual cycle Fancy rat Upholstery Bong Drug test Toilet humour Photography Vitamin C Menstrual cup Urine Skunk Urinary incontinence Bread Olfaction Microeconomics Aromatherapy Tooth enamel Acetic acid Shaggy dog story Ben Johnson (athlete) Carbon dioxide Psoriasis Mark Guglielmo Sudden infant death syndrome Felis sapiens Cell (biology) Natural gas Radar Illegal drug trade Hamster Iron Tobacco smoking Penis Flatulence Hydrogen peroxide Cheese Japanese toilet Dairy Determinism Daylight saving time Diaper DNA Public transport Ammonia Breastfeeding Odor Prostate cancer Flood geology Brewery Seismic retrofit Pebble bed reactor The Shining (film) Donald Neilson Cancer Welding Angel One (TNG episode) Space Shuttle program Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Loudspeaker Transformer Cannabis cultivation Water purification Vinegar Land use forecasting Passenger car Bedbug The Human Stain Masturbation Animal communication Light-emitting diode Pet skunk Plame affair Dog $ale of the Century Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Natural Selection (computer game) Hydrogen economy Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Urination Surveillance Life insurance Insurance Plutonium OK Soda Albatross Hydrogen sulfide Migraine Manual transmission Diseases of the honeybee
