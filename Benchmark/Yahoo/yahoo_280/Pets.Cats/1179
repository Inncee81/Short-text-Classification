how do you socialize cats that don't get along i adopted my kitten snow shoe in february and had him since anyways i got him as a baby at the humane society so he was in a romm with other cats he got along with them but he has not interacted with other cats since yesterday we found a stray kitten bathed fed and put a collar on her before we introduced her to snow shoe when we did they hissed at each other and won't get along with me if i have the other cat's smell how do i socialize them so they can get along try having them in the same room just apart so they can see each other but not get near them like u hold one and sit on one side of the room and someone else hold on the other side of the room just do that each time they should calm down a little more and be used to getting along snow shoe is probably worried he is getting replaced and may be jelous of the attention the other cat is getting when u hold the kitten have someone else hold and play with snow shoe or hold snow shoe right after and give her a treat even out attention good luck Cat Feral cat Phoebe Buffay's songs Socialization Kitten Shoe Atomic Kitten Dog training Treecat Feral Softball Customs and etiquette of Japan Garfield Social aspects of clothing Social rule Shaggy dog story Cats (musical) Darkwing Duck StarCraft: Hybrid Sento Purr Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Tick The Beatles discography Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Cliff Richard Greebo 1957 World Series The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Toilet humour The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll AFI 100 Years series Charles Goodyear Luck Goatse.cx Domestic rabbit Inspector Gadget Sauna Lynx Rabbit Sculpture Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Through the Looking-Glass Care Bears RuneScape quests Betting (poker) Horseshoe The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Basic English Maneki Neko Dog Japanese toilet Qiang Big Brother UK series 5 I Want to Hold Your Hand African American Vernacular English Catgirl American and British English differences Jean Schmidt Animal communication Symbiosis (TNG episode) Yoko Ono Manx (cat) Friends Winning Streak Abu Dhabi Clothing Siamese (cat) Olympia Snowe The Amber Spyglass Xiaolin Showdown Skunk Little Snow Fairy Sugar Anarchist symbolism Pet skunk Winter Olympic Games Ferret Alley Cat Asiatic Golden Cat Empress Dowager Cixi Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Spot (Star Trek) Decontamination Assignment: Earth Mickey Mouse High-heeled shoe Petz The Island (2005 film) Felix the Cat Blink-182 The Shining (film) Paul Is Dead Sonic the Hedgehog Brandy (entertainer) Gaia Online Rugrats Brian Close Fire fighting Planet Waves
