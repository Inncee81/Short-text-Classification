bach rescue remedy new kitten how do i give it to her i will be picking up my new kitten today and i'm sure she will be very nervous with all of the new changes in her life so i was trying to think of a way to calm her down i also happen to already have some bach flower essences and i've been told that it is a great way to calm cats down but what i don't know is how to give it to her do i put it in her water apply it to some part of her body the bach rescue remedy is a good choice for her and will help with any emotional issues she has in her new home fears anxiety trauma from loss of mother siblings etc you just shake the bottle well and put three or four drops on the fur between her ears and you do it four or five times a day for a week or so it is normal for a kitten or cat to hide under a bed for quite a while when they first arrive in a new home she should be place in a small room for a period of adjustment anyway so she doesn't get lost and be hard for you to find you can simply put the drops on a small cloth and put it with her wherever she has found to be you would refresh the drops four or five times a day until she is ready to venture out flower essences are energetic in nature and do not have to be ingested to be effective it is important to use them intensely for effective treatment and putting drops in a water bowl just doesn't work with a cat because they don't drink enough water frequently enough to have any significant effect Bach flower remedies Cat RuneScape quests The Catcher in the Rye Traumatic brain injury Social rule Stuttering Insomnia Anxiety Customs and etiquette of Japan Alcoholics Anonymous Urinary incontinence Vulcan (Star Trek) The Ashlee Simpson Show Fecal incontinence Autism Shaggy dog story EastEnders Domestic rabbit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God Emperor of Dune Pitaten The Death Gate Cycle The Amber Spyglass Diazepam Traditional Chinese medicine Baldness Badly Drawn Kitties Socialization Fancy rat Cannabis (drug) Sin City Post-traumatic stress disorder Ron Weasley Children of Dune Johann Sebastian Bach Professional wrestling match types Kitten Chlorpromazine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypnosis Multiple sclerosis Homer Simpson Psoriasis The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sant Thakar Singh Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
