i'm going to strangle my cats if they dont stop someone help ok here is my situation i adopted kittens exactly months ago everything was great no spraying peeing or any problems getting along with my other cats i did the isolation until they were all scratching at the door trying to get in to play with eachother they like their litter i scoop it twice a day sometimes more no food switches yet all of a sudden about weeks ago they started peeing and spraying all over the house now i've heard dont punish or upset your cat this is what causes this but nothing has seemed to upset them they should be the freakin happiest cats ever they are so spoiled of our furniture is cat furniture they get toys treats they have a whole garage and private potty area to themselves they roam the whole house as they please what is going on today for the first time i also found poo on the floor when the litter boxes were clean its not a matter of the litter boxes as i have one for each cat they are always clean help they also decided to use our bed as a pee litter box days ago ruining our blankets and matress topper that cannot be cleaned or dry cleaned why are they doing this i have tried spraying natures miracle using feliway and other products that supposedly work but they dont ok my indoor outdoor cat that is usually well behaved just now came in and went strait over to the wall and sprayed she is a female and fixed what the heck is going on thanks for all the responses but keep in mind that i have a lot of experiences with cats my whole years of life and have done fostering through shelters this is the first time i've had kittens and my well behaved adults acting in the same way my kittens aren't neutered spayed yet but will be soon the vets want me to wait as they are only months but i think its time all of my other cats are fixed no litter changes in fact when i tried changing the litter they had problems they are still using the litter box but seem to be enjoying just going in the house right now i have the kittens isolated but i dont know what to do about the adult cat that did this right in front of me any ideas i'm wondering if this is a dominance fight which is why there are so many markings i have never seen this before even when i had more than cats in my house at once while fostering get them neutered your vet is wrong the procedure can be done at eight weeks of age as long as the kitten is at least two pounds in weight if this vet doesn't do early spay neuter go to one that does your local animal shelter or humane society should be able to refer you to one or you may even be able to get it done there sounds to me like they're reached sexual maturity and this is the cause of their spraying Dog Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Kitten Guinea pig Ferret Feral cat Socialization Housebreaking Hamster Manx (cat) Fancy rat Toilet humour Ron and Fez RuneScape quests Japanese tea ceremony Garfield Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Atomic Kitten Dog training Flea Treecat Pitaten Social rule Infantilism Animal shelter The Fairly OddParents Tick Genericized trademark The Contender (television series) Human Castration Liger Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong House Mouse Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Salad Fingers The Star Wars Holiday Special Diseases of the honeybee Fire fighting David Hume Spanking 2000 Australian Grand Prix Toilet Fiddler on the Roof Grammatical gender Milton H.
