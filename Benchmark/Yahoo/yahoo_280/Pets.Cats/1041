i live in florida and my cats keep on getting fleas its starting to get annoying having to strip down all my bedding rugs and on my days off working harder to make sure that there are no more fleas so my question is what is a fast quick and easy way to prevent and get rid of all the fleas yours is a serious problem and there is a three prong solution make an appointment for your kitties at the vet for a flea dip this will kill the fleas and their eggs buy some flea killing orgie of death bug bombs for your house and set them off as you're leaving your house with your kitties to the vet you have to be gone for at least two hours make sure you read the cans to know for how long you should be gone and then for safety's sake be gone for an hour longer the bomb will kill the fleas and their eggs but you have to do both the flea dip and the bombs at the same time or your couches will re infest your cats or vice versa get some flea collars for your kittens or flea whatever to keep the fleas from coming back when you get back home you'll have to vacuum wash the sheets etc but you'll only have to do it once make sure you wash all the dishes etc as you'll have poison everywhere yeah it'll take a day and it will be a long day but you'll never have to do it again also when you're vacuuming put a flea collar inside the vacuum bag or container as this will also kill fleas that might still be lingering to life vacuuming without the boms won't get the job done as they get imbedded in your couches your sheets your drapes your mattresses everything once you've got an infestation it really does take a serious all out nuking to get rid of them good luck i remember when i had this problem and it was in florida where those nasty little buggers just thrive in the heat raunch Flea Bedbug Cat Mattress Vacuum tube Foodborne illness Equine conformation Hand grenade Coffee Badly Drawn Kitties Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dog training Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Kosher foods Social rule Vacuum mattress Recumbent bicycle Garfield Volleyball Weed control Tobacco The Fairly OddParents Futurama (TV series - season 5) Casting Solar power Theory of conduct Carnivorous plant Hey Arnold!
