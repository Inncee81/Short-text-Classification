what is a good way to train a month old cat to go wee wee in the litter box she does her other business in there just fine but for some reason she doesn't go tinkle in the box she either goes right outside the box or on my living room carpet i've never had a cat before so this is all new to me help cats usually learn to use the litter box from their mother and should be completely housebroken by the time they're old enough to be adopted if you've had the cat for awhile and this is a new behavior it's likely due to a health problem like kidney failure uti etc or because the litter box is too smelly they dislike using dirty litterboxes i'm assuming since you call it a she that this is not a male cat but some males spray or mark their territory which is very hard to correct some cats pee on carpet when they're stressed you've introduced a new pet or family member taken a vacation etc if she does this every time and has always done it it is very unlikely that you can train this out of her take her to a vet for a medical evaluation medication or advice on training Pet skunk Cat Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Guinea pig Toilet humour Urinary incontinence Manx (cat) Ferret Dog Hamster Housebreaking Toxoplasmosis Socialization Urine Animal communication Tobacco smoking Breastfeeding Black panther Rabies Friends Feral cat Dog training Cat litter Prolog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Moe Szyslak Taboo food and drink Flea The Cat in the Hat Traumatic incident reduction Plastic Red Dwarf characters Education in Japan President of Singapore Folic acid Veterinarian Microchip implant (animal) Circumcision Phoebe Buffay Alternative medicine Big Day Out Kitten Hypertension Obedience training Phoebe Buffay's songs Albert Ellis Transsexuality Software testing Ernest Hemingway Liger Physician Raw food diet Tai Chi Chuan The Beach Boys House Mouse Unemployment Diatomaceous earth Camp Lazlo Ethics Diabetes mellitus Canary Education in Australia Condom Maine Coon The Marshall Mathers LP Penis Stuttering Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Randomness Sleep Childbirth Pee-wee's Playhouse Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cheetah Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Carpet Kim Possible Chinchilla Health insurance Pet Sounds Garfield The Sims Boxing training Dynamic Systems Development Method Extreme Programming C plus plus The Pet Sounds Sessions Psychiatry Psychotherapy Code: Lyoko Computed tomography Scientology beliefs and practices Felis sapiens Jackass: The Movie Good Times
