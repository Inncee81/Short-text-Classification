weird markings on my cat hi i recently got a cat from the rspca he is four years old and on his left ear has what looks like ink markings there are two half moons made up of four dots each and in between those two more dots there is also a hole on the tip of his ear before i adopted the cat i was told he was a stray does anyone know what these markings could mean thanks haven is correct it sounds like a neutering tattoo is the easiest way to know if an animal is entire or not makes it so much easier to peek in the ear of a scared stray to look for a tattoo rather than to a physical check on a male and with females the only way to know besides another op if in doubt ask the rspca the cat more than likely came to the shelter already neutered and so that is why it isn't as clear as if it had been done very recently Violin Tattoo Dog Pet skunk Animal rights Grammatical gender Animal shelter Gender Rabbit Bulgarian language Polish language Elephant Hangul Ferret Sterilization (surgical procedure) Mickey Mouse Animal euthanasia The Time Machine Body modification Kakapo "Weird Al" Yankovic House of Leaves Pitaten Condom Domestic rabbit Castration Dutch language Who Framed Roger Rabbit Earring Czech language Hebrew calendar Spanish pronouns Autostereogram Gender-neutral language Shaggy dog story Blink-182 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Badly Drawn Kitties YuYu Hakusho Gender identity Criminal tattoo Slovak language Oscilloscope Masoretic Text EastEnders Lion Guinea pig Bass guitar Vector (spatial) New Zealand English Printed circuit board Kangaroo Comanche Memento (film) Red Dwarf Kitten Social rule Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Arabic alphabet Nine Inch Nails Hamster Leopard John Frusciante Ron and Fez Traditional animation Wolverine (comics) Mammal Shofar Action (physics) Drawing Chinese calendar The Death Gate Cycle The Price Is Right Socialization OpenBSD Quotation mark Theory of conduct Microchip implant (animal) Maka dai dai shogi Irezumi Code: Lyoko Treecat Maine Coon Fountain pen Naruto jutsu Tour de France Pac-Man Vulgar Latin Feral Dean Koontz Palindrome Panthera hybrid Prank flash Virginia Opossum Mnemonic Friends Rent (musical) Lady and the Tramp
