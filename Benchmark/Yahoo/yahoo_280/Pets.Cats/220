how do i get my cat to use the litter box again i can't get my month old cat to use the litter box we're had him since he was weeks old when we first got him he was fine with it then one day he just stopped using it a few months ago he hasn't used it since he'll jump in the bath tub and go there i have tried everythign i can think of to stop him i've ran water in the bathtub when i see him jump in there he'll just jump out until i turn the water off and jump back in he knows he's not supposed to he'll do it right in front of me or my husband and when we yell at him he just gives us a confused look the litter box is in the bathroom also i have two other cats and they use it just fine i am so tired of cleaning the bathtub but i don't know what to do with him by nature cats are fastidious and instinctively cover wastes with sand or dirt and indoor cats find a litter box suits this purpose well your new kitten wants to please you most kittens are litter box trained by their mothers if your kitten isn't accustomed to a litter box its your job to teach it what you expect and reward it for good behavior there are three factors to consider its ability to control its bowels and bladder its sense of home and toilet areas and how to communicate what is acceptable behavior to your new pet after you take your kitten home after meals drinks exercise or excitement gently place it in an easily accessible box filled with litter several times if necessary until it gets the idea after one or two tries in the litter box the kitten will usually become housebroken remember to praise the kitten lavishly for correct actions patience and continued loving care should handle any problems if your new kitten is sick with diarrhea or some other disease it is almost impossible to housebreak it at that time nurse it back to health and then resume its training order is important to cats changes in the environment including color or location of the litter box color or type of litter senility lack of sanitation odor of other animals on clothing a new animal baby or visitor in the home territorial anxiety in a multiple cat home a nearby female cat in heat moving or getting new furniture intact cats in the home stray cats outside the home change in the household schedule insufficient attention loneliness or emotional crisis in the family can all lead to litter box use problems if your cat stops using the litter box in favor of other surfaces in the home a veterinary examination should be your first step inappropriate urination is a common problem due to urinary tract disease or behavioral expression of feline displeasure occasionally the stress or discomfort of some non urinary tract disease will lead to this problem one rare cause is retained or remnant ovarian tissue in a spayed cat a sudden fright or too long confinement may cause occasional accidents common problems may arise if the cat doesn't like the type of litter its odor or its consistency experiment with several brands until you find one the cat likes the box may not be private enough or some object frightening to the cat may be near the box's location another problem may be that the litter pan is too small try different cat box fillers placing feed dishes where the cat has been urinating or moving the litter box to a quieter more private area if commercial litter doesn't seem to work try sawdust sand or newspapers with multi cat homes several litter boxes may be needed frequent cleaning is a must regardless of the number of cats make sure the litter box is accessible keep the location consistent keep the sides reasonably low for easy access keep it 'baited' but clean avoid scented litter or deodorants scoop often and change several times week spraying is when a cat marks a vertical surface with urine this is a form of territorial marking although cats with urinary tract disease will occasionally mark a vertical surface too the cat generally stands on all four feet lifts its tail straight up and squirts urine backward the erect tail often quivers just prior to and during the expulsion soiled areas must be cleaned thoroughly to destroy the presence of ammonia common solutions are those of equal parts white vinegar and water baking soda mouthwash detergents and clorox other products sold specifically for this purpose are available through local pet stores in any event the area must be saturated then blotted over and over again until all urine has been removed if the cat still refuses to use the litter box the confinement method is one alternative to retrain the animal once the cat is using the litter box regularly it is given more freedom it is important to select an area which is just big enough to hold the litter box at one end and the cat's bedding at the other give the cat no other area than a litter box for elimination apart from its own bedding the cat has to remain in the cage for hours a day for a minimum of two weeks after weeks of successful confinement allow gradually increasing periods of freedom close supervision is needed initially to ensure the cat doesn't revert to soiling outside the litter box when the cat is left alone continue to confine it praise the cat whenever it uses the litter box once the cat seeks the litter box on its own you can begin to feel confident that retraining is complete it is also possible to obtain drug therapy for inappropriate urination this should only be done through consultation with your veterinarian Tobacco smoking Kitten Dairy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stomach
