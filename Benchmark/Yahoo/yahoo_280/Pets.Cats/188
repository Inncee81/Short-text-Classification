if we move does anyone know if our cat will stop spraying our cat sprays by all our windows and i know its because of the cats outside because for some reason there happens to be like cats roaming around our apartment building every time i can so much he stops spraying for a little while but then it will start again does anyone think once we move and he isn't hearing these cats around that he wont spray thanks yes he is neutered he's and has been neutered since he was months i think if you moved somewhere that didnt have cats roaming everywhere outside he might stop it good that you got him neutered and that usually stops it it did for all my boy cats all of them but if you move he could get stressed and make things and the spraying even worse they make stuff you can spray on things to keep cats away so u could use that to keep himaway from windows or keep the outside cats away visit a site like petsmart com or petco com they sell stuff like that good luck Pet skunk Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Fire fighting Feral cat Domestic rabbit Grammatical gender Castration Friends Sin City IBM PC compatible Bulgarian language Pitaten Spanish pronouns Schr__dinger's cat Polish language Cat Shaggy dog story People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Gender 2000 Australian Grand Prix Care Bears Luck Quake III Arena Girly Phoebe Buffay's songs Latin grammar Okashina Okashi Dog Phoebe Halliwell Neopets New Zealand English Badly Drawn Kitties Kitten Windows XP Doomtown Full Metal Panic?
