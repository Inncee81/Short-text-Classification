what should i do about indoor cats hey everyone i have cats who have been indoor cats since they were born i always lived in a building so that wasn't a problem they're years old and it's been two years since i've moved to a house with a garden they would do anything to go out so at first i felt sorry and let them go and i'd sit with them until it became like a habit if they didn't go out they wouldn't stop meaw'ing they never meaw for anything so now since they've come home with lots and lots of different insects on them i bathed them applied the appropriate medication and have not let them out since then but just looking at them looking out the window breaks my heart what should i do is it wrong from keeping them from their natural environment is it not wrong because i'm protecting them from potential danger to their life i don't know what to do any help in this matter is greatly appreciated thanks keep the cats inside if you let them out you are putting them at risk of ear mites fleas ticks rabies traps insecticides predators and being run over by cars do you really want fleas in your carpet they bite humans if you sit on the floor or go barefoot cats that are allowed outside have much shorter lifespans than inside cats one day they might not come back home and you would never know why then how will you feel no good can come of letting them outside Cat Flea Feral cat Hamster Theory of conduct Mosquito Dog Pesticide Insect Bat Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Diseases of the honeybee Sento Biological pest control Hey Jude 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ferret Diving DDT Shaggy dog story Organic farming Time Out of Mind Electrophysiology Pet skunk Ben Johnson (athlete) Shen Gong Wu Friends Dog training Ethics Social rule Mid-levels Air pollution Life expectancy Radon Malaria Rabies Tick Bleeding Characters in the Smurfs Breastfeeding Livestock House dust mite John Frusciante Guinea pig Volleyball Radio Yerevan Blonde on Blonde Milton H.
