whats wrong with my kitten theres something wrong with jake my week old kitten his brothers and sisters are fine yesterday he wasnt playing like normal and he's gone limp and cold i took him to the vets and they injected water in him but its not done anything i'm feeding him kitten milk every hours by syringe he cant walk and isnt meowing anyone got any ideas the vet said he will probably die keep him warm firstly get a hot water bottle but make sure you cover it well with thick blanket then place him on there you're doing good by keep feeding him and the fact he wants to take milk still is good does that mean he isn't feeding from his own mother because there's no replacement for their own milk and being with his mother and the others might give him the will to live he must not give up if the vet injected water in him then he sounds like he's really dehydrated maybe he needs to go back to the vets or a different vet he might need a shot of vitamins too or something or glucose to stimulate him my mum used to breed pedigree kittens and a couple of them did seem at deaths door but my mum never gave up hope and tried everything she could it's tiring and upsetting she even had one that had brain damage and couldn't walk but she kept with it even though the vet said it would die and it made a massive turn around and ended up fine it's now got a loving home to sum up keep feeding yourself if it's not feeding off mother if mother is there keep kitten with her all the time keep kitten warm take back vets there's always something else they can do believe in yourself ps if the kitten does die then obviously you will feel sad but at least you will have done all you could the absolute best of luck to you o Guinea pig Atomic Kitten Kitten Cat Ferret StarCraft: Hybrid Chocolate Breastfeeding About a Boy Garfield Insulin EastEnders Protein-energy malnutrition Social rule Yoko Ono Dairy Domestic rabbit Little Britain Hypoglycemia Hey Jude Milk Bat Boy Knots Landing Pet skunk Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Shaggy dog story Singlish Red Hot Chili Peppers Sin City Dehydration Hamster Alanis Morissette Nutrition Badly Drawn Kitties One Tree Hill (TV series) Hip hop rivalries Poker jargon Charmed Bong Joy Division (band) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory RuneScape quests Coffee Manx (cat) YuYu Hakusho Carburetor Limp Bizkit Teen Girl Squad The Marshall Mathers LP Tea Kodocha K' Fancy rat Diabetes mellitus Spice Girls Marilyn Monroe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Doors Items in the Metroid series Tofu Hypothermia Paul Is Dead Chicken Sarah Kerrigan Vitamin C Father Ted Arthur Laffer Premature birth Big Brother UK series 6 Fancy Crane Customs and etiquette of Japan Characters in the Smurfs Comanche About Schmidt Salad Fingers Saturday Night Live 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Days of our Lives Humphrey Bogart Drowning Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Silent Night, Deadly Night Stroke The Shining (film) Dieting 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rabbit Another World (TV series) Pulp Fiction Phoebe Buffay's songs The Smoking Room True Crime: Streets of LA Phoebe Halliwell Tire
