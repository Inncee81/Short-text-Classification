question about cats i've never owned a cat so don't know too much about them but theres one that keeps coming into my garden i've been out to stroke it gave it some milk its been coming in my house the past few days scratches at the cupboard meows as though its hungry but the fact its not my cat i can't feed it can i just wondering what to do it only comes in the garden about every night so i'm pretty sure someone must own it as i don't see it in the day what i was wondering was will cats just eat eat like a dog or would they only meow for food if they were hungry obviously if its being looked after fed properly i could stop worrying about it just the fact that it was scratching at the cupboard as though it was hungry it also ate some grass in the garden right so basically what i'm trying to say is would a cat still 'ask' for food even if it had a full belly lol well let's put it this way cats can be gluttons when they want to be they are non stop eating machines and have to be shut off once in a while even tho this kitty is most likely being taken care of by someone else he's going to put the sympathy routine on you to make you think he's starving to death which i'm sure he's not with him scratching on your cabinet door the way he does he's trying to convince you that he's in dire need of food cats can be great actors too lol once you start feeding any outside cat you made a friend for life all it takes is one bowl of food or milk and the cat will think your house is his house too cats like dogs eat grass once in a while to clean their stomachs out it's something that animals have done for ever so the only thing i can tell you to do is don't give him anymore milk and don't feed him if you continue to do this he will come around more and more and probably not want to leave your house it's okay to pet him and talk to him but don't feed him anything i hope this advice helps you out Cat RuneScape quests Garfield Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Hamster Domestic rabbit AFI 100 Years series Taboo food and drink Breastfeeding Salad Fingers Pet skunk Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Dog Chicken Trailer Park Boys The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Star Wars Holiday Special Livestock Homer Simpson Animal communication Kashrut Hedgehog Fecal incontinence The Time Machine Pitaten Ron and Fez Catscratch Little Britain Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Animal rights Dairy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abstraction (computer science) One Piece minor characters Kitten Andrew Dice Clay Spanish verbs Kim Possible Stomach cancer The Fairly OddParents YuYu Hakusho The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Phoebe Buffay's songs Ralston Purina Company Friends 1957 World Series Toilet humour Rent (musical) Spot (Star Trek) John the Baptist Neighbours CatDog Ranma __ characters Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Anorexia nervosa Bat Neopets Social rule Organic farming Kakapo Chocolate Invader Zim Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Hansel und Gretel The Super Milk-chan Show The Lovely Bones Lycanthropy Johnny 5 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Japanese tea ceremony Kangaroo Goat English grammar The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kosher foods 613 mitzvot W.I.T.C.H.
