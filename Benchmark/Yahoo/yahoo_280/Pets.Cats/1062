i think my husband gave our cat away our friends came over monday to go swimming at our apartment and brought over a couple of their neighbors their one neighbor works for the same company as my husband but in a different building they all went swimming and when they came back our friends' neighbors were talking about wanting another cat and since we had several cats they asked for one of ours my husband was a little tipsy and was supposedly joking around with them and was telling them they could have one of our cats the girl said something like are you sure you aren't particular about which one we take and that's when i said we were not giving any of our pets away our cat was there that night and all of tuesday and also on wednesday morning arthur is a weird cat that comes out for attention in the morning before i leave for work and at night before we go to bed it dawned on me wednesday night that i hadn't seen arthur since that morning so i searched the entire apartment with no luck arthur is a very skittish cat who has never been outside in his life and won't even go into our apartment hallway when i told my husband about searching the place for the cat and that he wasn't in the apartment my husband got very defensive and asked me if i was trying to say that he did something with him i told him that i didn't even say that only that arthur was not in our apartment we have cats so i'm thinking my husband was hoping i wouldn't notice because my husband is stupid i'm not really sure what i'm asking i guess i'm trying to vent and see what i can do about this i don't really know these people because they are our friend's neighbors if my husband did give him away i guess i can just start giving away things that belong to my husband and not tell him see how he likes that i have a very strange update my husband just called and said he went home and looked for the cat and couldn't find him my husband never goes home during the day when he's supposed to be at work maybe once in a blue moon he will go home for lunch but it's too early for lunch right now and he didn't tell me the reason for going home i'm wondering if it was because he went and got the cat from these people and took him home or something like that seems very strange for him to even go home during the day in the first place and not only that but on the same day i was complaining about the cat being gone sounds like your man is up to something if he's gonna get defensive you might as well accuse him and ask if he did it i understand just wanting to vent you go girl i would be so pissed if someone took one of my pets and i would totally notice too i have cats and a dog but foster kittens and always catching and releasing strays and i would notice that's just effin' rude and disrespectful if he has a problem with there being too many cats he should have talked to you about it not just gotten rid of it and then lied ugh men Shaggy dog story Garfield Paul Is Dead Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) EastEnders Knots Landing Blood on the Tracks Phoebe Buffay's songs Ocean's Twelve One Piece minor characters AFI 100 Years series Russian joke The Star Wars Holiday Special Kodocha Social rule Good Morning, Vietnam The Catcher in the Rye Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Fiddler on the Roof Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Oasis (band) Dead Like Me Badly Drawn Kitties Little Britain Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans The Shining (film) Jon Secada Abigail Folger Sin City Doug Girly Good Times Operation Market Garden Pok__mon Live!
