my cat has a flesh wound please help my cat has been attacked by something and it's too late to take him to a vet he wont stop licking it what can i do it is way to big for peroxide or something i can like see his muscle and s t by the sound of it you need to find an emergency after hours vet it's obviously an open wound is it fresh and bleeding if the wound is deep enough to expose the muscle it needs to be properly investigated and cleaned before anything else and he will probably need some sedation for this to be done it will also need stitching and possibly a drain as well he's probably also in need of pain relief and antibiotics animal bite wounds can be seriously nasty not only is there a high risk of infection but the skin around the wound can die off a few days later because of damage to the blood supply that cannot be seen at the time of the injury if there's no emergency vet that you can get too keep him inside somewhere warm and quiet as he's probably in some degree of shock if he'll let you you can clean the fur around it with warm slightly salty water but don't touch the wound itself let him have water if he wants to drink but it's better not to feed him you're going to have to take him to a vet first thing in the morning if you can't find one tonight and i said earlier he'll probably need to be sedated which can be done much more safely if he hasn't eaten hope that helps and hope that your cat is okay Wound Hiking Tattoo Childbirth Traumatic brain injury Dialysis Bleeding Cat Shark Chlorpromazine Myocardial infarction Paracetamol Group A streptococcal infection Domestic rabbit Acne Guinea pig Shock Diving Anthrax Pneumonia Hydrogen peroxide Equine conformation Tuberculosis Pet skunk Aortic dissection Avalanche Tooth enamel Fecal incontinence Body piercing Breastfeeding Diazepam Rabies Taboo food and drink Stopping power Naruto jutsu Jackass: The Movie Miscarriage Mouth ulcer Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Intravenous therapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cup Tooth Ferret Diabetes mellitus Prostate cancer Weight training Escherichia coli O157:H7 Social rule Skin Legionellosis Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Stroke Blood Rocky Mountain spotted fever Drowning Gout Terminal ballistics Leech Needle aspiration biopsy Vampire Coronary heart disease Ebola Marathon (sport) Gastroesophageal reflux disease Narcotic Wound healing phases Cellulitis The Legend of Zelda series enemies Bruise Cancer Coprophagia Pneumothorax Nuclear power Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Trench warfare Atherosclerosis Ulcer Vomiting Lyme disease Electroshock gun Hip fracture Bone marrow transplant Local anesthesia Dracunculiasis Toxoplasmosis
