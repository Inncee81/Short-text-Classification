did i open pandora's box i have always worn pantyhose with my skirt suits for work each day at the office needless to say with me dressing that way my hubby developed a pretty intense curiousity about it as i was getting ready for work one day i asked him what the fascination was and he told me that he found it alluring and sensual when i wear pantyhose and that he was curious to experience that feeling so i hiked up my skirt eased out of my sheers handed them to him and told him to slip them on i let him keep them on for a few minutes and he went absolutely crazy over the way they felt which i thought was kind of neat now hes asked a few more times recently for me to let him wear them again i don't want to deny it to him because of how fascinated he is and how much he liked it that one time i'm thinking if i can limit it to a few minutes around the time we go to bed we could have fun with it was i wrong to do this how should i handle this it's maybe a little bit kinky but definitely not wrong as long as it doesn't really bother you don't worry about it after all nobody else has to know if that's your concern if you and he end up having some fun with it so much the better there's nothing wrong with it Milton H.
