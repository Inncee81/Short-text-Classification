what is a good way to get my foot in the door as a cook i have very little experiance as a cook just a few months as a cafeteria cook about years ago but i have recently discovered my love of cooking and i really think i would enjoy a career in cooking the only problem is i dont have any idea how i would go about finding a cooking position with no experiance i understand i need to start at the bottom but im not sure where the bottom is so any advice about good places to work or what i can do to make me more appealing as a cooking candidate would be great the very bottom is at a fast food joint although you won't learn much but it'll get your food in the door and you can work to different jobs from there at least you'll have the experience in the industry however both my mother and stepfather worked in the food industry as chefs cooks for a long time they train newbies all the time just be willing to take near minimum wage and you will have no problem your best bet is to go to a school some community colleges offer degree certificate programs so check them out there are also high end schools and that does matter b c it'll get you in the door much quicker just apply don't go for star restaurants but try some chains or franchises or similarly sized restaurants they'll start you chopping vegetables but then as you prove yourself they'll give you tasks with increasing complexity my mom started as a waitress and she found out they needed help in the kitchen and her boss said okay they ended up training her a lot even though she had the basics my stepdad trains people who don't even speak english and have no cooking experience in the kitchen they prefer the english speakers b c they can interface with management and the rest of the staff better not to mention understand customer requests it'll help if you practice at home too that'll help convince them to hire you when you can talk technique with them and it'll help you progress faster i was never in the food industry my mom and stepdad always talked me out of it however more than once their bosses asked me if i would be interested in doing it also i worked as a cashier at a grocery store through high school and college one day one of my bosses asked me if i'd like to learn to bake i said i have no experience she said we'll train you and i'll give you extra an hour i declined b c i didn't like the hours conflicted with college In-N-Out Burger RuneScape quests Wal-Mart Kitchen Expert system CPU cache Hamburger Restaurant French cuisine The Apprentice 2 Software engineering Extreme Programming Education in the People's Republic of China Japanese cuisine Game programming The Shining (film) Pizza Spring operating system RISC Hell's Kitchen (television) Walt Disney World College Program McDonald's Social rule Pretty Good Privacy RuneScape skills Barbecue Graduate school Computer The Amazing Race Stove Wall Street Poker jargon GED Shaggy dog story Education in the United States College Kashrut Organic food Current teachings of Prem Rawat Fast food Kodocha French fries Tesco Japanese tea ceremony Parachuting Ben Johnson (athlete) Ice cream Education in Portugal Solar power Cookware and bakeware Ty Cobb Supermarket Redundant array of independent disks 1957 World Series Labor theory of value Plame affair Economic inequality CPU design G-Man (Half-Life) Mach kernel Second language acquisition 2000 Australian Grand Prix Grandview, U.S.A.
