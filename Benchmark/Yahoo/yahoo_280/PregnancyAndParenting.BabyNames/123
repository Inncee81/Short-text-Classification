middle name drama my partner wants our first sons middle name to be david as that is his first name it is a bit of a tradition in his family for the oldest son to have their middle name the same as the fathers middle name but i was thinking about wanting vincent as the middle name due to it being the middle name of my father and brother and my grandfathers name because my father is very sick at the moment and only has approx a year or so left of life what should we do i feel that your choice should over rule his but if he is so set on the middle name being david name the baby vincent david if that wont work use two middle names vincent david or david vincent if that doesn't work either just think of a complete different name other than vincent or david so one choice wont rule out the other hoping that the new middle name will be something you both agree on Atomic Kitten Characters of Lost Alois Hitler Friends Sharon Tate Knots Landing Vincent van Gogh The Deep End of the Ocean Guiding Light EastEnders Miss Saigon John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) All My Children The Dalek Invasion of Earth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Entourage (TV series) Edward II of England Night (book) Westminster School Family name Everwood Vietnamese language Beetle in an Anthill One Life to Live Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Sexual orientation Emperor Yuan of Han Names and titles of Jesus Wolfrider Poker jargon Beauty and the Beast (series) Luke Skywalker Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Voting system Romulus and Remus Hollyoaks Martin Scorsese Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Giles Gilbert Scott Paige Matthews Walt Lloyd Big Brother (USA TV series) Malcolm in the Middle Empress L__ Zhi Jam (TV series) Daredevil The Supremes Abortion debate Sola fide Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Walter J.
