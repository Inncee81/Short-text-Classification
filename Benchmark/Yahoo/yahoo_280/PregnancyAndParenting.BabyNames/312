is this a cool design idea for a baby girl's room i didn't know what category to put this in well i had tripets two boys and one girl three weeks ago and right now they are all in one room in a few weeks we're going to move our girl tallon into her own room and let the boy's merrick and chandler share i thought it would be really cool to do a really girly theme so my mom made a purple comforter i can't remember what it's called i'm a little brain dead thing for her crib and we have pink sheets but i wanted to paint the walls light pink with clouds and little jets going in between clocks with the times from some of the major fashion capitols of the world with the city's name by them and for pictures i have some swatches and patterns and other sewing things framed so a fashion design themed room yay or neigh like actual clocks that tick tick tock tick tock not painted ones the boy's room is panted like under water themed the walls are blue and then there's sand colored with seaweed and shells and things at the bottom and there's fish the ceiling has like the bottom of a boat and then more blue with lighter blue to make it look like the sun is shining on it and some of the fish and things come off the wall they are velcrow ed on what do you think of that their rooms are connected by a door so we can leave it open and they can still heat each other and whatever in tallon's room we are going to put a full length mirror on the door to camoflage no clue how to spell that it and in the boy's room we just painted it blue and it blends in pretty well first of all if you just had triplets and you still have time to design a bedroom congratulations they must be sleeping well how exciting to have new bundles i love the ideas of the different cities with the clocks i am asuming that they will be set to the correct time zone for that city what a cute idea i have also seen people take pictures from a trip say paris and then frame them you could put a big collage of say different black and white pictures from different cities or they could be of a fashion design theme on one wall that would be cute youll have to post a picture when your through ps you better hurry and call all hands on deck to help you finish b c in a few weeks they will start to stay awake more and your design plans may have to be put on hold good luck The Shining (film) Paul Is Dead Rococo Cliff Richard Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Friends EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Grace Cossington Smith Garfield AFI 100 Years series Havelock Vetinari Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Fan (implement) Ed, Edd n Eddy Pink Floyd Wilton House World line W.
