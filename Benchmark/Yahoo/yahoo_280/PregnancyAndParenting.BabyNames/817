name advice please due in a week we had names picked but now aren't sure our first daughter is and when we were having her we decided if it was a girl the name would be sierra alexandra that is until she was born and all of oa sudden we decided on bailey jade our next one is due in a week from tomorrow and thought we had names picked but in the past two weeks we really aren't sure we don't know the sex of the baby for a girl we had sheridan grace picked and for a boy dylan alexander now we are trying to decide between girls sheridan grace zoe claire giselle ava also open to middle name suggestions we also like lyric but aren't sure of a middle name boys dylan alexander cedar jaron jarvis dean zaron not sure of a middle name we don't really want common names nephews and nieces names are grayson zack xander tate tallara jazz javier marc darrion kade shawnica eve chardae rose tori elise soraya aspen christian derick matthew john mitchell james aaron michael what do you like or suggest thanks i should have clarified a little better and said we don't really want traditional names not common i come from a family of six and on my mothers side she came from a family of four dad came from a family of twelve on my other half's side he comes from a family of eight his mother from a family of nine and father from a family of three so we have all the traditional names of david peter paul mark mary lillian patrick anna anne daniel joe joanne heather helen jack isobel annabel etc most of the ones in our generation of the familys have said it has become too dificult not to mention family arguments trying to name children after family etc so we would choose less traditional names and not name after family hope this helps on why we are looking at these styles of names cedar and lyric are by far the best two on this list and it's cool because they're both relatively unisex so they could be for a boy or a girl cedar suggests determination resolve and fortitude and lyric suggests creativity eloquence and beauty as for me i tend to prefer names that actually mean something so that's why i like these names a name needs to be more than just a pretty sounding bunch of syllables and as far as all these people saying that cedar and lyric are bad names and that your kids will hate it when they're older that's bullshit brown steaming bullshit my name is rebel lenore and that's about as weird as it gets and you know what i fucking love it i didn't like it much when i was a little kid but when i got to my early teens i finally realized what a great gift an off the wall name is life would be so much worse with some boring name with no meaning or significance trust me go with something unique and with some kind of meaning and your kids will be thanking you one day i know i did Charmed One Life to Live Line of succession to the British Throne Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Neighbours Past characters (Neighbours) AVN Awards Time Out of Mind EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Chuck Cunningham syndrome Academy Award for Original Music Score Days of our Lives Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay Dawson's Creek Marilyn Monroe Tony Award for Best Musical Empire Burlesque Guiding Light Blood on the Tracks History of As the World Turns (2000-present) The Catcher in the Rye The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Love and Theft Academy Award for Costume Design Street-Legal Little Britain Boston Public Friends Joni Mitchell America's Next Top Model W.I.T.C.H.
