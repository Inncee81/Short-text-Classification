weird unusual names choosing unusual names ive noticed over the past few days people will keep posting in my opinion quite odd names on here and ask if they're cute or nice or what we think of them do people really go from here and use the names or opinions there was a girl yesterday wanting to call her daughter academy cos she loved it i hope she doesnt i use the user name kirsty all the time as i love that name my real name well on my birth certificate is echezeaux india pronounced esh er zoo its a place in france india well you know my parents were hippies hmmm classy my mum hates that i wont respond to it cos she loved it do you get weird hormones when your pregnant that make you think weird names are good for kids what are your true thoughts on my stupid name is it fair to put that on kids discuss i dont think people give enough thought into having children let alone naming them i did the same with my first long lists and after other people none of the names were really for him we were indulging ourselves and the grandparents fortunately he didnt have anything weird and is happy with his name james he doesnt use his middle names we gave him after his dad and grandfathers my second we took weeks to name after he was born the name is unusual but really suits him it suits his personality and was meant for him he loves it and has only met other people with his name my third was also named after she was born although i had decided on a middle name of rose because all the roses were budding outside my window while i was waiting to give birth days overdue i had a list of names but none suited her when she was born her name means 'fathers joy' which she really is being his only girl i would recomend parents wait til they know their baby a bit before making the final choice they often dont suit the names choosen before you meet them Atomic Kitten EastEnders Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Friends About a Boy Alois Hitler W.I.T.C.H.
