how can i change dad's mind on what to name our child i am not sure if he is joking but my child's father is insisting on naming our child spryte leigh if it is a girl he does not like any of the names i suggest it is our first child together and the third for both of us am i being selfish because i had full say over my two other childrens' names should i give in because he wasn't given the opportunity to pick his kids' names i had been planning on a name that ended in na because i already have a jena and reyna but he just seems to have his heart set on spryte and no it is not because of the drink but because of the meaning of elf maybe i am not giving it a fair chance because i am headstrong and not used to having an involved man during my pregnancy should i fight it or is spryte really not that bad of a name when i got my cat my mom insisted on naming it johnny cash i got the cat shortly after johnny cash passed away needless to say i wasn't thrilled about naming my girl cat who was grey and white not even black after a male singer nonetheless she got the name and soon became johnny cabbage cuz she got fat thus a cabbage and now she responds only to the name cabbage spryte is a terrible name and i wouldn't ever put it onto a child especially spelled that way but in all honesty if you let him give your possible daughter that name give her a strong middle name that she can fall back on when she becomes her own person and personality good luck The Fairly OddParents Knots Landing Pitaten Charmed Friends RuneScape quests Recurring South Park characters Joke About a Boy Theory of conduct Vegeta Kyle Broflovski Winning Streak Elvis Presley Marilyn Monroe President (game) Insane Clown Poppy Poker jargon Trailer Park Boys Ranma __ characters Social rule The Contender (television series) Doug The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Johnny Cash Alena One Tree Hill (TV series) Halloween Luck Grandview, U.S.A.
