why is there no playoffs system for college football like they have in college basketball but college basketball seedings rankings are kinda weird too with the ncaa tournament considered the strength of schedule or whatever why can't both of these sports especially college football have a normal playoff system the official line from the ncaa is that the kids would miss too much class time but we all know that is bogus since every other level of football has a playoff system and those kids actually have to go to class since they are not there on academic scholarship the real answer to your question is they don't have a d i playoff because too much money is divvied out via the bowl system that nobody wants to change the lesser teams get a bowl payout and would miss out on that if they went to a team playoff format Playoff Playoff format National Football League Atlantic Coast Conference Ivy League University of Houston Bowl Championship Series World Football League College basketball National Collegiate Athletic Association Quizbowl Baylor University West Virginia University Joe Paterno National Basketball Association Georgia Institute of Technology Division I NFL playoffs Sudden death NCAA Division I-A national football champions Michigan State University Tulane University University of Maryland, College Park Boston College Athletics University of Central Florida Basketball University of Michigan Western Kentucky University Syracuse University Orange American football University of Denver Duke University North Carolina State University American Football League Single-elimination tournament Virginia Commonwealth University NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Purdue University University of Texas at El Paso Middle Tennessee State University National Hockey League University of California, Los Angeles March 2005 in sports Auburn University New York Giants National Football League Lore University of Connecticut NCAA Philippines Basketball Championship Williams College Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women Boise State University Washington State University Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Football (soccer) Florida State University The Catholic University of America EA Sports University of Virginia Sports betting University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Jerry Lucas Chinese Basketball Association University of Tennessee Comparison of Canadian and American football University of Texas at Austin New Mexico Lobo Basketball San Diego State University Stanford University Monday Night Football Super Bowl XXV University of South Carolina Clemson University Michael Jordan Columbia University University of Arkansas Oklahoma State University - Stillwater University of Kentucky Lebanon Valley College Carolina Panthers Pennsylvania State University University of North Carolina at Charlotte University of Nevada, Las Vegas Utah State University University of Florida University of Washington New York Knicks Oklahoma Sooners Canadian Interuniversity Sport Tim Floyd Tournament Luther Head
