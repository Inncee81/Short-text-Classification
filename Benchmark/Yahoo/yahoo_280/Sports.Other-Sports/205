can you make a skateboard with decks clamped together like a press instead of buying a huge expensive press to make the shape of the board is it possible to simply buy of the same deck shape and and clamp them around the maple veneer sheets to make the shape thanks a lot i dont think people are understanding me so let me restate the question if i used decks as a mold to make another deck i would get plies of maple veneer put glue in between then put that whole thing in between the decks i would then clamp the decks together around the layers of veneer acting like a huge press or mold to shape the layer deck to be the same as the other im not trying to glue decks together silly dude real decks are somewhat expensive but making your own out of a mold of to different molds is too complicated and a waste of time i see what you are saying and you probably cold do that i have never tried or even thought of it but if you feel like you should do it if all else fails just go buy one plus you would still need to buy screws bolts trucks wheels and bearings seperately and put it together in a home made deck that might not have the proper allignment Skateboard Skateboarding Screw Plywood Woodworking Seismic retrofit Skateboarding trick Casting Drill bit Boat building Clinker (boat building) Upholstery Tire Welding Portsmouth Block Mills Deck (ship) Violin Injection moulding Poker jargon Tarot Marquetry Geodesic dome Mattress Textile manufacturing Shaggy dog story Bolted joint Rigging Die (manufacturing) Electrophysiology Blow molding Sailing Carbon fiber Plastic Parquetry Theory of conduct Tom-tom drum Manifold Transformer Carburetor Dinghy Ship model Microeconomics San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Glass MapleStory Wire wrap Guitar Motorcycle SS Morro Castle Book of Isaiah Suspension bridge Chobits Cookie Seventh Sea (collectible card game) The nature of God in Western theology Polymer clay USS Tunny (SS-282) Cruising (maritime) Supply and demand Billboard (advertising) Floyd Rose Sampling (music) Mercury 4 Bonsai Cartridge (firearms) Canoe Time Out of Mind Monopoly (game) Industrial engineering Atari 8-bit family Ship Sushi Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Mercury Atlas 6 Richard Feynman Strap-on dildo Year of the Spider Adhesive Opportunity rover Yu-Gi-Oh!
