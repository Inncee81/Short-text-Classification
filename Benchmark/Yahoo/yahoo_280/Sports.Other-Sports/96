how do people do splits i want to learn how to split because i want to be a cheerleader for my high school please tell everything thanks i realize that as a man and one who started to do the spits in my late s and as someone who is above averagely muscular always seems to cause a lot of surprise when i do the front splits i can t do the straddle splits yet but i m about from the ground at this point the reason that i bring this up is that i think anyone can do the splits even the least likely candidates like me and this is how warm up with some cardiovascular exercise i usually do the elliptical machine once warm the following stretches work really well sit with legs together and reach both hands until you have your feet in your hands keep your back as straight as possible breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds while seated bend one leg with foot back and away from body knee should be about degrees away from other straight leg reach for foot of straight leg breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat with other leg lay on back with one leg straight pull other knee to chest with both hands breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds then pull same knee gently to the side until upper arm is flat on ground if it hurts stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds with hand of same side grab outside of foot palm down and pull towards body if it hurts stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds with both hands grab same part of foot and gently pull towards center and hold if it hurts stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side sit back up and place foot of one leg flat to the outside of the knee of the other and rotate upper body so that you can put the elbow of the straight legged side to the out side of bent knee look behind you as you do this this one s a yoga move i just don t remember what it s called breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side now put soles of feet together and as close to the groin area as possible grab the outsides of your feet together while knitting fingers use your elbows to push down knees keep back straight go as far down as you can with out pain in the knee if you feel any knee pain or pressure ease up or stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds from this position extend one leg so that knee of extended leg is against sole of foot reach for sole of extended leg s foot keep back strait and don t bounce breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side now spread legs as far as comfortable reach towards center with back straight then reach for either sole with back as straight as manageable breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds for each side and center spread legs a little further if you can and repeat center lie on stomach and bring bent leg under body so that knee is close to sternum and back is straight and parallel to ground breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds from this position put palms on ground and push chest upward so that leg behind and upper body bend toward each other stretching abdomen a little breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side after this you can attempt the splits a little but don t try to go all the way down it will take several months or more if you re super old like me but do not rush it or you may hurt yourself always make sure there is no undue pressure on your knees and or back and if there is stop immediately don t risk injury i wish you luck i apologize if the descriptions are hard to follow Swingout Front crawl Glossary of ballet terms Volleyball Tai Chi Chuan Swimming Horizontal bar Powerbomb Glossary of climbing terms Clean and jerk Boxing Casualty lifting Weight training Mixed martial arts Glossary of American football Anatomical terms of location Butterfly stroke Backbreaker Massage Cheerleading Aikido Piledriver (professional wrestling) Drowning Marching band Softball Tenshinhan Childbirth Four square Decompression sickness Parade (military) Carpal tunnel syndrome Charleston (dance move) Breastfeeding Water polo Piccolo Junior Saga Side pass (dance move) Salute Mattress Handstand Sport rowing Wing Chun Spanking Horse gait Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Glossary of partner dance terms Neckbreaker Diver rescue Shaggy dog story Hogtie bondage Drill bit Ben Johnson (athlete) Trumpet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gesture Elbow bondage Strap-on dildo DDT (professional wrestling) Human position Menstrual cup Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Human anatomy Lindy Basic Captain Thunderbolt Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Canoe First aid Breech birth Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Big Apple (dance) Textile manufacturing Laws of cricket Pittsburgh Steelers Wood carving Rugby union Tide High-heeled shoe New England Patriots Recovery position Strike (attack) Stopping power
