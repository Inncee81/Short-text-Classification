mile time im a year old girl and ' and i tried running a mile and i can only run it in its very depressing i have moderate asthma but i really dont think that should stop me i want to play soccer this year and in tryouts they test the mile i can do sprints pretty well but i know they base alot of their decisions on the mile i really need some tips to quicken my mile i have trouble with distance as well i have excellent sprint times but when it comes to endurance i lack a little bit if you work on lengthening your strides that will help you to go faster and save a bit of energy i play college soccer and we get tested on every kind of running possible and the best thing is to not think about it too much just go into auto pilot and let yourself run if you constantly think about how tired you are and how much you have to go it throws you off so my advice dont think too much and lengthen your strides Equine conformation Football (soccer) Auto racing Fast bowling Olympic medalists in athletics (men) 24 Hours of Le Mans Sprint (race) Ben Johnson (athlete) Fuel efficiency Triathlon Hurdling Baseball Unreal Internal ballistics 2000 Australian Grand Prix Athletics Milwaukee, Wisconsin Tour de France Drag racing Eventing Dressage Sport rowing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Boeing 777 Show jumping American football Scrabble (game show) Tony Stewart W.I.T.C.H.
