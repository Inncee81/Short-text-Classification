bowling question i bowl with a finger tip ball and hook the ball my question is i have a probelm of lofting the ball a bit which reduces the hook for me i have tried everything from slowing my approach and moving but i still tend to loft the ball i thought by going to a heavier ball it would help but i am still having this problem i bowl with a pound ball but when i bowl with a pound ball i loft it even more i should also note that i am a left handed bowler i used to do that ive done things i have adjusted where i look from the arrows to the dots also i changed the pitch on my thumb hole to speed the release and so i cant grab it by bending my thumb there is a product you can put in the thumb hole to stop you bending your thumb if this is the problem see link below Fast bowling Types of bowlers in cricket Cricket Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bowling ball Fielding (cricket) Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Mouse (computing) General relativity Aerial (dance move) Slower ball Golf club (equipment) Golf Bass guitar Archery Batting (cricket) Drill bit Golf glossary Timpani Spin bowling Swing bowling The Time Machine Gesture Flipper (cricket) Ravi Shastri The Inside Swingout Softball Laws of cricket Violin Double bass Tenshinhan Terminal ballistics Bowling (cricket) Harp Piccolo Junior Saga History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Harmonica Chopsticks Vector (spatial) Skateboarding trick History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Backstroke English cricket team M60 machine gun Wicket-keeper Carburetor Bouncer Seam bowling Internal ballistics Outswinger Rugby union Volleyball Floppy disk Rugby union positions Knife Clarinet Wind turbine Brian Close Cricket ball Suplex Traffic light Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Bong Snooker Rolling-element bearing History of Test cricket (to 1883) Yorker Black hole Cincinnati Bengals Basketball Skittles (sport) Professional wrestling throws Tire 2005 English cricket season Guitar Baseball Stars Screw Indian Oil Cup 2005 Team Fortress Classic Carpal tunnel syndrome Wicket Super Bowl IX Anchor Western concert flute M16 (rifle) Over (cricket) American football Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Umpire (cricket) Electrophysiology Side pass (dance move) Duckpin bowling Clean and jerk Shaggy dog story Swept wing Steering
