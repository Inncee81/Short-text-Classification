shud i inform the coach that i will not attend tryouts i live in usa i am visiting canada now i signed up for volleyball at my highschool the tryouts are on th august i don't wana try out anymore and i am visiting canada now so there is no way i can attend the tryouts this was my first time signing up for a sport shud i email the volleyball coach and say that i can't attend shud i give reasons why i can't attend what will be the consequences if tell her abt it and if i don't plz help i think it would be courteous to notify the coach that you can't attend because you will be in canada if you changed your mind and don't want to play volleyball at all tell the coach that too the coach has to make plans for the team depending on the number of people who signed up if you quit the team this will give the coach time to pick someone else who wants to play i don't think there will be any bad consequences if you take this approach not contacting the coach and not showing up won't make you look too good Volleyball Sandy Koufax New York Knicks Norway national football team Los Angeles Clippers Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Baseball Gmail Buffalo Bills New York Jets Reggie Jackson Cincinnati Bengals Wayne Gretzky Washington Redskins San Antonio Spurs Jon Heidenreich New Jersey Nets Super Bowl XXVII Maurice Richard Bowl Championship Series Minnesota Vikings Ice hockey New Mexico Lobo Basketball Royal Assent Toronto Raptors New York Giants Detroit Red Wings Boston Bruins Cleveland Browns Beach volleyball Denis Law Southeastern Conference Dog agility New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets New Jersey Devils 2004-05 in English football Oakland Raiders Volleyball World Championship West Virginia University Big East Conference Georgia Institute of Technology Toronto Argonauts Identity theft Volleyball Olympic Tournament Lacrosse Carolina Panthers Miami Dolphins China at the 2004 Summer Olympics Michael Phelps Portsmouth F.C.
