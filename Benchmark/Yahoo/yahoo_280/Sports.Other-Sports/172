how do you play fantasy football my friend just asked me to play fanstasy football and i dont care for football i am completely lost when it comes to this what do i do i heard something like a draft please help points for best answer if you don't care for football don't spend too much on the league if you don't care for it at all you may want to turn down your friend you can play a lot of fantasy leagues with minimum effort but most people who play are enthusiasts who love that their fantasy teams force them to watch teams they never cared about before basically each owner in the league takes turns picking players from across the nfl and puts together the best team they can the exact makeup of a team varies from league to league as do the actual rules on scoring but it would be something like qb rb wr te defense and kicker starting each week and your roster will be twice that size each week you play one of the other teams in your fantasy league based on those players' individual performances you will score points exactly how many and for what accomplishments vary from league to league and hopefully score more points than your opponent and win the game since the draft is the most important part of fantasy football you could do all right by grabbing a fantasy magazine and checking the news to read up on the last minute injuries holdouts criminal problems etc once you have drafted the team and know who your best starters are you only need to make adjustments when one of your regular starters has a bye week or gets injured part of the fun of fantasy is checking the free agents trading with other owners and watching the games to see how your guys did but you can get by without making that much effort National Football League New England Patriots American football Football (soccer) Carolina Panthers Buffalo Bills Kansas City Chiefs Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns New York Jets Super Bowl IX Baltimore Ravens American Football League Baseball Chicago Bulls San Francisco 49ers Canadian football Yao Ming Indianapolis Colts Glossary of American football Toronto Raptors Ultimate (sport) Terrell Owens Orlando Magic Miami Dolphins 2005 NFL season Super Bowl XVII New York Knicks Super Bowl XXV Minnesota Vikings Rugby union Ice hockey Los Angeles Clippers Donovan McNabb Arena football Super Bowl XXVI Reserve clause Super Bowl III Toronto Blue Jays NFL Draft Fantasy baseball Detroit Tigers Playoff Rugby league Detroit Red Wings Dan Marino Bundesliga (football) Football Jacksonville Jaguars Canadian Football League Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXXIV New Jersey Nets Super Bowl XIII Paintball The Football League Volleyball Super Bowl XXXVI Minor league baseball Dallas Cowboys Sudden death Chicago White Sox Philadelphia Eagles Softball Super Bowl X National Basketball Association FA Cup Brett Favre Los Angeles Kings 2005 World Series Major League Baseball Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl VII Super Bowl XXI National Rugby League Major League Soccer World Football League Damon Allen Alex Ferguson Ra (board game) Gaelic football Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXIV Steve Nash Oakland Athletics
