why don't left handed hitters bunt or slap the ball near the rd base side when a shift is placed on them i see shifts being put on bonds big papi and hafner i know that a lot of times they have success hitting the ball up the middle or pull the middle and try to middle the ball on the bat but during critical junctures of the games why won't these guys bunt near the rd base line or slap the shot near the rd base this could disrupt the defense and runners on base could move up the hitter could get on base and maybe an error might be commited are they not skilled enough and can't handle the bat to hit the ball the other way in the infield or what pitchers are pitching them away so why won't these guys do it i mean look at hafner his team could be running away with first place in the al central if theywon more close games if he could come thru and play smart like that when a shift is placed on him in critical close games he's having a bad year not hitting for power or average why can't he do this and contribute to his team why can't lefties like him and others do that i think that's one of the subtleties of the game if lefties were able to do that that would cause the fielding side to make another adjustment but you have to take whatever is your best chance of getting a hit if you're currently not good enough to hit the other way for whatever reason grip stance etc then maybe the best chance of getting a hit is to keep on pull hitting even when the shift is on other possibility is that while it definitely seems like something that a good hitter would do if you're a power hitter and the team's best chance of getting runs is off your bat i'm not sure poking it down the line for a single and leaving the hitting to one of your less able teammates is necessarily the way to go 1957 World Series Softball Babe Ruth Baseball scorekeeping Fast bowling Tris Speaker Home run Robin Ventura Batting average Bunt Ty Cobb Pete Rose 2005 World Series Andr__s Galarraga 2004 World Series Hank Aaron Manny Ram__rez Fielding (cricket) Baseball Stars World Series First baseman Boston Red Sox Box score (baseball) St. Louis Cardinals Batting (cricket) Cricket Satchel Paige Sandy Koufax Chicago White Sox Toronto Blue Jays Los Angeles Dodgers Laws of cricket Baseball positions 1986 World Series Ted Williams BASEketball Interference (baseball) Mike Scioscia Barry Bonds 2004 American League Championship Series Table tennis English cricket team Designated hitter 1986 National League Championship Series Hal Trosky Stolen base Baserunning San Francisco Giants Pittsburgh Pirates New York Yankees David Ortiz Gary Sheffield Sammy Sosa Ravi Shastri Out (baseball) Luke Appling Chicago Cubs No-hitter Water polo Reggie Jackson Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Pedro Mart__nez Shoeless Joe Jackson Pitcher Snooker Babe Ruth's Called Shot Lou Gehrig Bert Campaneris Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 October 9 in baseball American football Seattle Mariners Moe Berg Tag Leg before wicket Batting order (baseball) Marius Russo October 20 in baseball Earned run average Rugby union positions Oakland Athletics Detroit Tigers Ichiro Suzuki Mike Schmidt October 10 in baseball Shortstop Cincinnati Reds New York Mets Casey Stengel
