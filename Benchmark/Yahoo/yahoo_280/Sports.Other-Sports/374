i signed my year old up for gymnastics today they placed her in acro gymnastics i i know they have a kid nastics too was this the appropiate class for a child with no prior gymnastics she did ballet and tap but not gymnastics the reason i ask was because the lady i spoke with on the phone said her class would be on wed but when i brought her in for registration the lady put her into the friday class as you may have assumed wed is kid nastics and friday is the acro gymnastics i does anyone have any experience with this that can help me i just dont want her to be behind or anything but i did see that the class acro gymnastics i is age and up honestly it probably doesn't matter if it is a good gym they will recognize if she is in the right class right away and refer you into the correct one if she is too behind or too far ahead Sport Excel Saga Doomsday argument Little Britain Adolescence Education in the United States Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Physical education Aerial (dance move) Rhythmic gymnastics Big Brother (Australian TV series) Divorce Barbie Martial art 2002 Commonwealth Games Beavis and Butt-head Nia Long Billboard (advertising) Calisthenics GED Bart chalkboard gags Public domain Allana Slater 1896 Summer Olympics Philosophy of language Luck North Carolina State University Fukuoka, Fukuoka Eastern Orthodox Church The Citadel (Military College) Otakon Gym 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Atomic Kitten Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Kodocha AFI 100 Years series C plus plus Horizontal bar Children of a Lesser Clod Retronym Yelena Davydova Martin Luther King, Jr. Figure skating Same-sex marriage in Canada Professional wrestling Dog agility Telephone tapping Anorexia nervosa Wedding Crashers Friends Ben Johnson (athlete) Gymnastics Midnight Run Malcolm in the Middle Mary, the mother of Jesus Friday E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
