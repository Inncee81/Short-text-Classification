for experienced gymnasts or coaches about a month ago i hurt my hand i went to the doctor they said to lay off it for awhile i start gymnastics team i made it august and i am going to fight the pain if it still hurts by then but what i wanted to know in your opinion do you think tumbling on a floor puts a lot more pressure on your hand than tumbling on a trampoline i know a trampoline is bouncy so when you tumble it isn't as hard but how much more pressure do you think it takes on your hand if you are comparing tamp with floor a lot or a little i am a pretty hard tumbler back handsprings doing tucks and stuff i know this question is a little confusing but if you do understand what i am asking your answer is appreciated thanks i think the floor will hurt a little more but they will both probably hurt a little bit if you start off doing just back tucks and front tucks and aerials then it won't hurt your hand since you are not putting it down try taking like some ibprofen before you go to gymnastics when you tumble your hands shouldn't be on the ground for that long anyway since you are blocking off the floor fast on most things i hope you understand what i mean i hope this helps congrats on making the team good luck have fun and do your best gymgirlexox Gymnastics Aerial (dance move) Diving 2000 Australian Grand Prix Carly Patterson Theory of conduct Cheerleading Trampolining Badminton Milton H.
