what sport my daughter is entering th grade this fall and we really want her to pick a sport she is short for her age about ' and is very flexible has been doing gymnastics for three years she is a bit of a scaredy cat about falling which is why we need her to choose another sport besides gymnastics and cannot swim which sport should she choose track soccer softball lacrosse tennis basketball ice skating swimming after learning of course etc we're not sure because she's a bit old to be learning an entirely different sport also she was wondering if joining mathletes would be social suicide she loves math but isn't sure yet if she wants to join now i will be biased because i am a tennis player myself but tennis is a great sport for a rising th grader she gets physical activity along with a bunch of fun it's definitely not too late to start either also her height will not affect her too much you meet bunches of new friends through the sport and you control what you do since it isn't a team sport and the equipment is not nearly as expensive as other sports you can easily get a lesson from a coach and start putting her in tournaments to get the ball rolling it's a very enjoyable sport that a rising th grade girl would appreciate and to add on to this tennis is an all year round sport that she can play anytime even if she wants to mix in other sports so i would give the thumbs up to tennis and to answer your second question mathletes would not be a smart decision if she wants to keep a high social status but it is never bad on a resume to say that you were a part of mathletes on any case you should let it be your daughter's decision on what to do she has a good of feel as anybody as to what to do with her life it's her life and therefore she should have the right to choose what she wants to do Sport Hunter College High School Education in the United States Syracuse University Orange Hopkins School Lacrosse Softball ELO rating system Physical education Texas Longhorn Athletics United States Air Force Academy Tennis University of Denver Sports in Puerto Rico Football (soccer) Playoff format Table tennis Roger Federer Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Four square Stuyvesant High School Fanny Blankers-Koen Volleyball The George Washington University Norway national football team Badminton Sports in Canada Friends Gustavo Kuerten Associated Press Athlete of the Year China at the 2004 Summer Olympics Tag Ice hockey Andre Agassi Cranford, New Jersey Raffles Institution Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics The Championships, Wimbledon Summer Olympic Games Parkour Minnesota Golden Gophers United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics University of Houston Paintball Georgia Institute of Technology Jumpstart 3rd Grade Great Teacher Onizuka Memorial High School (Hedwig Village, Texas) Big East Conference Indiana State University Golf Lottie Dod Diving Kender Computer and video game genres Water polo Aerial (dance move) Bowdoin College Punahou School Hamilton College Pitaten Sport in the United Kingdom W.I.T.C.H.
