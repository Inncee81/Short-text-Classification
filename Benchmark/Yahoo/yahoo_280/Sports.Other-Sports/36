do you think that the mlb rally cares if barry used steriods first of all i would like to congragulate barry on breaking the record however unlike most people i don't think he's used steriodsguilty in the court of public opinion but inocent in the court of law and if he has i don't care but my question is does anyone think bud and the mlb offices care if he used steriods he's making them money and putting them in the spotlight with an almost feel good story and those who don't like talk about and debate about it don't they p s i am a baseball fan have been for all my life i am not some ingnorant person who is here to beat up on barry bonds i'm not a fan of the giants but think what barry has done is amazing doubt the mlb really gives a shit they will just complain about it and make a public stand to improve their image but really who cares about a guy roiding to hit a ball out of the park i don't see the big deal its not like baseball is a combat sport or anything Major League Baseball television contracts Baseball World Series Major League Baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Babe Ruth MLB on FOX Negro league baseball Pete Rose New York Yankees Andr__s Galarraga History of baseball in the United States Detroit Tigers Boston Red Sox Home run St. Louis Cardinals Pittsburgh Pirates 2005 World Series Mois__s Alou October 20 in baseball Ty Cobb Chicago Cubs Tommy Lasorda Mark McGwire Jos__ Canseco Willie Mays Washington Nationals Baseball (object) Baseball Stars Hubert H.
