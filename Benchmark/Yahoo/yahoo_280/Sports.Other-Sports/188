martial arts mixed with gymnastics where could i learn that like martial arts with a bunch of flips and handsprings and jumping and lying kicks and stuff weapon training too targets sticks swords etc the flips would be useful to avoiding a punch and stuff i don't think wu shu looks very effective in real life situations though is shaolin kun fu effective in real life all martial arts incorporate aspects of gymnastics in them however the martial arts you see in movies is not real at all i've watched three different documentaries where the martial artist technical advisers talked and demo'd true moves and then how they had to radically change them so that they looked good for the camera they showed how the fancy moves flying kicks somersaults etc would never be used in actual combat and how a real artist would literally chop up anyone foolish enough to use them to show off real martial arts is done quickly fight's over in a couple seconds and it's usually so fast you don't even see the moves just hear the sound of broken bones i'd say go with tae kwon do personally i think it's probably the most 'western' friendly Martial art Mixed martial arts Chinese martial arts Aerial (dance move) Wushu Aikido Tai Chi Chuan Wing Chun Karate Eagle Claw Eskrima Shaolin (martial arts) Professional wrestling attacks Kata (martial arts) Jeet Kune Do Sport Jet Li Muay Thai Hapkido Unreal Kung Fu Hustle Double Dragon Skateboarding trick Gymnastics Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Society for Creative Anachronism Tekken characters Kick The McGuire Sisters Bruce Lee Professional wrestling aerial techniques First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Choy Lee Fut Lightsaber combat Fighting game Nunchaku Ninja Tricking Capoeira Xingyiquan Judo Punch (strike) Kung fu Savate Akuma (Street Fighter) Liu Kang (Mortal Kombat) Vovinam Goju Ryu Equilibrium (2002 film) Ranma __ characters GunZ The Duel Zen Kalarippayattu Limit Break The Inside Girls Aloud Antonio Inoki Weapon Bubble Bobble True Crime: Streets of LA Ultraman Leo Super Mario 64 Three Stooges Mortal Kombat Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Tenshinhan Piccolo Junior Saga Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) B-47 Stratojet Shang Tsung Hip hop culture The Ashlee Simpson Show Lightsaber Kenpo Blood (computer game) Korean martial arts Xiaolin Showdown Bas Rutten Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Empire Burlesque Fist of the North Star Yelena Davydova Strike (attack) Carly Patterson Shen Gong Wu Johnny Cage Shaggy dog story Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Blonde on Blonde Buddy Guy Northern Shaolin (martial art)
