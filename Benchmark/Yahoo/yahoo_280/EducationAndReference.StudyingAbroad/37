yo i wanna behave this year in skool how do u think thatta happen i get the feeling that you normally have not behaved in school the way your parents or teachers wanted you to your goal is admirable these are some hints you are breaking a bad habit which means you might have days that you fail a bit and go back to your old behaviors if that happens start again one failure one day to meet your goal is not constant failure its only one day take it one day at a time do not look at is as all year first day of school you tell yourself i am going to behave today get through one day then another etc keep a log so you can tell what days were good and what days you messed up you will find you were good more often than you thought if you do mess up write down what caused it this is the tough one if your friends are the cause of you misbehaving stay away from them in school but hang with them after school if a best friend is causing the problem go to your guidance counselor and ask to be put in a different class until you clean up your act if its possible they will do that because they dont want you to misbehave you never have to tell your friend you asked to be moved reward yourself for reaching small goals too often we wait until we are done that is too long tell yourself at the end of each day you have behaved you will do a little something for yourself that you like at the end of each five days you behave make the treat a bit bigger and at the end of a month make it even better your parents might actually help you with this good luck Social rule Kodocha 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pitaten The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Nicomachean Ethics Debugging The Ashlee Simpson Show The Adventures of Pete & Pete Dog training Friends The Catcher in the Rye Shaggy dog story Springfield Elementary School Theory of conduct The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Piccolo Junior Saga Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) W.I.T.C.H.
