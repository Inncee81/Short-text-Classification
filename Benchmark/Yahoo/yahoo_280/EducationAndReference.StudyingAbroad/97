i really want to study abroad whereas some cities correlate with certain careers ie chicago graphic design l a film and digital media are there any cities overseas that are worth traveling to for a student interested in journalism my school send pre med students to maastrict and english majors to europe what about us journalists is there anywhere for us to study the thing about journalism is that you need to know a little about a lot of subjects the actual craft of writing news reporting isn't that tough as long as you have a broad view of the world i'd suggest studying in a city you've always wanted to go to with a culture that interests you if you want to travel and you should as a journalist go to europe and buy a train pass and explore as much of the eu as you can or go somewhere completely unfamiliar like china what you do while living there is more important than the classes you take when you're doing study abroad the most important thing is to take in the culture and talk to as many people who live there as you can don't spend all your time hanging out with the other us students and don't go to london that place is a hole Graduate school Biodiversity Antarctic Treaty System Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape Professor Ragnarok Online Education in Australia Doctor of Philosophy Antiviral drug Australian National University Futures Studies Johns Hopkins University Terran (StarCraft) Electrical engineering Alabama (band) National Science Foundation Jane Goodall The Isley Brothers Genetically modified food University of California, Santa Barbara Aquaculture Middle East Technical University Seattle Mariners Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research University of Cape Town Tina Turner Juris Doctor Asia University of Maryland Baltimore County Master's degree Species Genetic engineering Nurse National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Peer review HIV UIUC College of Engineering Singles Collection: The London Years United States Merchant Marine Academy University of Connecticut Linus Pauling Animal testing Z__oty Open access Cornell University AIDS in Africa Athabasca University Organ transplant Mars Domestication of the horse The Citadel (Military College) Doctorate Education in Germany University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Biology Chimpanzee Johns Hopkins Hospital Schutzhund Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area Rice AIDS reappraisal Doom (film) University of Ottawa Fermi paradox The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Charles Fort Malaria Stanford University Political science Korea University Duke University Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong The Wild Wild West Mae Jemison Cetacean intelligence Amateur radio Statistical survey Who Shot Mr. Burns?
