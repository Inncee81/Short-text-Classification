please suggest me some techniques to develop focus and balancing in preschool children also how to develop hand muscle for coloring and writing the best ways to do that for focus and balancing you can play some fun movement games such as 'musical statues' they have to focus on the music then be able to 'freeze' when the music stops you can incorporate balancing by giving them the pose they have to make when the music stops the above answer from leslie is also very good start with two masking tape lines on the floor not too far apart and the child has to walk between them then go to one masking tape line which the child walks along then to a low wide balance beam then a low narrower one then you can make it a higher wide balance beam then a higher narrow balance beam etc as far as developing hand muscle control you have to look at the 'whole child' they need to develop larger arm muscle control first so activities such as throwing balls dancing with scarves moving their arms in prewriting patterns in the air roller painting at an easel etc then move onto developing muscle control in the hands lots of manipulation with playdough squirting water spray bottles squeezing water from sponges etc then they need to be able to do isolated finger movements lots of fingerplays at group time ie where is thumbkin cutting with scissors picking up small objects using a pincer grasp squeezing pegs etc etc i have oodles of activities specifically designed to assist pre writing motor skill development in particular so if you would like more ideas please feel free to email me Volleyball Aikido Professional wrestling holds Quake III Arena Drawing Swingout Glossary of partner dance terms Weight training Fast bowling Tag Equine conformation Paintball Textile manufacturing Diving Stage lighting Strap-on dildo Urinary incontinence Music Anchor Bass guitar Naruto jutsu Bicycle lighting BEAM robotics Menstrual cup Double bass Proprioception Harp Asperger syndrome Stuttering Professional wrestling throws Floppy disk Milton H.
