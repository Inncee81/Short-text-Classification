texas hold'em tournament ruling so i was in a heads up hand and the river card gave me a straight and the winning hand without the river card i would have lost the other guy caught a of a kind on the river there was talk around the table you know normal stuff he got a straight it beats a of a kind then i rake in the chips while i am raking a good minute goes by and someone says that the river didn't have a burn card the guy that says this is holding the stack of muck is the host and his father is the one i am in the hand against so they then proceed without any research to burn the card that helped me to burn the river card and put out another river what is the proper way to handle this in las vegas if it has been prov en that a card had not been burned by the surveillance dept then the card that was the river would become the burn and another card will be dealt as the river Poker jargon Texas hold 'em Draw poker Blackjack Card game Community card poker Pai gow poker Poker tournament Professional wrestling match types Poker Cheating in poker Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game President (game) Hand (poker) Mahjong Big Two Draw (poker) Contract bridge Omaha hold 'em Aerial (dance move) Wheel of Fortune Skat World Series of Poker Stud poker Craps Card Sharks Egyptian Ratscrew Cleveland Browns Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
