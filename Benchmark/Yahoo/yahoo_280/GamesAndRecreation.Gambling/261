question about being the big stack i've been having this problem lately my bankroll take a major hit so i've been playing mainly freerolls i have no trouble dodging maniacs and then catching them off guard when i have premium hands and doubling up and then using my prescence to intimidate the weaker players and thus building a huge stack in the early and middle stages of a tournament however these tournaments i enter have anywhere between and people and only or so actually get anything when it comes to crunch time the last few hundred people or so i falter and i see my stack slowly start to dwindle away i'm not a table bully i just play my game adjusting only to put pressure on the smaller stacks but i don't loosen up much until antes come in then i may limp in with marginal hands and i don't feel it's my duty to take out smaller stakes so i don't take a lot of risks and yet i've gone out on the bubble pretty consistently any tips i have played in thousands of tournaments anywhere from casinos to online to freerolls online to free bar poker leagues to friendly house games i have made final table or have won at least of the time you have to turn into more of that table bully that you say you are not and get more aggressive with your betting and preflop play you would be surprised how many people are like you and just try to limp into a pot to see a flop even in the late stages of tournaments if you are going to enter into any pots this late in the game you need to be raising and times the big blind make it a rule in mid to late position mix up the position and dont always raise you will get callers here or there so sit out some rounds to at least win back your blinds or antes in that round my favorite raises come right before the dealer dealer small and big blinds i seem to pick up more pots and feel more comfortable raising here you dont need to have a premium hand but try to be either suited with a king or ace or have connecters preferably suited at least your main goal is to steal the blinds and antes without going to showdown you must bet well if you get a caller and see the flop if the board doesnt look like one that someone with a premium hand hit you need to follow up your preflop bet with a pot sized bet even if you didnt hit the flop and if out of position to them and they bet first get some guts and reraise them but not putting your tournament life at stake times out of ten they will fold the other times they will call or reraise and you dont bet after or get out here unless you have a good amount of outs the other times that you take down those pots without a showdown will pay for the oops hands that you get caught on and then some the people that tighten up and dont raise preflop are the ones that go out on the bubble or just make the final table with some luck the people that are aggressive and raise like i said earlier are the ones that win or come very close to it Craps Community card poker Stud poker Cheating in poker Blackjack Omaha hold 'em Baccarat Seven-card stud Online poker Gambling Contract bridge Snooker Sandbagging (poker) Five-card draw Sheepshead Draw (poker) Backgammon Volleyball Bluff (poker) Pai gow poker Game show Caribbean stud poker World Series of Poker Poker strategy Baseball $ale of the Century Norway national football team World Series Pittsburgh Steelers Slot machine Winning Streak Sports betting Softball Tournament American football strategy President (game) Skat Wheel of Fortune Roulette Magic: The Gathering New York Giants Dominoes Hand (poker) Euchre Hearts (game) Peter Shilton Ra (board game) Cello Ravi Shastri Violin Pete Rose Spades Video poker Bryan Robson Computer and video games Table tennis Tag Textile manufacturing Tilt (poker) NBA Finals Tenshinhan Chess terminology Yao Ming 2005 English cricket season Hollywood Squares Detroit Tigers Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament Stu Ungar Cribbage Tennis Social rule Pete Sampras Guilty Gear Pinball Bad beat 500 (card game) ELO rating system High card by suit (poker) FA Cup Playing card
