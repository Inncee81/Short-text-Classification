casino blackjack is there a statistical reason for winning at a deck shoe and losing at an deck shoe my husband is a black jack dealer in the th largest casino in the world but he finds that when he is required to use decks instead of hardly anyone wins why is this why the difference it's driving him nuts not knowing from looking at the other answers you the hubby aren't the only ones who know nothing about this subject here's the correct answer please ignore all others to keep your i q level from dropping for each deck added to a shoe the house garners a slight advantage about for several reasons first there's an increased probability of larger chunks of low value cards occurring together in the deck making book assumptions of a value card coming out of the shoe next and a value card being in the hole less accurate adding decks also makes it increasingly difficult for players to determine the true count of the cards the count and the true count are different if you have decks in the shoe and the count is after two decks have been dealt the true count is only divided by the number of decks remaining in the shoe decks if the same occurred on an deck shoe the true count would only be so even if you have a player with the remarkable ability to accurately run the count on a shoe and here's the biggest reason for all of this the more decks you have the more count stable the shoe is and the harder it is for the players to have a positive enough true count on the shoe to realize any advantage whether they're keeping track of the count or not of course the deeper into the shoe you go the less this is realized and the more accurate the count would become but the counting player would have to accurately count several decks of cards down over a long time without messing up to determine if he might be at an advantage for the last couple of hands of the shoe not an easy task doesn't matter much though the stability of the count regardless of if someone is counting is the reason deck shoes are tougher to beat than deck shoes which are tougher to beat than double deck games more decks less drastic count swings and with an even count the house is always at an advantage because the dealer goes last Poker jargon Craps Draw poker Cheating in poker Baccarat Contract bridge Monty Hall problem Skat Betting (poker) Pai gow poker Texas hold 'em Stud poker Card game Canasta Volleyball ELO rating system Suit (cards) Card counting Sheepshead Cribbage Redundant array of independent disks Gambling Online poker Playing card Randomness Dominoes Spades Egyptian Ratscrew Dice Baseball Hearts (game) Fischer Random Chess Card Sharks Piquet Poker Five-card draw Mao (game) Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Prisoner's dilemma Shuffle Ra (board game) Doomsday argument Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Omaha hold 'em Floppy disk Violin Determinism Star Trek Customizable Card Game Tarot (game) Fast bowling Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Gin rummy Badminton Microeconomics Golf Yu-Gi-Oh!
