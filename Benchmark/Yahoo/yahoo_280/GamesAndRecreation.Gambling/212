what makes a winner what makes a winner winner is a personality type an attitude a state of mind it's also an image that other people read and respond to a winner will always get a date make money and yes beat the casino to be a winner you have to think and act like one here's a quick guide how to transform into a real hardcore winner how many times have you seen this scene in a casino you're sitting in the corner of your blackjack table having an even game and the beauty in the opposite table won't give you the time of day up till now everyone around you are pretty much the same and then in he comes throwing his jacket in a swift smooth motion sitting in the center of the hottest table with a glass of fine scotch the hostess served him on the house and then he starts winning and then the beauty you've been mooning over starts making eyes at him he's not a better player than you he's not better looking he's not richer and he's not smarter but he got the winner's aura and that makes a world of difference the good news is that everyone can transform into a winner the not so great news is that to be a winner you have to work hard if you're ready to make that transformation here is valuable advice you should take to heart mental work think like a winner i know that sounds trivial but this is the foundation of anything to follow our consciousness and perspective determines who we are how other see us and consequently how we live from the day we are born we are embedded with rock hard behavior patterns that don't always work for our benefit parents teachers and others teach us to be good but that usually means disciplined quiet and passive we are reared to obey people that aren't that smarter than us yes i'm talking about your boss and keep our feelings and instincts to ourselves the bottom line is we are told to accept reality according to norms and act by them well the first thing about being a winner is to defy what was presented to us as obvious and objective and the place society seems to allocate for you no more taking orders for granted from now on you determine your goals and wills i'm not saying beat up your boss but even when you are doing what you have to when you don't want to do it your own way think james bond he always accomplishes the mission m lays down on him but he stays wild while doing it how to start the change simply picture yourselves as winners take a scenario with a winner who you consider an ideal type and plant yourself in the picture imagine yourselves in all kind of scenes and then create scripts of the 'winnerish' way to handle them how it works well our thoughts these intangible abstract shadows can change matter both our thoughts and the matter we are made of are created of the same tiny units called quantum there's a great movie about it called what the bleep do we know i recommend minutes of winner thinking every morning as soon as you wake up and an extra at night you can take another one focusing on casino wins for advanced training look up nlp talk like a winner when you're talking about yourself think big and focus on a positive message when a winner tells a story or describes a situations he always positions himself as the center of the plot i saw winners who worked in the mail room that could carry a story about themselves that would made senior executives feel small think of it this way if your life were a movie would you settle for a supportive role when you should be the lead keep your speech interesting do not be monotonous in tone or content because that's just boring be a little dramatic when you talk about yourself but never push it or you'll lose your credibility act like a winner this is the other end of the previous tip when it comes to losing no explanations no apologies and above all no temper tantrums a sore loser is an ugly sight don't try to explain why you lost the game don't get all apologetic about the money you lost you can figure all that out privately in public be as gracious as a prince you can always compensate for this in your next win by sharing your wisdom in those stories we talked about before Poker jargon Milton H.
