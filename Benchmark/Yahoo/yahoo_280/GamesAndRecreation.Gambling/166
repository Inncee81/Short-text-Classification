can you call a bet in a nl holdem cash game wiht a small pp lets say you have in mp you raise it to twelve times the bb he reraises you to thirty six on the button he has a huge bet range do you call or fold effective stacks are bb would it change if effective stacks were bb would it change if he was on the bb sabes actaully if he has a wider range of reraising preflop i dont see how you can call lets say flop comes out a theres a huge chance he doesnt actually have the ace and you wont stand to win a lot of money on the other hand if he has a smaller range and the flop comes out a you can put him on the ace and bet accordingly why would someone with a large range be not scared of an ace and if you dont lead out and bet you dont know whether he hit or is just c betting are you just going to check call all the way to the river o yea another point how does your oppenent holding jj get you to be paid off okay you say checkraise which most times will be a bluff this cost alot of money and many times he will actually have something lets say he has at least a j with at least a higher kicker than yours which is going to happen of the time are you going to check raise with all these overcards that he may have hit if you're right you win a decent pot but if your check raise gets called you're going to lose alot of money because check raise bluffs to be effective have to be at least the size of the orignal bet and are usally it's not generally called a bet in a no limit game that's more of a limit term you raise to three times the big blind which is a fairly standard raise in most games another player re raises you three times your raise to so now you have to put in more to see a flop the problem is what can you beat he clearly likes his hand or is completely bluffing but even against a bluff there is a pretty good chance he has two over cards to your hand he could have j or q or something equally unimpressive but even with such a mediocre hand you win just of the time so the problem with calling here is that against most over cards and it is unlikely that he doesn't have over cards to you are in a coin flip if he has a pair of sixes or better you are a substantial dog against you are only going to flop a set one in times if you miss the flop a face card comes on the flop and he bets into you what then a stubborn call do you really want to call off the rest of your stack in the hopes he is being overly aggressive with ak and doesn't hit as nice as a pocket pair looks especially after a run of bad cards a low pocket pair like this is rarely any good against this kind of action unless you have a powerful read on this player you probably want to release your hand and move on to the next it certainly doesn't seem like you are in a favorable spot here Omaha hold 'em Blackjack Bluff (poker) Poker Slot machine Stud poker Cheating in poker Community card poker Craps Pai gow poker Sandbagging (poker) Sheepshead Cribbage Draw (poker) Baccarat Gambling President (game) Hand (poker) Egyptian Ratscrew Monty Hall problem Dice Paintball Bad beat Ra (board game) Game show Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Skat Sports betting Seven-card stud Maverick (film) Let's Make a Deal Aerial (dance move) Video poker Piquet $ale of the Century Dominoes Online poker Credit card Norway national football team Hearts (game) Five-card stud Wheel of Fortune English cricket team Caribbean stud poker Volleyball GunZ The Duel Pai Gow Pittsburgh Steelers Card Sharks Contract bridge Winning Streak Equine conformation Star Trek Customizable Card Game Collision detection Coin flipping Extreme Programming Magic: The Gathering Playing card Roulette The Amazing Race Monopoly (game) Three card monte CPU design 1919 World Series Mahjong GunBound Octopus card Gramophone record Microeconomics National Football League Floppy disk Yu-Gi-Oh!
