anybody know of any games or bets that you can't lose i like bar bets or games that can't be lost if you know the secret of course thanks sure real estate specifically buy in neighborhoods being bought up by gay men seriously most have an obsession with detail and a few gays can often increase property values for an entire neighborhood in very short order regarding bar games here you go this is my favorite and the chicks love it claim that you're an accomplished meta physicist you're able to sense others' auroras through certain media copper in particular set up nine pennies on the bar in a x square grid select an attractive girl even better if she's hanging out with other female friends to touch one of the pennies while you're away outside in the bathroom or wherever you'll be able to sense her aurora through the copper of whichever penny she touches step away let her touch a penny then come back to the bar hold your hand an inch or so above the pennies eyes closed and slowly move your hand over the grid open your eyes and touch the same penny she selected this works every time and so long as you don't give away your secret you'll probably get her number every time the secret your friend who remains at the bar and witnesses which penny she touches positions his cocktail on his square coaster or cocktail napkin in the same location as the penny in the grid for example if she touches the upper left penny your friend places his drink on the upper left portion of his cocktail napkin a quick unseen glance at his drink tells you which penny she touched you can even go a step farther with this if she touches more than one penny which she'll inevitably do on about the third try your friend's drink will be in the location of the first penny she selected after noting where his drink is however he picks it up takes a sip and places it in the position corresponding to the second penny she touched not only will you blow her away by telling her she obviously touched more than one penny but you'll be able to say which pennies and in which order she touched get even fancier by telling her to try again by touching the penny with a non conductive object like a pencil you'll still sense her aurora if she touches all of the pennies your friend might simply pick up his glass and cocktail napkin in the same hand take a sip but not set the glass down you can come up with a whole list of contingencies to include multiple girls touching a penny no one touching any at all or perhaps a signal to let you know your friend didn't see for certain which if any penny she touched quit while you're ahead though eventually someone will figure out your friend is in on the gig even they won't know how exactly and remember don't tell your secret Friends Craps Fischer Random Chess Sudoku Sin City Avenue Q Tag Swingout Cellular automaton Knots Landing Blackjack Social rule Chess terminology Menstrual cup Glossary of partner dance terms Gambling Professional wrestling match types EastEnders Tai shogi Rugby union Dominoes Columbine High School massacre Softball Mao (game) Married... with Children Slot machine Dead Like Me Theory of conduct Dai dai shogi National Football League My Name Is Earl Shaggy dog story Volleyball Tenjiku shogi Human sexual behavior Jon Secada Aerial (dance move) Humphrey Bogart Death Note Draw poker Surreal number Good Times The Shining (film) YuYu Hakusho Baseball Baroque chess Pinball Gay slang The Critic Syberia Chu shogi Action potential Blood on the Tracks The Wotch Kodocha Denis Law Monopoly (game) Complex number British coinage Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Daredevil Glass Water polo Skateboarding trick Japanese tea ceremony Glossary of American football Colony in Space Cannon shogi St. Elmo's Fire (film) RuneScape quests Combat Mission (computer game series) Phoebe Halliwell Laws of cricket Dai shogi Good Morning, Vietnam Moe Szyslak Confidence trick The Lovely Bones Penny Arcade (comic) Textile manufacturing Mouse (computing) Hall & Oates Sex and the City Ron and Fez Computer and video games Manifold Burial Touch football (rugby league) Big Brother (USA TV series) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
