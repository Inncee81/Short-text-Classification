i reported abuse and i am wondering if they will take action on myspace there are some very awful awful videos posted by some looney that i came across when i was just looking through videos the videos are showing our soldiers being tortured killed etc being that he posted these isn't that innapropriate i have done it times now because i just can't believe that is allowed on there i know we have freedoms but this idiot is no journalist i mean something has to be done it is so disgraceful to our soldiers and their families of those who have lost them it just make me sick so my is will they let his profile stay that way and will they leave those videos on there even with our freedoms they still have their own rules so they should do something right that definitely sounds like a violation however the myspace team usually runs automated programs to replace their human moderators and so they may have programmed the site to only send them videos to review only if they have been flagged a certain number of times by a number of different users personally i find them to be very unreliable they take days to respond to your emails and often times they dont reply at all my best advice is not to fixate on that video try to forget about it and it'll eventually be deleted after a matter of time they don't usually last that long anyways because responsible users like you are quick to report em good for you Something Awful Forums Stopping e-mail abuse Something Awful Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act RuneScape cheats MySpace E-mail Cindy Sheehan E-mail spam Internet troll IBM PC compatible Computer Beavis and Butt-head Internet Relay Chat Amnesty International Democratic Underground The Best Page in the Universe Fark.com GameFAQs message boards Computer virus Gmail GameFAQs Neopets John Lott Utilitarianism Guantanamo Bay Yusuf al-Qaradawi Forum moderator Slashdot subculture Unlawful combatant Independent Media Center Internet forum Theory of conduct TV Tome 2channel Mafia (game) Xanga Ajax (programming) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Colbert Report The Amber Spyglass Password Expert system Wikipedia Rachel Corrie Monday Night Football International Freedom of Expression Exchange Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Netfilter/iptables Slashdot trolling phenomena John Kerry military service controversy Aladdin (1992 film) LiveJournal Social software Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Pretty Good Privacy Ex-gay Spam Prevention Early Warning System Swift Vets and POWs for Truth Orkut Make money fast Weezer Kenneth Bigley Uses of torture in recent times Blog War on Terrorism Phishing Search engine optimization Computer and video games Girls Aloud Karl Rove DeviantART Scientology versus The Internet Spam (electronic) Terri Schiavo Downing Street memo Mouse (computing) Pat Tillman U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Have I Got News For You KMFDM Public domain America Online Cross site scripting Oil-for-Food Programme OpenDocument 2003 Invasion of Iraq Ann Coulter Podcasting Debugging Internet phenomenon Extreme Programming Tag Slashdot Camp Delta 2004 Republican National Convention Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
