when you block someone on myspace do they know their messages are blocked we blocked our sons obsessed ex girlfriend from our my space she told our son her mother wrote us using her account will she get a notice that the message is blocked or will she just think we got it we didn't get it since it was blocked i was just hoping she would know that we didn't get it so she would get the hint to leave us and our son alone no they don't get a message saying their blocked they can tell if they check they sent messages because the letters she sent him wont be there and if she request him as a friend it won't show up so thats when she will know she been blocked please be careful though because she can easily create a fake profile it's happened to me before MySpace Friends Knots Landing Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Days of our Lives Advance fee fraud CPU cache AOL Instant Messenger Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Critic Pitaten Gmail Transposition cipher C programming language Stan (song) George Costanza Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Marilyn Monroe Social rule The O.C.
