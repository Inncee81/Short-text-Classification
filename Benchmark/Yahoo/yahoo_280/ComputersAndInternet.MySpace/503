i can't change my layout for some reason when you change your myspace layout you enter the new code into the about me section right that's what i always do and that's what it tells me to do after that it tells me to type in the security code displayed in the box you know the weird looking numbers and letters just for security purposes but now when it gets to the security part a little red x appears in the box so it doesn't show the security code so i'm stuck with the same layout and i can't change it to anything the capatcha thing is down right now try back later and it should work Unicode ZIP Code MySpace Keyboard layout Cangjie method New York City Subway nomenclature Characters of Lost Extreme Programming Linux kernel HTML element System/34 Cascading Style Sheets C plus plus Cross site scripting Postcode QWERTY Missingno.
