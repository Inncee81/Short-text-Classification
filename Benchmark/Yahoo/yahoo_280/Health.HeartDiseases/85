what can i expect after difibrilation from an icd i just got a shock this weekend while i was on vacation i have been feeling a little bit weird ever since i just wanted to know if it is normal to feel an abnormal rythm afterward i haven't felt the same ever since if you have gotten shocked what are the possiblities that i could get shocked again is being shocked once mean you are going to be shocked again i just need to know i've been shocked times it's a traumatic experience and that may have some impact on how you feel i only felt odd after the shock for the remainder of the day i took it very easy being shocked once does not have a bearing on being shocked again it goes off when your rhythm is out however if you are having a problem it may be subject to firing if you meet the criteria call your cardiologist and inform him of the firing right away he will most likely want to do a download to see what happened it will also record any non sustained events they take it seriously meanwhile don't play with light sockets Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Post-traumatic stress disorder Anorexia nervosa Grief Equine conformation Cardiac arrhythmia Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Milton H.
