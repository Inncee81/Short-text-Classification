what does this mean in dumb terms basically i have a heart condition and im and the doctor told me i have bicuspid aortic valve disease and when i asked him what is that he ignored me ive tried looking on the internet and found only smart things pretty much can anyone explain to me what it is what can happen to me and am i likey to have a heart attack hi and only the first thing you should know is that a bicuspid aortic valve is the most common form of congenital heart defect affecting up to of the population there is also a genetic component of patients with bicuspid aortic valves have other family members with the same thing thus we generally recommend that first degree relatives of people with bicuspid aortic valves get screening echocardiograms normally the aortic valve is made up of three separate leaflets that form what looks like a mercedes benz symbol when they come together in a bicuspid aortic valve there is incomplete separation of two of the three leaflets hence the term bicuspid or two leaflets the problem is that these abnormal valves have a tendency to become calcified and fibrotic hard and thickened over time unfortunately the fact is that most patients with bicuspid aortic valves will require surgery during their lifetime for some with more deformed valves intervention is required in childhood or adulthood however the majority have relatively normal valve function and remain undiagnosed until late in adulthood when the valve becomes stiff it is impossible to predict when you will need surgery to replace your valve but the most important thing is to follow up with your cardiologist on a regular basis you need to know that a cardiologist will need to monitor you with echocardiograms because patients with bicuspid aortic valve are not only at risk for developing a stiff aortic valve but can develop a severely leaky aortic valve an enlarged aorta and even dissection in the worst cases the decision to take you to surgery is not based on symptoms alone although those are definitely important as well your doctor will watch the gradient across the valve the amount of valve leakiness and the size of your aorta if the valve is very leaky and your heart function is starting to suffer surgery is generally recommended if the aortic root is getting bigger to the point where there is a risk of aortic dissection surgery is generally recommended if the gradient becomes severe we consider this to be a mean gradient of mmhg or more and you have symptoms sugery is generally recommended the question of whether to recommend surgery in an asymptomatic patient with severe aortic stenosis is more controversial and should be discussed with your cardiologist don't worry though as long as you keep seeing a cardiologist who understands bicuspid aortic disease you should be ok surgery is very safe these days and you can generally expect a long and healthy life even after having your valve replaced hope that helps good luck Prostate cancer Myocardial infarction Heart sounds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atherosclerosis Heart Cancer Multiple sclerosis Cephalic disorder Sickle-cell disease Androgen insensitivity syndrome Intersex surgery Medicine Atheroma Bipolar disorder Mitral valve prolapse Folic acid Cardiovascular disease Diabetes mellitus Aneurysm Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Blood pressure Osteoarthritis Heyde's syndrome Pneumonia Cerebral palsy Chronic fatigue syndrome Von Willebrand disease Syringomyelia Crohn's disease Coeliac disease History of intersex surgery Endocarditis Anorexia nervosa Stomach cancer Aorta Anemia Colorectal cancer Cystic fibrosis Cardiac stress test Computed tomography Adult attention-deficit disorder Ulcerative colitis Autism Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Polycystic kidney disease Coronary heart disease Coronary catheterization Malaria Lupus erythematosus Magnetic resonance imaging Cardiothoracic surgery Dialysis Asthma Physical examination Tuberous sclerosis Noonan syndrome Cytomegalovirus Syphilis Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Sex assignment Mesothelioma Congenital disorder Growth hormone deficiency Transsexuality Angioplasty Breast cancer Psoriasis Rheumatoid arthritis Shock Infantilism Haemochromatosis Parkinson's disease Clinical depression Epilepsy
