and lots of 'strange' colors are used to make themselves look 'unique bandana in hair bows are popular heavy make up usually around the eyes sparkles are quite common fake moles have been spotted tries to pull of vintage look usually really hot but we haven't seen them with out make up so this is questionable dates only scene boys typical scene boy long bangs usually covering eyes usually black or different colors such as orange red blue purple ect make up usually centered around the eyes eye shadow black usually pink or purple tight pants extremely tight band shirt sometimes a too tight jacket usually damn sexy however they do tend to be full of themselves and unfriendly to anyone they deem unworthy or not in the scene dates scene chicks however may branch out to preps both sexes myspace over friends girl pants thinks they're not conformist may or may not be straight edge vegan scene kids usually go to local shows have extremly tight groups they may be there for the music but usually they are there for the social time scene kids are usually very picky about who they talk to and associate with if they deem you cool they may go up to you and talk to you and act as if they've known you for years go to shows after all that's where the scene is any artistic movement has a scene and that's why they're called scene kids live for shows but not all scene kids go to shows some just mosh in front of school keep up with the up and coming bands by doing your research be friends with all the local bands and brag about it it's very very important to know your music history i e norma jean if you're not able to carry on a deep conversation about lyrics style and or band mates you will be rejected when not at a show listen to your music all the time get the attitude you don't have to be vain and slightly arrogant but you must be social yet slightly socially withdrawn be very polite to people of all ages shapes ethnicities religions etc after all that's why most people look up to scenesters think that you are absolutely without a doubt the most gorgeous person on the face of the planet this is something you will have to work extra hard on if you have low self confidence practice this around other friends compliment yourself often when you do encounter your first scene friend be sure to appear overly confident in everything you do compliment others sparingly but thoughtfully remember people care about people who care about themselves become active on myspace post a plethora of pictures of yourself and shows you've been to add as many friends as you can including random scene kids and check out what they are listening to download every song ever by that band and research the band's bio other sites like purevolume and livejournal have an abundance of hardcore kids as well get hair that isn't curly you can also have different colors in your hair but it's not a must the weirder it is the more scene think 's metal hair trimmed up with all the sophistication of today it doesn't matter if you're a boy and your hair is longer it doesn't matter if you're a girl with shorter hair what matters is your ability to pull it off with confidence also you can't go wrong with getting it stacked or layered the idea is to look androgynous with your hair spike it up in the back and straighten the sides you can also straighten the bottom and mess up the top layers of your hair or you can grow out your bangs and have them over your eyes if your hair is curly get a chi straigtener and heat protecting sprays also get a well holding hairspray for humid days wear eyeliner whether you're male or female not emo eyepaint if you know how to apply eyeliner do it yourself but if you are a novice girl or guy let someone that knows how to apply makeup do it for you males have a tendency to put a little too much makeup on their faces while girls can wear as much or as little as they please wear tight skinny pencil jeans or straight leg jeans not flares bootcuts or baggy jeans while the tighter the better find a decent fit for you because no one will talk to you if you look like a fashion victim girls are recommended to have tight form fitting jeans in a vintage or dark wash girls can also wear jean skirts or black stretch skirts as long as a decent pair of leggings are worn beneath remember you can never go wrong with a pair of solid black leggings guys should find a decent fitting pair of girl jeans or somewhat of a fitted straight leg jeans aswell the tighter the better but remember that the rest of us do not want to be able to see the vein in your thigh through your jeans and don't forget the belt preferably black pyramid belts white for females usually worn with the buckle to the side stock up on band shirts or graphic tees band shirts are uni sex if you've done your music research load up on classic band t shirts i e the ramones get the tightest fitting t shirt within reason look for shirts that have the vintage feel if you can actually find a vintage shirt more scene points anything with dinosaurs on it is automatically accepted shirts with foil prints on them are also in as are shirts with any of the following on them gun butterfly bird skull lightning bolt hello kitty etc get classic shoes shoes can make you or break you vans classics that are in all black or pretty much any color that matches you this is part of the standard uniform once you get those you can feel free to branch out to any style of vans you want old school adidas nikes or converse too beat up your shoes too the more beat up and dirtier they are the better for girls ballet flats and other formal low heeled shoes also boots of any kind are accepted accessorize if you're a girl invest in necklaces that have guns hearts keys butterflies skulls etc big wooden necklaces are a good alternative do not wear gloves or arm bands of any type the only ones that are acceptable are the fingerless wrist warmers with either the skull on the back or lace trim oversized sunglasses with thick black or white frames are acceptable and cat eye frames are another good choice hats can be worn with caution though you're better off without as it is important to show off one's glory the hair girls should wear plenty of bright colored hair barrettes clips ribbons and bows if you're a guy keep your keys dangling on the side with a carabiner attached to a belt loop every scene kid should own at least one bandana often black red and white and some neon colored ones either fold it into a flag to hang out of your back pocket in a band around the head or down around your neck guys can wear hats if they don't do much hair styling a flat brim new era cap is worn to summer shows with basketball shorts a knit beanie worn over a bandana during the winter hello kitty is a big deal with both scene girls and boys be a vegetarian or vegan whatever you prefer add unnecessary letters as you type for example rawwr kiiid
