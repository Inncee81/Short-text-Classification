teeth whitening could someone tell me how much it costs to get your teeth whitened and if it takes more then one visit thank you here is a ballpark cost range for what a dentist might charge for a single professional teeth whitening treatment in some cases more than one treatment might be needed to some dentists feel that their in office bleaching treatments should be followed up with the use of an at home whitener if so you can expect that there will be an additional cost for this additional treatment a patient's costs might lie at the lower end of the price range stated above in those instances where a significant portion of the treatment process is performed by a staff member rather than solely the dentist as another consideration those dentists who incorporate an activation light or laser into the whitening process will have higher equipment costs than those who don't these dentists will need to charge a relatively higher fee for their whitening treatments all whitening products contain peroxide either as carbamide peroxide cp or hydrogen peroxide hp peroxide dissolves the organic stains in the tooth to change the color and produce a whitened effect there are four types of peroxide containing tooth whitening products available in practice products are applied by a dental professional these products contain a high percentage of cp or hp and are applied directly to the teeth some activated by heat light or laser this may be the product for you if you're in a hurry for whiter teeth and you don't have tooth sensitivity for very dark colored teeth the whitening process can be sped up in two to three hours followed by a take home product until the desired whiteness is achieved a take home product supervised by a dentist is the most popular whitening method these products contain a lesser percentage of cp or hp than in practice products and are worn in a tray overnight or during the day at home a custom fitted tray is made to hold the whitening product directly against the teeth while lessening its contact with the gums some products have fluoride added to help prevent or treat mild tooth sensitivities the typical stains of ageing will whiten in seven to fourteen days when the tray is worn overnight over the counter otc whitening products contain a small percentage of hp or cp caution should be used with these products as many contain an acidic solution that can wear away tooth enamel otc products use a bulky one size fits all tray to hold the product usually more product is swallowed than stays in the tray because of the trays poor fit against the teeth it can take up to six months and the purchase of several kits to get whiter teeth flexible strips coated with whitening gel have recently been introduced as an otc at home tooth whitening method the strips are worn on the front teeth and folded over to keep them in place results are reported to be noticeable after fourteen days and effective for months over the counter whitening toothpastes contain a small percentage of hp cp or polishing ingredient the toothpastes are effective in keeping teeth cleaner and whiter looking but some may be very abrasive the harsh abrasive will wear away the enamel with repeated use gradually making the teeth look yellow whitening toothpastes remove surface stains and prevent new stains from building up whitening toothpastes however aren't in contact with the teeth long enough to remove internal stains ask your dentist about the safety and cavity protection of specific toothpastes before you buy you may wish to read a
