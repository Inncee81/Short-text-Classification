do i look different from what i see in the mirror in person i look pretty good in the mirror and i've been told quite a few times that but whenever i try to take pictures of myself i look so unlike me i don't like it at all every time i take a picture i look totally different then what i look like in the mirror i look all nice in the mirror but in pictures not all i look weird when people look at you person to person are they seeing the you that is seen from a camera or more like the you that is in the mirror i've took some pictures of people with a camera and noticed that most of the times they looked a lot better in person this sometimes ruins my self esteem because the camera makes me think i look that bad in real life i know exactly how you feel that is why i hate taking pictures and when you stay infront of the mirror for hours you turn and see which side or which way you should turn to take a good picture besides other people see what you see in the mirror not what comes out of the lens of a camera Taxi Driver Single-lens reflex camera Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Stereoscopy Mirror Xiaolin Showdown Photography Social rule Sampling (music) Narrator Marilyn Monroe Camera Current teachings of Prem Rawat Telescope Cinerama Cliff Richard Have I Got News For You Shen Gong Wu Autostereogram Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cinematography Image Reflecting telescope Late Night with Conan O'Brien Discordianism Digital photography Technicolor Canon T90 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Lauren Bacall Charmed Bat Lash Contax Pinhole camera 2000 Australian Grand Prix Apollo 12 Canon EOS Humphrey Bogart Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Street photography Macro photography Pure Pwnage Apollo 8 Sunglasses Paul Is Dead Tokusatsu Real Love (song) The Amazing Race Anamorphic widescreen Andy Kaufman Boom Town (Doctor Who) Panoramic photography View camera Gollum Photojournalism Spidey Super Stories The Shining (film) Movie camera Goatse.cx Shaggy dog story Video camera tube Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga Widescreen Digital single-lens reflex cameras The Parting of the Ways Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Leica Something Awful Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Aladdin (1992 film) Twin-lens reflex camera Parallax Konica Minolta Oh My Goddess!
