shaving question for girls sorry but i had to ask girls do you shave the hair on your upper thighs where it's a little peach fuzz i don't even know how to shave when i can't see the hairs at all ack i used to do it every day when i was a teenager then i learned that my husband can't tell that even my lower legs need to be shaved until long after the hair becomes so bad that i can't stand it the hair on the upper thigh is finer than on your lower legs and grows slower so you can get away with shaving it once every few months or never at all Puberty Pubic hair Hair Haircut Beard Professional wrestling throws Ron and Fez Equine conformation Shaving Skinhead Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kodocha 613 mitzvot Aerial (dance move) Double bass Professional wrestling holds Moustache Undergarment Depilation Razor Social role of hair Waxing Leg shaving Singlish Recess (TV series) Baldness Comanche TOKYOPOP Tyrannosaurus rex Anatomical terms of location Powerbomb Androgen insensitivity syndrome Biped Tonsure Joe Namath Prostate cancer Hijab Triathlon Glossary of ballet terms Teen Girl Squad Pseudofolliculitis barbae Tammy Wynette Trousers Mohawk hairstyle Mojave people Drug test Gwen Stefani Homestar Runner Sexual differentiation Kender Samson Madonna (entertainer) Tarantula Leaf Dreadlocks Bladderwort Punt (boat) Head shaving Tupac Shakur Payot Irish dance Dilbert Cello Terrorvision Violin Weight training Diving Hypertrichosis Barber Rapunzel Piledriver (professional wrestling) Joy (novel) Global Gillette Horse Secondary sex characteristic Squat (exercise) Mr. Olympia Megan Griffin Bad Girls (television series) Poodle Ham Black panther Leslie Cheung Fascial compartment Backstroke Keeshond Marilyn Monroe Ostrich Guinea pig DDT (professional wrestling) Stocking Professional wrestling attacks Mark Jindrak Gabber music Headbanging Paul Is Dead Breaststroke Hip fracture History of subcultures in the 20th century Smallville (Season 3)
