how can i move my acrilic nails without it hurting too much first off baby oil isnt gonna do anything i wouldnt suggest that you pry them off cause that will hurt and cause damage to your natural nail if you refuse to back to a salon to have them soaked off then you are in for a long process you need to get pure acetone and pour it in a glass bowl do not heat up anything cause you will blow up the microwave clip the tip off and soak for at least mins and then using an orange wood stick gently scrape the acrylic off and then soak again continue doing this until all the acrylic has been removed Manicure Acetone Nail (anatomy) Plastic Knife Idli Bong Textile manufacturing Drill bit Beer Internal ballistics Soldering Chopsticks Glass Cookware and bakeware Olive oil Polymethyl methacrylate Agar plate Pottery Tanning Explosive material Fractional distillation Lathe Seismic retrofit Perfume Cincinnati Bengals Laser engraving Sake Handloading Soy milk Coffee Leather Upholstery Tofu Alcohol fuel Fiberglass Knitting Vacuum tube Turbocharger Motor oil Tea Gesso Single certification Solvent Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Campfire Inhalant Rice Wound GunZ The Duel Acrylic paint Mattress Skinny Puppy Pedicure Tattoo Nine Inch Nails Smoking pipe Microwave oven Epoxy RuneScape skills Opportunity rover Soap bubble Dye Diamond simulant Hydrogen peroxide Katana Lightning Molotov cocktail Chicken Manhunt (video game) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Balthasar G__rard Fire extinguisher Menstrual cup Hurricane Wilma Organic peroxide Happy Tree Friends Hyssop View camera Dialysis Nuclear weapon design Fire fighting Bassoon Potassium hydroxide Cher (entertainer) Comanche Straw-bale construction Columbine High School massacre Spark plug Earwax Casting Repouss__ and chasing Essential oil Technicolor Nitroglycerin Shroud of Turin Ultraviolet The Ashlee Simpson Show Petrochemical
