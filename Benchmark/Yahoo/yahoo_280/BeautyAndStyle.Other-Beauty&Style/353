how can i train my man to look after himself better my man is the complete opposite to me i take lots of pride in my appearance and there's rarely a hair out of place on me lol my guy on the other hand doesn't care what he looks like he has acne which he cannot be bothered to treat by improving his diet or doing to a doctor and often he doesn't shave or iron his clothes i feel a bit embarrassed as i always look immaculate how can i train him into becoming a well groomed man first acne can be difficult to take care of for anyone there is no single cure for acne when i was a teen with acne i finally found that regular bar soap and shampoo lather worked well on my face without causing undesired dryness or flaky skin but this won't work for everyone second as for not shaving his face often if you want him to do it more often be sure to tell him in a nice way say somewhat jokingly that you refuse to kiss him until he shaves for example you might also try buying him a new razor such as the more expensive and fancy type of blade razor or even an electric razor electric razors are very popular gifts at christmas time for example it's possible he is just lazy about shaving but his acne might make shaving a bit difficult however keeping his face shaved might help to improve the acne problem if you want him to get a haircut try offering to take him to a barber shop together or a hair stylist for men as for non ironed clothes that is pretty normal for guys i only use a flat iron about twice a year if the clothes are stored so they will not get wrinkled after being laundered that can go a long way to reducing wrinkled clothes you guy might need some help learning how to care for his clean clothes such as which items to hang and which items to fold and how to fold to avoid wrinkles if his clothes need to be replaced try taking him shopping for clothing this way you can pick out some things you think he will look good wearing he probably doesn't really care one way or another based on what you wrote if you help select the clothes that look better and fit better you can both be happier some men simply don't know how to go about making themselves look better if their father or other family members were sloppy then that may be all they know lastly don't forget to encourage him to keep his teeth in good condition not brushing his teeth will be costly later in life use suggestions to get your guy to improve say things in nice joking ways perhaps screaming and making demands may not be helpful at all Shaving Social rule Razor Textile manufacturing Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Sento Haircut Clothing Barber Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Professional wrestling match types Characters in the Smurfs Urinary incontinence The Apprentice 2 Japanese tea ceremony Global Gillette Upholstery Stomach cancer Domestic rabbit Avenue Q Tooth Friends Skinhead About a Boy Beard Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Strap-on dildo Humphrey Bogart Drill bit Customs and etiquette of Japan Fancy rat Animal Crossing 613 mitzvot Baldness Gas metal arc welding Happy Tree Friends Theory of conduct Shampoo The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Jam (TV series) Kodocha 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kimono Marilyn Monroe Eczema Pubic hair Hair Dog training Kurt Angle Equine conformation W.I.T.C.H.
