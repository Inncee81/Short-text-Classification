advice on being the new girl ok i'm a year old girl going into th grade i went to a private school before and now i'm in a new state at a public school so it's a big difference and i haven't met anyone here yet cuz at my apartment complex where we r temporarily living there aren't any kids my age so i need tips on what to do on the first day of school to meet people and how to make friends i forgot cuz i haven't been the new kid since st grade also i need tips on how to do my makeup and an outfit for the first day i went to paris over the summer and got my haircut there so it's cute of course and i like it the way it is so the stores i shop at are mostly abercrombiekids and hollister but i shop at american eagle too so thanks in advance join a club trust me it works i was the new girl a few years ago and waiting for someone to walk up to you and ask to be your friend won't help whatever you're interested in there's probably a club for it it really helps when you're shy and want to make friends extra advice be outgoing and don't try too hard to be liked be yourself good luck Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada AFI 100 Years series Pitaten Girls Aloud Can't Hardly Wait Teen Girl Squad Boy Meets World Recess (TV series) Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete Boston Public Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
