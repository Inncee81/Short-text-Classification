is it like this with you ok so i am very uncomfotable about the way that i look no matter how many people try to tell me im pretty im so self concious there are times wheni dress up a certain way i might think oh this loks good right and whenever someone snaps a pic of me it comes out so disgusting looking to me yet everyone else likes it and says it looks good i think maybe i have brained washed myseld to think i am sooo ugly i get hit on all the time even though im married and everyone tells me i look good but i dont ever want to believe it and like i said even when i think i do look good if i have a pic taken i think i look awful in it does this ever happen to you i hate haven my picture taken for this same reason there are times when i look in the mirror and actually like myself but when i have my picture taken i can hardly recognize myself but i really think it's mainly because we are not comfortable with our selves you need to learn to love who you are and just accept it we are all beautiful and unique in our own way believe me i would kill for people to tell me that i'm pretty or better yet have guys hit on me be happy with what you have and appreciate yourself you have to love yourself before others can love you best of luck Marilyn Monroe Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Teen Girl Squad Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Charmed Shrek 2 Vernon Schillinger Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Theory of conduct Jennifer Lopez Sharon Tate Friends The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Something Awful Dead Like Me Knots Landing Haven (TNG episode) Great Teacher Onizuka Milton H.
