not to sound so spoiled or anything ok here comes another abercrombie and hollister and ae question goodness do you consider these stores expensive honestly i dont think it's expensive at all although i agree for a some tshirts at af is but otherwise i think rest of it is fair price i didnt know this but do people shop there to make themselves look rich or something i have no intention to look like i belong in a certain clique when i shop at these stores but simply because i like their clothes btw i never wear tshirts that has their store name written across the chest i never buy graphic t's anyways why do some people hate people who shop there i dont hate people who shop at like hot topic uhhh im not looking for attention wtf i'm just really curious why people have so much hate towards certain brands of clothing it's all about value people who shop at particular stores are shopping there for particular benefits it may be the quality of the clothing the styles they provide or the prestige associated with the brand if they get the value they want they'll pay the price for certain people the money is worth more than any of those factors of value for others it's not people who dislike anyone who shops at a store that's regarded as cool feel that way because of the struggle most people at some point in their lives face about conformity and individuality they see the people as people who are more concerned with fitting in than each being his or her own person in reality there has to be a balance conforming to standards is not reasonably optional but being different to a certain extent can be valuable fashion is like a lot of things in life the better you know the rules and guidelines the more room you have to bend and break them if you look at fashion historically you can see that today's fashion has been shaped by people in the past who did things that were considered unusual during grade school however fashion is much less sophisticated and therefore holds less potential mostly you're going to see fads that come and go one clique will identify with a certain fad another clique will do the opposite to tighten their own group in the end humans are very tribal we're instinctively competitive yet inexorably gregarious we need friends and enemies not either or grade school is just the tip of the iceberg don't sweat the small stuff if you like the clothes and the people whose opinions you value most like them then there's really no question as for an objective view of those clothes being expensive they really aren't you can get cheaper sure but the high end of fashion prices goes much much higher Supply and demand Goodness and value theory Clothing Microeconomics Social aspects of clothing High school subcultures Theory of conduct Electronic commerce Inflation Infantilism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Law of value Abortion debate Airsoft Human nature Fashion Insurance Advertising Surplus product Paintball Mattress Fashion design Gender role Illegal drug trade Ethical consumerism Japanese tea ceremony Socrates American individualist anarchism Publicly funded medicine Jennifer Lopez Tariff Education in the United States Digital photography Competition Mercantilism Ethics Social rule Economics Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
