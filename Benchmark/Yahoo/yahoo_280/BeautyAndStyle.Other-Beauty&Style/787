i am a boy of and i have worn my sisters clothes for years give me an idea of what to do i think it's best if i try to stop now and only do it when i have finished school and i'm in unerversity i don't want to be a fag for ever my god how could you still use your sister's clothes for three years well my advice is start saving some money and then buy some guy clothes you don't have to buy the expensive ones just buy plain shirts and maybe jeans if you have plenty money if not you could go with regular trousers as far as i know guy's apparel isn't as much as we girls have so i assume it would be easy for you the point here is not about how much clothes that you should have but it's about how you wear your clothes and present yourself in front of others Trousers School uniform Skinhead Social aspects of clothing Clothing Skirt and dress Shirt The Amazing Race Canadian Armed Forces Gay slang Aerial (dance move) Heavy metal fashion Professional wrestling slang Animal Crossing Kyle Broflovski Overall Order of St. John Friends Mattress Boy Scouts of America Tallit Scouting Comanche Okashina Okashi Doug RuneScape quests Scrubs The Catcher in the Rye Good Morning, Vietnam Kodocha Drag (clothing) Little Britain Goatse.cx The Life and Times of Juniper Lee 613 mitzvot Characters in the Smurfs Sweatshop Denim Cross-dressing South Park Jeans Knots Landing About a Boy The Wall Sears Holdings Corporation All in the Family Life insurance Treehouse of Horror XV Redneck Frankie Vaughan Hijab Undergarment Adidas Sinfest Suit (clothes) Fred Phelps Beachwear Japanese school uniform Morning dress Onam French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Protective clothing Chemise Can't Hardly Wait Social rule Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Kilt Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
