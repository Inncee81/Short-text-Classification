best eye color i think these are beautiful eyes plus the kitty is uber cute http www flickr com photos rekha http www flickr com photos diezelphotography http www flickr com photos minhavidadegata http www flickr com photos jon e i think the cat's eyes are the prettiest p actually the reason all those eye colors look so great is because of the quality of the camera it may also be due to retouching but i'm not sure if these photos were retouched or not most anyone can be shot by a good photography with a high quality camera and film and their eyes will look magnificent oh and i'm glad that you included a multitude of eye colors brown eyes don't get recognized much as being a nice eye color just because they're common they can still be beautiful so i'm glad you included the little girl with brown eyes Photography Butterfly Stereoscopy Digital photography Flickr London Rafflesia Cinematography Cover girl Ajax (programming) W.I.T.C.H.
