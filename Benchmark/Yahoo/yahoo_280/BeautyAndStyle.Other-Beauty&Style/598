why do girls model themselves after trashy women why do young girls model themselves after people like paris hilton and lindsay lohan more specifically what is it that's attractive about them i personally wouldn't want to model myself after someone in rehab for cocaine or arrested for a dui they're also too skinny and not cute without makeup so what's so great about them there's nothing great or admirable about them but unfortunately the media repeatedly portray good girls as boring or laughable and bad girls as fun loving and desirable therefore it is easy for young girls to want to imitate those rotten and annoying girls who are shown living an exciting and extravagant lifestyle the same thing goes for the boys boys who should be admired for being smart responsible and good students are depicted as nerds unattractive and undesirable while the bad boys are depicted as charming funny and desirable the cool guys who get all the pretty girls this is why parents have to spend more time setting a good example and teaching their sons and daughters real values human decency instead of repeating the phrase family values without really knowing the true meaning of it Lindsay Lohan Humphrey Bogart Garfield One Tree Hill (TV series) Paris Hilton Friends Otaku The Fairly OddParents Undergrads The Young Ones (TV series) About a Boy Viz (comic) Physical attractiveness The Beach Boys Beavis and Butt-head Sex and the City Great Teacher Onizuka Cliff Richard Family Matters (TV series) Adolescence Lewis Carroll Totally Spies!
