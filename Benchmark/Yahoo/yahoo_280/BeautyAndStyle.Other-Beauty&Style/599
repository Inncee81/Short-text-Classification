th birthday gift my best friend's th birthday is coming up in weeks and i want to get her something cool just last month i gave her a grad gift that had a whole bunch of cool things in it body lotion perfume photo frame beach bag trinket box mixed cd plus cash and i do not want to copy this gift again so do you have any cool gift suggestions that would not look like a repeat of what i gave her last time i have some little things to put with her gift like a really nice candle and an earring and necklace set but i need something s else is she going off to college if so getting her stuff for her new dorm or apartment would be sooo thoughtful and appreciated and your candle would go nicely with it target has really really reaaaallly cool stuff for dorms this year if you are a member of facebook go to the target dorm group and look at allll the pictures people have posted of cool things they did with their dorms from there and buy her some cool decorations and stuff she can use if someone would have giving me a bunch of stuff for my room on my th birthday i would have been soooo excited to move in if she's not going away to college you could get her a nice purse from a brand she likes for my best friends th birthday i got her a digital camera because she didn't have one and she loved it you could take her out and have a girly spa day and get medicures pedicures tans facials waxed ouccch the works and pick up the bill if she has a car that doesn't look very her buy her some custom floor mats seat covers steering wheel cover air freshener stuff like that they have stuff at spencers target walmart and hastings the nicest gift ever is a pet if she doesn't already have one can take care of it and is in a situation where one is allowed and practical lots of people are giving away free kittens around where i live and i'm sure if you looked in the paper you could find some there too you could also get something like a fish a guinea pig or a frog even if she's going off to college she could take care of these but if she's already got a house full of pets or isn't an animal person this is probably a bad idea they say every woman loves orchids and i have to say they are the most beautiful flower ever the plants can often be expensive but you can look around kroger home depot and places online like orchid com usually have pretty orchids i received an orchid as a present on my th birthday and it was my favorite thing that i got i hope you can think of something special for her your friend is really lucky to have you as a friend it's nice that you're trying to put so much thought and effort into her birthday gift Shaggy dog story The Inside Social rule Little Britain Garfield Humphrey Bogart Birthday Episodes of Lost (Season 1) AFI 100 Years series The Catcher in the Rye Marilyn Monroe Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct EastEnders Wheel of Fortune Time Out of Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show Avenue Q Darwin from Orchids to Variation The Star Wars Holiday Special The Price Is Right Mid-levels Sin City Ron Weasley Wal-Mart Undergrads Ed, Edd n Eddy Roxette Green Day Poker jargon Guinea pig Care Bears Sant Thakar Singh The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Sharon Tate Kimi Finster Negima Spidey Super Stories Kylie Minogue Gaia Online Japanese tea ceremony Doug Pet Sounds Francis Bacon (painter) Characters in the Smurfs Jennifer Lopez Facebook (website) Dog Good Times The Smoking Room Haven (TNG episode) Yoko Ono W.I.T.C.H.
