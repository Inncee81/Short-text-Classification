ok i shop at thrift store alot like of all my clothes come from there the reason i do this is because its cheaper all the stores in the mall have the same things so everyone look alike and i like being different the problem is i have a problem with spending alot of clothes for other people and myself like for birthdays and christmas i have the hardest time spending on a shirt when i can spend at the thrift how can i manage to get pass the prices when im shopping for others i would never buy anyone else something from the thrift store and im kind of a shame to tell people i shop there why is that i m preppy but i love to shop there pple never know that i do though im not ashamed but the pple i hang out with dont really like shop there so i keep that to myself but no im not ashamed im not going to go to hollister and spend sollars on a shirt like u said if u can go to a thrift store it is kinda ashaming if thats a word but i just tell pple i get the things i get from the thrift store i say i get it from ross bcause some of the stuff i get at the thrift store area soo cute shop there all the time its awesome and cheap Retailer Clothing Shopping Teen Girl Squad Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
