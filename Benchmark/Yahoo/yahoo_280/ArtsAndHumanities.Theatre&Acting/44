are you happy with how expressive your voice is or do you wish you could sound as charismatic as your favourite actor and have as rich a voice do you think your voice is just what you grew up with and its set in stone or do you think you can mould it into whatever you want it to be like voice is a strange thing it's all relative most people tell me that i have an amazing voice so much so that i'm able to pay my bills by working as a voice coach when i'm not acting but i've always wanted to have a bassier tone to my voice like ian mckellen your voice is not set in stone by any stretch of the imagination your voice can be almost anything you want it to be it just takes lots and lots of training a little patience and the help of a good voice coach to point you in the right direction but i've found that it's always best to learn to like your own voice train it so that it can be the best it possibly can but always make sure it's still your voice it's never wise to copy someone else in any form of art because then it's a imitation not an innovation your voice is a part of who you are embrace it and never be shy of using it Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shakespeare on screen Social rule Ranma __ characters Highway 61 Revisited Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Humphrey Bogart Violin Shaggy dog story Classical music era Ranma Saotome Infidels Music Novel Supply and demand Drama Colley Cibber Gandalf Empire Burlesque Rich Mullins Theory of conduct Duran Duran Counterpoint Magic (illusion) The Emancipation of Mimi Last Action Hero Storytelling Voice actor The Riordans John Cage New York Giants Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back Punisher House music The Fairly OddParents Blood on the Tracks Doug Ian McKellen Neuro-linguistic programming Britpop Okashina Okashi Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Singlish John Peel Milton H.
