what contributes to lack of self awareness some people in the world are obviously self aware even to a fault while others are so self unaware that they seem to have no regard for how they come across and how their presence affects others i actually envy the latter bunch what do you think contributes to a person being so solid in their posture before the world that they never question themselves or have to be self reflective about how their being impacts others i can't really give a blanket statement for why some people are self aware and others aren't but i'll share my thoughts with you for you to consider as possibilities i think lack of intelligence may play some part in it understanding yourself can take a lot of complex reasoning ignoring the inner workings is much easier if your brain does not have the capacity to analyze things inate honesty may be another inner trait in the self aware something within makes a person be honest with themselves people who have been criticized excessively as children may also be in the habit of criticizing themselves perhaps this makes some people very self conscious but the same treatment can make other people withdraw into a cocoon of self deception so i don't know if criticism is really a cause perhaps it is only a trigger of latent potentialities in a person which brings me to people's astrological charts some signs are naturally more analytical than others virgo and gemini are two very analytical star signs my husband is an astrologer by hobby and when he draws up a chart he can tell how easy or hard it will be for a person to understand who they are if the person was born at night this will make it more difficult for them to know who they truly are if the person's chart has many lines across it i think they are called aspects or transitions or something like that then that person will be much more complex than a person with only a few lines drawn across it well that's my two cents worth i don't know how right i am but maybe i have given you some food for thought love and kindness Human Person Intelligent design Philosophy of language Neuro-linguistic programming Supernatural Deconstruction Theory of conduct Traumatic brain injury Autism rights movement Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Astrological sign Astrology Second language acquisition Psychosis Asperger syndrome Manifold Sexual orientation Lie Autism Psychoanalysis Transactional analysis Philipp Melanchthon Ethics Pseudoscience Abortion debate Alcoholics Anonymous Expert system Infantilism Critique of Pure Reason Karen Horney Cognitive science Aristotle Alexander Technique Psychology Stuttering Meme Goodness and value theory Time Out of Mind Arguments for and against drug prohibition Zodiac Dualism (philosophy of mind) Magical thinking Procrastination Physical attractiveness Marshall McLuhan Sociobiology Artificial consciousness Polyamory Anthroposophy Microeconomics Sigmund Freud Theodicy Opus Dei Tai Chi Chuan Enneagram Current teachings of Prem Rawat Scientology beliefs and practices Virgo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carl Jung Soul Mind Immanuel Kant Falsifiability Surveillance Hypnosis Objectivist philosophy Horoscope God Carlos Castaneda Information warfare House (astrology) Hearing impairment Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Nicomachean Ethics Logic Equine conformation The nature of God in Western theology Esperanto as an international language Meditation Mojave people Dyslexia Religious Society of Friends Epistemology Drug addiction Gestalt therapy Social psychology Wealth Nature versus nurture
