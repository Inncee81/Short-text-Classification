time as a tangible thing is time considered a fundamental component of the universe if so it is then no less real than you and me matter or gravity what is then made up of what is its substance matter curves space itself with its presence the geometry of spacetime is the gravational field time is the actual curvature of the space itself time is not what allows motion its actually motion that allows time time passes differently for observers moving at different speeds your head is moving slightly faster than your feet hahahaha if you wish to know more about the nature of your universe you can email me any kind of question General relativity Gravity Black hole Philosophy of space and time Time travel Einstein's field equation Special relativity Einstein-Cartan theory Gravitational radiation Mathematics of general relativity Planetary orbit Equivalence principle Faster-than-light Speed of light Big Bang Universe Quantum gravity Time Lorentz group Brans-Dicke theory Physics Luminiferous aether Inertial frame of reference Fundamental interaction Maxwell's equations Dark energy Mass Differential geometry of curves Atomism Kaluza-Klein theory Physical paradox Pp-wave spacetime Tests of general relativity World line Frame fields in general relativity Curve Space Differential geometry and topology Geodesy Creationist cosmologies Minkowski space Exact solutions in general relativity Movie projector Geodesic (general relativity) String theory Hubble's law Topological quantum field theory Warp drive Anti-gravity Quantum mechanics Light Non-Euclidean geometry Event horizon Dynamic theory of gravity Photon Dark matter Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Ricci flow Congruence (general relativity) Eye Shape of the universe Alcubierre drive Proper time Manifold Action at a distance (physics) Energy Planck units Science Modified Newtonian dynamics Theory of everything Time dilation Schwarzschild metric Causality History of physics Heim theory Comoving distance Metric tensor (general relativity) Coriolis effect Spacetime symmetries Schwarzschild coordinates Stress-energy tensor Astrodynamics Force Tide Phase (matter) Path integral formulation Scientific method Gauge theory Algebraic geometry Polarization Solar system Riemannian geometry Mathematics Gravitational slingshot Moon Space-time theories of consciousness Field (physics)
