can one event change your future i'm not sure why but i always have this theory that even if one small event that happened in your life didn't happen your life would be completely different for example if you hadn't have broken up with that friend you would have stayed friends for ages you would have probably met different people you would have done different things with this friend you wouldn't have met the friends you have now etc i just made that up but does anybody else live by this theory or do you have another theory you live by this theory is incorrect yes i have thought about it before but it is not merely incorrect merely because i disagree because i don't disagree we all at times feel that we should have done something a certain way to prevent adverse situations from arising but the fact is that time is a set continuum of events if one thing changed about that continuum then it would cease to exist all together in other words if a particular event does not happen at a particular time then time ceases to be time and becomes something altogther different so if you did something in the past if you were to undo that thing the entirety of existence would change into something completely different there is a one in an infinitum chance that time as we know it would still exist Theory of conduct Time travel Theory Traumatic incident reduction Free will Philosophy of space and time Intelligent design English grammar Sexual orientation The nature of God in Western theology Grandfather paradox David Hume Debugging Time Out of Mind Infinity Reality Jon Secada Sigmund Freud Philosophical skepticism Ontological argument Transactional analysis Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Socrates English verbs Contract Ethics Ludwig Wittgenstein Mythology John Titor Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Physical paradox Scenes from a Memory Bah__'__ Faith and Science John Cage Creationism Fine-tuned universe Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Atomism Continuum hypothesis Probability Paradox Subjunctive mood Friendship The Drew Carey Show Spacetime Forcing (mathematics) Philosophy of language One Tree Hill (TV series) Eternal return Ecco the Dolphin Goodness and value theory Deconstruction Metaphysics Consciousness Friends Real number God Emperor of Dune Milton H.
