what book s have you read that changed your life the way you think or live tell me why the course in miracles it taught me the true meaning of love a long time ago i thought that love was something that you reserved for some special set of people that you had judged worthy of it after a while i got to thinking about what jesus had said about turning the other cheek and loving our neighbor i put the two together and realized that he had made no exceptions in these statements it became obvious to me that he intended that we exclude no one from the love that we are supposed to be giving i started thinking about my idea of love and suddenly realized that i had not been loving anyone at all i had simply been judging everyone and every thing judging someone worthy of love is not love it is only judgment i actually started to cry when i realized this i saw just how much of my life i had wasted being judgmental thinking of myself as a christian when i was actually doing just the opposite of what jesus had asked us to do i thought about the verse judge not lest ye be judged and i understood it for the first time i realized that i have a lot of catching up to do so many opportunities were wasted i now try to apply the love that i have for the world in a universal way like jesus asks us to do if i start to feel afraid and think that i see someone that i should not love because of something i have thought or heard i try to catch my mistake as soon as possible i tell myself that i have forgot the truth and have fallen for the same old trick that had cost me so many opportunities to be loving in the past the horror of this realization is often all that is necessary to bring me back to my senses and make me drop the judgmental nonsense i was thinking i still have a lot to learn about love but at least i m making progress love and blessings your brother don Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity John Howard Yoder Angel Current teachings of Prem Rawat Ten Commandments Christian views of Jesus Book of Isaiah Friedrich Schleiermacher Sola fide David Hume The nature of God in Western theology Theory of conduct John the Baptist She Loves You Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory Summa Theologiae Merit Jon Secada Goodness and value theory Roman Catholic Church Meaning of life The Amber Spyglass Reinhold Niebuhr Opus Dei Time Out of Mind Fundamentalism Miracle Saint Christian eschatology God Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Matthew 5 Past teachings of Prem Rawat Urantia Book of Mormon Jiddu Krishnamurti Gospel of John Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Eucharist Israel ben Eliezer Bible and reincarnation Church of Christ, Scientist Avenue Q Jewish principles of faith Scientific method Atheism Simone Weil Milton H.
