does free will come from identifying oneself with the laws of nature a related question is what is your notion of free will i see two natural notions of free will in the first we have free will only if we can break any law of nature whatsoever that could control us the second is the one that i propose in the question we have free will if we are the laws of nature i cannot accept the first notion because it is too much against the foundation of science so i am left with the second one this other one does make sense because if you are the laws of nature then you have no reason to feel that you are controlled you control i know that most people do not think that they are the laws of nature but this is only because we think of the laws of nature as something that is separated from the world i guess by laws of nature i mean the reality the reality or the reality does not need outside laws it contains its own laws it is the home of all laws because ultimately we are the reality we are right to feel that we have free will to publically private your question is interesting if you ask what is an electron i can refer to experiments in which we observe its effects we do not observe the electron but its effects by reality i mean whatever is real behind all experiences we do not observe the reality but all experiences are its effects however being the totality of course the reality must be what is behind the subject the object and the process of experience not just behind one of the three it is as simple as for the electron but we extend it to the totality by laws of nature i refer to a viewpoint on this reality it is the limit toward which the laws of physics seem to converge the laws of nature do not have an existence separated from the reality so whenever i wrote ultimately we are the laws of nature i meant that ultimately we are the reality this is because we are a subject experiencing the reality but remember that this reality is also behind the subject if you stop your life to always wonder no if you act and live it then the laws of nature apply yes Philosophy of mathematics Science Immanuel Kant Quantum mechanics Scientific method Cyberspace Determinism Supernatural Victor Cousin Rudolf Hermann Lotze Philosophy of science Causality The nature of God in Western theology A Course In Miracles Physics Intellectual property Epistemology Philosophy of space and time Where Mathematics Comes From Human Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Simone Weil Law of value Gravity Goodness and value theory Modernism Idealism Empiricism Creationism Objectivist philosophy Social psychology Logic Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Mathematics Theory of conduct Abortion debate Deprogramming Scientology beliefs and practices Postmodernism Falsifiability Multiverse Species Classical mechanics Out-of-body experience Black hole EPR paradox God Frankfurt School Sexual orientation Natural deduction Speed of light Artificial consciousness General relativity Meaning of life Dharma Manifold Intelligent design G__del's incompleteness theorem Categorical imperative Anthroposophy Infantilism Critique of Pure Reason Origin belief Neuro-linguistic programming Faster-than-light Special relativity Bell's theorem Religion Interpretation of quantum mechanics Western philosophy State Free will Existentialism Atomism Adjoint functors Anarcho-primitivism Philosophy Color S__ren Kierkegaard Exploitation Summa Theologiae Property (ownership right) Real number Theodicy Separation of church and state in the United States
