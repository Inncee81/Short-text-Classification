would it be wrong to screw a dead body if so why serious answers no religious crap logically speaking the only difference between a corpse is and any other inanimate object is that someone is pretty likely to feel some sort of attachment to the corpse from a purely physical point of view it's no more wrong to have sex with a corpse than it is to have sex with a hamburger neither would be a typical behaviour but that only makes it wrong in a 'fitting in with everyone else' sense a goal that's not likely to be achievable anyway most of the outrage you are seeing is purely cultural in nature there are societies who would our typical behaviour of burying a body in the ground as an atrocity you would be required to do different things by their standards maybe set fire to it hang it from a tree keep it in your living room for a week or even eat it people in each of those cultures sometimes have trouble looking out and seeing that their own narrow view is not necessary the only one if you have obtained the corpse by legal means and such an act is not against the laws of the region you are in then i say go right ahead if you feel like it i guarantee you that the corpse will never complain and on the scale of all human behaviours that makes it fairly innocuous as far as i can tell peace Coercion Ethics Abortion debate Sexual orientation Scientology beliefs and practices Science Determinism Theory of conduct Evil Meaning of life Utilitarianism Democracy Civil rights Transgender Grammatical gender Human Friedrich Schleiermacher Fallacy Victor Cousin Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Rape Metaphysics Transsexuality Civilization Contract Social justice Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Rudolf Hermann Lotze Law of value Appeal Cremation Goodness and value theory Funeral Alignment (role-playing games) Heterosexuality Strategic management Philosophical skepticism Causality Animism Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mediation Anorexia nervosa The nature of God in Western theology Creationism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Maimonides BDSM Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Color Asperger syndrome Moral relativism Paraphilia Fundamentalism Gender Sex Gay rights Argument from morality Gender role Water (molecule) Birth control M60 machine gun Sociocultural evolution Deconstruction Magical thinking Sexual attraction Philosophy of mathematics Aristotle Happiness Right Zoophilia Original sin Economic anthropology Simone Weil Morality Expert system Game Summa Theologiae Nicomachean Ethics Corporation Sexual abstinence Strap-on dildo Species Anthropomorphism A Course In Miracles Theory Claude L__vi-Strauss Torture Human nature Moral objectivism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Gender identity disorder
