what is an argument how would you define it what makes a good also a bad argument what are some examples of arguments say if i were making a claim that chocolate is better than vanilla how might i argue for it or use whatever example you like what makes an argument valid as the answerer aboved mentioned an arguement has two parts the premesis and the conclusion both are statements and are either true or false your conclusion is suppose to follow from the preceding premesis what makes an arguement good or bad is its logical skeleton the subject matter is irrelavant the logical skeleton is key the truth of the conclusion should be deductively entailed in the preceding premeises bad argument grass is green roses are red even though the statements are true the statement grass is green does not deductively entail roses are red good arguement all fish swim all sharks are fish all sharks swim being that all fish swim and all sharks are swim the conclusion all sharks swim is deductively entailed in the preceding premeises hence the above arguement is deductively valid one of my arguements is as follows p if god is an all powerful being then god does not exist p everything that exist is dependent upon relative realms of scope and possiblity to exist p humans exist but are dependent upon air water food solar energy planet earth to exist water exist but is dependent upon two hydrgen and one oxygen atom to exist trees exist but is depedent upon water soil photosynthesis to exist one could even agrue that atoms and sub atomic particles is depedent upon other atoms or sub atomic particles to exist ex electron proton nucles p if god is an all powerful being then he would not be depedent upon relative realms of scope and possibility to exist conclusion hence there is no god or there is no all powerful being note i have only discussed dedutive valid and deductive invalid arguements there are three other types of aguements inductive arguement abductive arguement and an arguement from analogy if you would like to know about what makes these arguements strong or weak email me i dont have the space in this limited forum to do so Logic Epistemology Logical argument Natural deduction Atomism Induction (philosophy) Propositional calculus Determinism Goodness and value theory Existence of God God Scientific method Fallacy Theodicy Contradiction Cosmological argument Vacuous truth Philosophy of science G__del's incompleteness theorem Critique of Pure Reason Bah__'__ Faith and Science Supernatural Atheism Gravity Fine-tuned universe Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Truth Religion Transcendental argument for the existence of God Extraterrestrial life Intelligent design Causality Fermi paradox Speed of light Physics Aristotle Expert system Time travel Reality Immanuel Kant David Hume Phaedo Neutrino Human Problem of evil Ecology Photosynthesis Default logic First-order logic Inference Free will Simone Weil Agnosticism Creationism Quantum mechanics Quantification Logical fallacy Hydrogen Model (economics) Philosophy of language Resurrection of Jesus Shark Summa Theologiae Supernova Atom Phase (matter) Special relativity Creation-evolution controversy Philosophical skepticism Faith and rationality Quantum logic History of physics Solar system Moral relativism Conspiracy theory Timeline of the Universe Model (abstract) Curry-Howard Axiom of choice Water (molecule) Modal logic Laws of Form Equivalence principle Reductio ad absurdum Paradox Begging the question Abortion debate Information warfare Ad hominem Microeconomics Nuclear fusion Extraterrestrial hypothesis Deconstruction
