i'm confused about this bit of philosophy in a book by eckhart tolle he says that the best way to be is not to mind the situation your in not to judge but just to let it be how would this apply to a doctors life one who accidentally killed a patient eckhart also says not to judge whether the situation is good or bad right or wrong thank you hassan for being so wise sometimes when something horrible happens we get locked into that moment it plays over and over in our minds and renders us inaffective to deal with it tolle in no way suggests we ignore the situation or not take responsibility but to take a step back and observe the situation from a neutral point it is what it is now move forward move forward in the now it comes down to disciplining of the mind and all its chatter i dealt with an anxiety disorder for years post traumatic stress for years to the point i was insane my thoughts and feelings had a life of their own and i was bounced back and forth continually incapable of taking any meaningfull action i began this program that uses tolles ideas amongst others and now years later i can say im healed and have a much healthier outlook it isnt easy to break a bad habit but allowing negative imagary thoughts and feelings run rampant is a bad habit and can be changed i had to stop my thought feeling process each time it started and force it to be here now focusing on the task at hand somthing that helped me was id pray god take away my stinking thinking and help me to be here now but anything you can do to interupt the negative thought process and return yourself to the present will work and eventually you will be in control of the thought process your mind will be clear and you will make effective choices you know the statement one day at a time well sometimes it has to be one minute at a time peace Socrates Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Utilitarianism Ethics Sigmund Freud Alexander Technique Theory of conduct Social psychology Psychoanalysis Determinism Scientology beliefs and practices Hypnosis A Course In Miracles Extreme Programming Meister Eckhart Obsessive-compulsive disorder Goodness and value theory Meditation Force (Star Wars) Evil Meme Clinical depression Alcoholics Anonymous Psychology Consensus decision-making Scientific method Existentialism Internet troll Second language acquisition The nature of God in Western theology Neuro-linguistic programming Logic Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stress (medicine) Aikido Postmodernism Cultural Revolution Motivation Modernism Philosophy of language Transactional analysis Bipolar disorder Falsifiability Rugby union positions Free will Psychotherapy Consciousness Psychosis Mutant X (television) Theodicy Narcissism Summa Theologiae Reiki Karen Horney Prayer Anxiety Microeconomics Philosophy of mathematics Magical thinking David Hume Cognitive therapy Economics Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Manual transmission Escape from New York Mind control Project MKULTRA Time travel Philosophy of space and time Strategic management Abortion debate Social rule Defence mechanism Central processing unit Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Causality Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Al-Razi Rudolf Steiner Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Poker jargon Fast bowling Religion Borderline personality disorder Past teachings of Prem Rawat Psychiatry Ex-gay Friedrich Nietzsche
