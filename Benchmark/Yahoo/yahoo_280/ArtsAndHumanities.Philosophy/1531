why do people waste so much money on college its really who you know so why bother putting yourself in debt the question is predicated on the notion that the only aim to going to college is to obtain a lucrative career there are many other reasons to attend college that include expanding your intellectual horizons being exposed to ideas and subjects that you might not otherwise entertain and to interact with other people who have diverse philosophical political and cultural backgrounds in an environment that allows for the free expression of these ideologies however let us put aside these issues of personal enrichment and look at university attendance purely from the vantage point of attaining a career that yields great monetary rewards sure in some cases you will find that those individuals who don t have college degrees but are savvy enough to get connected to the right people will in some cases be able to surpass those who are educated in the job market yet however disconcerting this fact may be to an individual who went through all the vicissitudes and debt involved in getting a bachelor or masters degree this occurrence is the exception not the rule from a statistical standpoint a person who obtains a bachelors degree or masters degree from a reputable university is more than likely to earn considerably more throughout his lifetime and is more eligible for promotions just peruse the internet for studies comparing the income of college graduates verses non college graduate and you will realize there is an appreciable difference between those who have a degree verses those who don t furthermore even in those careers that require no collegiate training such as construction work plumbing car mechanics and various technical occupations the hours that these individuals have to work and the working conditions these individuals have to endure make the slightly less paying job that requires a college education preferable what would you like to do after all work a job that requires over hours a week is back breaking and has meager benefits that gives you an extra a year or would you rather work in a job that requires a college degree that pays dollars but gives excellent benefits ample vacation and requires minimal physical exertion let me bring the point home with an analogy your average midlevel computer programmer most of whom are college educated or whose positions require a college education make anywhere from to in the corporate world a good certified mechanic working for a upper class car dealership makes this amount if not more however that same mechanic doesn t receive the same amount of vacation has to work days a week and normally puts in hours of labor furthermore this same individual is subject to hazardous conditions that can be injurious and since his job is physically laborious any impairment can result in lost wages or the complete loss of his career to use myself as an example i graduated with two bachelor of science degrees i have a friend who works for a car dealership doing estimates he only has a ged he made more than me at least per my last conversation with him and he ascended to his position based on the relationships he has developed at work however where i work hours a day he has to work hour days for days a week only getting off for sundays with no vacation i get two day weekends and every other friday off plus great medical benefits matching retirement and over three weeks of vacation every year plus more time off if i want based on how many hours i work over the hour workweek now suppose that dealership lays him off based on his educational background he is not marketable anyplace else besides other car dealerships with my college degree even if the it market which employs me completely collapses i can easily become a teacher or a police officer or get employment in some other white collared field as with anything there are trade offs for some entering the workforce or going to a technical school is more advantageous to them and is more conducive to career advancement than entering a university setting the path that one should take is dependent on ones personality and talents of course what one majors in when attending college matters as much as the fact that one attended college if you majored in philosophy english or some other liberal art don t expect career options that will give you a salary comparable to a programmer engineer mechanic or plumber in the final analysis you should not be that pessimistic about a college education sure knowing the right people always helps but having a college education as a backup plan comes in handy when personal connections fail success as we progress into the future is going to become more contingent on higher and higher levels of education just examine the historical trends back in the s and s a man could have respectable career prospects with just a high school diploma now those same professions that only required a high school diploma back then either state that they prefer a bachelors of science or arts degree or even mandate it i have seen it in my place of employment were highly experienced employees who don t have degrees are being displaced by a young workforce that only have a college degree to their credit i am sure within a decade or so even a bachelor s degree will not be sufficient even the secretarial positions that are open in my organization are asking for college graduates in english or journalism as society keeps upping the ante on education we should not dismiss higher education just because a few political astute non degree holders and brownnosers are ascending the corporate ladder we need to establish our life decisions on the basis of what holds true for most not what holds true for a few Capital accumulation Insurance Community college Inflation City and Guilds of London Institute Nurse College admissions Physician Trade union
