in your professional opinion i was having a conversation with a relative about how people care more about things like basketball stats than they do about issues that effect the human race she said that was because basketball is more important than physics math or issues that can change the world my brother agreed with her saying that there is no point thinking about things you can't experience can this be true is the rest of the world really so aimless i try to share things with people that interest me like a good book a theory or philosophy or even a thoughtful movie but it seems that i get frowned upon unless the topic of the conversation is one that abandons deeper meanings your thoughts thanks for taking the time your responses were genuinely helpful and much appreciated oh how i agree i am always saying this most people i talk to could care less about anything but how much money they make and who drives what car i play classical guitar am into books chess computers current events movies philosophy theory learning new things but like you i am looked upon as weird i think that you and i are among the minority we're the odd balls of the world but you know what i don't care i'm happy and most of them are not Philosophy of language Ethics Theory of conduct Economic inequality Social psychology Consciousness Meaning of life Determinism The nature of God in Western theology Special relativity Artificial consciousness A Course In Miracles Scientific method Mathematics Goodness and value theory Logic Philosophy of mathematics Rudolf Hermann Lotze Epistemology Free will Supply and demand Dead Like Me Economics Richard Feynman Paradox Science Causality Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of science Consensus decision-making Altruism Psychotherapy Chess Narrator General relativity Physics Simone Weil Game Aristotle Reality One Tree Hill (TV series) Religion George Lakoff W.
