what in a person who sees no choices in life made the choice to ignore the choices and why that may depend on if they are ignoring the choices or overlooking them ignoring choices implies a choice in itself as you point out failing to observe the choices may imply primarily a lack of imagination in that case it would be failure of the intellect one might say soul which is responsible if the person is actually consciously choosing to ignore or more likely to discount options available to them then there are several possible culprits a the person may be using semantics to define away choice in which case it is again their intellect which is acting for example the act of arguing against free will and the existence of choice as such would be an intellectual act b the person may be misunderstanding the meaning of choice so that they say no choice when they mean no good choice this may be due to stupidity of course or to pessimism based on past experiences my guess is that the majority of people who say they have no choices merely mean that they have no good options available to choose from and in that appraisal of their life they may be very accurate Free will Summa Theologiae Microeconomics Sexual orientation Soul S__ren Kierkegaard Theodicy Nicomachean Ethics Abortion debate Existentialism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Economics Alignment (role-playing games) Argument from ignorance Meaning of life Scientific method Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Fallacy Non-aggression principle Original sin Psychology Deconstruction Objectivist philosophy Polyamory Problem of Hell Democracy Intellectual property Predestination Evil Satanism Information Intelligent design Decision making Faster-than-light Model (economics) Ethics Coercion Friedrich Schleiermacher Social psychology Password Neuro-linguistic programming Simone Weil Human Utilitarianism Human nature Ontology (computer science) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Libertarianism Artificial consciousness Intelligence (trait) Narcissism Sant Thakar Singh The Skeptical Environmentalist Meaning Economic anthropology Game theory Guns, Germs, and Steel Newcomb's paradox Francis Crick Goldstein's book Arthur Schopenhauer Anarcho-capitalism Probability Monty Hall problem Reality Doomsday argument Divine grace Asperger syndrome Postmodernity Occam's Razor Out-of-body experience Special relativity Reincarnation Political correctness Pascal's Wager Instant-runoff voting Philosophical views of suicide Atheism Redundant array of independent disks Parapsychology Philosophy of language Jewish principles of faith The Wisdom of Crowds Social progress Androgen insensitivity syndrome Religion Internet troll Infantilism Postmodernism Acts of the Apostles Architect (The Matrix) G__del's incompleteness theorem Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Bayesian inference Supernatural Alcoholics Anonymous
