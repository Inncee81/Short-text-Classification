what prevents us from loving everyone equally i mean love in the broad sense not the man woman relationship great question and it makes me think of another that i'll have to ask i think you can't love everyone equally the best you can do is try to have compassion and understanding for everyone just like romantic love friendship love and family love are intensified or lessened by personal chemistry there are friends you have that you can look at and know what they are thinking or can feed off each others laugh and there are others that you like and respect but it's just not the same then there are those people that you have an uncontrollable distaste for even people who have more than one child and would never admit that they love one more than the other still show obvious differences in chemistry between them with family you automatically have some chemistry because you share genes but some family members connect better with others many people don't like to admit it especially when it comes to family members but it's really out of your control whether you connect with a person or not the best you can try and do is try to realize that it's not the other persons fault if you don't connect with them they just have a different chemistry that isn't compatible with yours and you should still be able to treat them with respect of course there are truly evil people and people usually don't have a hard time justifying disliking them but even with them there is usually someone who loves them you are drawn to or away from people by chemistry but whether you have chemistry or not you can like or dislike their actions so the short answer is chemistry we are all made of mostly water but we all have different qualities that that repel water like oil that are soluble in water like sugars and oxygen and those that are like gases some are water soluble some aren't Theory of conduct Theodicy Polyamory Philipp Melanchthon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chemistry Simone Weil Sewage treatment Scientific method Solution Philosophical skepticism Social rule Interpersonal relationship Love Trinity Human Alcohol Objectivist philosophy Aesthetic Realism Homosexuality and Christianity Altruism Floppy disk Sexual orientation Whose Line Is It Anyway?
