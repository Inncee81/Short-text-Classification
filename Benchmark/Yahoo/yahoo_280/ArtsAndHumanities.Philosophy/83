what is a sense of humor why do some people like jokes and goofiness and others don't i'm asking this in philosophy because i keep getting tautological answers in the more obvious categories i need some lateral creative thinking on this people are always shocked that i love jokes hearing them telling them i love to be silly goofy but i'm also very serious why is this seen as a contradiction i am really really curious it almost seems that culturally people separate themselves as if well you tell me can i tell you something mel brooks once said to me a guy slipping on a banana is not funny a guy slipping on a banana sliding down an oily road banging into a truck landing in a lake washed into a river hurled along with the current is funny penfold you're back lol and someone gave you a thumbs down this is perfect they didn't see you were being funny that is a hilarious answer amerpilot you're right did you know this statistic of those who send emails believe the tone of the email is understood of those who read those emails understood the tone good one no psyengine timing of course why have we not mentioned that or did i miss it timing and serious people often have a very different rhythm altogether hmmmmm this is fun everyone lavadog american pariot is right the same thing happened to you as happened to penfold someone didn't get you were making a joke i hate those thumbs down it really shows to go you some people are born with a big hole inside one which they can never fill it is in this empitiness that they dwell intrusive about their behavior they live in houses which by and large have no mirrors the result is that they cannot see themselves they question how come others cannot see the value of lord voldemort why are these people they ask themselves always laughing what do they find so funny they just don't get it most of them never will because they are essentially angry at the world for being born and never being able no matter how hard they try to fill that big empty hole inside themselves of course i could be wrong des i often wonder myself then i think of how absurd i am to ever take myself seriously and crack up on my self sometimes i'm driving when i think about it and i laugh so hard i have to pull over i can't help iit i crack myself up Joke Milton H.
