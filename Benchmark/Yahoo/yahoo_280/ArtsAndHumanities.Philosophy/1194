have your say here of a photographic memory person like what do you think about them so so i have always had a photographic memory and i consider it to be a wonderful gift to have when i was in school if i was taking a test could not quite remember an answer i would picture the textbook in my mind i could see the pages in my mind and even turn them until i got to the appropriate section then i would read the highlighted section until i had the answer this was one reason why i always got on tests had a gpa the reason i said it was one reason is because contrary to what generalist says about memory without wisdom i also had wisdom he seems to cubby hole people w photographic memories as no more than idiot savants memory does not preclude wisdom as i studied i aimed for understanding we all have memory it just so happens that a photographic memory enhances one's memory i have always been grateful for that gift i don't think the majority of my friends even know i have it since i don't see it as something to brag about it's just part of who i am wisdom is something that evolves over time some would say it comes with age there is some truth to that however there are many older people who have no wisdom at all wisdom comes from learning not only what is in books but from interaction with other people with other cultures belief systems it comes from experience both good bad i believe i have acquired wisdom over the years of my life and i believe there is much more to learn i hope to gain more wisdom as i get much older so my photographic memory is simply one of my intellectual traits it does not define who i am i am caring compassionate too they don't define me either but partially describe me how can anyone say what they think about people with photographic memories that's only one aspect of a person not the totality Theory of conduct Friedrich Schleiermacher Human Philosophy Nicomachean Ethics A Course In Miracles Numerology Meaning of life Psychology Asperger syndrome Supernatural Social rule Second language acquisition Goodness and value theory Cognitive science Intelligent design Soul Gifted Meme Hypnosis Epistemology Scientology beliefs and practices Economics Buddhism Strategic management Expert system Simone Weil Religion Mathematics Esotericism Intelligence quotient Infantilism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Francis Crick Culture Duties of the Heart Critique of Pure Reason Jacob Neusner Many-worlds interpretation Intelligence (trait) Eidetic memory Empathy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God Science Dream Philosophy of language Eastern Orthodox Church Autism Autistic savant Sri Aurobindo New Testament Rudolf Hermann Lotze Creationism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Phillip E.
