is there hope for humanity why or why not last year as a symbol of my own hopes for our world and humanity i bought a rosebush named hope for humanity to symbolize this affirmation or perhaps desire over the winter it died and now all that remains is its soil which serves as fertilizer for other potential life i question the state of our world and the state of humanity and so i am asking all of you is there hope for humanity please offer your thoughts and why you have come to your conclusions there are some truly thoughtful answers from all of you and i've spent a long time choosing a best answer thank you all for exceeding my expectations and challenging my ability to choose only one answer ok nice poem nico the boss agreed personal improv i agree that children are the future and as custodians of the earth now it is our job to leave them a legacy of our love for them and our world paul i have one thought to share with you peace tinman i appreciate your realism e fn w you are practical wise with a glimmer of hope if ya would allow a two way tie believer you would be getting points today your answer resonates with me and i'm glad to be part of this world thanks to you and all those like you my thanks to everyone for answering is there hope for humanity yes but only if humanity realizes that hope is dependant upon faith not necessarily religion but faith in our selves and each other so that hope can span world wide from knowing that we can all exist in perpetual happiness amongst each other as we care about each other and we can be in peace through understanding but in order for hope to generate peace that understanding must be cultivated by everyone in order for our hope can be seen as an affirmation for the care we have for our own species if we do not care then their is little hope so i think there is hope for humanity from the standpoint of humanity vs humanity but little hope from humanity vs nature because nature always wins despite our hope of surviving amongst it why i have come to this conclusion because throughout the history of man we have hurt each other the only species on earth that has the greatest intelligence but the greatest amount of death generated by its own kind this had me think that their would never be hope because we are ignorant to kill each other off despite being intellectual enough to prevent it but family and our love for each other has always been the guiding force for hope and faith as well as understanding that has me think hope for humanity is possible as long as we rely on intelligence and not our carnal nature Human Meaning of life Intelligent design Immortality Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Simone Weil Trinity Abortion debate A Course In Miracles Soul Supernatural Creation-evolution controversy Infant baptism God Altruism Epistemology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Socrates Objectivist philosophy Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Predestination Animism Nicomachean Ethics Creationism Property (ownership right) Urantia Phaedo Biblical inerrancy Christian eschatology The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Microeconomics Evil Merit The nature of God in Western theology John Howard Yoder Duties of the Heart Reality Expert system Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Immanuel Kant Atheism Opus Dei Maimonides David Hume Evolutionary creationism Perseverance of the saints Eastern Orthodox Church Bah__'__ Faith and Science Moral objectivism Sin Psychology Economic inequality Meme Extinction Ethics Church of Christ, Scientist Annuity Leviathan (book) Philosophy of mathematics Sexual orientation Philosophy of language Utilitarianism Kain (Legacy of Kain) Presuppositional apologetics Capitalism Civil rights LaVeyan Satanism Estoppel Peter Singer Infantilism Original sin Flood geology Goodness and value theory Philipp Melanchthon The Origin of Species Reinhold Niebuhr Intelligent design movement Incarnations of Immortality Arthur Schopenhauer Buddhism Christianity Consciousness Sri Aurobindo Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Charles Darwin's views on religion Culture Reincarnation
