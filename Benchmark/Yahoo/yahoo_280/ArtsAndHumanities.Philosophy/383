what do think is occurring when you are captivated by a particular piece of art valac gypsy this is very interesting to know my greatest pleasure was when someone looked at my work or others the painting evoked a very personal feeling not an interpretation i recently was captivated by a work of art so much so that i contacted the artist all i could say was the eyes the eyes what a powerful story they tell i felt a bit ignorant nonetheless i was hypnotized by these eyes i believe the artist appreciated my email as he himself replied later that same day first i am arrested by the distribution of masses expressed in tonal values for me they are the abstract the bones on which the painting is formed as a composition the underlying rhythm of the drums next i am captivated by the chords of color they are the pitch and key of the piece high or low major or minor like the overall sound of woodwinds brass and strings then i see or hear the whole as i take it in i also become more aware or the different voices speaking to each other and together a quivering of violins supported by a pattern of cellos underpinned by violas and basses a trumpet call striding there a trombone perhaps looping there the soft clash of a cymbal the chop chop of a woodblock in the patterns of color and the brush strokes and all this is a further expression of the composition at different levels and through echoes and contradictions like counterpoint and then if the painting really moves me the whole orchestra is there in both concert and sequence and i see the subject it's not that i hear the music or instruments but i feel it and them physically if it's what i call a good painting all the tone color lines soft and hard and composition as a whole comport with the subject and become a whole of its own an artifact with its own rationale rising from the subject which is a peg supporting and expressing the sensation of focussed observation then if that whole is captivating and powerful i weep whether i'm in a public gallery or anywhere else and the first mate takes my hand and i move on enriched in a way i cannot define in words any more than one could define music not knowing any meaning the artist may have seen or intended to convey unwilling to put any words to it or to my own sensations if we could write it it would not need to be painted if we could play it as music we would not be able to see the whole thing at once that is the peculiar power of a painting and sculpture is a similar though different story mostly the heralding of sounding brass rising and falling in three dimensions simultaneously like a frozen fountain whatever its materials and speaking like the different parts of a choir from different viewing angles and yet for all those abstract overlays i mostly appreciate works that have a subject based in reality landscape figures still life architecture etc and are not merely the abstract the bones or only one part of the orchestra are not enough even though they may have the moving appeal of a small chamber group what joy in all of it when found and most of all in the orchestra of paint Wassily Kandinsky Art Clarinet Sonata (music) Violin Authentic performance Tonality Jazz Big band Steve Reich Trombone Orchestra Double bass Olivier Messiaen Music genre Joseph Haydn Fugue Musical ensemble Baroque music Timpani Drawing Louis Andriessen Anton Bruckner John Cage Marching band Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven) Figured bass Harmonic series (music) Bass guitar Symmetry Saxophone Serialism Beethoven's musical style and innovations Concerto Musical works of Mozart Choir Cello Charles Ives Klezmer Andr__ Jolivet Bassoon Romantic music Jewish music Modernism Igor Stravinsky Mute (music) Sonata form Philip Glass Guitar Mario Davidovsky The Creation Symphony No. 1 (Havergal Brian) Tone (linguistics) Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven) Modernism (music) Transposing instrument Claude Debussy Blues Musical notation Postmodern music Musical mode Anton Webern Flute Wood carving Musical terminology Music of Nigeria Concert band Japanese art Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven) Gy__rgy Ligeti Trumpet Lute 20th century classical music Sampling (music) Michel Henry Definition of music Mandolin Synaesthesia Counterpoint Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Trance music Drum and bass Aesthetics Quintet Video game music
