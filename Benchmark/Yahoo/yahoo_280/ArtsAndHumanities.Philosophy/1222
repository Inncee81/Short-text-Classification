can attitude create miracles david hume has a good answer to this question he essentially says that miracles and tragedies are simply improbable events that create strong reactions if an improbable event produces a strong negative reaction a loved one gets hit by a bus it is considered a tragedy if on the other hand it produces a positive reaction you win the lottery it is considered a miracle in this way miracles are highly dependent on the reaction of the person who experiences the event creating a miracle out of an improbability you might also be talking about a self fulfilling prophecy it is a well researched principle of psychology that holds when a person believes something will happen they unconsciously alter their behavior in ways that increse the likelihood of it happening people are also subject to confirmation bias wherin they are more likely to notice and remember things that conform to what they believe think will happen in this way attitude can increase the probability of a miracle happening although it is really subtle behavioral changes at work and can make an ambiguous situation seem like a miracle so attitude plays an important role in the phenomenon of miracles but does not literally create them it merely influences behavior and perception in ways that seem like it is creating miracles Social psychology David Hume Supernatural Psychology Homophobia Free will A Course In Miracles Probability Determinism Agnosticism Religion Goodness and value theory Theodicy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Stuttering Cult Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Resurrection of Jesus Causality Atheism Scientology beliefs and practices Child sexuality Nuclear fusion Cultural relativism Coercion Reality Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cognitive science Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Consciousness New Age Fermi paradox Entropy Narcissism Falsifiability Historicity of Jesus Fine-tuned universe Hypnosis Theory of conduct Asperger syndrome Sexual orientation Postmodernism Miracle Philosophy Philosophy of language Human sexual behavior Human nature Microeconomics Intelligent design Milton H.
