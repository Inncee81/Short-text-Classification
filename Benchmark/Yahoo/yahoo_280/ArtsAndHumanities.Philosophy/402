so what do you say without evil there will be no value for good and every human posses a evil side which is most of the time suppressed or unleashed if given chance or there would be no law and fear of god are we ready to do any evil thing bad are those just got caught good are those just suppressed the evil side of themselves dear all when i saw this question i was not able to hold but answer note this is of prime importance and worth reading so please read it completely though it is a bit long post there is nothing called evil in existence nor we have the capability to create one the so called 'evil' is just a deteriorated goodness for example when you have a pious person among a bunch of people he is good but the same pious person if enters a new group where everyone is much more pious than him than he is evil in that group but the question is why does goodness deteriorate goodness deteriorates because of material desires the more material desire the more it deteriorates so its important to understand this relative nature next though what i want to say here may off course be difficult to understand as it is the truth i am putting it here also there is nothing called goodness or good the so called goodness is nothing but the nature of lord nature of hari as we all have been derived from him and that is the original nature we often build up deviation from that nature and that deviation is the so called evil and also we retain some of him qualities without much deviation and it is what so called goodness so when a person is in constant engagement and starts missing hari he tries to be more and more like him by his own sweet will and he becomes more and more like hari and when he finally become like hari he merges into the supreme this is one of the other way i can explain enlightenment to you all see for more technical minds i would suggest the explaination below take a big marble and start squeezing it but force exerting pressure on it the marble starts to squeeze and its density starts growing higher and more and more density builds up and similarly more and more small it becomes now imagine it is just a mm size from over km and you squeeze further waht happenns the object would have developed gravity and it would be very high and it will start absorbing matter and as it absorbs matter its gravity increases more as the density also builds and now imagine you squeeze it further it is almost reaching infinite density and it is not allowing light to come from it and absorbing light also now consider you squeeze it further and a km solid cube has become the size of an ant and if you continue to do so what will happen finally it will become even smaller and smaller and at last it becomes void what happens when it becomes void it does not occupy any amount of so called space so no effect of time or in more logical terms it absorbs its own time and time has no control over it and its is no more subjected to time decay so does this mean void is infinite density i do not wish to explain further as it is not recommended without for minds not yet tuned as it may be bewildering but all this is summarized by just the first manthra of isavasya upanishad om poornamadha poornamidam poornath poornamuduchyathe i poornasya poornamadhaya poornamevavasishyathe ii the profound statement of the visva vyapi vishnu is celebrated by this santhi paatam that is whole this is whole from the whole the whole becomes manifest from the whole when the whole is negated what remains is again the whole the poornathvam and the sampoornathvam of the visvathomukhan is saluted here echoing the first namam of sri vishnu sahasra naamam the half of the first manthra of this upanishad goes on to dwell more about the lord and his universe and how he pervades them after creating them om isavasyam idam sarvam yath kimcha jagathyam jagath i this portion of the manthram states that all this whatsoever moves in this universe including the universe itself is pervaded or enveloped by the omnipresent lord the root vis to enter informs the meaning of visvam his poornathvam is celebrated thus thru the first naamam the purusha sooktham portion sa bhoomim visvatho vruthva is another echo from this first namam this subject matter is of atmost importance and is capable of revealing the real nature of the so called nature and the material manifest please read it completely and for further understanding of this subject matter one needs to meditate on this same or rather than doing all this can just medidate on the envolope sound om or the one of
