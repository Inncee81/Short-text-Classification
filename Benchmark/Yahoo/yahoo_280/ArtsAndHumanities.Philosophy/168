does there truly exist an insuperable contradiction between religion and science can religion be superseded by science no neither side contradicts the other hear that people neither side contradicts the other it's like comparing a common rock with the concept of love science simply has no way to test the religious hypothesis the only movie i've seen that attempted to so was the movie flatliners and very few people i know think that would be a test worth risking because we don't know if there's an afterlife or not and the only way to find out is what we're all trying to avoid religious or not i've met a few religious geneticists and other scientists who like me are convinced that natural selection is the primary driving force behind our existence and development since the beginning of life on our planet but they have no problem incorporating their religious faith with the undeniable scientific evidence of evolution by simply believing that god created an evolutionary process to create us makes sense to me what doesn't make sense to me is people who can't simply come to the same conclusion they did instead of vehemently denying all the undeniable evidence for evolution when it's staring them right in the face that's what i don't get Creationism Intelligent design Evolutionary creationism Religion History of creationism Atheism Supernatural Science Creation science Evolution Creation-evolution controversy Evolutionism Young Earth creationism Intelligent design movement Gaia theory (science) Existence of God Human Teleological argument Teach the Controversy Karl Popper Pseudoscience Flood geology Scientific method Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Origin belief Meaning of life Theodicy The Origin of Species Bah__'__ Faith and Science Sociobiology Soul Jewish principles of faith Biology Species Gaia philosophy The nature of God in Western theology Duesberg hypothesis Reincarnation Meme Center for Science and Culture Psychology of religion God Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Epistemology Theory Macroevolution Francis Crick Wedge strategy Patriotism Maimonides Human nature Afterlife Creation biology Creation and evolution in public education Irreducible complexity A Course In Miracles Biology and sexual orientation The relationship between religion and science Death Atomism Church of Christ, Scientist Extraterrestrial life Goodness and value theory Theology Free will Occam's Razor Predestination Biblical inerrancy Darwin on Trial Urantia Fundamentalism Religious Society of Friends Ken Wilber Social implications of the theory of evolution The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Pascal's Wager Faith History of evolutionary thought Fermi paradox Bertrand Russell New Age Social sciences Theistic realism Causality Artificial consciousness Astrosociobiology Near-death experience Phillip E.
