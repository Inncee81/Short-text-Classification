my husband thought i was being oversensitive when i was offended by what he said to me what do you think he has worked the last saturday evenings so i was in on my own he could have swapped for another evening if he wanted to so i asked him why he couldn't have the saturday evening off with me all the teens have been out for a change so he said it was because the tv isn't very good on a saturday he couldn't understand why i was annoyed i must be terrible company hey i've never had so many thumbs down lol right i've decided to not nag and be boring instead i'm going out with my friends to paint the town red okay st of all i am sure that you are not bad company nd i am sure that this is all a matter of you being more emotional as a female and him being male and not thinking about things in the same way no i don't think that you are being oversensitive about him working the saturday nights especially when he could switch but have you tried talking to him and letting him know how you feel without blaming him or feeling self pity perhaps something as simple as i would really like to spend this saturday night with you would it be possible for you to switch your hours so that we could be together guys often don't think about these things and are much more willing to do it when they feel good about it not pushed into guilt i think that this should be an easy one to fix the past is the past and if you didn't tell him how you felt about it ahead of time then i don't think that you can hold it against him but if you have this talk with him and he still refuses to switch nights then i say send his butt to the couch just kidding of course but you get what i mean good luck Hey Jude The Apprentice 2 The Catcher in the Rye Social rule All That Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
