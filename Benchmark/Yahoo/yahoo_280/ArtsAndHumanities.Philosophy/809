what is the most common thing in the universe harlan ellison once said that the two most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and stupidity i personally believe that his statemant was a little too vague in my opinion the most common thing in the universe is stupidity because no matter how smart we think we are or how evolved human kind gets their are always problems or wars or a crisis don't get me wrong by no means am i a genius or even smart for that matter i have made plenty of mistakes and i deal with that as i mature and get wiser i do my best to think and not conform to others stupidity but i'm not perfect plato once said ignorance the root and the stem of every evil so my question is do you agree and think that stupidity is a terrifying epidemic or is their something else that controls more of the universe than even that of a humans conscience ignorance don't be sarcastic and dont be a smart a i'm lookin for real answers so if you don't have one don't answer yes i know technically space is the most common thing but im looking for a more in depth thoughtful intellectual answer yes i agree low intelligence is root cause of almost everything evil in politics religion and the masses in general every person i know who shows restraint patience politeness kindness and love is pretty smart boy are they few and far between and all the crass idiotic in trouble with the law addicted and overall miserable people i know are not only suffering they're own stupidity created self causing personal misery and they're spreading it to others and that goes from the homeless guy all the way up to the white house and god if there is one and i notice they're everywhere which means we are in a lot of trouble if you consider endless wars and human savagery a lot of trouble to balance that out we party more than we should 'cause the balance inside must be maintained that's why there's also an epidemic of prescription medication among the smart people they're in deep despair Simone Weil Evil Theory of conduct Atomism Theodicy Religion Socrates The nature of God in Western theology Supernatural Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Conscience Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Nicomachean Ethics Anti-intellectualism Sin Epistemology Stupidity Creationism Meaning of life Soul Contract Irony Intelligent design Psychology of religion The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Human nature The Fairly OddParents A Course In Miracles Property (ownership right) Coercion Ethics Calvin and Hobbes Problem of universals Problem of evil Plame affair Infant baptism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder KaBlam!
