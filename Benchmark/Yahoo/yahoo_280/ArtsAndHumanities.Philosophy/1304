why do we assume it is human nature why do people assume that common reactions must be human nature there are many influences that affect how people act that are arbitrary yet people assume that because it is common it is natural human nature seems to imply that we are unable to affect it it is used as a validation for actions and attitudes that are actually choices i kind of take issue with that i'm tired i hope that this was comprehendable haha any ideas on this issue i do agree with the fact that we have instincts and reactions that come from that but there are reactions that are a product of societal norms abritrary conditions that are referred to as human nature for example women are predisposed to staying home with children that's my personal opinion obviously but it is what i believe i do believe that we have some maternal instincts but i do not believe that it has to follow the pattern that has been created by society brilliant indeed the phrase human nature has become more of an excuse than fate we are all the time trying to pass off our decisions and failures to such excuses rather than take or fix responsibility for the choices made just because a majority of people make the same choice it doesn't become human nature it still remains a wrong choice made by a number of people and just because a majority of people have chosen it does not become any right choice nor the consequences of the wrong choice can diminish in any way Goodness and value theory Human nature Abortion debate Theodicy Social psychology Sexual orientation Microeconomics Ethics Predestination Theory of conduct Determinism Gender role Objectivist philosophy Social contract Original sin Social justice Economics Culture Homophobia Coercion Polyamory Free will Externality G__del's incompleteness theorem Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Libertarian socialism Morality Evil Democracy Biology and sexual orientation Libertarianism Value system Economic anthropology Anarcho-capitalism Political correctness Utilitarianism Law of value Human sexual behavior Religion and sexuality Discourse ethics Sociology Contract Supply and demand Nicomachean Ethics Doomsday argument Originalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Infantilism Criticism of libertarianism Japanese values Urinary incontinence Eugenics Second language acquisition Cultural relativism Homosexuality and Christianity Karma Abortion Axiom of choice Expert system Consensus decision-making Social progress Reality Fathers' rights Domestic violence Simone Weil Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Altruism Birth control Decision theory Psychology Conservatism Motivation Abortion in the United States Religion Sociocultural evolution Zoophilia Church of Christ Norm (sociology) Community Efficiency wages Feminism Same-sex marriage Karen Horney Technology God Emperor of Dune Transsexuality Sin The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Alcoholics Anonymous Gestalt therapy Universal pragmatics Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Labor theory of value Public domain Incentive Equivalence principle Historical materialism Islam as a political movement Summa Theologiae
