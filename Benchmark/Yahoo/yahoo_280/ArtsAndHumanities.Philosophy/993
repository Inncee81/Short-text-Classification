if you are a christian can you believe in evolution i believe in god and that jesus was the son of god i accepted jesus into my heart when i was five i also believe in evolution i don't take everything in the bible literally because some things would have been lost in translation and it would be hard to pinpoint which stories those are so here is what i believe god is omnipotent god is massive god is larger than we could ever imagine every religion that has a god or diety is worshipping the same massive god but just with a different name and different idea of god now think of a fly small lives a whole lifetime within two weeks this would be equivilant to our yrs because we are larger we see his life as being extremely short but to him it is as long as our lifetime now think of god huge wouldn't it make sense that because god is so large one of his days would be years to us put that into concept of the story of creation what if each of gods creation days was thousands of years of years to us but to god it was only one day wouldn't this make sense i was talking to my christian grandmother about evolution she is about she has lived her whole life by the word of god and has taken everything in the bible literally she thinks that the world is years old and doesn't even investigate the possiblity of evolution she thinks that the scientists are wrong she is an educated woman that was even a teacher i think that she thinks if she looked into it her faith would be dashed because she has been living her whole life this way and doesn't know anything else and if she even entertained the possibility she would see that living the christian life she has actually made some wrong choices what do you think lufiabuu i am notsure what you know of how the earth began but when it did the theory is that it took almost of our years for the earth to do one rotation therefore what we call a day rotation would have been five years to us at the time the earth began i know it is hard to understand philosphy if you are not a philosopher so i will try an explain it another way ex a tree is years old imagine all this tree has seen if the tree could talk he would probably talk v e r y s l o w l y because that is how life is for the tree the tree was here before us and probably will be here after us the reason the tree talks slow is because that is how we hear it being that we are quite small compared to the tree if the tree was talking to other trees they would hear it normally as we hear each other now back to the fly if the fly could talk and was talking to other flies the other flies would hear him as we hear each other but becasue the fly is so small and so fast to the fly we are like the tree and all we hear is buzz buzz buzz to the tree we are like the fly and all the tree would hear would be buzz buzz buzz do you get it yet the theory of evolution isn't that we evolved from apes that is a common misconception the theory is that we evolved from the same cell organism this organism has branched off many different species and we actually evolved from ourselves it is very possilbe that there were similar apes to our species at the time when humans began as for me not beliving or not having faith don't be ridiculous i am a curious child of god looking for answers god made me this way and if through my research i can figure out how to incorporate science and religion into the the main stream than maybe i will have accomplished what god wants me too i have faith i am just not clouded by the literal translations people take from the bible therefore i feel no guilt in being the person that god made me to be enough fath for you lufiabuu the theory of relativity applies to physics not philosphy again you have misunderstood the trees don't actually talk slowly but if we could hear them it would sound slow to us or not like talking at all philosphy not relativity it is hard for some people to imagine but think of a one hundred foot tall giant what do you think it would sound like to us if the giant spoke now imagine that giant is going for a walk how long would it take for the giant to walk across the rocky mountains how long would it take you even though you are going the same distance it seemed a lot longer to you than it did to the giant time is something man made up to keep track of his life think of life more as distance that you are travelling not as hours on a clock and things will start to make a lot more sense please try not to be get upset it is after all a friendly debate yes is the short answer to your question and you put forth some ideas why i'm not necessarily saying i agree with you there are some significant problems with evolutionary theory but ultimately the bible does not go into detail as to how god created the earth leaving a lot open for interpretation you said i believe in god and that jesus was the son of god i accepted jesus into my heart when i was five that's what really matters after that point it's really about trying to live the kind of life that jesus modelled for us a life of service compassion and sacrificial love i would encourage you to keep studying and keep learning and don't be limited to studying soley 'christian' sources learn all you can about everything you can personally i have found the more i've studied subjects such as science philosophy and psychology the deeper my appreciation of god and his creation has become and don't get too caught up in just studying the academic don't neglect the creative the universe is the greatest work of art ever created in short my advice to all christians is to live and love as christ showed us and learn as much as you can about the wonderful world god created for us to be a part of t W.
