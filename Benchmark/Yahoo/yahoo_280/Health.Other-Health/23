how should a toilet seat protector be placed on the seat many public rest rooms have a tissue paper toilet seat protector for use which direction is is supposed to be placed in when you tear out the center does the hinge lie to the back of the toilet or to the front no matter which way i try it it usually slips into the toilet before it can be of any use no no no check it out my mom just schooled me on this and i'm a grown ss woman i've been doing it backwards i don't usually sit but if i had to i always had the center tear in the back my mom told me that you're supposed to let the tear hang from the front so if you have to sit down you have more front coverage whether male or female our most important parts are located in the front also it doesn't splash as much because the paper is there and it doesn't fall into the toilet before you sit down i never realized but it makes a lot of sense so now if i just have to sit it goes in the front Japanese toilet Toilet Menstrual cup Professional wrestling holds Shaggy dog story Fecal incontinence Futurama (TV series - season 2) Married... with Children Euphemism Bart Sells His Soul Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Aerial (dance move) The Inside Equine conformation Dog training The Shining (film) Professional wrestling aerial techniques One Tree Hill (TV series) StarCraft: Uprising Kodocha Toilet paper Psycho Japanese tea ceremony Volleyball Reservoir Dogs Washroom Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Operation Petticoat The Dunciad Professional wrestling attacks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chair Bidet Professional wrestling throws Baroque chess The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Toilet-related injury Skateboarding trick Ulna Vegeta Scenes from a Memory Palace of Westminster Scapula Theory of conduct Treehouse of Horror V Haven (TNG episode) Urination Condom Futurama (TV series - season 4) Flush toilet Basque language The Amber Spyglass Sento Cello Ocean's Twelve Rent (musical) British House of Commons My Life as a Teenage Robot Toilet humour Katelyn Faber Chess strategy and tactics Powerbomb Milton H.
