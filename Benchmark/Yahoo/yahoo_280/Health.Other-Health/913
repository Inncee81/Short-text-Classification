i'm trying to quit smoking any tips first off congratulations for wanting to quit smoking as far as answering there are a lot of ways the best ways are slowly lowering your dose takes a long time sometimes or going cold turkey which is faster but harder either way the last thing is making the decision to quit so you'll eventually have to deal with the withdrawal for the most part when you deal with withdrawal you'll just have to tough it out but there are some things that can help cleanse out the toxins and may help to minimize some of the effects of withdrawal drinking water will help to detox and taking some supplements that work as cleansers may help as well specifically apple cider vinegar green tea decaffeinated chlorophyll fantastic cleanser and even good amounts of fiber and water helps some people although it's not very comfortable for the lower level of detoxification you get all that being said it's likely that the symptoms should stop relatively shortly after your last cigarette it's never as long as it feels like it is your neurotransmitters don't take too terribly long to scream for something they are addicted to after you stop another important thing to note is that no matter how bad it gets taking more of the drug and yes nicotine is a drug will only make the withdrawal last longer and will be harder on you in the long run good luck and congrats again Withdrawal Addiction Cannabis (drug) Cocaine Alzheimer's disease Caffeine Tobacco smoking Nicotine Drug addiction Vitamin C Buprenorphine Prostate cancer Tea Coffee Opioid Antidepressant Bong Methamphetamine Alcoholism Dietary fiber Illegal drug trade Arguments for and against drug prohibition Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fluoxetine Vinegar Drug abuse Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Tobacco Bipolar disorder Action potential Paroxetine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cider Diazepam Spice Girls Alcoholic beverage Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Narcotic Mattress Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Social rule Obsessive-compulsive disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Hypoglycemia Insomnia Dialysis Stomach cancer Drug test Babe Ruth Atherosclerosis Sleep Cigarette Foodborne illness LSD Health issues and the effects of cannabis Traumatic incident reduction Smoking cessation Anxiety Word of Wisdom 2000 Australian Grand Prix Snus Tocopherol W.
