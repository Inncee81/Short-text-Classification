why do i get these migranes i get these migrane headaches that are so bad that i throw up and they usually last all day i have had these ever since i was a kid and only seem to be more frequent as i get older does anyone know what causes this or can it be a tumor or what is it if you have suffered from them since you were a kid it is likely not a tumor they are probably more frequent because as an adult you have more stress in your life and are probably doing more things that would cause headaches however if you have any new symptoms you should see a neurologist for a real exam for years i probably took tylonal or ibuprofen every hours a day i ended my migraines by eliminating preservatives artificial colors and artificial flavors from my diet mostly just switching brands i started reading the ingredient label on my foods and learning what the fancy names for various chemicals are this really works i do not get migraines anymore go to www feingold org they will send you a list of foods that do not contain these chemicals again mostly brand switching please look into it i do not benefit in any way at all this is real make your next question about the feingold diet and see how many other people use it and love it Migraine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Aspartame Food coloring Cluster headache Chronic fatigue syndrome Multiple chemical sensitivity Brain tumor Cancer Chocolate Neurology Stomach cancer Hypoglycemia Tension headache Colorectal cancer Vegetarianism The Coca-Cola Company Multiple sclerosis Cannabis (drug) Tyramine Prostate cancer Paracetamol Organic food Sugar substitute Fancy rat Lamotrigine Coffee Epilepsy Folic acid Veganism Tocopherol Dyslexia Headache Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Russ Feingold Patent medicine Vitamin C Coeliac disease Fecal incontinence Ibuprofen Clinical depression Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Menstrual cycle Carpal tunnel syndrome Paget's disease of bone Domain Name System Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Acromegaly Topiramate M__ni__re___s disease Egg (food) Dehydration Breastfeeding Cheese Addiction Hal Trosky Combat stress reaction Oncology Lyme disease Autism Bread Controversies in autism Medical cannabis Margarine Mental illness Food Medicine Tobacco smoking Foodborne illness Ramen Soft drink Propranolol Cancer of the larynx Hemorrhagic stroke Alzheimer's disease About a Boy Super Size Me Meningitis Pitaten Gulf War syndrome Trans fat Saccharin Food irradiation Campbell Soup Company Syringomyelia Monosodium glutamate Humphrey Bogart Aspirin Ferret Codename: Kids Next Door Malaria Chile pepper Franz Kafka Hamburger Botulin toxin New York City Subway nomenclature Caffeine Synaesthesia Hypertension
