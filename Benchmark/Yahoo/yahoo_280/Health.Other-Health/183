good samaritan law i know the basic idea but i would like to know a little more as far as medical care i am certified in lifeguard first aid cpr for the professional rescuer and emt outside of my training i grew up around emergency situations my mom is a trauma doc my question is for example if i needed to intubate a person assuming that i know how to and that i have the gear to do so but i am not certified to would i be covered by the good samaritan law thanks no you would not be covered by the good samaritan law the good samaritan law only applies to people who stay within a basic level of care if you intubate without the appropriate certifications you are stepping outside that basic level of care and would not only be liable if that person died as a result but also you would be considered practicing medicine without a license basically you can be ok staying at an emt b or first responder level but once you start doing als procedures you become very very liable even a paramedic who's authorized to perform intubations can't do it on his off duty hours because he's not acting under his medical director if he does so hope this helps p s i've seen emt b's get their license revoked for starting iv's while waiting for the paramedics Emergency Medical Services Paramedic First aid Ambulance Certified first responder Nurse Drowning Lifeguard Terri Schiavo First aid kit Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Scientology beliefs and practices General practitioner Community emergency response team Certified Nursing Assistant Paralegal Good Samaritan law Advanced Life Support Health insurance St. John Ambulance Emergency medicine Death Physician Advanced cardiac life support Physical trauma Medicine Automated external defibrillator Negligence Health profession Podiatrist Vehicle extrication Notary public Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Traditional Chinese medicine Good Samaritan Medical emergency Medic One Emergency department Mechanical ventilation Hypnosis Ethics Publicly funded medicine Transsexuality Public health in mainland China Cardiac tamponade Public domain Traumatic brain injury Juris Doctor Altruism Physical therapy Abdominal thrusts Air Force Pararescue Parachuting Supply and demand Shock Chiropractic Euthanasia President of Germany Pretty Good Privacy Naturopathic medicine Chinese University of Hong Kong Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pilot certification in the United States Massage Education in Portugal Myocardial infarction Civil rights Copyright law of the United Kingdom Nursing Medical Assistant Medicare (Canada) Electrical engineering Intracranial pressure Basic life support Law of the People's Republic of China Stroke Dentistry Appeal Tort Abortion Psychiatry Dafydd Williams Kashrut Sexual assault Prostate cancer Treaty Midwifery Firefighter SAMU Information Technology Infrastructure Library Golden hour (medicine)
