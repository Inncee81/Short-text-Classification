my little toe is bleeding bumped into a metal bar do i have to go to the hospital for that injection it's not very deep i think unless it is a deep gash you probably do not need a tetanus shot or stitches but stitches can only be applied within the first hours of injury clean the area with peroxide solution that is diluted peroxide and water never use just peroxide without diluting it as it will damage the surrounding skin dry carefully and you could apply a little otc antibiotic ointment if you must cover it use a small gauze bandage not a bandaid a bandaid will only make the area moist and you want to keep it clean and dry as bacteria grows in moist mediums leave the toe exposed to air as much as possible to aid in healing if it is broken it might turn purple and even if it isn't it might be painful for a while but there is nothing a hospital will do for a small toe fracture you can elevate it to reduce swelling and pressure to the area but watch it carefully for signs of increased redness swelling or discharge which signals it is infected then you need to see a doctor usually this is more painful than serious Wound Hydrogen peroxide Acne Intravenous therapy Bruise Dialysis First aid kit Tattoo Body piercing Gout Conjunctivitis Traumatic brain injury Eczema Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mouth ulcer Bone fracture Decompression sickness Sterilization (microbiology) Disinfection Ammonia Diving Urinary incontinence Halitosis Tesla coil Pneumonia Ulcer Otitis externa Aloe Carpal tunnel syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Organic peroxide Cocaine Myocardial infarction Paracetamol Callus Gonorrhoea Wisdom teeth Tuberculosis Mosquito Fire extinguisher Tourniquet Anthrax Intracranial pressure Equine conformation Radiation therapy Casting Skin graft Ultraviolet Osteoarthritis Penis Rebreather Traditional Chinese medicine Chemoluminescence Antiseptic Virus Fancy rat Wound healing phases Battery (electricity) Seismic retrofit Sewage treatment Escherichia coli O157:H7 Snakebite (bite) Diabetes mellitus Explosive material Professional wrestling holds Childbirth Mercury (element) Terminal ballistics Chalazion Cancer Allergy Massage Scar Skin Fecal incontinence Electrophysiology Stomach cancer Bacteria Chronic fatigue syndrome Spider Bleeding Gangrene Drill bit Tooth enamel Diabetic retinopathy Sunburn Gilding Rocky Mountain spotted fever Candidiasis Comfrey
