what do u think about shots i found out recently that shots arent required by any law no child has to receive them its the parents choice most schools will just tell u that u dont have a choice but actually u do and to me these shots are useless polio doesnt exist measles are very rare and hepatitis is rare amongst children under and if a sudden outbreak of polio swept the nation we'd have invent a new vaccine anyway the old one would do nothing after extensive research i came to the decision to not vaccinate my children these are a few reasons i do not vaccinate a person would not normally contract diseases at one time naturally yet at and mth visits a baby is injected with five vaccines there is no proof that vaccines are responsible for the decline in certain diseases improved sanitation medical care and less crowding may also have contributed to the decline in certain diseases most diseases decreased by over before the introduction of vaccines by vaccinating children many cases of certain diseases ex measles chicken pox have now shifted to the adult population where the disease is often more serious and debilitating vaccines have not been tested for any possible carcinogenic cancer causing teratogenic gene altering effects or their effects on the reproductive system it says this right in the product inserts from the manufacturers vaccines are not effective so the child can still get the disease even if they are vaccinated and a child can actually get a disease sometimes from the vaccine if it is a live vaccine after researching many of the diseases like measles mumps and polio i found they are not as scary as the media hyped them to be especially for a healthy immune system example polio is asymptomatic the same amount of vaccine that is given to a yr old is given to an mth old and a mth old etc i beleive the chance of dying or getting a serious side effect from the actual disease is much less than the chance of dying or getting an adverse reaction from the vaccine the dieseases are not dangerous or deadly in most people i believe that injecting my children with things such as formaldehyde mercury trace amounts aluminium paint thinner coolant anti freeze detergent phenols msg plus dead animal tissue aborted fetus tissue mutated human and animal viruses bacteria antibiotics and animal bacterial and viral dna is not particularly a good idea my children will be going to public school i live in california which has philosophical exemptions all i do is sign a paper saying vaccines are against my personal beliefs and my children are exempt Smallpox Vaccine controversy Virus Pneumonia AIDS Poliomyelitis Autism MMR vaccine Thimerosal Antiviral drug Measles Spanish flu Autism epidemic Rabies Mumps Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS OPV AIDS hypothesis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Marburg virus HIV vaccine Antiretroviral drug Hepatitis Prostate cancer Bioterrorism Cytomegalovirus Chronic fatigue syndrome Malaria Nutrition HIV Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Foot-and-mouth disease H5N1 Herpes simplex virus Growth hormone treatment Crohn's disease Ebola Androgen insensitivity syndrome Adverse effect (medicine) Andrew Wakefield Animal testing Psoriasis Chickenpox Tuberculosis Sexually-transmitted infection Helicobacter pylori Streptococcus pneumoniae Colorectal cancer Jonas Salk Vitamin C Breastfeeding Abortion debate Stem cell Common cold Antibiotic Leukemia Human papillomavirus Sickle-cell disease Meningitis AIDS reappraisal Aspartame Controversies in autism HIV test Asthma Rotavirus Medicine Syphilis Hepatitis B Louis Pasteur Urinary incontinence Population history of American indigenous peoples Acne Avian influenza Allergy Stomach cancer Genetically modified food Foodborne illness 2000 Simpsonwood CDC conference Mercury (element) Hepatitis C Alzheimer's disease Diabetes mellitus Insulin Abortion Pasteur Institute Lassa fever Cirrhosis Tobacco smoking Folic acid
