how do you get sick quickly i really want to see high school musical but there is a meeting at my house on every friday at pm and i have to particapate it's not that i don't want to be in it it's that i also want to see hsm the first day it comes out so how do i get sick so i don't be in the meeting ex how do i get laryngitis a high fever a nasty running nose and more allowing yourself to get sick by trying is dangerous because you can get so many nasty diseases but you could try a hot shower then sit or sleep in front of a cold fan or ac or hang out with someone else who is sick you know let them sneeze on you and stuff but you run the risk of getting whatever else they may have yuck and if you are really that amped to see that movie to get really really sick just lick a door knob or something i'm willing to guess that just seeing high school musical will make anyone sick enough to get out of anything Common cold Sento Quarantine Biological warfare Sleeping sickness Buddy Guy Group A streptococcal infection Time Out of Mind Decompression sickness Radiation poisoning The Rutles Prince (artist) Foodborne illness The Young Ones (TV series) Disease Altitude sickness Michael Jackson James Lick Cancer of the larynx Sweating sickness Muslim ibn Aqeel Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Dean Koontz Hyperthermia Emo AFI 100 Years series Ebola Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide The Ashlee Simpson Show Japanese tea ceremony Van Halen The Adventures of Pete & Pete Kelly Clarkson Upper respiratory tract infection Health insurance Billboard Hot 100 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Emotions (album) Bathing Electrophysiology Full Metal Panic?
