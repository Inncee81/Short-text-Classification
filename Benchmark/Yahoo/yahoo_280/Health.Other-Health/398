why do people say 'bless you' when you sneeze and not when you cough where did the tradition of saying 'bless you' come from after one sneezes there are many variations as to why we say bless you or god bless you when we sneeze at one time people believed a man's soul could be inadvertently thrust from his body by an explosive sneeze thus bless you was a protective oath uttered to safeguard the temporarily expelled and vulnerable soul from being snatched up by satan who was always lurking nearby the purpose of the oath was to cast a temporary shield over the flung out soul which would protect it just long enough to regain the protection of the corporeal body conversely the sneeze itself was the expulsion of a demon or evil spirit which had taken up residence in a person therefore although the bless you was again a protective charm meant to protect the sneezer from evil in this version it was meant to ward off the re entry of an evil spirit which a tormented soul had just rid itself of another one is the heart was believed to momentarily stop during a sneeze it doesn't thus the bless you was uttered either as a supplication for life to return or as a congratulation upon its successful restart other than that i do not know anymore good question Demon Hell Charmed Sneeze Exorcism Reincarnation Ayyavazhi mythology Incarnations of Immortality Angel Original sin Phoebe Halliwell Holy Spirit Phaedo Sola fide Ten Commandments Immortality Ayya Vaikundar Heaven Animism Paige Matthews Amulet Soul Devil Kain (Legacy of Kain) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Adam and Eve Daedra Naraku Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Anointing Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Evil Amidah Magic (paranormal) Matthew 5 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Blood (computer game) Mortification of the flesh Summa Theologiae YuYu Hakusho Death (personification) Common cold Perseverance of the saints Legend of Mana Demonic possession Cathar Michael (archangel) Demonology Oh My Goddess!
