when you throw up are you throwing up the calories that you just ate for example if someone with bulimia just ate calories and went and threw them up are they throwing up all the calories along with the food that they just ate or do the calories get absorbed no i'm not think of becoming bulimic i'm very happy with my weight it was just a random question that i was curious about some of the calories they just ate would probably be absorbed it takes minutes for the stomach to process food and put it into the small intestine where the actual absorption process occurs if the food is still in the stomach then unless it's alcohol the body hasn't had a chance to absorb any calories yet Anorexia nervosa Bulimia nervosa Gastric bypass surgery Stomach cancer Energy Stomach Vomiting Dietary fiber Aspartame Obesity Dieting Healthy eating Atkins Nutritional Approach Breastfeeding Nutrition Weight loss Digestion Adjustable gastric band Small intestine Calorie Gastrointestinal tract Alcoholic beverage Diarrhea Veganism Hyperglycemia Low-carbohydrate diet Folic acid Glucose Tocopherol Foodborne illness Gastroparesis Paracetamol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insulin Chocolate Standard enthalpy change of fusion Egg (food) Orders of magnitude (energy) Blood alcohol content Milk Super Size Me Chicken Explosive material Tofu Bodybuilding Crohn's disease Omega-3 fatty acid Glycogen storage disease type I Fugu Maltitol Suicide methods Ton Eating South Beach diet Professional wrestling throws Hangover Hamburger Eating disorder Life extension Sucralose Binge eating disorder Raw food diet Cancer Overeaters Anonymous Pancreas Sushi Coeliac disease Olestra Drowning Naruto jutsu Spider Esophageal cancer Nuclear fission Glycerin Calorie restriction Polyols Ruminant Earthworm Malnutrition Lymphatic system Gastric acid Cheese Kashrut Food Peanut Happy Tree Friends Cassava Sleep Calorimeter Retinol Hydrochloric acid Pomegranate Opium YuYu Hakusho Laxative Protein-energy malnutrition Fasting Urinary incontinence Autonomic nervous system Fluoride
