alcoholics what are your reasons for drinking my mom was doing so good w staying sober and today she drank again what happened i am sorry that you have to see your mom suffer from alcoholism an alcoholic doesn't need a reason to drink they need lots of help not to the physical need for alcohol is too great to overcome without help lots of it they can't just have drink as that fuels the need even more they can't be around anyone that does drink as that's all the reason they need i wish you and your mom the best it's quite difficult for a non drinker to have to deal with a drinker she needs to make a life style choice and stick with it she needs to get support from the local chapter of alcoholic's anonymous and attend meetings they also have programs for the family of alcoholics that you may be interested in attending that might give you more insight into the alcoholic mind as a non drinker in an alcoholic family i see how alcohol can affect everyone around the alcoholic due to their behavior when they are drinking it is very sad to see these people subject the people they love to the hurt and heartache of watching them drink their lives away when your mom sobers up to where she can understand what you are saying you might want to express your feelings on her drinking hopefully it won't fall upon deaf ears don't take it personally if it does your mom has to be ready to give up drinking and seek help before she'll be able to be stronger than the bottle praying for your mom's success good luck to you both Alcoholics Anonymous Alcoholism Maison Ikkoku Theory of conduct Social rule Pitaten Alcoholic beverage Nicomachean Ethics Addiction Alcohol Humphrey Bogart Book of Isaiah Traumatic incident reduction Cindy Sheehan Blood alcohol content One Tree Hill (TV series) Pok__mon Live!
