what can cause a severe phopia towards road trips i am years old and deathly terrifried of road trips my family used to go on road trips in the past but we don't any more during road trips i would have a change in my attitude i am always calm and easy going but i can get annoyed easily i can't sit in a car any longer then hours without getting impatient and if i eat during a long road trip i get bathroom problems every road trip i went on gave me a back ache a neck ache a stomach ache and a severe head ache i can't imagine sitting for so long and doing nothing to entertain me nothing works to calm me down during a road trip i cry frantically during road trips because i hate them so bad i will never sit in a car for a long road trip even if it will save me from danger if i have to get somewhere a long distance i travel by plane and that's much better i hate road trips more then anything else and i don't know why what can cause such hatred and a severe phopia towards road trips what happened when you were younger were you involved in a terrible car crash and had to be rushed to the hospital in critical condition perhaps by a drunk trucker on the road who was driving in the same lane as you but in the opposite direction traumatic experiences like that can cause a phobia of long road trips by car however the stomachaches and headaches bathroom problems etc might also be a cause of motion sickness in this case carsickness for some people it may be a sometimes thing out of the blue sometimes carsickness may come as a result of doing certain things like eating and or reading in the car in your case it may be the cause of being in the car for a certain amount of time without a rest stop have you ever been nauseated on a road trip before and how do you handle being on a public bus like greyhound if you can't afford to fly a certain distance you need to get to it might be a safer alternative Public transport Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Road safety Speed limit Driver's license Hitchhiking Bike lane debate Freeway Traffic light Pain Decompression sickness Utility cycling Transportation in Beijing Recumbent bicycle Shaggy dog story Car handling Fecal incontinence Characters of Lost Theory of conduct Pitaten Mojave people Boston and Lowell Railroad Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
