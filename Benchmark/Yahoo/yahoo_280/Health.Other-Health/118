whats the difference between hma and ppo for insurance purposes and which one is better when buying a plan i'm guessing you meant hmo usually with an hmo you have to go to the dr that's on their list in their network the benefits are it's cheaper usually only have to pay a co pay for office visits but if you need to see a specialist you have to first go to your primary dr and have him refer you to the specialist this is usally the cheaper plan for most people families drawbacks your stuck with the drs on their list if your current dr isn't on the list too bad i remember when we changed insurance companies at work i ended up losing about good drs because they wouldn't work with our insurance company ppo's are generally good for single people that are fairly healthy you can go to any dr you want without a referral but you'll pay a higher co pay usually per visit you're not as restricted basically that's just been my experience with them either way insurance companies suck Health insurance Managed care Insurance Health maintenance organization Life insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared Publicly funded medicine Unemployment Preferred provider organization Annuity Wal-Mart Theory of conduct Bond Poker jargon Blackjack Mutual fund Term life insurance Unemployment benefit Pharmaceutical company Airline Adverse selection 401(k) Social Security (United States) Auto insurance Obesity Health care in the United States Microeconomics Price discrimination Professor Medicare (Canada) Apple Computer Primerica Financial Services Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax Variable universal life insurance Electrophysiology Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Octopus card National Insurance Gross domestic product Commodity markets Password Sweatshop Philosophical skepticism Medicine Central processing unit Trust (Law) USA CPU cache Arguments for and against drug prohibition Security (finance) Contract CPU design Taxation in Canada Risk management Social justice Citigroup Password cracking Ponzi scheme Compensation of employees Balikpapan Health savings account Anarchism and capitalism Rebreather Labour economics Public policy Wheel of Fortune Mortgage NASDAQ Redundant array of independent disks UK Singles Chart Economics Outsourcing Nuclear power Cable television Social security Lloyd's of London Computer Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation North American Numbering Plan Firefighter Commodore 64 Dividend Tai Chi Chuan Finance Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act Universal life insurance General practitioner Social Security debate (United States) Fuel injection Legal aspects of transsexualism Flat tax Employee Retirement Income Security Act Strategic management Trade Homeopathy Freeters Dwarfism Transformer
