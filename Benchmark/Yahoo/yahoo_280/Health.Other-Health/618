what could be causing this pain my mum has started to experience pain in her hand after using a wall paper stripping machine the pain is on the outside of her thumb and goes upto her wrist it does not hurt all the time but she gets really sharp shooting pains it is a nerve similar to what triggers carpel tunnel when you use any muscles or nerves that get more use than normal it can trigger off aches and pains i had to remove carpet staples a few weeks ago from the hard wood floors to prep for new carpet installation and by day if i so much as leaned on my one hand or bent my fingers i would be in tears the pain felt as if it was from my thumb and first finger up the vein area of my arm just above the hand any pressure on it would trigger a shooting pain your mom will most likely notice lessening over the next few days and eventually it will stop hurting but in the mean time a certain way she bends her wrist or puts pressure on it leaning with her hand will probably trigger these pains more it's no fun and an inconvenience it is best if she doesn't do any more strenuous work with that hand for now Professional wrestling holds Carpal tunnel syndrome Diving Aerial (dance move) Massage Pain Milton H.
