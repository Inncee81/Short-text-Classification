yawning me and mom were waching a commercial the other day and on this commercial the pepole were all yawning after it got to the middle we were both yawning whats the deal i v though about this befor and kinda just blew it off so are yawns contagious a yawn is a semi automatic reflex that originates in the brain stem in response to a lower level of oxygen in the brain yawning also occurs when a person loses interest in their surroundings i e gets bored it does not necessarily indicate fatigue although people do tend to yawn when they're sleepy a study was done in which heart rate skin effects and muscle tension were measured in young adults before during and after yawns they found that yawning did increase their level of arousal for a short time yawning is an action that occurs throughout the animal kingdom cats in particular seem to yawn a great deal in the late s several studies were done in rats and it was found that rats yawned more in the early morning before awakening and also when they were very hungry several different brain chemicals seem to be involved in yawning but the mechanisms are still not understood for example yawning seems to be contagious why is that just reading about yawning made me yawn several times in your case i doubt that a lack of oxygen is the main reason you yawn since your yawning spells seem to occur mainly around bedtime or during the middle of the night they probably are related to being sleepy and groggy Yawn Sleep Narcolepsy Traumatic brain injury Urinary incontinence Brain Eye Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia Decompression sickness Drowning Biology and sexual orientation Psychosis Ozone depletion Autism Radiation therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Reflexology Homeostasis Ozone hole Weight training Diazepam Explosive material Muscle Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diabetes mellitus Herpes simplex virus Heart Cephalic disorder Puberty Stopping power Reticular formation Epilepsy Dieting Fibromyalgia Parkinson's disease Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Clomipramine Welding Rabies Second language acquisition Intelligence quotient Child sexual abuse Cognitive science Wound healing phases Social psychology Nutrition Psoriasis Ozone layer Cat Fire fighting Human brain Tourette syndrome Motivation Cancer Intracranial pressure Vomiting Coma Insomnia Leukemia Clinical depression Asthma Urination Health issues and the effects of cannabis Multiple sclerosis Wood Thermoregulation Methamphetamine Myocardial infarction The Secret of NIMH Stuttering Planetary nebula Aphasia Allergy Functional magnetic resonance imaging 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate DNA repair Stem cell Biofeedback Daylight saving time Baldness Person Ojibwe language Gasoline Ear Mobile phone radiation and health M16 (rifle)
