can anyone prove that marijuana is harmful if used through a butane free vaporizer in this situation there would be no smoke that would release harmful carcinogens into the lungs and no harmful chemicals from flame or chemical lighters marijuana is well known in the medical field to relieve symtpons of alzheimers glaucoma depression and chronic pain it would be a wise decision for the government to pass out butane free vaporizers to medical marijuana users in my opinion so that no harmful carcinogens would be released during the inhaling of the marijuana please answer this question seriously to the marijuana protesters please concentrate your efforts on baning tobacco instead afterall it was a german who wanted to make marijuana illegal while promoting the sales of tobacco and beer some of the brightest doctors are of course germans if marijuana would be made legal oh how doctors would lose so much money that is to say of course the german doctors want you to drink beer and smoke you'll be seeing them and paying them more often when marijuana is vaporized it is not being smoked like a pack of cigs sorry to point you out as being wrong but using a vaporizer is not smoking marijuana it is vaporizing it for example the air vapir system utilizes a state of the art convection technology to heat herbal matter hot air is blown through a disk implanted with herbal material such as marijuana and other plants commonly used in aromatherapy the hot air induces the material to release its full flavor along with its active and volatile elements this easy to inhale vapor cloud is achieved without burning of the material without burning or smoking and just because people are near death doesnt mean they should be smoking marijuana they should be vaporizing it your whole idea backs up joanns point that doctors would lose out on the patients if they cheated by using marijuana marijuana is aka the poor mans heaven drug the united states is the perfect example of nazzism in this modern day with beer and alcohol sales the us government makes too much money from cancer patients and liver diseased dodos that got farked up from drinking and smoking to make marijuana legalized legalization of marijuana will never happen it would pretty much break the economy and bankrupt doctors all over the world so the question is why do doctors give it to people who are near death so they can enjoy life before dying so someone decided somewhere along the line that life was not meant to be enjoyed with marijuana and if it is given to people near their death stage then you are saying that it is helpful or beneficial in some way about henk and his comment about german phobia here is the german guy named harry j anslinger who had it in for the us as all germans in that nazi era did anslinger was an extremely ambitious man and he recognized the bureau of narcotics as an amazing career opportunity a new government agency with the opportunity to define both the problem and the solution he immediately realized that opiates and cocaine wouldn't be enough to help build his agency so he latched on to marijuana and started to work on making it illegal at the federal level anslinger immediately drew upon the themes of racism and violence to draw national attention to the problem he wanted to create some of his quotes regarding marijuana there are total marijuana smokers in the us and most are negroes hispanics filipinos and entertainers their satanic music jazz and swing result from marijuana use this marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with negroes entertainers and any others the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity criminality and death reefer makes darkies think they're as good as white men marihuana leads to pacifism and communist brainwashing you smoke a joint and you're likely to kill your brother marijuana is the most violence causing drug in the history of mankind and he loved to pull out his own version of the assassin definition in the year there was founded in persia the religious and military order of the assassins whose history is one of cruelty barbarity and murder and for good reason the members were confirmed users of hashish or marihuana and it is from the arabs' 'hashashin' that we have the english word 'assassin ' anslinger was a german henk truth be told on the page about why marijuana is illegal is in my source for everyone to read its not a german phobia issue its a racist issue about a german who hated anyone who wasnt his breed and didnt want anyone who wasnt of his breed to enjoy life heres to ya hater Lung cancer Drug addiction Harry J.
