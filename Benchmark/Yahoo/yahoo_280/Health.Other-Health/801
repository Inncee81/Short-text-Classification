pulmonary embolism i had a pulmonary embolism years ago i am f in descent health didn't use birthcontrol pills injections adhesives didn't go on a long trip car or plane so my doctor never gave me a reason why i had such a life threatening embolism a few days before i had it though i was in a single car accident in which i hit my nose on the steering wheel and it fractured along the middle of my nose i didn't pass out i was wearing my seatbelt didn't hit anything but my head on the steering wheel felt no pain in my chest immediately or even the next day so i don't think a broken nose could've caused it i also am pondering if i could have some kind of blood clotting disorder that caused it when i went through the pe it was tiring painful i couldn't even take care of my daughter and i could've died so i'm scared that if i have another one it could kill me this time anyone have any ideas what could cause this kind of pe thank you ps anyone go through something similar it doesn't seem unlikely that the nose fracture couldn't have had something to do with it but i would think that the embolism would have gone to the brain from the nose typically embolisms can happen while on birth control because it tends to thicken the blood since you weren't on bc has there been any family history it seems strange to me that your doctor would be so evasive as to why it happened i would see a specialist and take your records to them and see what questions you can get answered there is always aspirin therapy to keep the blood thinned out i hear it's the best thing ever created and to take a baby aspirin once a day for ultimate health of course you want to be under a doctors care and advice before doing that but definitely find someone more experienced than your current doctor Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pulmonary embolism Air embolism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hip fracture Medicine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aspirin Myocardial infarction Urinary incontinence Deep vein thrombosis Migraine Intravenous therapy Pope John Paul I Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asthma Childbirth Stomach cancer Time Out of Mind Characters of Lost Chest pain Rei Ayanami Shaggy dog story Oral contraceptive Paracetamol Atrial septal defect Prostate cancer Tobacco smoking Pulmonary hypertension Knots Landing Malaria Milton H.
