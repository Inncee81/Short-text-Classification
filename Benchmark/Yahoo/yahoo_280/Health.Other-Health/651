will i still need my tonsils removed i was put in the hospital for three days about two weeks ago due to severe tonsilitis after i got out my tonsils became infected and i was given new steroids and antibiotics i was set to get them removed wednesday but had a delayed allergic reaction to the medicine and broke out in a rash so the surgery was postponed while still slightly swollen my tonsils are much better i'm set to get them out on the nd but due to the obvious progress my throat has made will they still need to be removed i suffer several soar throats a year and was told that would end with the removal of my tonsils but if they are better i don't know if i should still get them out any past experiences and help is appreciated thanks well it was almost nearly closed up and it is a same day surgery obviously i've seen the specialist a few times and he had good reason to take them out but since it's been several weeks and with several medications they have gotten better but are still a little big they would be out already if i didn't have an allergic reaction to the antibiotics which i will no longer be able to take it was the best medicine possible and the only one that actually worked i guess i'll tell my mom they are better though i know one thing i never wanna have to go throw with this again it was really bad experience tells me that even if they get better they are coming out your dr decides to remove them by the number of times in a period of time they make you sick and it sounds frequent with you its not too bad overnight in the hospital bad sore throat for a couple of days but cold stuff helps it feel better and afterwards you wont have these problems anymore i found after having mine removed that i get over colds a lot faster now too good luck Tonsil Urinary incontinence Group A streptococcal infection Allergy Psoriasis Pharyngitis Traumatic brain injury Cephalexin Common cold Insulin Chronic fatigue syndrome Infectious mononucleosis Conjunctivitis Prostate cancer Asthma Medicine Radiation therapy Acne Stomach cancer Nasal congestion Babe Ruth Crohn's disease Syphilis Breastfeeding Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Ashlee Simpson Show Pneumonia Tattoo Lyme disease Eczema Stroke Tonsillectomy Antibiotic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Lupus erythematosus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obstetrics Weight training Heinkel He 100 First aid Saturday Night Live Shaggy dog story Adjustable gastric band Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Decompression sickness Kodocha Cancer Urticaria Multiple chemical sensitivity Theory of conduct Social rule AIDS Hal Trosky Health insurance Blonde on Blonde Fasting Cindy Sheehan Cellulitis Multiple sclerosis Clostridium difficile Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Great Teacher Onizuka 1925 serum run to Nome M__ni__re___s disease Big Brother (USA TV series) Fancy rat Dialysis Pitaten Hip fracture Ulcerative colitis Yarrow Scabies 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sampling (music) The Inside History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Upper respiratory tract infection Wonderland (McFly album) Diphtheria Equine conformation Ebola Stuttering Bone marrow transplant EastEnders Mouth ulcer 1957 World Series Medical cannabis Rocky Mountain spotted fever
