coping question i broke up with my boyfriend today and it went well it was several hours ago yet i still feel bad i'm still kind of shaking i rode my bike miles and i bought an energy drink actually that's probably why i'm shaking lol what do you do to help coping i'd like some kind of instant relief please and thank you the best instant relief that works for me is finding a quiet spot like a beach or nature trail sit down and take in the beauty of the world lay down look at the clouds or stars and just breath relax and think about the excitement you have ahead of you being newly single as for the long term relief you will feel some aches and pains it is never easy breaking up but it is all normal and will fade every time you get sad or uneasy remember you did it for a reason and change is hard sometimes best of luck to you Social rule Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Shake It Off Guilty Gear Mid-levels Anxiety Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
