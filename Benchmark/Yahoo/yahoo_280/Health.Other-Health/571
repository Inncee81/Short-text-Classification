about marijuana last night i tried marijuana for the first time the boys that gave it to me told me it wasn't regular marijuana i don't know what that meant but anyway i took quite a few puffs after a while they kept asking me if i felt it yet i didn't feel anything like the tingling they told me about that they said i should feel my body wasn't tingling but they told me my eyes were low and kinda red and i had the giggles too they also told me that for some people their first time smoking weed they didn't feel anything can someone explain to me what happened you should've coughed the first time and everyone would've had a good laugh if you didn't cough and if didn't hurt your throat you didn't inhale you don't smoke a joint like a cigarette practice making your lips into a round circle then take a deep breath in that's exactly how you smoke a joint when he said it wasn't regular marijuana he probably meant that it was chronic chronic is very expensive and very nice believe me you will know when you're high if you do it again smoke it in like i told you it'll hurt but a good hurt watching commercials is like watching a little movie you notice things like the music that you don't ordinarily notice it's fun good luck and have fun d Cannabis (drug) Mojave people Social rule Tobacco smoking Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Bong Cigarette Smoking Man Milton H.
