i am feeling real down and out today how do i pick myself up i am suffering from anxiety and am thinking today that i will never get better and get on with my life i am so scared to do anything i feel like my whole life is a waste of time and i am burdening everyone around me i don't feel like this all the time but today is one of those days yea today basically sucked for me as well but i just try to find ways of not thinking about the garbage by doing something fun such as listen to a favorite cd usually a ska band cuz they're impossible listen to without dancing haha my suggestion to you is to stop worrying about whatever it is for the moment and do something you enjoy that's fun watch a movie a comedy perhaps or listen to a favorite cd or play some video games or read a book anything that will take your mind off what is bothering you it's not bad to worry about things but it's not good to worry for an extended period of time so get away from it mentally and get preoccupied with something else thats fun Jon Secada Avenue Q The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Milton H.
