how long would a person have to continue on taking the drug before he becomes addicted i'm just wondering whether a person can try a drug and not get addicted to it or if there are stages that a person has to go through before he gets addicted how quickly a person will get addicted to a drug depends upon a lot of factors including his genes and the biology of his body differences among persons may cause one to take a drug and not be harmed by it at first but it could also cause another person to overdose on the first use and face severe consequences there are also stages that a person will go through before he is considered an addict the first would be the stage of experimenting if a person takes a drug once and never does so again then the stage of experimenting would be just that and the person will not turn into an addict however when the person has come to terms with the feeling of euphoria and keeps on taking the drug again and again until he becomes dependent upon it then that's when he has become addicted to the drug Drug addiction Addiction Drug abuse Methamphetamine Narcotic Opioid Alcoholism Bipolar disorder Cocaine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Illegal drug trade Cannabis (drug) Diazepam Rat Park Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Motivation Clinical depression Psychedelic drug Substance abuse Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Amphetamine Hypoglycemia Anxiety Sexual orientation Prostate cancer LSD Withdrawal Red Hot Chili Peppers Cancer Paracetamol Consensual crime Tobacco smoking Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs The Hasheesh Eater Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Antidepressant Biology Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Grief Alprazolam Suicide Controlled Substances Act Borderline personality disorder Harm reduction Drug overdose Sexual addiction Paroxetine Bradley Nowell Doxepin Traumatic brain injury Pharmaceutical company Medicine Sleep Obsessive-compulsive disorder Buprenorphine Lorazepam Human sexual behavior Urinary incontinence Orgasm Drug test Sid Vicious Psychosis Bene Gesserit Traditional Chinese medicine Hydrocodone Physician Daredevil John Holmes (actor) Speedball (drug) Transsexuality Abortion debate Suicide methods Arguments for and against drug prohibition Biology and sexual orientation Responsible drug use Amineptine Iggy Pop AIDS Hard drug Phil Anselmo Hepatitis C Psychology of religion Adverse effect (medicine) Dopamine Epilepsy Crystal methamphetamine and sex Twin Hypnosis Death Kurt Cobain Fitz Hugh Ludlow Anorexia nervosa Barbiturate Methadone Morphine Human Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Duesberg hypothesis Narcissism Domestic violence
