is it really bad for you to crack your knuckles what are the short term and long term effects some people say its ok to do and others say its bad i want to know the truth likely not i'm not saying definitely no because while cracking knuckles is common research on its effects is not we have only a handful of studies on the subject none shows a definite link between knuckle cracking and arthritis however cracking your knuckles is neither harmless nor desirable the arthritis connection may be an old wives' tale but cracking your knuckles can hurt your hand in other ways and there's no benefit to it some students crack their knuckles after writing a great deal but cracking knuckles isn't a solution for writer's cramp instead take a break and bend and stretch out your fingers a few times kids may develop a habit of cracking their knuckles because they like the sound the crack comes because of a change in the synovial fluid the lubricant that bathes the joints when finger bones are suddenly stretched apart the space between the joints widens and an air bubble forms in the synovial fluid the bubble quickly bursts and makes a sharp sound nature did not intend us to repeatedly stretch the ligaments of the finger joints i found two medical articles that talked about patients who had injured their hands from knuckle cracking one over stretched his ligaments and dislocated his fingers another partially tore the ligament in her thumb in a researcher looked at the hand function in adults age and above he didn't find a greater tendency toward arthritis in the habitual knuckle crackers but the knuckle crackers were more likely to have swollen hands and reduced hand strength however an accompanying editorial posed this idea perhaps a person must have looser than average ligaments in order to crack knuckles in the first place and those loose ligaments and joints may set the person up for other sorts of joint damage in another study published back in the researcher visited an old age home and asked patients whether or not they had cracked their knuckles when they were young he found who remembered they had and who remembered they had not when the researcher x rayed their hands and compared the two groups he found no difference in arthritis rates what does cause arthritis there are many kinds of arthritis but the most common osteoarthritis is a function of age and genetic predisposition if you x ray hands of people age percent will have arthritis osteoarthritis tends to be a bit worse in the dominant hand the bottom line while cracking knuckles may not get you arthritis faster it won't win you many fans and might injure those fingers in other ways so it's best not done Carpal tunnel syndrome Equine conformation Rheumatoid arthritis Knee Arthritis COX-2 inhibitor Prostate cancer Hand Joint Tai Chi Chuan Massage Welding Anterior cruciate ligament Harp Gout First aid Punch (strike) Password Poker jargon Milton H.
