headache advice i have headaches almost everyday after work any advice on how to relieve them prescription medicine isn't always the answer although sometimes it can be incredibly helpful but i suggest trying other methods first since the headaches occur after work i must assume they are stress induced you need to find ways to relax yourself however reading may not be the best solution as this can be strenuous for your eyes especially with a headache try watching a non action film or when you get home arrange talks with your friends walks are especially helpful as not only does it provide exercise but even if you don't have a friend to talk to listening to calming music while you walk can really clear your head however if this doesn't help the headache or even makes it worse then try other approaches medicine being one of them make an appointment with your doctor and discuss your symptoms he will be able to diagnose the cause far better than i ever could also try relaxing during work every once in awhile contract your muscles slowly for ten seconds from the feet to your shoulders individually and breath slowly for each contraction this can help de stress you at work and can help you relax lastly avoid caffeinated drinks such as coffee and soda since both can cause an addiction and cause withdrawal you may even want to simply limit their consumption rather than going cold turkey instead bring a water bottle to work drinking more water really can help improve your mood and how you feel make sure to stay hydrated and this could also help with your headaches i'm not a doctor so i can't diagnose everything properly but i'm certain that some of these approaches should help you with your headaches either way i would consult with your doctor so you can be properly diagnosed i suggest you see a do rather than an md a do will look at the entire body and will try and find the root of a specific problem while an md will simply prescribe medication to limit the effects however both doctors should be able to help you best of luck Insomnia Drug addiction Caffeine Prostate cancer Clinical depression Chronic fatigue syndrome Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Cannabis (drug) Decompression sickness Hypoglycemia Anxiety Asthma Bipolar disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Common cold Psoriasis Addiction Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hyperthermia Meditation Sleep Word of Wisdom Cancer Multiple sclerosis Childbirth Aikido Stuttering Reflexology Breastfeeding Myocardial infarction Massage Milton H.
