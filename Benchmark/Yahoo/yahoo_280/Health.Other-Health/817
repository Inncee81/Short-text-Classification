why does my yr old keep running fevers read for more info the fever will come on and last for about days not a high fever more on the low side sometimes coughing will come with it but other times it doesn't this afternoon he said his tummy was hurting then said he was cold temp here w heat index so it wasn't cool out by any means that was when i realized he had a fever again the fever comes and goes about x a month sometimes he'll go a month w o any this has been going on for close to a year now it's mostly in the summer months tho i took him to the doc awhile bac and was told it was a cold he was giving several diff cough meds but none worked triamintic seems to work better than prescrp meds for him we did move into a new used home last yr at this same time not sure if that has anything to do with it or not i know ppl has allergy probs but i don't think that would explain the reoccuring fevers any idea what's causing the fever all the time like i said he has already seen a doc but still don't know anything he also stays peaky looking i am by no means dark i am as light colored as can be so i don't know whether to think he has taken after me with the light color skin or if there is actually something else wrong his blood was checked back in nov and it was a little low then they ran sum test but only came up with having a cold but he has always been real light is there any certain thing that could cause him to be light skinned children of his age quite commonly suffer mystery fevers unfortunately they think it's a normal response to viral infections which can take up to two weeks to get conquered he could also be suffering from an allergy to something the first things i think i would check would be the filter on the a c or the water pan in a swamp cooler mold or mildew in either spot could be the cause of the low grade fever or cough an allergic responce can and does cause low grade fever especially in little ones it is a response of the immune system and the first line of defense is to raise the body temperature body cells can function quite well in the higher temperature while bacteria and virus can't when the allergen level drops off the immune response would back off and his temperature would drop the fact he's coughing makes me suspect this is something he's breathing it coughing is the body's way of reducing or eliminating things that irritate the respiratory tract his skin color is a genetic thing although if he is staying on the sickly side he might look paler because his little body is always on the fight try checking the various filters and do a big clean on things like carpet pillows and drapes my son had a run like this at the same age and i ended up putting some lysol disinfectant in the rug cleaner as well as the wash for the pillows and drapes i used the anti allergen spray all over the place and loads of bleach cleaner on just about every washable surface there was we never did figure out what it was that caused it all but he did get better as he got older the pediatrician said sometimes that's how it goes with the little ones we did discover our a c unit filter was loaded with pollen and mold spores we just changed it out monthly when it had to run and i sprayed like a nutter with the allergen spray for the peaky look i'd make sure he's getting a multivitamin mineral chewable every day to make sure that's covered and as long as the fever isn't getting up there and if it stayed near my peds doesn't recommend doing anything to bring it down he said push the liquids and let the body do what it does best it's not the fever that is the enemy it's whatever is spurring it on i know what you mean about the pale i personally think i can give a snowbank a run for the money and my kids are all on the pale side as well so that could be genetic just trust your instinct on that you will know from the way he looks overall if it's a pale from genes or a pale from sickly look at his eyes not the skin bright eyes are healthy
