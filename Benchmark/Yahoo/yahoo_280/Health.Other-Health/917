when you're afraid you gulp i dunno but sometimes when i'm afraid i start to gulp and i can't even control it it's like the saliva must go in rather painfull and sometimes and the only way you can ease yourself is to gulp but then your throat moves and people can tell you're afraid gaah why does this happen hey its the same with me there's nothin to worry about it i know its annoying cos every moment you feel that people are getting to know that you are uncomfortable or scared but then its helpless and then you can always disguise it as a natural gulp by trying to control your facial expression cos a lot of people gulp not from fear but by habit aaaaaaaaaaahhhh anyways keep smiling and face your fears bravely Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
