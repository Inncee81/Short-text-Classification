do you like walking outside and somebody in front of you is smoking and the smoke comes up right up to your face and you breath it in then your hair smells your clothes smell what do you think about it i personally hate it what do you think about it my work place has places set aside outdoors for both smokers and non smokers they both have benches and are shaded from the elements unfortunately they weren't smart about the respective locations because the non smokers are upwind worse the smokers congregate directly in front of the doors making it next to impossible for a non smoker to enter without having to hold his her breath while running the gauntlet of second hand smoke one time i politely asked the smokers to move away from the doors but you'd think that i asked them to jump off a cliff judging by their reaction or should i say lack of it they glowered at me but didn't do anything i then complained to upper echelons but nothing came of it i put signs on the doors which read please do not block doorway notice that it doesn't mention smokers but apparently smokers can't read i don't have to use that entrance but unfortunately it's the most convenient considering that there is plenty of space all around the entrance it astonishes me that anyone would want to hang around so close to it regardless we live in a society where people tend to react violently to the smallest provocation i belong to many blog sites and you would not believe peoples' misinterpretations and subsequent reactions to the least offensive things that are said when was the last time you asked someone to turn down their car stereo and lived to tell about it i presume that you are speaking in general terms but equally generally speaking everyone should deal with it as best you can if you're a smoker would it kill you to move if you're a non smoker can you find another way around btw this actually happened today as i parked my car i saw two co workers walking around the building which many of us do when we need a break one of them held a coffee cup in one hand a cigarette dangled in her mouth and a lighter in her other hand did she think that by walking she'd offset the effects of the cigarette or the caffeine for that matter p s the word is breathe please don't beat me up The Smoking Room Mojave people Bong Cigarette Smoking Man Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cigarette Cigar Shaggy dog story Smoking ban Theory of conduct Kitchen Microeconomics Social rule James Bond Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Tobacco Sailing Fire fighting The Time Machine Common cold Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Conspiracy (TNG episode) One Piece minor characters The Amber Spyglass Diving The Inside Office Milton H.
