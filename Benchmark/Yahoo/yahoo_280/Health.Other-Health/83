doctor falsing accusing me of doing drugs can i sue hello i have had migraines my entire life and said i took tylenol pm but they didn't help i had to take many but i asked to get helped and to get him to take me to a neurologist he said he wanted to take me to an small group insane asilum because i took drugs daily he told me i was hiding something and i told him you can check my blood now or any day you want and im negative one of my parents used to beat me up in the head daily with a hair brush for minutes really hard and i asked if maybe that's why i have headaches and migraines daily and he looked at me as if i was lying i almost burst to tears because he said so many horrible things to be when all i want is get medical help he said i should be around people like me but i never said anything he saw my bf and kicked him out of the room angry and then he left the office and started joking around with the nurses then he told me he was the only way of life sorry for the spelling i was in a rush i think it's time for you to see someone else he sounds like a quack and a nut case doctors are supposed to help you with your problems and if what you say about your parent beating you on the head with a hairbrush then it's very possible that is why you have the migraines headaches but it may not be the only reason if you have a choice go to another doctor and see what that person says it's a patient's right to a nd opinion Migraine Cluster headache Chronic fatigue syndrome One Tree Hill (TV series) Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Prostate cancer One Piece minor characters Hal Trosky Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Headache Quackery Epilepsy Urinary incontinence Stroke Triage YuYu Hakusho Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Hearsay Terri Schiavo Paget's disease of bone Psychiatric hospital 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Lamotrigine Drug test Physical examination Myocardial infarction Knots Landing StarCraft: Uprising Hypoglycemia Folic acid Piccolo Junior Saga Medicine Chlorpromazine Multiple chemical sensitivity Gastroparesis Le Malade imaginaire Milton H.
