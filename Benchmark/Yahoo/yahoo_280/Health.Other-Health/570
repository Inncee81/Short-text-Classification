can someone please read details explain hiccups and tell how to get rid of them i've had hiccups a lot in my long life and i was told they are caused by a spasm of the diaphragm when i was a kid my mother used the scare tactic on me sneak up from behind and scare me and it worked the sharp intake of breath seems to reset the diaphragm unfortunately once i learned that my mother would do this i no longer gasped in surprise because i expected it i've tried a lot of remedies since then and the only one that usually works is this without anything in your mouth sit comfortably and swallow three times while holding your breath and keeping your mouth closed this does not sound so hard until you try it but it actually requires a great deal of concentration somehow focusing all this concentration on swallowing seems to have the same effect as the involuntary air intake Hiccup Carburetor Drowning Bong Stuttering Epilepsy Trumpet Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breath Microphone Milton H.
