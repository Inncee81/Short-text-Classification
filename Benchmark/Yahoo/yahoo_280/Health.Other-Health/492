i honestly think it might be a panic attack or something along those lines one day i went to school in your average black and white converse stupidly forgetting the school rules when i get to the door the security guard stops me and tells me to go and stand in the corner with the other kids who broke the uniform policy at first i was okay but cursing at myself then they took all of us to the cafiteria where i start to think the dreaded what ifs about what they were going to do with me if i was going to get in trouble and worsely what my parents were going to say as soon as they told us to sit i went to the front empty table then it was starting to get hard for me to breath i started crying hard my vision getting blurry then i was hardly able to breath the security guard took me to the bathroom and i had the feeling i had to vomit when i tried to nothing happened just me coughing heavily something similar happened month later when i got my first detention just not as bad nothing else has happened since march okay so it's pretty much a panic attack right as if my heart beat faster yes it does but does the fact that i have asthma sp have to do anything with this and if anyone is wondering no i don't use an inhaler i just have the petty kind of asthma but still it is asthma i finally got back to class when st period was half way done i didn't completely calm down till second period was complete also when i went to the rapids water park i suddenly had some chest pains my dad was worried but it happens once in a blue moon for me when i have chest pains well arn't i some peice of work p yeah that's a panic attack welcome to the club i feel you there i used to flip out when i got in trouble too now that i'm older i just have other things to flip out about i can't get through it without medication you may want to see your school counsellor or talk with your parents about it if they'll be available for you the best non medicine cure for a panic attack is distraction talk with a friend about something you or they like and try to do as much of the talking as possible it helps regulate your breathing and lie down if you feel dizzy or at least sit with your head on a desk or table passing out probably wouldn't make you feel any better p Columbine High School massacre Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Asthma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Panic attack 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Shining (film) Time Out of Mind God Emperor of Dune Ben Johnson (athlete) Milton H.
