does smiling really release endorphins i've heard somewhere that when you smile you release some endorphins is this true or not it can be infered from the wikipedia entry linked below that the physical act of smiling does not release endorphins that's probably because voluntary smiling is simply a muscle reaction the entry mentions the polite or fake smile that we see and use daily ala saying thank you to a clerk as for involuntary smiles i'm sure those coinscide with an endorphine release but the release is tied to the emotional reaction not the physical act of smiling Smile Endorphin Addiction Facial expression Orgasm Drug addiction Self-harm Body language Yawn Involuntary commitment E-meter Simplified molecular input line entry specification Autonomic nervous system Mona Lisa Urinary incontinence Muscle Spider-Man 2 Facial Action Coding System User Friendly Comedy Defecation Anxiety Sadism and masochism Deprogramming Good Vibrations Alcoholics Anonymous Russell's paradox Opioid Jackass: The Movie Source engine Nicomachean Ethics 20/20 (album) Laughter Smiley Smile Yoko Ono Miranda warning Cognitive science Objectivist philosophy Medea (play) Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Soul Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Zoophilia Pain play Terri Schiavo We Belong Together Stuttering Our Friends in the North Queen (band) Sherlock Holmes History of nuclear weapons Social rule The Beach Boys Elvis Costello Inference Psychosis Victor Cousin Cordelia Chase Philosophy of language David Hartley (philosopher) Human sexual response cycle Exit counseling Out-of-body experience Hall & Oates Real-time strategy The Matrix Online Manslaughter Premature ejaculation Blonde on Blonde Punishment Emoticon Human sexual behavior Probation officer Euthanasia Nuclear fission Lawyer Mass Superman: The Movie Motivation Shanice Determinism Essential tremor Biomechanics Salah Chemistry resources Smile Empty Soul Unemployment Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi Hearing (sense) Smiling Faces Sometimes Jinyong Patriotism Smile (album) Happiness House of Leaves Drama Gratitude Queen II Physical intimacy Biochemistry
