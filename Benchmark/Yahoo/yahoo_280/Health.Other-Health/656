how can i get an elderly client to cooperate when it is time to get her ready for bed she's and when i see her i'm supposed to have her washed up and in her nightgown by o'clock when i finish my shift someone comes to spend the night with her but she doesn't want to get off the couch when i tell her it's time it takes half an hour to get her ready but she won't listen to me even if she agrees that she's ready to get ready for bed she does nothing to get up i put her walker in front of her but she won't put her hands on it so i can help her up she just acts like she didn't agree to get up i don't know how to deal with her since i can't very well grab her and force her to cooperate and i can't yell at her or anything like that i'm very polite and pleasant with her but it's so frustrating the person that spends the night is not hired to do her personal care just to be there perhaps you can mix up the routine a little bit this is what we used to do at a skilled nursing facility i used to work at the first time she is assisted to the bathroom after she has eaten her dinner have the bathroom set up for her bedtime routine wash her dentures have her rinse out her mouth have everything you need nearby for her to wash up a bit have her bedclothing in the bathroom as well perhaps you can light a scented candle if safe to do so to make this a less stressful experience for both of you then once she is all spruced up and fresh let her go back to the couch and relax for the rest of the eve until your relief nurse gets there another little trick is to have warm water in the sink and float a small bottle of scented lotion in there when she's done washing she can be rewarded with a nice backrub with warm sweet smelling lotion alternatively perhaps a wash basin brought to her good luck and much patience to you nursemom Certified Nursing Assistant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Kitchen Treehouse of Horror IV Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ron and Fez Japanese tea ceremony Married... with Children The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Knots Landing Futurama (TV series - season 5) Social rule Japanese toilet Characters in the Smurfs Milton H.
