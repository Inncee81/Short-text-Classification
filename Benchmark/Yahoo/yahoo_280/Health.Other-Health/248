is it a good idea to tell somebody that the person needs help the girl told me that she can t stop paying for her school because she sign a contract and she already put down dollars already she have to put down for school and she already training for the tsa job at the airport but the process takes long but the problem is she not making enough money she makes something a week and she have to put down every week sometimes she don t have enough money to travel to work and come back sometimes i get mad at her because i always help her she told me don t tell nobody about my situation so instead of keep helping her should i tell somebody at work or can they realize somethiong wrong also they won t refund her money she try to reason with them but they want her to pay the money every week because she mess up before so is it the best thing to tell somebody so they can help her if i do that she probably won t be friends no more but i don t know is the right thing to do her work cannot do anything to help because essentially its not their problem she made the agreement with the school to pay them and in return the made an agreement to educate her if she is still in school and wants to stop going and paying she needs to talk to the school about resigning if she already finished school and is just making loan payments then she will have to contact whoever the loan is through and work out a better payment plan Social rule Friends Marshall Plan Contract Deflation (economics) Money The Amazing Race Pitaten Schabir Shaik Trial Gold standard Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Usury Mensal__o scandal Islamic banking Ocean's Twelve Octopus card Secretar__a de Inteligencia Great Teacher Onizuka 401(k) Mortgage John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Advance fee fraud Bretton Woods system Health insurance Avenue Q Unemployment benefit Therion (band) Student loan Leeds United F.C.
