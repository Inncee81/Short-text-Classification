do you have to let a new doctor know of your medical history is it the law i am seeing a new doctor and there a some things i prefer not to divulge i know it's a bit confusing but the new doc is a podiatrist not related in any way for my ongoing medical condition and has nothing to to do with or would have any effect on my medical condition i completely understand that the doctor would not be held liable if something were to happen to me and that's ok with me i need antibiotics for a toe infection instead of having foot surgery current doc refuses meds and insists on surgery i have already spoken to my pharmacist and the antibiotics would not interact with any of my current medications probably a podiatrist wouldn't have to know everything but he should be made aware of your general health and what medications you are taking to make sure he doesn't prescribe something that conflicts with medications you are already taking conditions like diabetes are very important for a podiatrist to know Podiatrist Doctorate Medical prescription Physician Traditional Chinese medicine Chronic fatigue syndrome Iatrogenic Cephalexin Cellulitis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pneumonia Folic acid Prostate cancer Adverse effect (medicine) Diabetes mellitus Traumatic brain injury Epilepsy Doctor Health profession Pharmacy Breastfeeding Tuberculosis Medical school Transsexuality Childbirth Eczema First aid Cardiovascular disease Foot Diarrhea Pharmaceutical company Pharmacist Obesity Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Quackery Common cold Osteoarthritis Malaria Medical analysis of circumcision Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stomach cancer General practitioner Cornea transplant Homeopathy Hypertension Army Medical Department (United States) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rabies Autism Physical therapy Fecal incontinence Coeliac disease Gout Gastroparesis Legionellosis Dentistry Antibiotic Crohn's disease History of medicine Emergency contraception Dermatology Bill Frist High-heeled shoe Complication (medicine) Spina bifida Gangrene Triage Terri Schiavo Scientology beliefs and practices Diabetic neuropathy Theory of conduct Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Stroke Causality Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses History of intersex surgery Medical record Surgery Infectious disease Diabetic retinopathy Herpes simplex virus Asthma History of male circumcision Mental Health Act 1983 Infantilism Bipolar disorder Migraine Ciprofloxacin Atherosclerosis Phimosis Hearing impairment Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Chinese University of Hong Kong Maprotiline Medical Assistant Multiple sclerosis Female genital cutting
