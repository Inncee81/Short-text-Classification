is it bad for my back to keep sleeping on an air mattress we just moved and we're moving again in a year we got rid of my crappy old mattress when we moved so my mom won't get me a regular mattress until next time we move because she doesn't want to have to move extra stuff so she has me sleep on an air mattress in a regular bed frame but the air mattress caves in so i have to put boxes under it but they slide back out to the sides so there is always a trough in the middle that i fall into i usually can't fall asleep for at least an hour and i sometimes wake up with back pain am i permanently damaging myself i'm yes air matresses aren't good for your back if you're just feeling sore my advice is to try sleeping in a different possition or with extra pillows under and or around you if that doesn't work try sleeping somewhere else even a couch would do it's got some support and definitely won't slide out from under you but if you're feeling true back pain and you're lacking necessary sleep my advice is that you ask your parent for a matress yes its extra weight when moving but if you hurt your back badly at your age there very well is a chance that it will cause permanant damage in the future spine's are terribly delecate and back pain is common nowadays if space when you're moving is the problem i'm sure it could be strapped on top of a car your back is important and air matresses were never intended for long time use there's no equal substitute to a real matress but if that truelly isn't an option try getting memory foam there are matress cover ones available that just go over what you already have and it may help your back but i still stick to just pressuring your parent to get a matress Casualty lifting Equine conformation The Fairly OddParents Upholstery Professional wrestling holds Futurama (TV series - season 5) Vacuum mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Floppy disk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Waterbed Aerial (dance move) First aid Spanking Back pain Strap-on dildo Pillow Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Out-of-body experience Poker jargon The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Scuba set Kurt Cobain Insomnia Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Amber Spyglass Urinary incontinence The Catcher in the Rye Skateboarding trick Theory of conduct The Shining (film) French Defence Sleep Dream Heinkel He 112 Pitaten Apollo 8 The Critic Knots Landing Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Social rule Jam (TV series) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Massage Bedbug Good Morning, Vietnam Phoebe Halliwell Undergarment Volleyball Sin City Narcolepsy Wheel of Fortune Breastfeeding The Amazing Race Carpal tunnel syndrome Daylight saving time Hip fracture Diving Humphrey Bogart 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Movie projector Odysseus Naruto jutsu Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Professional wrestling match types Quicksort Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Pok__mon Live!
