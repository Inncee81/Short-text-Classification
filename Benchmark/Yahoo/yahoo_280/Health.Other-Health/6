why did you ask your health questions here i'm just looking for some clarification a lot of the health questions on here seem to be very specific and some people are even asking questions that deal with life and death matters why do you turn to strangers on yahoo rather than a doctor or a nurse in your area is health care costs too expensive just to talk to a doctor do you think you will find a better answer than a professional will give you i'm just so confused i would hate to feel as if this was my only health information option if i were in some dire need of medical attention what do you think i think people sometimes need confirmation that they really do need to see a doctor they might also want to know what to expect so they ask people who have been there before i also think a lot of those life and death situations are written from posers who are just plain bored you have to realize this is a great place for anonymity and people abuse it by making up lives that don't resemble their own in the slightest Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Ethics National Health Service Adult attention-deficit disorder Infantilism Prostate cancer Mental Health Act 1983 Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Scientology beliefs and practices Social rule National Kidney Foundation Singapore Medicine Health science Drug abuse Life insurance Nurse Stomach cancer Milton H.
