i was just prescribed effexor and i also use marijauna will these have a bad interaction no marijuana does not negatively interact with any other drugs however you may not like how you feel when you are using both some people do not like the marijuana high mixed with antidepressants or pain medications because they feel too sleepy or too relaxed so try it out and see if you like how you feel if you do not like the high while on the meds eat and drink a decent meal to cut the buzz and don't do it again i agree with the above posters about efexor being a dangerous drug read http en wikipedia org wiki effexor people on this drug have a high instance of suicide it is supposed to be used only when no other categories of antidepressants have worked and has a ton of negative physical side effects just because a doctor prescribed it does not mean it is a good treatment option you might want to seek a second opinion from a different doctor and try something else first also the drug raises seratonin levels the same thing the marijuana does maybe sticking with the pot is the best solution for your depression and or anxiety just be careful with whatever choice you make and again i seriously urge you to seek another opinion and treatment option Antidepressant Clinical depression Venlafaxine Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Cannabis (drug) Anorexia nervosa Paroxetine Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Addiction Maprotiline Bipolar disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Clomipramine Insomnia Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Fibromyalgia Serotonin Panic attack Tricyclic antidepressant Post-traumatic stress disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bupropion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anxiety Medical cannabis Fecal incontinence Borderline personality disorder St John's wort Cocaine Drug addiction Alcoholism Cannabis Sleep apnea Folic acid Illegal drug trade Hypoglycemia Tianeptine Medicine Psoriasis Lamotrigine Haloperidol Chlorpromazine Psychopharmacology Malaria Migraine Diazepam Isotretinoin Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fluoxetine Marijuana parties Adverse effect (medicine) Antipsychotic LSD Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Sertraline Hashish Chemical imbalance theory Stroke Electroconvulsive therapy Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor Narcotic Homeopathy Narcolepsy Parkinson's disease Transactional analysis Schizophrenia Obesity Stuttering Drug abuse Obsessive-compulsive disorder Transsexuality Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Trimipramine Sleep Monoamine oxidase inhibitor Gastroparesis Sigmund Freud Epilepsy Citalopram Psychotherapy Indomethacin Internet troll Ethics Alprazolam Anxiolytic Health insurance Childbirth COX-2 inhibitor
