why do people abuse vicodin why do people find vicodin addicting what does it do to them vicodin is very addictive it's 'hydrocodone' a 'substitute' for codeine i live with 'severe pain ' and have a prescription for vicodin but evidently there is something in my body that doesn't react to it the way most people do frankly i've been without any vicodin for over three weeks now taking just acetominophen and i can't tell any difference at all other people though tell me that they feel 'slightly high' and 'invincible' when on vicodin i can't 'argue' with that i suppose but it doesn't do anything for me except relieve part of my pain it's not the 'high' that is addicting though it's the 'chemical reaction' to vicodin in the body but again i seem to be 'immune' to that too so in a way i'm like you and wondering why so many people abuse the drug Hydrocodone Controlled Substances Act Analgesic Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Addiction Rush Limbaugh Drug abuse Prohibition (drugs) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Methamphetamine Duesberg hypothesis Codeine Migraine The Marshall Mathers LP Clinical depression Cannabis (drug) Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Antidepressant Alcoholism Prostate cancer Withdrawal Rick James LSD Asthma Chronic fatigue syndrome Diazepam Osteoarthritis Allergy Obsessive-compulsive disorder Narcotic Bipolar disorder Methadone Anxiety Illegal drug trade Kurt Cobain Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Rat Park Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tobacco smoking House, M.D. Psychosis Traumatic brain injury Narcissism Promethazine Convention on Psychotropic Substances Post-traumatic stress disorder Self-harm Dextropropoxyphene Fitz Hugh Ludlow Morphine Domestic violence Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Methylphenidate Herpes simplex virus Anti-psychiatry Diarrhea Eastern Orthodox Church Insulin Medical prescription Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Irritable bowel syndrome Symbiosis (TNG episode) Medicine Good Times Aspartame Acne Harm reduction COX-2 inhibitor Chemical reaction Medical cannabis Cocaine Homeopathy Sadism and masochism Urticaria Opium Dualism (philosophy of mind) Hay fever Alcohol Dana Plato Endometriosis Raw food diet AIDS reappraisal Social rule Brett Favre Anorexia nervosa Explosive material Drug test Elvis Presley Torture Haloalkane Fibromyalgia First aid Sedative Borderline personality disorder
