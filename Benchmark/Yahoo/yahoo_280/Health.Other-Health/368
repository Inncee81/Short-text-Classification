why did i feel so sick i'm going to be a freshman and today was the first day of volleyball tryouts when i got there i felt fine and ready to work but as the tryouts progressed i started to feel sicker and sicker about minutes into the tryouts i started to have a little trouble breathing but that was just because i was working my body harder than i usually do and then i started to feel tired and a little dizzy lightheaded i think there the same thing eventually i started feeling like i was going to throw up and so i asked to go to the bathroom and i almost threw up but i didn't so i went to the bathroom and sat on the floor for a few minutes and i started to feel better i went to the bathroom because i didn't want to make a big deal out of it and ruin my chances i started feeling bad again so i asked my coach if i could sit and he asked if i felt dizzy lightheaded and i said no because again i didn't want to make a big deal out of it but i did say that my stomach sort of hurt and he said to just stand because that would be better than standing he also said to drink water but the water made me feel sick because it was warm i also forgot my water bottle and i was really thirsty so maybe i was dehydrated what do you think was wrong it was also hot and i was sweating alot i also have a sunburn but i don't know if that had anything to do with it except for the fact that it may have made me hotter warmer same thing this actually happened last night and i was just wondering so that the same thing doesn't happen at the nd day of practice tonight i'm sure it's not a mental issue because i do get enough rest and i eat the right foods which means i get enough nutrition could be heat stroke go see a doctor if it doesn't go away tomorrow Hyperthermia Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dehydration Ron Weasley Avenue Q Social rule Water Jackass: The Movie Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fecal incontinence Aerial (dance move) Piccolo Junior Saga Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Sandy Koufax Diving Sin City Jam (TV series) One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chronic fatigue syndrome Jon Secada Sauna Dialysis Satchel Paige Kitchen Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Survival skills Cigarette Smoking Man Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hiccup Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Friends Volleyball YuYu Hakusho Little Britain The Death Gate Cycle 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pitaten Fiddler on the Roof Ex-gay Mojave people Marilyn Monroe Panic attack Traumatic brain injury Futurama (TV series - season 5) Russian joke Good Morning, Vietnam Poker jargon The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Drinking Blood on the Tracks Babe Ruth Hiberno-English Drowning Grandview, U.S.A.
