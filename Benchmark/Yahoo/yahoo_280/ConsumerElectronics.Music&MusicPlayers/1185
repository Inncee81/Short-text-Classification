anybody know any music websites that work mp players this is actually very rare most music that is downloaded from stores are copy protected via drm and is one of the cases against using 'legally purchased' downloaded music also they are in their own propriety formats i have heard emi now offer drm free music on itunes but are more expensive than normal you might be able to convert these to mp if you find the correct software best bet really is to buy the cd its usually cheaper anyway especially at ebay and discount stores and use media player to 'rip' the tracks to mp yourself ITunes Music Store Digital rights management ITunes FairPlay IPod Online music store Jon Lech Johansen Digital audio player RealNetworks MP3 We Belong Together Gramophone record Compact disc Trusted computing UK Singles Chart Digital photography Karaoke Floppy disk Rhapsody (online music service) SonicStage DVD QuickTime Apple Computer Podcasting First-sale doctrine Napster (pay service) MAME Sony Commodore 64 GNU General Public License Ebook MiniDisc Copy protection Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Publishing ILife Streaming media File sharing Laserdisc Windows Media Audio Musical Instrument Digital Interface Warp Records Copyright infringement Compact audio cassette Secure Digital card Vorbis Mixtape Arbitrage Verizon Wireless Spyware Macrovision Copyright Wal-Mart Windows XP Stardock Intellectual property Video game music ROM image Rootkit Computer virus Copyleft GNU Free Documentation License Sega Dreamcast Winamp Sears Holdings Corporation Copyright infringement of software Walkman Super Audio CD Blackjack Bbc.co.uk TLC Modchip Tesco PlayStation Portable Windows Vista Neopets Microeconomics Napster Slot machine Nintendo Revolution BitTorrent Internet fraud Comparison of media players Mozilla Firefox Macromedia Flash Shake It Off PostScript Electronic commerce Creative Zen Digital download Bulk vending Poker jargon Digital Radio Mondiale Screenshot Ripping Abandonware Betting (poker) Price discrimination Pretty Good Privacy
