is it safe to jerry rig a non powered subwoofer to fit a jack meant for a powered subwoofer i recently bought a pawned jvc surround sound system and the subwoofer that came with it is not powered but the only available subwoofer channel is for a powered subwoofer if i were to splice the speaker wire from the subwoofer into an analog a v plug and plug it in is there a possibility it would damage the reciever or subwoofer first of all where are you getting the power for the passive sub from passive nonpower active powered you need a couple of things for anything to work first you need a sub channel that's crossed over meaning it's split the highs from the lows so that only the low frequencies that the sub should be getting are the only ones that it is getting then after the cross over you need the power to push the sub i say that because if you try to splice the signal into another powered channel for the other speakers you will get a full range of sound not just the lows and you also can't run power through a cross over it has to be crossed signal then power what you need to do is get an amp for the sub it can be another cheap home sterio you just need to send the output from the sub channel to that amp then run the sub off it's power or just buy a new powered sub Loudspeaker Subwoofer Electronic amplifier Surround sound Low-pass filter X10 (industry standard) Operational amplifier Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Action potential Electric guitar Car audio SCART Audio crossover Bass guitar Domestic AC power plugs and sockets High fidelity Quadraphonic Home cinema Modem Audiophile Movie projector Cellular network Jack plug TGV Spark plug Electrophysiology Solar power Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Decibel Acorn Electron Universal Serial Bus Electronic filter TRS connector Federal Standard 1037C BS 1363 Advanced Mobile Phone System FM broadcasting Radar Mixing console Transistor Digital Subscriber Line Digital-to-analog converter Electrical wiring Telephone exchange Transformer Impedance matching Analog-to-digital converter Genetic engineering Digital Theatre System MIM-23 Hawk Telephone Power line communication Alternating current Analog signal Kenwood Electronics Capacitor Cable television High-definition television Radio Vacuum tube DVD Musical Instrument Digital Interface Low voltage differential signaling DVD-Audio Solar cell Dolby Pro Logic RCA connector Fuse (electrical) Analog computer Effects unit Sound recording Diode Bicycle lighting Sonar Xbox Instrument amplifier Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Impedance Oscilloscope Electrostatic loudspeaker Diesel engine Public-key cryptography Passive radar Antenna (radio) Television Coaxial cable Sound Blaster Sound reinforcement system Citizens' band radio Seismometer Dimmer Atari 8-bit family Naval mine Electric motor Audio system measurements Galileo spacecraft Signal transduction Software-defined radio
