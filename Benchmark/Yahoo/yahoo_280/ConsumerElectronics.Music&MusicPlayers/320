help cant get limewire found another site called imesh cant copy to cd because of copy rights where can i go i can download as many songs as i want just want let me make copies on cd please if you no where i can download music for free and make a copy on cds would be very grateful and happy well if you really can't get limewire you may want to try a bittorent client such as azures one of the benefits to bittorent is it's speed although like any p p software it can get slow and you run the risk of getting a virus another benefit is that rather than tediously downloading one song at a time you can get artists' entire collections at once you can find azures simply by going to google and typing in azures download should give you a good link to a download as for the bittorent files torrentspy com is probably your best bet although you may have to do some digging among many websites for bands that are harder to find BitTorrent Peer-to-peer Computer virus LimeWire ITunes Music Store Warez File sharing ITunes Online music store Copyleft Copy protection Kazaa Windows XP Trusted computing Mach kernel Gnutella Spyware MAME Grateful Dead Linux EMule Malware GNU General Public License Napster Dave Matthews Band Digital rights management Mozilla Firefox Software patent debate MGM Studios, Inc. v.
