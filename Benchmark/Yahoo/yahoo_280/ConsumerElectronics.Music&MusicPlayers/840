why do earphones last a short time i use my earphones when listening to my mp player at the gym but they tend to get static y until there's no sound after several months of use why is that and are there any ear phone brands that last for years one reason why earphones easily break is that you use them too much another reason is that the wirings inside the cords leading to the earphones easily break too especially if you use no brand earphones so what you have to do is to store and use your earphones carefully and be careful not to tangle the cords that is one of the main reasons why the wires break and that is not exceptional when using branded earphones it's still best to take good care of your gadgets Headphones IPod Microphone Walkman Gramophone record Modem Jack plug Telephone Violin Transistor radio Hearing aid Shure Incorporated Urinary incontinence Culture of Japan Glossary of climbing terms Crystal radio receiver Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Surveillance Knife Social rule Guinea pig Cyberspace Filling station Climbing equipment IPod nano Moonraker Sling (weapon) Naval mine Etymotic Research IPod shuffle Domestic rabbit Parachute Password Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Inspector Gadget DVD Video game music Traumatic brain injury Avalanche Textile manufacturing Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Mobile phone radiation and health Piano Parachuting Brock (Pok__mon) Telephone tapping Radar Ethics Loudspeaker Delay line memory Harp Decibel Mattress Friction Telecommunication MP3 Car handling Short message service Land mine RISC Childbirth Audiophile Static (superhero) Fuse (electrical) Hamster Internal ballistics BS 1363 AM broadcasting Brain Dog Compact audio cassette Timpani Podcasting Emo Transformer Rope Alternating current Action potential Joy Division (band) Team Fortress Classic Get Smart Microeconomics Alcoholic beverage Trench warfare Brand Read-only memory Shen Gong Wu Pikmin Telephone numbering plan Phoneme Pok__mon (anime) Docking Extension Cord French Defence Menstrual cup Vowel Monopoly Circuit design Weight training
