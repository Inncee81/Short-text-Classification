do record players play at a slightly faster speed than what it's supposed to play i ask this because my record player doesn't seem to be playing at the accurate speed of what the song was originally recorded i found out because i was playing my guitar along with a song playing on my record player but it sounded as if my guitar was not properly tuned i then played the same song from an original cd and this time my guitar sounded tuned exactly the same to the song on the cd oh and i do know the speeds that are designated for the different type of records so it can't be that i made a mistake on that hahaha thanks some record players can slightly alter the original intended sound of the album because of incorrect calibration radio stations have been speeding up songs on purpose lately to squeeze in more commercial time so some people never really get to hear the artist's intended sound and that comment by the first guy hahahahahahaha Violin Sampling (music) Big band Blood on the Tracks Real Love (song) Gramophone record Ska Slide guitar Shot of Love Pat Metheny MAME Bass guitar Planet Waves Joy Division (band) Harmonica Beatmania IIDX Adore Sound effect Harmonic series (music) Pump It Up The Who Helicopter Judas Priest Please Please Me I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Bohemian Rhapsody Opeth Led Zeppelin Journey (band) Donovan Heavy metal music Time Out of Mind Phonograph Red Hot Chili Peppers Pet Sounds Multitrack recording Drum and bass Les Paul Buddy Guy Nu metal Floyd Rose The Velvet Underground Weezer Quarashi The Beatles Overkill (band) Type O Negative Def Leppard (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Rush (band) Oasis (band) Blink-182 10cc The Smashing Pumpkins Bruce Hornsby Rock (music) Blonde on Blonde Van Halen Stairway to Heaven Blackjack American rock Paul Weller The Emancipation of Mimi Mixtape Mandolin RISC KCBS-FM Sly & the Family Stone Bon Jovi Black Sabbath Songwriter Beat It Ritchie Blackmore Double bass Eddie Van Halen Yes Hey Jude Wings (band) ITunes The Ventures 2Step Beatmatching Table tennis Tom Waits Tool (band) Lou Reed Wilco I Want to Hold Your Hand The Residents Twelve string guitar Killing Joke Noel Gallagher The Ashlee Simpson Show Golf club (equipment) Electric guitar Highway 61 Revisited We Belong Together Box Tops Paul Is Dead Wonderland (McFly album)
