how do i download songs on my i pod ok well i just got an i pod and i am ready to download songs from lime wire to my i pod but everytime i try to put the song on the i pod it wont let me you have to be using itunes or realplayer it may not be a popular move but i personally recommend using realplayer as it seems to be more user friendly make sure the songs are added to your realplayer library or itunes's for that matter and then sync it should be fairly painless make sure your ipod is 'installed' too ie run all the discs that came with it so that windows doesn't try to treat it like a hard drive it has to be 'formatted' in either itunes or realplayer watch to apple fanboys girls now tell you realplayer sucks but imho it is better and uses less memory to run and can bypass all that craptastic drm security bologna IPod ITunes Music Store Digital rights management Digital audio player RealNetworks FairPlay Online music store RealPlayer Podcasting QuickTime Apple Macintosh MP3 Walkman IPod shuffle Windows XP IMac We Belong Together Comparison of media players Jon Lech Johansen Video game music ILife Vorbis Napster (pay service) Windows Vista Computer forensics USB flash drive FreeBSD Modchip Trusted computing IPod nano Advanced Audio Coding IPod photo Macintosh Finder Extraordinary Machine Microsoft Windows Apple II family Mac OS X v10.4 Bbc.co.uk IPhoto Windows Media Player WordPerfect Xbox 360 System 7 (Macintosh) Linux distribution Winamp Computer virus NeXT SonicStage Mozilla Firefox LimeWire Linux MiniDisc MS-DOS Mac OS X v10.3 History of Microsoft Windows IPod mini Commodore 64 IBM PC compatible Windows Media Audio Floppy disk Embedded system Internet Explorer Visual Basic WebObjects OpenOffice.org Macromedia Flash System/36 Disc jockey Screenshot Mac OS X Copy protection Windows 3.x Ebook Rootkit MDAC Napster Movie projector Creative Zen Ecco the Dolphin Nintendo Revolution Last.fm Xbox Sony DVD MAME Symbian OS Apple Open Collaboration Environment Virtual memory Wget Console wars Mixtape GNOME Gramophone record NTFS Java programming language DesktopX Microsoft Office
