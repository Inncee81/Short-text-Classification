putting music on mp player gb mp player my problem is that all my music is gb how do i compress the songs so that they are less that gb altogether there is around songs thanks any help is appretiated and a step by step guide would be useful best answer will also get points to compress the songs you have would mean changing the encoding rate so my question to you is what is the encoding rate of your current music if it is kbps or kbps you can try kbps as that will save you space however if it is already kbps then reducing it even more will reduce the fidelity to the point that you may not like what you hear what might be a better solution is to divide your music up into two or more groups load up one group of music and when you get tired of it remove it and put in the other group ITunes Vorbis CPU design Data compression Audiophile JPEG UTF-8 MP3 Audio data compression JPEG 2000 Gramophone record Modem Marching band Video codec High-definition television Expert system Tire Digital audio player Genetic algorithm Image compression 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Jet engine Compact audio cassette Internal ballistics Unix time Hydrogen economy DVD RISC Super Audio CD Analog-to-digital converter Range encoding Computer chess Wheel of Fortune Central processing unit Compression artifact Arithmetic coding Nuclear weapon design Karaoke Circuit breaker DualDisc Cancer PNG Gapless playback Dance Dance Revolution 4thMIX Complexity classes P and NP DV Musepack Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Digital circuit Phase-shift keying DNA Future energy development DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Computational complexity theory Music of Ireland Information entropy MPEG-4 Part 3 Coding theory Laserdisc Orthogonal matrix ZX Spectrum Zeno's paradoxes IPod Volleyball Keynesian economics Delta encoding Space Shuttle program Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 M-209 Movie projector Advanced Audio Coding Fermi paradox NTSC Ecco the Dolphin GSM services Dance Dance Revolution Compact disc Domain Name System MPEG-2 Motion compensation Macromedia Flash Unicode Video game music NTFS Quantum mechanics Hydroponics Tar (file format) Digital video recorder Metroid Prime Monty Hall problem CD-ROM CPU cache Fire extinguisher Carbon dioxide FairPlay Simulated annealing Music radio DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Acromegaly
