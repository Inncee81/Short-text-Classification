do ipods really hold gbs what sort of movies do they play should i get a black one or a white one i'm gonna buy a new ipod and i was looking at some earlier and the one i want has a capacity of gb but i don't get this my computer's hard drive has a capacity of gb how can a shitty little ipod hold nearly as much as my laptop and why would you want it to could the apple website mean to say gigabits and made a mistake also when it says you can watch movies on it what does this mean is this for watching entire feature length movies on them or just music videos and again what penis would want to watch movies on an ipod anyway when you're out you're moving around and your eyes need to concentrate on the outside world and at home you've got at least a computer which will play your movies on a much bigger screen anyway the amount they hold suggests you can watch feature length films on them but this seems senseless to me finally i like the black ones but everyone has the white one why is this should i get a black one or a white one black or white personal preference gb is correct so that you can hold all of your music video pictures etc all on one portable device and not have to carry your pc to your friends home to share or watch on a plane or whatever it offers freedom and choice i choose to stick with my rd generation gb IPod ITunes Digital audio player IPod nano Laptop Apple Macintosh Apple Computer IBM PC compatible IPod mini IMac Walkman ITunes Music Store Redundant array of independent disks USB flash drive IPod photo Computer IPod shuffle Computer and video games Flash memory Archos PlayStation Portable Steve Jobs Touchpad Floppy disk PowerBook Creative Zen Digital rights management Desktop computer Digital photography Handheld game console FairPlay Universal Serial Bus Podcasting Mouse (computing) Computer animation H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Computer role-playing game Surveillance PlayStation 3 Hewlett-Packard Computer bus TRS-80 Gramophone record Atari ST Movie theater Atari 8-bit family Linux kernel Commodore International TiVo Handheld video game IBM PC Wheel of Fortune FireWire Jennifer Lopez Secure Digital card Advanced Audio Coding Apple typography IBook Mac OS X ILife Mach kernel Nintendo Video game music Atari 2600 QuickTime Ethernet Motion picture rating system Multitrack recording Online music store Laserdisc The Ashlee Simpson Show Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Amstrad CPC PowerBook G4 Mixtape G-Man (Half-Life) Compact audio cassette Television Mac OS X v10.4 The End of the World (Doctor Who) AmigaOS View camera Gigabyte Mac mini Blu-ray Disc CompactFlash Shit Home computer Sony Strap-on dildo Xserve Final Fantasy Kaypro Movie projector RealNetworks
