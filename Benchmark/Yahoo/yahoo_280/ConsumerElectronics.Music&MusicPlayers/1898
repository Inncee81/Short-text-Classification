what should i label my dvd's with i heard that sharpie's can be bad for a cd dvd over time anyone have any thoughts i have used sharpie's in the past and things seem ok but thanks for the answers i found out that sharpie makes a non toxic cd dvd marker just for this purpose for a cd its essential to use labels and you can by them from cd stores but as dvds have two layers so it doesn't matter if you won't buy any label for them you can write on you dvds by any sharpie you need they won't get hurt at all but don't wash any dvd cuz they have two layers and water can enter between them cds have only one layer so you can wash them but not with something sharp you can wash them only with your hands and if you want to use your cd for a long time you need to label it Jon Secada Compact disc Bon Jovi DVD Laserdisc Floppy disk Domain Name System Sharpie (marker) Textile manufacturing Boat building Taxi Driver Copy protection MP3 Motion picture rating system Blu-ray Disc Social rule Nine Inch Nails CD-R Scarlet's Walk Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Roxette Upholstery The Inside TLC Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Feet washing Scenes from a Memory Menstrual cup Marillion Video CD The Smashing Pumpkins The Amazing Race Eminem Bristol Motor Speedway Alcoholics Anonymous Hey Jude Weezer They Might Be Giants Delta Goodrem Married... with Children Philosophy of language Out of Gas Good Times Billboard Hot 100 Tire Anamorphic widescreen Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Star Wars Holiday Special Super Video CD Tony Stewart The nature of God in Western theology Tattoo Metallica Coffee Otter Daria King Crimson Boom Town (Doctor Who) Durian Notable lines in the Star Wars series Australian Sharpie Theory of conduct Hip hop rivalries Daz Dillinger Videocassette recorder Kodocha Collecting fossils DVD-RAM Nicomachean Ethics Sonic Youth Brian Griffin Cheese Dream Theater The Apprentice 2 Fecal incontinence Dishwashing Meaning of life Have I Got News For You Non-native pronunciations of English Infant baptism Futurama (TV series - season 5) Douglas Adams Kaliyan DualDisc Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sinfest Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Leaf Digital rights management Quebec French PNG Organic food Wound Poker jargon FLCL Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Monty Hall problem Knife Knoppix Garth Brooks
