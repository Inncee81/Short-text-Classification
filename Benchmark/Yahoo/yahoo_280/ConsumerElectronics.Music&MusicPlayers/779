how do i add music off itunes to my ipod shuffle without erasing the ones i already have on there if you're loading them from the same computer itunes will just sync your ipod refresh it adding the new tracks but that's automatic so if you load from another computer it'll sync up whatever's on that itunes and in that event you will lose what you already had unless you change your settings from automatic to manual next time you plug in your ipod go to ipod settings on itunes this is only activated when you plug the ipod in and change the settings before you add the new music ITunes IPod shuffle Apple Computer ITunes Music Store Podcasting IPod nano IPod photo IPod mini Walkman ILife Sinclair ZX81 Napster (pay service) Online music store Apple Macintosh Digital audio player Rhythmbox Redundant array of independent disks Advanced Audio Coding Disc jockey IMac Digital rights management QuickTime USB flash drive Windows 2000 SonicStage Embedded system Automatic transmission Original Amiga chipset Spark plug Universal Plug and Play MP3 SCART Apple typography Jack plug Mac rumors community IPhoto Gramophone record U2 (band) Lip sync NeXT Vorbis Compact audio cassette Apollo Guidance Computer Rhapsody (online music service) Synchronization TRS-80 Daylight saving time Manual transmission Billboard magazine Apple Newton Apple Store Btrieve Blackjack Liquid crystal display We Belong Together Steve Jobs PlayStation Portable Video game music MOS Technology SID WebObjects DV SIMD Movie projector Floppy disk Plug-and-play Domain Name System Touchpad C programming language FireWire Aircraft engine controls Linux kernel Canon T90 Transmission (mechanics) MiniDisc Telephone exchange Refresh rate Carburetor CDC 6600 Jon Lech Johansen Atari 8-bit family Leap year Last.fm IS-95 Modem Atari ST Musical Instrument Digital Interface Mac OS X v10.4 Jack FM NTSC Commodore 64 Mercury Cougar The Faders AltiVec Wheel of Fortune Cocoa (API) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster
