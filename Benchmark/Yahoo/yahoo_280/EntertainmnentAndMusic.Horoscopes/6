influences the years from birth to age the nd challenge takes over from age to and the third affects us our whole life challenges shape our attitudes and can affect our health these vibrations that challenge us cause either an exaggeration of the associated qualities or a lack of them both of which are extremes which need to be brought into balance first challenge challenge children are usually given a lot of duties and disciplined into schedules and organization to the point that the creative impulse is quieted to a whisper as teenagers four's are the one's who have the next ten years of their life planned what profession which college etc they have their beliefs and values down pat and could show you the file they have them written in fun and creative expression are the balancing agents for four which are found in the three and the five second challenge this is the challenge of sensitivity and self sacrifice two's look for needs to be filled in others and attempt to fill those needs while ignoring their own all with the hope that someone will take care of them in return it is possible that a two challenger can manifest just the opposite as well and be preoccupied with their
