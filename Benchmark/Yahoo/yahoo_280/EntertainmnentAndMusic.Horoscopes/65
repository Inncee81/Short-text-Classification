how do i find out what i am i know im an aquarius born on the cusp st jan and i was wondering how people find out about charts and what their zodiac says about them like saying im a leo with scorpian descendant what does that mean can any one help directly first of all a cusp is simply the point of transition from one thing to another while some reputable astrologers have done extensive study on the effects of cusp placement for the most part the meaning of cusp in relation to sun signs has been exploited by scam artists for one thing being born on the cusp does not mean you are part capricorn part aquarius your sun is either in aquarius or it is in capricorn it is not in both mathematically if you were born when the sun between degrees minutes of capricorn and degrees minutes of aquarius then you would truly be born on the cusp but even then you would still be either capricorn or aquarius when we consider that there are degrees in every sign and that the sun moves about degree every day about minutes every hour you can see that the period of time the sun is truly on the cusp of a sign is about minutes each month not or days because the sun mercury and venus tend to travel closely together however it is possible your sun is in aquarius and your mercury and venus are in capricorn which would imbue many capricornian qualities to you this is true for anyone born within days of the sun sign change thanks to computers and web sites like http www alabe com which has already been mentioned you no longer need to have a good command of math to enter the study of astrology but ultimately acquiring a mathematical understanding of the circle and base because minutes degree is going to help you immensely a leo with a scorpio descendant is better described as a leo with taurus rising a taurus ascendant depending on date time and place of birth this person probably has an aquarius m c medium coeli midheaven often the same thing as the th house cusp i e a leo d c th house for simplicity's sake let's say we're working in the middle degrees of the sun sign and the beginning degrees of the ascendant this leo's sun would be the th house in which family and home life are described this would be the man who first came up with the phrase a man's home is his castle protective and stubborn he would make a passionate if suspicious partner in love or business it's possible he may find pursuing his career at odds with maintaining a happy domestic front only knowing the sun sign of the chart in question because leo is ruled by the sun which is in the house of home family i'd say this person would sacrifice career for home anytime the conflict arose now let's look at your early aquarius perhaps late capricorn sun it rests right on the midheaven of this leo's chart based on this one thing it would be easy to imagine you represent some significant conflict to this person's home life simultaneously figuring prominently in the advancement of his career there are many many many other elements and aspects to consider before making any conclusive judgment but that perhaps gives you a glimpse of how this works Horoscope Western astrology Chinese calendar Solar system in astrology Birthday The Twelve Labours Sabbat (neopaganism) Medical astrology Capricornus Chinese astrology Hipparchus (astronomer) Mithraism Aquarius Taurus (constellation) Solar system Leo Synthesizer Mercury (planet) Scorpius History of astrology Voynich manuscript Cancer (constellation) Natal chart Astronomy on Mars Mathematics Parallax Equinox Numerology Scientific method Tide Navigation Philosophy of language Second language acquisition Saint Seiya Moon Logic Libra Aries Ordinary differential equation Geometry Venus God Simone Weil Kumbh Mela Solar eclipse Extraterrestrial skies Longitude Supernatural Postmodernism Virgo Jon Secada Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Aristotle Dice Year Chess terminology Modular form New Age Filioque clause Philosophy of science Tonality Hindu calendar Sister Princess Bohemian Rhapsody UK Singles Chart 2 (number) Objectivist philosophy A Course In Miracles Tycho Brahe Babylonia World Wide Web Star of Bethlehem Epistemology Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, & Jones, Ltd.
