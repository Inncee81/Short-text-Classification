is this a sculpture or an installation i had sculpted a life size human figure with wire and placed it sitting on a chair and table the figure in a sleeping position with its head lying on a book on the table and i had connected some nails from the head to the book with wire the figure chair and table are not connected by any glue or stuff and the book is a real one cuz i'm using mixed media and if wanna exhibit it'll require some time to place the objects like a person sitting down with the head and hands on the table sleeping so the whole piece consists of a wire human table chair and a real book can anyone tell me if mine's a mixed media sculpture or mixed media installation your piece is a mixed media sculpture why because although it is made up of a variety of materials the sculpted figure the ready mades the wire the book table nails they form together a single unit a dimensional object or form if the elements which make up your sculpture had been spread out in space perhaps distributed on the floor the walls or even the ceiling so that their total effect would have been to change the way that we the viewers experience a particular space then one would have been looking at a mixed media installation Sculpture Drawing Manifold Mattress Casting Glossary of sculpting terms Henry Moore Stairway Chair Lighting Drill bit Maxwell's equations Textile manufacturing Human position Seismic retrofit Wood carving Harp Fire fighting Fan (implement) Nail (anatomy) Basement Professional wrestling match types Stucco Rococo Mixed martial arts Hash table Upholstery Tesla coil Color Grace Cossington Smith Cyberspace Solar cell Antenna (radio) Explosive material Cello Traditional animation Volleyball Transformer Naval mine Screw Mosaic Violin Out-of-body experience Wire Annuity Lorentz group Wallpaper group Solar system Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethernet Radio controlled airplane Sand art and play Art in Ancient Greece Table tennis Yoko Ono Lathe HTML element Perl Barbed wire Sundial Doctor (Doctor Who) Spark plug Dog agility Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Compact disc Japanese tea ceremony Art Alexander Calder The Three Graces Timber framing Windows XP Graphics St. Peter's Basilica Air-raid shelter Floppy disk Electrophysiology Polarization Hamster Double bass Eastern Orthodox Church Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Lie group Yoga Sutras of Patanjali CIE 1931 color space Welding Ice hotel Baroque Carpet Langmuir probe Diamond cut M__bius strip Rachel Whiteread President (game) Temporal bone Bookbinding Digital circuit
