is limewire pro illegal i here that the free version of limewire is illegal i wonder if pro is legal whether limewire is legal technically the act of using limewire kazaa morpheus or any other p p file sharing system is perfectly legal however the act of sharing copyrighted music is what the authorities will prosecute for as you are allowing other users to download something which they should pay for for free the act of downloading music which is being shared by other users is illegal however the authorities will prosecute those who are sharing a significant amount of music like drugs they will go after the dealers not the users more input and advice the main question here is not whether limewire is illegal but if mp sharing or sharing of any files applications for that matter is illegal there have been lots of lawsuits where the music recording industry have tried to serve hefty fines etc to the companies individuals who encourage and facilitate the sharing of files between people however in recent court cases the decision has been made that it is not plausible to adequately place blame on people since all software such as limewire does is act as a catalyst the heart and soul of limewire winmx and kazaa is the people like you or i that download files and likewise make files on our own pc's available for others in order to 'win' the recording industry would have to sue each and every one of us which would simply be a too difficult and costly task by taking software such as limwire off the internet by way of force all that would happen is that another group of individuals would come up with somehting new and another head would grow in its' place it's like trying to police an individual taking a new cd that he bought over to his friend's house and copying it on to his pc virtually impossible as we all know technically ftp is legal in itself as a mode of communication and data transfer it has really unbelievably been used since not long after the second world war the net was invented as a communication method that would be almost self healing after an attack by offering billions of alternative routes for data transfer in itself it is pure genious and gives us communication that our ancestors would only dream of music piracy has shot up tenfold since the advent of programmes like napster the us uk governments thought the problems had died when they passed acts that shut these sites down these primative fileshare sites actively promoted the fact that they offered music free to download through their shareware but the new breed is very different programmes like kazaa limewire winmx and e donkey are just bacteria that feed on the source that almost all internet users harbour in their own homes a piece of software is an appliance like a tumbledryer a tumbledrier dries your clothes an ftp application downloads files it doesn't know what a particular file is what it shows or how it works it just does its job but the pitfall is that this software can pass copyrighted music unreleased hollywood blockbusters expensive software child pornography important and censored documents images films in an unbiased way between countries individuals criminals and governments so limewire is technically legal but it and programmes like it have a finite lifespan and i would wager that within the next few years maybe at the most filesharing will be another heavily taxed weapon in our worldwide governmental arsenal it's the first opportunity for the world to get something for free really free grab the chance now and go forth my children and get what you need but make sure it's legal just because you can get it it doesn't mean that the stuff you have is legal steer clear of terrorism movies images child porn pornography of a corrupt nature in general and any file that your conscience and society will not accept but otherwise enjoy this rare blip in history when the majority notched up a rare victory on the bedpost of our existence limewire is completely illegal one of the main reasons this is illegal is because artists release their music to get money off of it if u take their music for free right of the internet it's like stealing their music which is also like stealing money from record companies it is just as illegal to allow people to upload from you than it is to download from others you have become a file sharer and they take it just as seriously as file downloaders trust me i personally now know two people who were caught not on limewire but on imesh it is not worth it your whole life changes once you get sued you put yourself family at risk of paying thousands of dollars because of a few moments of weakness i gotta have that song i did it too my friends learned just how much they really needed all those songs once it happened the answer was they didn't need them at all your follow up question will i get caught is i'm sorry to say just a bit out of touch with what's going on out there people your new experts should not be the ones responding to this saying its legal but others who have gotten caught do some research on google with such words as music industry sues or lawsuit and see the world from the other perspective they are totally serious and totally committed to busting as many people as they can hope this helps someone out there go get some legal advice on this limewire is legal there was a recent court case betwenn the riaa and another p p file sharing client and the file sharing client won this is becuase the software is intended to help people distribute files and how can the people that have that software be held accountable for the others that use it illegaly if you share copyrighted metarial it is illegal if you share pics and documents which aren't copyrighted it is legal don't be fooled by the this product is legal that kazaa but on their website if you read it carefully it says that the downloading of the product is indeed legal and so is downloading music if its not copyrighted almost all music is copyrighted therefore downloading them is illegal this has been said above but here it is black and white clear as crystal copyright laws and laws pertaining to patents and inventions protect original works of authorship and inventions individuals who reproduce distribute copies receive copies publicly perform or display works or inventions other than their own and without the consent of the owners or holders of rights or their authorized agents in original works of authorship or inventions n m ay be in violation of copyright patent or other intellectual property infringement lime wire llc does not encourage or condone the illegal copying of copyrighted material this is not intended to be legal counsel or advice if you have any questions consult your attorney reference http www limewire com english content ftc shtml f anyone paying for legal file sharing sites have been fooled you could have stuck with any of the popular free sites and would be in the same boat regardless but with a little more money in your pocket no one has been caught or sued yet that has only downloaded music users uploading assuming larger quantities are the ones that have been fined granted it may happen where downloaders are caught but for now those who block all sharing along with turning off the function for the computer to be used as a supernode have a much better chance at avoiding trouble in a sense limewire is legal but in another sense it's illegal the fact right now is that limewire kazaa etc are legal because it is simply peer to peer file sharing like taking a cd to a friends house and letting him take the music on to his computer ripping this is legal in a sense so is limewire then because the music comes from an original cd that someone paid money to get and they are simply sharing it to selected people the problem that the recording companies and artists have is the mass file sharing meaning the sharing of the song to more than people in fact it's perfectly legal for anyone to share a file for free to or less people basically like burning a game or a cd and giving it to your girlfriend or something so is limewire legal yes but if they want to take a further step they might want to make a expiration system basically a program that automatically deletes songs off the online list after it's been downloaded times so there limewire is technically legal whenever you don't pay for some download with the exception of pc game demos the free download files are illegal limewire is a tool just like a knife tools have their roles in various tasks possessing the knife doesnt commit the crime its the person the used the knife that commits the crime one's focus should not be on the existence of limewire but on the particular wrong doing the happens with it is limewire illegal http wiki answers com q is limewire illegal Computer virus AmigaOS Microsoft Office Google Desktop
