half the games i download on torrent downloaders dont work why not i will download the game and then it says there is a file missing even though it takes up quite a bit of space the seeding in the torrents is not fast enough or there arent enough people seeding seeding is when you are purely uploading the file most people dont do this because they either dont know what it is or dont want to waste bandwidth the whole thing about torrents is what you give is what you get the more you upload the faster your download will be most torrent sites ask you to please seed for at least half an hour after you download if there are any peers people who download a file also called leechers try looking for torrents with more than five seeds and torrents that are new most sites let you sort by date or seeds Hard disk Linux Windows XP PlayStation 2 MS-DOS Windows Vista USB flash drive System 7 (Macintosh) Knoppix Computer virus Floppy disk System/36 Windows 3.x Virtual memory Apple Macintosh Copy protection AmigaOS Redundant array of independent disks Steam (content delivery) File system Btrieve Computer System/34 IPod NTFS Xbox CP/M Commodore 128 Binary prefix File Allocation Table Backup Password Microsoft Disk image Windows Me Patch (computing) Personal computer ITunes Commodore 64 Master Control Program Digital rights management Spring operating system Booting Apple IIGS MP3 Partition (computing) PlayStation 3 Mac OS Disk cloning Embedded system Modchip Macintosh Finder Supercomputer History of Microsoft Windows Anti-virus software NeXT Operating system IBM Atari 8-bit family Pretty Good Privacy Mach kernel Cache IBook ZX Spectrum OpenOffice.org Enterprise content management BBC Master VMware Mainframe computer Architecture of Windows 2000 Portable Document Format CPU cache PLATO History of operating systems Berkeley Software Distribution Common Unix Printing System Spyware Mac OS X Mouse (computing) SAM Coup__ Expert system BIOS Windows 95 Forth programming language Mozilla Firefox PlayStation Portable Amiga FreeBSD GNU General Public License Read-only memory Computer security
