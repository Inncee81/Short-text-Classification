whats the best linux live cd i keep hearing that linux is better than windows and so i was looking on google for live cds which you can try trouble is there are so many different ones im not sure what is best as i would like one which is a desktop and is not specified to do a certian job and preferably one which i can install onto my hard drive and make it my operating system if its better please help personally i think live cd's aren't the way to go they don't install and they don't detect half your hardware most of the time if you want to give linux a try i recommend a program called wubi http wubi installer org it installs any one of the four flavors of ubuntu linux like a windows program if you decide you don't like it you can go to add remove programs and get rid of every trace of it you get a real install without partitioning your hard drive it does this by creating a huge file and making a virtual drive out of it this makes it a tad bit slower than a real install on a seperate partition but a hell of a lot faster than running it off a cd later on if you want to partition and install the traditional and more permanent way the iso file is in your c wubi folder just turn that into a cd with your cd burning software uniinstall wubi and use the cd to partition and install wubi takes a while when you launch it it downloads a megabyte iso file which takes an hour or three depending on your connection then installs linux which takes another minutes once you got it up and running it's pretty impressive way better than a live cd BitTorrent World Wide Web Uniform Resource Locator HyperText Transfer Protocol Wget Domain Name System Azureus Internet Web server Mozilla Firefox Apache HTTP Server Domain name I2P Representational State Transfer Website Jabber Warez JSON CPAN HTTP cookie Streaming media Common Unix Printing System VJ Kademlia Wireless Application Protocol Session Initiation Protocol Bbc.co.uk Transport Layer Security Internet censorship in mainland China Spyware Squid cache Anonymous P2P Web crawler Ajax (programming) Magnet link Proxy server SAML Unix MD5 User agent Uniform Resource Identifier World Trade Organization MSN Messenger Mozilla Application Suite MUD Google Web Accelerator Slapt-get Sikhism Router Opera house Federal Standard 1037C Virtual hosting File Transfer Protocol Port numbers File-sharing program Kazaa Java Servlet Freeware Subversion (software) Gmail Phishing Gopher protocol Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Gnutella Committee for a Workers' International Digital art Transmission Control Protocol Secure Shell X.509 Typosquatting Extraterrestrial hypothesis Cyber bullying Ecclesiastical Latin Peer-to-peer Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Slash (punctuation) Unreal Tournament Web cache Remote procedure call Dictionary Web browser Web traffic 400 (number) Kuzari Wikisource Kurdistan Scalable Vector Graphics Economy of Colombia Netscape Navigator Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition HyperCard Television network Network Time Protocol Suprnova.org Cross site scripting Solar variation MIME MoveOn 386BSD
