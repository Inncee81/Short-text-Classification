linux distributions i'm fairly new to linux and i've tried out a few different distros so far the best one i came across is ubuntu i've also tried slax dsl puppy linux and xubuntu is there anything out there better than ubuntu i want to pick a distro to dual boot with xp another distribution that caught my eye was linux xp has anyone used that and how compatible with windows programs is it thanks jtb but i have plenty of experience with dual booting well better tends to be highly subjective as most proponents of a distro will think their favorite distro is the best i prefer kubuntu personally it is based on ubuntu but has the kde desktop interface instead similar to the one slax has i prefer it mostly for its support and its interface i don't like gnome but other people choose other distros for different reasons don't get linuxxp unless you want to pay for it it requires a key code after boots and it is probably no more compatible with windows programs than any other linux distro using wine a windows compatibility layer you would mostly be buying it for its interface WAV Musical Instrument Digital Interface Audio file format Marching band QuickTime Digital photography Slideshow MP3 Macromedia Flash Interchange File Format PlayStation Portable PNG SonicStage IPod ZIP (file format) PC Engine FL Studio Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Web page IPhoto NTFS ITunes Floppy disk MiniDisc Trombone PlayStation Sound Format Lossless data compression Bass guitar Slide guitar Image file formats Disk image JPEG Creative Zen Windows 2000 Movie projector Game Boy GIF Microsoft PowerPoint Cello Multitrack recording View camera Ebook Tar (file format) OSType Cascading Style Sheets Dither Computer forensics Trumpet File format Winning Streak Digital audio broadcasting Memory Stick HFS Plus Comparison of file systems Tracker TeX C programming language TrueType Podcasting Audio tape length and thickness Printf ILife Amstrad CPC International Phonetic Alphabet Advanced Encryption Standard File Allocation Table Portable Document Format AVI AmigaOS Unicode Telephone Windows Picture and Fax Viewer RSS (file format) MusikCube Warez Shogi Drum and bugle corps (classic) Saxophone BVE Compact disc Hierarchical File System Aspect ratio (image) Tablature Winamp MPEG-4 Gravis Ultrasound Module file Nine Inch Nails Ring tone Radio drama Universal Disk Format Cue sheet Windows 3.x Dd (Unix) Objective-C DVD
