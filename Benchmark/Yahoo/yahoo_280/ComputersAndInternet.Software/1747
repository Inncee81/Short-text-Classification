i need a software program for audio editing and dg mixer im looking for a software for removing voice from beat and to make my own beats audio recording and dj mixer with turn table is there one program that that can do all that or if not wht are the best out now for free to do this sony's screenblast acid the version i own this one detects beats in clips and allows you to create music using clips and recordings or if you really want value for money magix's music maker i own v v is the latest but costs about v should be available for about this one allows you to record audio and midi if you want also allows for some really good recording options such as hear and record without automatically mixing existing tracks into the new one you are recording by dj mixer w turntable i am assuming that you mean the hardware if you meant software then all i can say is that i have seen a product like that at best buy but that was gosh a couple of years ago i think it was a magix product that calls for additional computer hardware such as creative audigy zs or creative audigy nx basically you are looking for something that that is usb based so you can pull it closer to you equipement or can be installed to the front of your pc so you don't have to grit your teeth while trying plug in the output of your equipment to the pc about that voice from beat thingy unless you go for something really profession such as vst steinberg et al each could ding you for approx and up there is precious little that cheap and or free software can do for you the closest solution i can suggest for under is hold your breath the creative audigy nx solution actually any creative product because the key to voice removal is in the software that comes with the hardware the device control software allows for karaoke settings which kind of double loops the track and attempts to almost eliminate the original voice not bad for something that really costs so little but be aware the results may be far from perfect and i can tell right away the final result definitely wouldn't sound like one of those tracks heads up you will have to find a way to combine these tools to get to your final destination which is what professionals do anyway other than that you should be all set to go i wish you the best in your attempt soon after my initial post i saw the post above me mentioning audacity yes it is free and can do a whole bunch of stuff without you having to shell out much IPod Mouse (computing) Macromedia Flash Screenshot Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Windows Movie Maker PlayStation Portable Computer and video games DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Oscilloscope International Phonetic Alphabet Music video Gramophone record DVD Window Maker DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Digital photography MSN Messenger QuickTime Windows Vista DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX ITunes Stereoscopy Digital video Telescope DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Palm OS Windows XP GunZ The Duel Hello world program Nintendo DS VHS Microsoft Paint IMovie Double Dragon Google Desktop Gmail Danger Hiptop Sony Ericsson K750i Nintendo GameCube AppleScript Movie projector Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMIX Option key Slot machine Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Doom engine Windows Mobile Television High-definition television Homestar Runner Quarashi Nintendo Entertainment System The Ashlee Simpson Show Teletext Machinima Floppy disk Pump It Up Fischer Random Chess History of the graphical user interface ILife Prank flash Verizon Wireless Aerial (dance move) Taskbar Laserdisc Anaglyph image Minesweeper (computer game) Liquid crystal display Polarization Multimedia Messaging System The Sims 2: University Point groups in three dimensions Super Nintendo Entertainment System Inkscape VHF omnidirectional range Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Drill bit 50 Cent Dial M for Murder Yu-Gi-Oh!
