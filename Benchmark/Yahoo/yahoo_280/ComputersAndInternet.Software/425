installing windows service pack ive read some questions similar to mine and all of the answers to them we're complete garbage halfway though the instilation of service pack i get a error that says 'access is denied i get it though windows automatic updates im the only user on the computer so im the computer admin i have a genuine copy of windows i know this for a fact i went on the microsoft website and read this article http support microsoft com kb top but im lost at step dont answer if you have no idea what your talking about i get stuck at step subsection a i do everything in step section a then i get stuck at the last sentence after you enable verbose logging install windows xp sp or windows server sp again to capture the registry key i tried ignoring this and going straight to step section e but i cant find error access is denied anywhere in the file i'm not sure what gets you stuck getting the log file or finding the error in the log file or fixing the registry key that is indicated as causing the error you need to be more specific as step is multi step if you are stuck on fixing it you need to run regedit from the command line and delete the key be sure to export the key and backup your registry first in case it screws up the computer then try repeating if that doesn't work there are some registry repair tools out there i think power toys for winxp might have a repair registry option it is free dl from ms otherwise norton utilities' win doctor might help it might also help to download all of sp like an admin on a network would there is info on ms website if you look hard enough and that might help your install go faster good luck i'll try to check back if you add more details and see if i can help more edit after enabling the verbose logging you can't skip the rest the reason you can't find the log entry is because you tried installing before verbose logging was enabled so you basically got a shortened version of the log enable the logging try installing sp then when you get the error that will be logged then you should be able to go into the log file and find out what key was bad the rest should make sense from there Hard disk Uploading and downloading The Right Stuff Computer and video games IBM PC Linux Quantum computer Warez Internet Modem Windows XP Steam (content delivery) Dave Matthews Band VAIO Video game music Chess Melissa worm Computer science File sharing HAL 9000 Forth programming language Digital audio player Digital photography Stuff (magazine) Wireless Application Protocol Genetic algorithm Object Desktop Computational complexity theory Vanessa Lynn Williams Web crawler Spyware ZX Spectrum W.
