problem with my mic hi i have a rand new mic but when i sing on it the sound of my voice does not cum at all i also tried singing on a karaoke software but i can only hear the music n not my voice i tried on sound recorder the voice does cum but it's not dat gud i have cheked make sure on da settings dat its not on mute i think it mite b sum other setting prolems pls help me if u can thanx i really wanna sing with music and good sound it is hard to troubleshoot without a good visual but here goes it may be that the mic is not compatible with your software if you bought a cheep mic that is probably the issue a cheep mic is usually also cheep in quality and you can tell the difference in the output if you have an expensive mic and a standard sound card that would cause you to have a sub par sound as well lastly i am a singer and i had to learn to appreciate the sound of my voice the sound that was recorded was different from the sound i heard while singing i suggest you ask someone else to listen and tell you if it sounds like you hope this helps BitTorrent Gnutella Peer-to-peer Azureus Modem Windows XP Futurama (TV series - season 3) Opera (web browser) Skype Computer virus Cheating in Counter-Strike Download manager Uploading and downloading Thread (computer science) JADE programming language Java programming language EDonkey2000 Computer and video games Chess Copy protection Linux Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Apple Computer Internet Relay Chat Stopping e-mail abuse Suprnova.org Preboot Execution Environment Perl Diablo II: Lord of Destruction BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Windows 2000 Jumpstart 3rd Grade ITunes Kazaa Logic Microsoft Windows Question mark Online music store Internet Mandriva Linux AOL Instant Messenger File sharing Trusted computing Justin Frankel ICQ Forth programming language Banjo-Tooie FastTrack Billboard Hot 100 Laptop Steam (content delivery) Wheel of Fortune Mozilla Firefox Quizbowl WordPerfect Copyleft Science Personal computer OpenOffice.org Thin client Gmail Knoppix Banjo-Kazooie MIRC Kademlia Scrabble Verizon Wireless Microsoft Office Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Podcasting Wget Microsoft SETI@home Ashton-Tate Computer science The Joker's Wild Anti-virus software Martial art CPAN OpenDocument PlayStation 3 Function (mathematics) IPod File Transfer Protocol Tic-Tac-Dough Pok__mon (anime) Bulletin board system Twenty One (game show) MSN Messenger Colossal Cave Adventure Logo programming language Dialer Wi-Fi Computer numbering formats Visual Basic VMware PLATO ITunes Music Store
