how do i export project in visual c i have coded a application in visual c but i don't know how to export it so i can post it on my website for people to download okay but i don't really want to give away the source file how would i make it into a application for people to use i know where to find it but when i put it on my website the users get this error the application configuration is incorrect re installing the application may fix this problem i think i linked to the crt and i will link to it in the app folder but what i can't figure out is how to make one of these sorry for the stupid question you can either distribute the sourcefiles or the binary file as you made an application you clearly have the binaries from building the source right you can post the binary and any necessary files like shared libraries or post the source files you need to give people a way of building it easily so either include the project file solution file as well or use makefiles jam scons whatever to create a build system edit what's this about making an application when you build your code you get an application right how did you code your application without ever running the binary once if you're having trouble finding the built application look in the source directory or more accurately the project directories there should be a build folder with debug or release subfolders you're obviously interested in release more info i googled a bit myself you can do so on the terms application configuration incorrect http www gamedev net community forums topic asp topic id whichpage and http www chat com this application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect may be pertinent you have an exe if you have a manifest file in the directory you should be including that in the online download as well it s also possible you dynamically linked the crt in which case unless the crt is present on the user s system because he is a developer using the same language and compiler etc you need to ship them as well copying from c program files microsoft visual studio vc redist x microsoft vc crt to the application folder should do the trick if you have another version of vc just look in the appropriate redistributable directory Windows 2000 Computer virus Object Desktop Redundant array of independent disks Bluetooth File system Steam (content delivery) Common Unix Printing System PlayStation Portable Computer wallpaper Mozilla Firefox Spyware Gmail Macintosh Finder Hard disk Blue screen of death Linux Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Unicode Malware Emacs Windows 3.x Opera (web browser) NTFS Windows Vista Super Nintendo Entertainment System Knoppix Screenshot System 6 X Window System Mac OS X Windows registry MDAC Rootkit Windows Installer Pretty Good Privacy History of Microsoft Windows Windows Me Mouse (computing) File format Partition (computing) Btrieve Linux distribution Library (computer science) OpenBSD Floppy disk IPod Laptop Control Panel (Windows) Virtual memory Debugging Konqueror Stardock Oscilloscope Backup Visual Basic Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xerox Star System/36 MSN Messenger PHP Expert system System/34 Windows Server 2003 USB flash drive Apple Macintosh Embedded system Domain Name System Digital Equipment Corporation Windows 95 Internet Relay Chat Ebook Disk cloning RSTS/E Patch (computing) Stopping e-mail abuse Mach kernel Microsoft Jet Database Engine GunZ The Duel Freenet Java programming language Screensaver Anti-virus software Mozilla Application Suite Diablo II: Lord of Destruction OS/2 PNG KDE
