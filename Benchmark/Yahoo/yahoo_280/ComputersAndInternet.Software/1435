does anyone have the full version of adobe acrobat who can modify one or two of my forms does anyone have the full version of adobe acrobat who can modify one or two of my forms i have some application forms in pdf format that need a few more fields pre printed on them and some of the fields changed it would only take a few minutes to do that and i really don't need the full version for such very limited use i would have no ongoing use for the full program i did have a full but trial version of adobe acrobat that i downloaded from their website for a couple weeks and i found it very user unfriendly even though i'm a bit of a computer geek myself so i decided that it was definitely not a good idea to buy it it would take too much of a learning curve for me to master an application that should only take me about or minutes to modify a few existing forms i could e mail you the pdf files and then they could be modified and sent back to me if you help me whatever you need in some similar area i could certainly return the favor john v i'll help subanen yahoo com Windows 2000 Booting Windows XP AmigaOS Blue screen of death Partition (computing) Microsoft Windows Computer virus Emacs Mouse (computing) NX bit IA-32 Object Desktop Sega Dreamcast Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows NTFS IPod Windows 3.x IBM PC compatible Btrieve Mozilla Firefox Screenshot Windows Installer System 7 (Macintosh) File Allocation Table USB flash drive Windows 95 Virtual memory System/36 GRand Unified Bootloader MDAC Redundant array of independent disks File system Dual boot Embedded system Oscilloscope Commodore 64 BIOS Windows Me Stardock System/34 FreeDOS Amstrad CPC Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Hard disk Atari 8-bit family Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Macromedia Flash Windows Server 2003 Backup Floppy disk PDP-11 Wine (software) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Library (computer science) Opera (web browser) Terminate and Stay Resident Architecture of Windows 2000 Super Mario Bros.
