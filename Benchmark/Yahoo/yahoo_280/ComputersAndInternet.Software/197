how do i know that im lagging im playing an online fps game and my ping is usually around but the other players kept on complaining that im lagging when im playing i see other players running stationary then they suddenly disappear and appear somewhere else like teleport or something also there are players whom i shot a million times but won't die then they suddenly disappear and then appear behind me im dead by then what are the signs that im lagging what are the signs that they're lagging my pc specs amd dual core ghz gb ddr ram gb of free space on hard drive two mb nvidia geforce gt not in sli kbps internet connection but im subscribed for mbps my cpu temp is around degrees i've checked for virus trojans spyware etc none found defragmented and disk cleanup when playing i don't have any programs running in the background that would affect the game everything is set to low in the game any help is appreciated david the ping isn't displayed during gameplay so im not sure if its around but im assuming that it doesn't exceed i also end most programs using the windows task manager so my pf usage no idea what that is is around mb about my startup only a few are on the startup list whalemeister about the sli thing when im playing the game and my video card is in sli the computer freezes no idea why the sli thing works fine with other games but not in the game warrock i usually play av and firewalls are off before i start the game this game servers is hosted in our country about the ping i can't ask them what my ping is cause its not displayed during gameplay about the bandwidth the max our isp provides is mpbs can't afford it im still a student and too scared to ask my parents they might find out i play too much video games whalemeister another thing am i the one lagging when i see lots of player disappearing then appearing firstly get those cards sli'd up the symptoms you describe sound like classic lag symptoms to me i see other players running stationary then they suddenly disappear and appear somewhere else like teleport or something also there are players whom i shot a million times but won't die then they suddenly disappear and then appear behind me im dead by then all of that are signs of lag when you say i don't have any programs running in the background that would affect the game does that include anti virus software and firewalls both av software and firewall settings can eat into your bandwidth other than that i would recommend upgrading your internet connection to a faster line i'm at mbps and have no issues with lag modern multiplayer gaming does use quite a bit of bandwidth your hardware will probably not be causing your issues here your graphics cards are a little on the old side now but as long as you can play the game fine in single player without really low framerates it won't cause an issue in multiplayer quite often the ping you see is quite a bit lower than your actual ping ask someone else online what your ping is you'll probably get a few 'funny' responses but most people will tell you what ping they see for you if upgrading your internet connection is not an option if you want to play online you should seriously think about it you can try to only play on servers hosted in your country as generally you'll get better ping times hope this helps and happy gaming Interactive geometry software
