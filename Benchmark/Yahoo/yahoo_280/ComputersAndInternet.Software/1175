windows vista i have windows xp and i was wondering if it is worth the money to upgrade to windows vista i hear from people that it is worth it but then i hear from professional editors that its not worth upgrading so anyone got any advice at this point in time no being that even as microsoft is fixing many bugs with vista my opinion is wait few more months until doing so or even a year why because vista has a large number of incompatibilities bugs security issues problems with it's own security blocking things you need or not blocking things you don't want vista sometimes hates something you install like your printer or your printer hates it also if you have a slow computer to run vista at an optimal level you'll need at least a dual core processor and gb of memory and hard drive space is a must probably about gb minimum that is only my suggestion xp professional would be a better choice at this time however it is hard to find in retail store being that microsoft is forcing the sale of vista from all retail stores and comp companies such as dell hp and compaq Microsoft Office Microsoft Office Assistant Microsoft Windows Windows XP Microsoft Word History of Microsoft Windows Windows 95 Microsoft Excel SAS System File Allocation Table OS/2 X Window System Windows Mobile Microsoft Bob Mac OS X Visual Basic Computer virus IBM PC compatible X86 MSN Messenger WordPerfect History of the graphical user interface Windows API OpenOffice.org Apple Macintosh Emacs IPAQ Sun Microsystems Internet Explorer AppleWorks Internet Relay Chat MS-DOS Graphical user interface Windows 2.0 BASIC programming language Visual Basic .NET Component Object Model Windows 1.0 Quattro Pro Widget toolkit Windows 2000 Apple typography AOL Instant Messenger Microsoft Agent GNU Microsoft .NET Windows NT Web browser Alley Cat Stardock Puzzle Bobble 4 Aqua (GUI) Pocket PC Jam (TV series) Weebl and Bob How the Grinch Stole Christmas!
