how do convert a bin movie to xvid or divx i have downloaded a bin movie i know how to burn it and how to watch it but i wanted to put it onto a disc with other movies so i want to convert it any ideas on a good converter that will change it to xvid divx or avi etc the bin file is a disc image it contains the movie data that you want to get at depending on what format the disc is in you may or may not have to convert it magiciso will display the contents of the disc image and it will probably have a folder called 'mpegavi' or similar if you right click there is an option to extract the file you'll probably find the extracted file is already an avi whether that's encoded with divx or xvid BitTorrent Azureus Kademlia EDonkey2000 Star Wreck Sigur R__s Linux distribution Suprnova.org Peer-to-peer SETI R.E.M.
