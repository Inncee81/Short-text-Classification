netherland rabbit help i want to get netherland dwarf and i need help on how to care for them here are a few tips i gave to another person on a similar question it is best to keep an indoor rabbit but if your going to keep an outdoor rabbit you should keep the hutch in a shed to protect it from the sun and cold weather this should start in spring to allow your rabbit to get used to the weather rabbits are heat sensitive and get heatstroke easily so keep your bunny out of direct sunlight also if you would like to let your rabbit run around and nibble on fresh grass you should buy a rabbit run make sure and keep the run on grass that has not been treated with weed killer if you cannot afford this it is just as good or even better to let your rabbit run around a bedroom cover all wires with chewproof tubing first and close all doors litter training is helpful if you are going to keep your rabbit indoors you should keep it in a cage and let it run around in an enclosed area such as a room some of the time with whichever cage or hutch you may buy make sure it is big enough for the rabbit that you are going to put in it the bigger cage the better the good thing about netherland dwarves is that they do not require a huge cage even though a big cage would still be good litter training is easier than it may sound spayed or neutered rabbits are more easily litter trained since they dont leave waste in any other areas to mark their territory your rabbit will start to leave most of its waste in one corner of its cage put a litterbox in that corner and fill it with dustfree unscented cat litter then place some of its wast inside the box to show the rabbit what it is for litter training should always begin inside the cage multiple litterboxes are sometimes needed when your letting your rabbit run around in the house unless you are planning on using your rabbit for breeding purposes you should get it spayed or neutered this can help your rabbit to prevent certain diseases but also is expensive make sure and find a good vetrinarian for your pet you will need to take your bunny to the vet for check ups monthly also to get its nails clipped regulary and to neuter spay your rabbit find a vetrinarian who specializes in exotics because they are the ones who will be able to help your rabbit the most pet shops usually sell rabbits but they are often healthier when you buy them from a breeder when you are buying a bunny look for these signs to show you that it is healthy looks attentive unclouded wide open eyes healthy coat with unmatted fur strong equal teeth no stains on the fur around the anal area feed your rabbit pellets but stay away from the cheap department store brands it will also need fresh hay at all times as well as fresh water it is important that you keep a water bowl in its cage as well as a water bottle until you see that your rabbit knows how to drink from the bottle your bunny will also need about a handful of fresh greens each day

handful a day if you have a small rabbit if you feed to much your rabbit might get a stomach ache you will also need to give your rabbit wooden chews to keep its teeth down since they are constantly growing my rabbits enjoy fresh maple twigs which are safe to give you can also buy wooden chew toys from a pet store rabbits also need to be groomed often especially the longhaired ones grooming helps to remove old dead hairs and helps knew ones to grow this is important because rabbits unlike cats do not have the ability to throw up so the hairballs can sometimes block their breathing path i have a shorthaired rabbit and use a soft baby brush to groom her if ever you think that too much hair has gotten into your bunny s mouth then feed i a laxative such as a dandelion leaf which should help to clear the throat you should probably do some research before buying one to learn how to care for it you can get this from library books here are a few internet sources that i have found http www hsus
