i want to breed mice or rats well i have a boa constrictor and want to breed some mice or rats both for the experience and hopefully savng on trips to the pet shop i just have a few questions about it where could i keep the cages and if i have them too near my room will my snake freakout because there's food nearby he can't reach is there anything special you need to do with rat mouse babies to keep them fed and everything and is there a cheaper way than the already bagged rat food to give them a balanced diet like are there certain combinations of grocery store bought veggies that would work thanks any help is appreciated but if you're one of those psycho oh no your hurting a poor little mouse you're so mean people could you just hold it to yourself for once i've been feeding him live for about years now and have had no problems while i am fond of mice i do realize they serve a role as snake food so i will do my best to answer your questions keep the cages away from your snake especially when you are feeding your snake mice can sense the predator and it will make them stressed they are also quite adept at smelling the phermones released by the scared mouse dinner of your snake this is especially true if there is blood involved never really watched a snake eat i don't know keeping the mice in a stressed environment would be inhumane and counterproductive to your goal of breeding them there is nothing super special you need to do about the babies themselves i don't recommend just throwing a whole bunch of mice in a cage and waiting for baby city your best bet would be to pair one male with two females and to separate them from her close to birth females can show aggression to another's litter and males have a nasty habit of eating the babies however if you leave the male in with her the night she delivers she will likely get pregnant again immediately because mice go through a postpartum estreous after a day or two it is ok to remove any dead pups from the cage there are almost always dead ones especially with new mothers and old breeders make sure to wean them at weeks so the mother can care for the next litter the lab style rat mouse blocks they sell at the pet stores are really the best easiest cheapest way to feed the critters they look like little beige bricks rats only eat few blocks a day so you can imagine mice eat way less than that if you buy just veggies and such you run the risk of giving them all diarrhea stick with the blocks but feel free to supplement that diet with small amounts of veggies that you probably already have around the house most of what i have said is true for rats too but from my experience its easier to keep rats paired as one male one female rats have larger litters but they take up a lot more space hope this helps add on don't get the cheapy blocks that they sell at like wal mart they come in a box they are not properly nutritionally balanced edit for mrs phas also make sure you are only breeding feeder type rats mice not fancy ones besides from my own experience feeder animals have a better temperament than the fancy ones feeder rats are most generally albino rats that are bred for the sole purpose of feeding predators fancy rats are strictly bred for pet purposes i just suggest feeder boring un biasedly bred for color and coat preference rats because they are easier to handle in my experience Ferret Dog Pet skunk Livestock Nutrition Brown Rat Poker jargon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rat Pet store Snake Kakapo Mouse Chinchilla Vegetarianism Elephant Prostate cancer Vitamin C Discus (fish) Tocopherol Gray Wolf Folic acid Animal testing EastEnders Dobermann Taboo food and drink Stomach cancer Wal-Mart Fecal incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bird Urinary incontinence Kitten Domestic goat Atkins Nutritional Approach Tasmanian Devil Fugu Albatross Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Ron and Fez Garfield Raw food diet Obesity Labrador Retriever Hedgehog Fish farming Japanese tea ceremony Trapping Squirrel Brain Nerpa IBM PC compatible Surveillance RuneScape quests Seabird Red Fox Shark Spider Shaggy dog story Coeliac disease Colorectal cancer Veganism Spidey Super Stories Garter snake Peter Singer Kangaroo German Shepherd Dog Hypoglycemia The Secret of NIMH Food Platypus Social rule Domesticated turkey Bat Craps Genetically modified food Fancy Crane Clinical depression Neopets Tobacco smoking Postpartum depression Floppy disk
