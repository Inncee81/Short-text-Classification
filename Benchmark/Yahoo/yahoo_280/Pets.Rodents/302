what to look for in a pet rat i am going to petsmart tomorrow to get rats but what should i look for when i buy them and i have searched for rats to adopt but there isnt any in my state and the closet rat breeder is a ways away so this is my only choice so please help me out and tell me what i should look for thanks check the eyes and nose to make sure they're clean make sure their coats are shiny and not matted although male rats tend to have coarser coats so don't worry too much if the males' coats aren't super soft handle them if you can to see if they're aggressive or extremely timid some rats tend to be a little jumpy at first but they shouldn't be leaping out of your hands if you're gentle the rats should be curious and try to sniff you come up to you rather than sit in a corner ignoring you if they nibble your finger a little i wouldn't worry they're still young and my rat did this while she was at the store but hasn't done it since then good luck and have fun with your rats Hamster Dog Fancy rat Guinea pig Rat Pet skunk Social rule Labrador Retriever Russian joke Cat Domestic rabbit Characters of Naruto Canary Milton H.
