thinking about introducing a new rat to my current one i've heard that rattie pairs tend to do better than single rats and i've been trying to convince my parents to get her a friend but i'm worried about possible aggression she's not too old yet and hasn't grown to full size although i'm not sure exactly how old she is she already has a strong bond with me but i can't play with her constantly and i'd like to get her a cage mate i'm just worried that she'll become territorial or aggressive to the new rat so what do you think should i get a second rat and if so how should i go about introducing them yes absolutely get a second rat maybe a third too a lot more rat keepers are finding it best to have rats in threes especially if there is one resident rat already remember rats are a very social animal and thrive with other rats although i strongly do not recommend single rats as pets it is still possible but requires a great deal of time to keep your pet rat company i would recommend younger rats than your current girl and of course the new rats should also be females mixing males and females makes for a lot more rats than most pet owners are prepared to care for make sure you have a proper quarantine cage and area for the new rats they should be kept separate at first as far as care and cost you are already tending to one rat taking care of one or two more will be very little additional time if they are all living together the cost of feeding one or two more little mouths is not much more than feeding the first one start with your quarantine after you are satisfied with your quarantine period you can start with neutral ground introductions if that goes well put the cages near each other and try a few more neutral ground visits if all continues smoothly try putting all the rats together in the same home keep an eye on the rats the first little while sometimes up to a day to make sure that there are no territorial cage issues there may still be squabbles but that is normal Hamster Cat Guinea pig House Mouse Animal communication Pet skunk Platypus Ferret Breastfeeding Dog Garfield Divorce Rabies Introduced species Social rule Canary Quarantine RuneScape quests Chicken Animal testing Milton H.
