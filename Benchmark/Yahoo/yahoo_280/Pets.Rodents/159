what type of cage do you think is the best to keep a hamster in i suggest getting a wire cage wire cages are easier to clean and last longer cages like critter trails are bad news they are completely made out of plastic so you have to replace the parts often and replacing this and that every so often starts to become a pain hamsters chew on everything including their cage this is dangerous because they could escape from their cage another bad thing about these plastic cages is the lack of ventilation this results in twice the clean up and the clean up is not easy on these cages they are built with tons of little hiding spaces these little hiding spaces are the areas that the hamster likes to go most which means it's where they will go potty most you will have to completely take them apart to get everything in the cage clean and remember cleaning is twice as often as normal normal is about once a week so you can see where i'm going with that cages like critter trails look like loads of fun for your animal and they can be but i would suggest only using these cages as like a playground for them not a habitat you can provide just as much fun for your hamster in a wire cage you can still get the tubes to put inside their cage and you can use bird toys for your hamster i give my rat toys that have wood and bells on them so he can chew on them they like it just make sure that you get a cage that is big enough to fit a house and a wheel inside of it they need their home and exercise to stay healthy be weary though of wire cages with wire mesh on the bottom letting your animal run around on bare wire is dangerous because their toes can get caught in the metal which can result in the lose of a toe they have plastic coverings for just this instance just know that in time almost everything you put in your hamsters cage is going to have to be replaced in time because of your hamsters need to chew so it would be a relief to know that your cage wont have to be part of the replacing which ultimately means the safety of your pet a ten gallon tank is just as problematic as a plastic cage not so much that they can escape from it but that it too can be a hassle to clean and again it does not provide a lot of ventilation so that ammonia stays in their habitat the ammonia build up is bad because it can give you hamster a respiratory infection which brings up another point make sure to use only aspen or products like carefresh for their bedding wood chips of pine and cedar contain aromatic oils in the wood which some people find pleasant but i'm sure it wouldn't be so pleasant if your face was right next to it all day and when your animal defecates on the wood it causes the oils to come up into the hamsters lungs which can result in a respiratory infection Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Professional wrestling match types Ferret Fire fighting Equine conformation Poker jargon Mattress Drill bit Plastic Wire Welding Seismic retrofit Knife Tobacco Cruising (maritime) Pneumonia Hydrogen economy Animal testing Cocaine Asthma Strap-on dildo Glossary of climbing terms Chair Marine aquarium Carbon dioxide M16 (rifle) Naval mine Fish farming Ammonia Soap Bong John Cage Tire Electrical wiring Social rule Textile manufacturing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bicycle frame Cannabis cultivation Air pollution Sea-Monkey Novelty (locomotive) Lung cancer Brewery Babe Ruth Gas metal arc welding RISC 1957 World Series RuneScape quests Thermal power station Scale model Lionel Corporation Japanese toilet Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Door Perfume Asbestos Cat Compact audio cassette Garfield Toilet humour CPU design The Apprentice 2 Solar power Anchor M60 machine gun Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Barbed wire Combine (Half-Life 2) Top-bar hive Autonomous building Hiking Mechanical ventilation Prostate cancer The Young Ones (TV series) Happy Tree Friends Crate training Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Energy development Casting Glossary of firefighting terms Anthrax Haloalkane Tesla coil Dialysis Haibane Renmei Rail terminology Liquid breathing Chicken Dairy
