which is better hamsters gerbils or chinchillas hi i'm living in an apartment and want a small fuzzy pet to take care of what is my best bet for a great little companion i'm going to be a student in the fall but will have plenty of time to take care of it i have limited space so i'm not looking for one that needs a huge cage or anything i'm also not looking to spend a great deal so which little critter is my best bet p s i am an adult living with other adults so there won't be any little children around to be rough with the animal also i've had hamsters before so i have a little knowledge on them thanks gerbils i own two gerbil people are very jealous of hamsters hamsters have the popularity that rightfully belongs to gerbils while hamsters have cuter faces and softer fur they are just not as nice or fun as gerbils they are nocturnal so usaully all you see is the back of your hamster sleeping in a ball in one corner they are not ready to play until it's time for you to go to bed then they obsessively run that wheel th th tha thumping all night long hamsters smell up the cage very quickly and will pee on you hamsters are solitary animals so you need to keep one per cage this makes keeping them more expensive and breeding them more difficult than gerbils gerbils are great they are dinural so are awake night and day they get very excited about any new thing you put into the tank for them and will immediately explore it you can make cardboard buildings tunnels for them and they will love crawling into through over and on them then they will gnaw it all up you can house two for a gallon set up they are by far the cleanest of all the small pets so bedding is not a big expense they live in clans and groom nest play together you can house up to seven boys in one tank five gallons of space per gerbil they are easy to breed and both mother and father are great parents gerbils come in about colors and varieties they are not a big commitment as the life span is about years of course more than half the people on here are going to say get a hamster because they have never had or even heard of a gerbil before two years ago i had never heard of gerbil either here is my story i went to the pet store to get specifically a hamster i was almost broke because i had spent like all my money on the cage and supplies i had like bucks and was hoping the hamsters were fairly cheap when i got there i realized that all the hamsters were and above just my luck i was so dissapointed then the store clerk let me know that they had gerbils on sale for i didn't know what it was she showed me them and they were all awake playing together i thought they were super cute and decided i wanted one i picked one out and brought him home i'm so glad that i did'nt have enough money for a hamster that day because happy my gerbil is the best pet i ever had i found out that gerbils like to live in pairs or more so i got him a male gerbil friend its now been two years with him and autumn my second gerbil i really hope you get to experience the joy of owning a pet gerbil they are the best rodents to have in my opinion good luck with your decision this site will help you learn more about them http www abcgerbils com Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Meriones unguiculatus Chinchilla Fancy rat Avenue Q The Fairly OddParents Ferret Pet About a Boy Poker jargon Friends Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Sin City Cat Breath of Fire III Dog New York Giants Days of our Lives Knots Landing Miss Saigon Gerbil The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Gaia Online Characters in the Smurfs Ranma __ characters W.I.T.C.H.
