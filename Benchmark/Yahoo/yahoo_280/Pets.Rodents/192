something new for my guinea pig i dont like my guinea pig to be stuck in her cage and shes the only one so i want to give her some more playtime usually i just let her run around the room and i think she likes that but i want to give her more choices any new playtime ideas what do you do for your pig for her to have some fun a toy that i use is cat balls w bells in them you would be surprised at how much they like them they love the sound of the bell inside the ball when they push it around with their noses i figured out that guinea pigs love to crawl around in tight places so sometimes i make a little maze for them w tissue boxes or any other kind of box i think you can also go to a pet store and buy some tubes for guinea pigs to crawl in but whatever you do don't get a ball that some people say they can roll in guinea pigs have bad backs and are not nearly as flexible as other rodents they can really hurt themselves in one of those the balls are only supposed to be made for rats mice hamsters and all of those other little critters before i knew about how bad the balls are for their backs i got a ball for my guinea pigs and i put one of my pigs baby in it and she just sat in there really scared you can also try to teach your guinea pig to walk on a leash some guinea pigs just wont learn because they just don't like it like my guinea pig chester but maybe yours will you can also train your guinea pig to do little tricks i taught my pigs to stand on their hind legs for treats there are tons of things you can do with your guinea pig Hamster Guinea pig Dog training Domestic rabbit Aerial (dance move) The Shining (film) Professional wrestling match types Blonde on Blonde Chinchilla Shaggy dog story Pet RuneScape quests Professional wrestling holds Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Diving Fancy rat Taboo food and drink Sinfest The Sims 2005 ICC Trophy Rodent Glossary of American football Animal testing Milton H.
