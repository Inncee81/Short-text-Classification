new piggie my guinea pig recently died so we've bought a new baby abyssinian pig he's a lot smaller than ginger the brother left behind we've had the baby for days and they're currently kept in two separate cages but near each other we introduced them out of their cages on the second day and ginger kept clambering over and squashing baby as well as sniffing him mainly sniffing his bum he also did a lot of purring and kept following him around in circles he wasn't aggressive we did this for about mins we then tried later for about mins the same happened but then ginger settled down and the baby kept trying to nuzzle in and cuddle ginger wasn't so sure and kept moving but every now and then ginger would sniff my baby's bum and purr most times he sniffed baby's bum baby pooped today third day we introduced them again and ginger still followed purred and sniffed my baby then settled down snifing baby and purring occasionally is this normal and when should we put them in the same cage hutch i know he should have been quarantined for three weeks but we don't have the time as we are going away and we are getting conflicting info we have also been told have read that another pig should be introduced asap else the original pig gets used to being on its own and that in weeks it gets used to being on its own the pig was only brought into the shop from the breeder a few days before we got him was quarantined for a few days in the shop and there is a vet in the shop which will probably have checked them if we register with the shop's vet we can get a free health check so we will probably be doing that the baby pig seems perfectly healthy clear eyes etc he's eating and drinking pooping etc he's not scratching has good skin and fur and if there was an internal problem it is unlikely the vet would even pick it up well you should have quaratines the new pig for weeks to ensure there were no health issues but it is too late now quit seperating them so far you have described a mellow wonderful introduction if that's all the dominance that is being shown you are lucky you should only seperate if there is bloodshed you are starting over from scratch every time you seperate and reintroduce them it causes unnecessary stress for all of you read http www cavyspirit com sociallife htm introductions and follow the instructions steve 's advice above along with his guinea pig caresheets are horrible please use a reputable source for guinea pig info Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Days of our Lives Knots Landing Hamster Cat Elephant Chicken Ferret Breastfeeding Taboo food and drink Fancy rat Pig Livestock The Contender (television series) Gray Wolf Quarantine Dog Daredevil Canary Invader Zim John Peel Progress of the SARS outbreak The Amazing Race RuneScape quests Roswell UFO incident Gramophone record Poker jargon Social rule The Den (television) EastEnders Ginger Rogers Street-Legal Cliff Richard Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield Babe Ruth Rabies Theory of conduct IBM PC compatible Spice Girls Treehouse of Horror V CPU cache H5N1 Infantilism CPU design Jennifer Lopez Apple Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B3ta Doug RISC Pretty Good Privacy Oasis (band) The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Mad Money 613 mitzvot Animal Liberation Front Introduced species Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hiberno-English Tea Los Angeles Dodgers Sharon Tate Characters in the Smurfs Labrador Retriever The Sims Tobacco League of Nations Eric Bischoff Animal testing Kimi Finster Pig (zodiac) Gwen Stefani Cheetah National Football League Hip hop rivalries Sliders Vowel Killian documents Three Little Pigs American Beauty (album) Timon and Pumbaa Ira Gershwin President (game) Ja Rule Liam Gallagher Housebreaking The Pack (Buffy episode) Vampire Tiny Toon Adventures Neighbours
