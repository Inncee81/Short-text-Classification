mice their food okay well i have two female mice just recently my friends mouse died and she still had some left over food she asked if i wanted it and i said yes as it is supposed to be really good quality food and is great for the health of mice i started giving them a mixture of their old food with a small blend of the new food through it to get them used to it before i start giving them a bit more but yesterday i noticed one of my mice's poo is completely green there is small pieces of green food in their new mixture but it's some sort of vitamin mineral not to sure but i'm wondering if this is okay that her poo is green or should i stop feeding them the new food my other mouse's poo is completely normal thanks in advance all should be well but just to be sure feed the mice the same amount you've been feeding them mixed in for about days if the poo is runny you should stick to your old food but if the poo is green that's okay it just means that the quality of the food is different and that its even better their new food seems to be of high quality so just after the days just add more to it about half the mix be of the old mix and half be of the new good luck if you need more information just contact me michael rasdall yahoo com and if you need anything in the fut re also Tocopherol Milk Nutrition Hamster Sea-Monkey Peanut butter Soybean Gas metal arc welding Casting House Mouse Tea Breastfeeding Vitamin D Dietary fiber Portland cement Gasoline Dairy Alcohol fuel Folic acid Piccolo Junior Saga Domestic rabbit Genetically modified food Antioxidant Galactic Civilizations Carburetor Mouse (computing) Extreme Programming Common cold Omega-3 fatty acid Veganism Vitamin C Organic farming GunBound Egg (food) Mickey Mouse Uranium Chicken Nitrous oxide Kenny McCormick Bread Fancy rat Welding Foie gras Yoghurt Tofu Stomach cancer The Amazing Race MP3 Guinea pig Steel Healthy eating Social rule Martial art Charles Goodyear Ant Toilet humour E85 Heinkel He 100 Potato 2000 Australian Grand Prix Captain Thunderbolt The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Sewage treatment Food Bat Thermal power station Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Cheating in Counter-Strike Billiards Calorie restriction Advance fee fraud Cat Shit Gypsy moth DDT Salad Fingers Taboo food and drink Tick Hydroponics RuneScape skills Tamagotchi Winning Streak The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Spider Alzheimer's disease Cheese Nutrient U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Cuisine of Laos Vermicompost Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Ceramics Betting (poker) Rooibos Inflation Ramen Overpopulation Coffee
