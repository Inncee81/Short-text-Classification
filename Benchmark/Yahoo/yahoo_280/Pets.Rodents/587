i need a pet i want another pet and i got for my bday so will you please tell me a pet that i might like i could spend about or more hours w it a day i want either a ferret rabbit guinea pig or something else good no rats mice hermit crabs hamsters or fish no spiders or anything of the like either turtles might be ok no hamsters please guinea pigs have a rather unpleasant smell and they are constantly in need of nail clippings if you don't clip them it can be very uncomfortable for it and if you cut them too short they could bleed out and die rabbits also smell badly and they break their backs very easily once they do this they are irreversibly paralyzed and very hard to care for they are very cute though ferrets can hide easily and escape just as well and unless you bathe them once every couple of weeks they smell bad too but the trick is to use baby shampoo to wash and then rub a small amount of baby powder on them when you are finished and they are dry this is the only one that you can easily bathe of the three i myself would recommend a ferret however it would be difficult to have a dog see above answers because of the lack of time turtles are notorious for salmonella reptiles in general can make good pets but are not a good idea with children birds are horribly messy rats mice and hamsters are basically the same as guinea pigs and keep in mind they are rodents and nocturnal they will keep you up at night Hamster Pet Ferret Coconut crab Ranma __ characters Cat Garfield Nocturnal animal Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Fauna of Australia Rodent Creatures in Bionicle Meat Exotic pet Animal testing Taikyoku shogi Kim Possible Social rule Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Tarantula Knife Who Framed Roger Rabbit Chinchilla Australasia ecozone Ai Yori Aoshi Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Have I Got News For You Internet phenomenon Rabies Upholstery Animal Microchip implant (animal) Rabbit Taboo food and drink Chicken Egg (food) Skunk House Mouse Mickey Mouse Timeline of alternative rock Bird Toilet humour Shaggy dog story Flea Rat Breastfeeding Menstrual cycle Veterinarian Stoat Happy Tree Friends Tooth Sin City Dream Father Ted Feral cat The Secret of NIMH Knots Landing Pig Tiny Toon Adventures Blood (computer game) Thermoregulation Spidey Super Stories Felis sapiens Gal__pagos Islands Sento Minnie Mouse Unclean animals Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hunting Dog training Textile manufacturing Kosher foods Kangaroo Cannibalism Timon and Pumbaa Mammal The Ashlee Simpson Show Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Animals in space Bong Keeshond Sonic Heroes Sluggy Freelance One Piece minor characters Goofy Seabird Gambian pouch rat Aladdin (1992 film) Tooth enamel Strap-on dildo W.I.T.C.H.
