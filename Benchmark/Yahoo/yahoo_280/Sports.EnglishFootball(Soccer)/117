what do you think of sunderland's chances this season i think they'll escape relegation this season they have got a good manager good and supportive chairman and have made a top signing by getting a top quality keeper like gordon which i think will be more important to them than buying any striker as they'll need to avoid letting goals in by the looks of it their game today with spurs will end in a draw with sunderland looking most likely to score which is a great result for them ive got my fingers crossed for them West Bromwich Albion F.C.
