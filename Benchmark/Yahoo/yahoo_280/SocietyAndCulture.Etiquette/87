with manners and etiquette on the decline do you ever feel it is almost a burden to know what others don't not that i regret one minute being raised in a proper home i wouldn't have it any other way but i find myself feeling weary towards others who show their lack of manners to a glaring degree like i am embarrassed for them or something for instance when one year old woman in husband's family smells something she always says ewww who farted was it you was it you i am always horrified for her my husbands family have no manners or more to the point they just don't use them it amazes me that my husband has manners when at my relatives homes but get him around his own and it's a regular burping and farting fest i find it gross and disgusting they don't even excuse themselves when at family dinners they pile their plates to overflowing with no thought that others may want to eat as well i was taught not to be a glutton and never overload my plate we could always go back for seconds the thing i find most rude though is the fact that if they are over for dinner they have no problem telling the cook they don't like something and their children now do the same thing i was taught to thank the cook no matter what and as a kid there were plenty of things i didn't like my parents would have throttled me if i'd complained i refuse to go some places with the in laws as i get embarrassed for them it's not like they don't know better they just don't care Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Customs and etiquette of Japan Social rule Wedding Crashers Laura Schlessinger Jam (TV series) Shit Friends The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Futurama (TV series - season 5) Theory of conduct Bart chalkboard gags Fecal incontinence Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Recurring South Park characters Little Britain Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fancy Crane Transactional analysis Abortion debate Rick Santorum The Critic Ty Cobb Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Knots Landing Marie Antoinette Marilyn Monroe Philosophical skepticism Asperger syndrome Burping Chopsticks Socrates The Delinquents One Tree Hill (TV series) Haven (TNG episode) Meal Economic inequality Back to the Future Kitchen Martial About a Boy Flatulence Polyamory The Star Wars Holiday Special Sauna The Amazing Race Viz (comic) Ontological argument The Adventures of Pete & Pete Infantilism Garfield Jon Secada Anne Boleyn Ayyavazhi mythology Married... with Children Red Dwarf characters Plame affair Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Cro Boston Public The Fairly OddParents Megan Griffin The Jeffersons (South Park) Hollyoaks Social aspects of clothing Rich Mullins Etiquette Scientology beliefs and practices Cindy Sheehan Sydney Riot of 1879 Sento The Apprentice 2 Ben Johnson (athlete) David Hume Blonde on Blonde Have I Got News For You English grammar The Contender (television series) Divorce 1957 World Series Grandview, U.S.A.
