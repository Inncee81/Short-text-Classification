people with no manners how do you put up with people with no manners without telling them something rude and looking like an hole typically i find that the best response to rude behavior is either to ignore it or to tell the other person exactly how their behavior is affecting you make it about the behavior not them and how it makes you feel or how you're impacted for example instead of saying oh that's so gross i can't believe you chew with your mouth open didn't your mother teach you any manners try this ya know i feel really uncomfortable when you eat with your mouth open like that because i can see your food and it's pretty unappetizing from across the table something like that by taking it to an objective place you're less likely to get a defensive response good luck Mojave people Social rule Asperger syndrome Etiquette Theory of conduct Customs and etiquette of Japan Evil Poker jargon Milton H.
