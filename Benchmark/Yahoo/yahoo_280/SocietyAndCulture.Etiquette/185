sailor mouth so it's not okay for a woman to have a sailor mouth but what makes it more acceptable for a man not arousing any gender debate here but just wondering p in society in general women are expected to uphold mannerisms far more than men just for the sake of being lady like but what really is the logic behind it because women are supposed to be gentler nurturing mothers etc i don't mean that in a negative way just trying to guess at the reasoning i know a professional woman who goes to great care to dress stylishly works out gets her hair professionally done carefully applied make up i respected her when i encountered her and assumed she was a classy lady when in a meeting behind closed doors with her subordinates one day i learned that she really has a sailor mouth and i lost all respect for her she didn't need to resort to that kind of language to be effective it just made her seem crass and i don't find it acceptable for a man to do it either and i am actually married to a former sailor i learned some new words when we got married but i try not to use them Gender role Humphrey Bogart Economic inequality Customs and etiquette of Japan Human sexual behavior Homophobia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Feminism American and British English differences Little Britain Theory of conduct Religious Society of Friends Women in the Victorian era Incest Gender-neutral language Japanese tea ceremony Transsexuality Social rule Milton H.
