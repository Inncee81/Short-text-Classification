name for baby embarrasing in social situations hello i'm asking this question here because i want to know what people think will happen to my child in social situations or will she face rudeness in the future my wife and i are picking out names for our new child our last name is jones and we want an unusual first name for the child my brother is against the names below and is trying to persuade me to name them a so called normal name let us know what you think of the names and if you feel these names are obnoxious we like boy names lidell parqwell jarteel hyleek rysteef girl names shaquinda lybinda yoquisha jocquilla wakanella lidell is probably the only one i would go with there are certain stereotypes associated with unusual names particularly racial ones and regardless of how far we've come the world is still not a friendly place aside from that as the spellings are rather difficult it may take your child longer to learn how to spell his or her name if you want to give your child an uncommon name try choosing something that people have heard and can pronounce but is less likely to make your child feel singled out when the teacher can't even say it Infantilism Social rule Autism Phoebe Halliwell Doug Charmed Asperger syndrome Adoption Japanese name Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Family name Breastfeeding Friends Bah__'__ Faith and Education Leo Wyatt Hearing impairment Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mojave people Joke Transsexuality Dyslexia Non-native pronunciations of English Sex assignment Stuttering Sant Thakar Singh Runaways (comics) Drama Married... with Children Milton H.
