what should i do i tried to post this earlier but it didn't go through if it double posts i'm sorry the bf is out of town this week and i thought it would be a nice surprise to clean up his apartment for him before he gets back he has been super busy lately and it has gotten a little messier than he likes to keep it and i know it has been bothering him i hate to come home to a mess too my question is this when i am cleaning what should i do about his paperwork work stuff i don't want to mess anything up or misplace something he really needs how should i approach this i don't want the pleasure of the surprise to be ruined by me having screwed something important up i wouldn't throw anything out i know you are trying to clean the place up but even if something is misplaced that could send him into a tailspin which would defeat your purpose i would stick to places that you know will be easy to clean like the kitchen bathroom bedroom and living room i would avoid any place like an office if he has any paperwork or business materials in any of the places listed above i would either clean around it or move the materials clean the area and then put the materials back exactly how they were i know this seems to totally defeat the purpose but cleaning paper clutter is a whole lot easier and a more manageable task than cleaning an entire home the day he gets back offer to cook him his favorite dinner or order his favorite take out while he goes through his paperwork that at least gives him incentive to go through it Kitchen Avenue Q Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Time Out of Mind The Apprentice 2 Ron Weasley Toilet paper Shaggy dog story 2000 Australian Grand Prix Violin The Apprentice 3 Hell's Kitchen (television) Blonde on Blonde Phoebe Buffay's songs Piccolo Junior Saga St. Elmo's Fire (film) Blood on the Tracks Upholstery Humphrey Bogart Survivor (novel) The Contender (television series) Walt Disney World College Program StarCraft: Uprising Hey Jude Super Chief The Inside Knots Landing Discworld gods Claremont McKenna College Battle of Stalingrad Japanese toilet Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Mach kernel Little Britain Thinks ...
