how do you start smoking this is going to be a strange question but how do you start smoking i don't smoke nor do i ever plan to start but i'm writing a story where someone is starting and he's getting pointers from someone else on how to do it without choking to death or throwing up any ideas on what i could have the character do one thing you could do is have the learning character being caught not inhaling the smoke just taking a drag but keeping it in their mouth this is easy to spot on beginners because instead of a stream of smoke coming out of the mouth it is a puff that comes out all at once people who spot this usually find it funny because it is obvious that the person is a newbie on it other than that just breathing in the smoke is the right way it chokes and hurts the first few times but not much after no throwing up unless the smoke goes in your stomach hopefully the character in the story is going to learn that smoking is a stupid thing to do Bong Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fire fighting Social rule Cancer of the larynx Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling holds Drowning Breaststroke Aerial (dance move) Cigarette Smoking Man Spidey Super Stories Theory of conduct Newbie Pneumonia Mojave people Magic (illusion) Sub-Zero Diving Noob Saibot Professional wrestling throws Breastfeeding Smoking pipe Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels The Amber Spyglass Salad Fingers Milton H.
