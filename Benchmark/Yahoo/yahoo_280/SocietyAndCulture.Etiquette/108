what is wrong with me shouldn't i feel happier at i m a college student yrs old and i dont do anything i went to college hours away when i come home my friends here don t make an effort to hang out we keep in touch it's not the same they re all busy with their own lives we ll grab lunch or something but it s not like we re in each other s present lives in high school i was more social then college i don t have a group of friends the only true friend i have is my boyfriend for a year and a half college i have acquaintances not any true friends i come home for a weekend and do nothing social at college i do the same thing other than class i ve joined student clubs and made acquaintances and that's all my family is the same way they used to be involved in my life but now they are all obsessed with my year old sister i don t want to stay in my hometown forever living in the past i wanna move to a city but i just feel like something is missing in my life is this just growing up what should i do my boyfriend goes to the same college only he is minutes away from home i decided to stay there this summer and work it was really lonely because i don't really feel like i have alot of true friends there he's pretty much it as far as a true friend goes as far as my other friends from high school we have distanced they aren't part of my everyday life anymore i feel like the only person im truly close to is my boyfriend when i do hang out with my other friends he gets kinda jealous especially if i go out to a party or if there are guys there which is understandable so i dont go he always does hang out with me he seems to think i dont make an effort to hang out with friends because he has no problem keeping his friends i did alot of complaining because i do feel lonely alot i feel like he still has all of his friends from high school to hang out with because he's close to home and i dont have that anymore i feel so lonely i think you should move to a bigger city as soon as possible i think that's what you need a city's vibrancy will make you feel more alive the resources available will help you get out and explore more and that is very true it worked for me i knew how it felt when i was in sleepy towns if yours is one it was peaceful but it was also a bit depressing certainly dont make your boyfriend the only person you can turn to this puts a ton of pressure on him work towards cultivating friendships with people you have a good vibe with jealousy is understandable but you shouldnt be limiting ur social life just so he doesnt get jealous i dont think that is healthy also why not visit friends together and have you met his friends most of the times one gets to expand their social circle by including bf's friends in our circle get to know his friends better one thing i do wanna say not everyone can be your good friend so it is okay if there are not many people u can really feel close to also people can outgrow each other and friendships arent the same anymore also it takes time to develop deeper friendships first see what vibe u get from a person do u have any friend who u know likes u and would like to hang out why not take it further visit with them call them a lil more often to see how they are doing give them a lil present ask them deeper questions instead of superficial ones get involved in their lives make them feel special when you give out love you are more likely to be in a position where you will receive love too but for this to happen you also need to take some risks and be in a lil vulnerable position and be ready to take a no always conduct yourself with thoughtfulness and sensitivity to others too i wish you all the best this is surely part of growing up you will realize with time that friend or no friend whether they come or go and they will you have to be your own best friend and be comfy in your own skin The Emancipation of Mimi Kodocha Friends Humphrey Bogart Social rule EastEnders Cliff Richard Avenue Q Theory of conduct The O.C.
