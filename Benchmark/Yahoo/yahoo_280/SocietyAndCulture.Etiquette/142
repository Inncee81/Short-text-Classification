make a card for everyone so this is my last week at my internsip and i've decided to make thank you cards for thsoe that were really nice and friendly to me although all of them were nice but i just talked a lot more with some of them more than others i think i should only make thank you cards for the ones i was closest to which were like of them my cousin says that the norm is that i have to make cards for all of them there are about in total thoughts i don't want to be rude but at the same time i don't think the ones that didn't really talk to me would care when they got the card although they do realize how important interns are to them i would just go to the dollar store and buy a couple packs of blank thank you cards that way you can personalize each one of them it's inexpensive and no one feelings get hurt Theory of conduct Social rule The Apprentice 2 Surveillance Negima The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ron and Fez Major League Baseball television contracts Sheepshead Bon Jovi Adoption Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Futurama (TV series - season 5) Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Poker jargon Fruits Basket Blonde on Blonde Topps Have I Got News For You Card game The Drew Carey Show Roxette Canasta Kender Cindy Sheehan Battles of Lexington and Concord Star Trek Customizable Card Game Sears Holdings Corporation Sharon Tate Saga (band) The Inside Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Friends Detroit Tigers Garth Brooks Wheel of Fortune Animal Crossing The Emancipation of Mimi Pitaten Mao (game) Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Customs and etiquette of Japan Autograph Printed circuit board Contract bridge Budd Dwyer James T.
