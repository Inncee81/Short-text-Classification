why do sales assistants interrupt me while shopping every time i walk in a shop nowadays i'm accosted by sales assistants almost as soon as i enter the shop asking if i have found what i'm looking for to which my usual response is either 'no i wanted to find a shop where i wasn't annoyed by sales assistants' or 'how do i know i haven't had a chance to look yet' followed by me turning straight around and walking out of the shop frustrated the whole experience ruining my shopping experience most of the time they are working on commission but why make it so obvious the rest of the time it is just to make up a score for their mystery shopper survey when will company management realise that the worst thing you can do is interrupt a shopper or even worse a diner who has a mouthful of food sorry to clear up the confusion the guys in places like electrical and mobile phone stores are the ones on comission not all sales assistants btw hope this reaches someone in the management departments of stores and restaurants and those research agencies that run mystery shopper surveys i used to work in retail and i hated that i always had to bug customers but i felt a lot of pressure from my managers if there were people in the store and you were not talking to them then you were not doing your job and you were seen as lazy at the registers they calculate things like average dollar which is the average price per item paid by customers stores generally want this number to be high so they pressure you to 'upsell' meaning they want every customer to leave with not just a pair of pants or a shirt but accessories and shoes to go along with it another issue was getting hours on the schedule it's not always commission that's the motivating factor the workers who consistently did better in sales got the most hours so there was a little competition there trust me most of the salespeople that bother you probably realize you don't want to be bothered and they hate it just as much as you do Retailer The Apprentice 2 Sears Holdings Corporation Little Britain Bulk vending Milton H.
