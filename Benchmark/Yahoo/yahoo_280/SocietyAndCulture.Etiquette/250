what are excellent excuses not to drink i know just simply not wanting to drink should be a legitimate excuse to not drink but what if youre around people who really feel they need to pressure you into drinking what excuses will stand up to their bullying i dont have any problems with others drinking but its just not something i enjoy anyone got any really good reasons not do drink i can have a great time without needing to resort to alcohol perhpas even medical reasons that would make the 'drinkers' more understanding of your reasoning i know once everyone starts getting drunk they will stop pestering my reasoning but getting past the first few rounds is where the story needs to be rock solid oh and there is no way i could say i was pregnant lol when i was in high school i told everyone that i was allergic to alcohol and that i would just puke it back up it work for four years straight and nobody ever challenged me on it once the word got around nobody would offer me a drink because they didn't want to waste a beer i actually got a lot of sympathy and a lot of free soda Alcoholism Mothers Against Drunk Driving Alcoholics Anonymous Oasis (band) One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Michael Garibaldi New Coke Wine Theory of conduct Rape Alcoholic beverage Social rule Soft drink Kodocha Prohibition Poker jargon Sake RuneScape quests Alcohol 2000 Australian Grand Prix Traumatic incident reduction Pitaten Drink __douard Manet About a Boy Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hypoglycemia Mountain Dew Lorraine Baines McFly Beer Caffeine Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Coffee Guinness Humphrey Bogart Boston Public Vomiting LOL (Internet slang) Public house Springfield Elementary School Yerba mate Bong Moonshine The Catcher in the Rye President (game) Nicomachean Ethics Time Out of Mind Knots Landing Daredevil George Brown, Baron George-Brown Hollyoaks Word of Wisdom Veganism The Contender (television series) Binge drinking Maison Ikkoku Heinkel He 100 Drinking culture Brewery Bottle Wheat beer Breastfeeding Sauna Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Drunk driving (United States) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Homophobia Equine conformation Parachuting Transactional analysis Liza of Lambeth Characters of Megatokyo Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Gift economy Australian words The O.C.
