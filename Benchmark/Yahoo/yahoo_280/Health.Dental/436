why do i have nose pain after dental x rays i recently went to the dentist she took a full series of mouth x rays and almost immediately afterwards i had a kind of burning feeling inside of my nose from about the mid nose all the way up to under the bridge of my nose i feel like my nose has been crisped dried out and sunburned inside it's really unpleasant but not intolerably painful one of the x rays she took was from the bottom of my chin and pretty much pointing directly up my nose i can't think of anything else that would've caused this since my nose hasn't been traumatized in any other way should i be concerned about the burning sensation inside my nose or should i just wait for it to subside and cancerous growths to form inside my nose anyone else ever experience this all xray units are required to be inspected regularly so it should be functioning correctly it would be possible to overexpose the xrays these would be so dark as to be unusuable you would know that these were incorrect because they would have to be redone the amount of radiation needed to overexpose the film is much less that the amount to burn you is is possible you are allergic to latex the personnel undoubtably wore gloves which could be latex lips tingling burning or a face rash would be common reactions that doesn't mean the nasal passages couldn't show up as the site of the reaction some of my patients have confirmed or suspected latex allergies we use non latex products in those cases you may want to consider that for further proceedures another cause of the nose issues would be that you are instructed to breathe through your nose if you were hyperventalating who wouldn't with a ton of stuff gagging you the nasal passages will get dried out and be very irritated that should resolve pretty quickly Tattoo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Allergy Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Hay fever Coeliac disease Common cold Clomipramine Carbon dioxide Strap-on dildo Aspartame Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Enzyme Diving Tobacco smoking Drowning Medicine Methamphetamine Carpal tunnel syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Anesthesia Food allergy Traumatic brain injury Hypoglycemia Conjunctivitis Multiple sclerosis Vowel Condom Cephalic disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cup Nuclear power Multiple chemical sensitivity Equine conformation Cat Nasal congestion Oral sex Body piercing Radiation therapy Bleeding Mouth ulcer Post-traumatic stress disorder Crohn's disease Domestic rabbit Casting Eczema Stuttering The Caves of Androzani Plutonium Stomach cancer Cancer Triage Food Air pollution Pain Ebola Rash First aid Jala neti Medical prescription Dehydration Ionizing radiation Lung cancer Wisdom teeth Safe sex Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Spina bifida Anal sex Trazodone Nose Syphilis Herpes zoster Eye Rosacea LSD Scar Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Asthma Tokusatsu Poker jargon Tooth Endometriosis Plame affair Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Narcissism Mercury (element) Mobile phone radiation and health Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hip fracture
