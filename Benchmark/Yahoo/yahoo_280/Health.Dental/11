i'm getting braces tomorrow and i'm really nervous what happens in the orthodontist office and does it hurt okay for me i had them done on both top and bottom they put spacers in between my molars and that was just the elastic that went in between my molars to make room for the metal band like things that went around my molars it hurt a little at first and then it only started to hurt more and more i hated that part so much as one came out and it only hurt more when the metal was put on because the teeth hadn't moved all the way to make room for the metal bit secondly they put a red thing in my mouth that pinched my cheeks so i wouldn't close my mouth and my teeth would stay dry after that you can't feel a thing but the red thing stays in for a while untill everything is in and in place i remembered it didn't hurt at all untill after make sure to ask for wax because without wax your teeth move and it presses against your cheeks and it rubs and hurts so wax ask for that have lip gloss or lip chap on hand because your lips have to move over the braces and licking your lips isn't as easy as it sounds so hope this helps it only hurts after i promise you that but there was no drill that was involved or things like that good luck and don't pick green or yellow Dental brace Drill bit Shaggy dog story Casting Nine Inch Nails Skateboarding trick Tooth Equine conformation Orthodontics Hangul Blood on the Tracks Social rule 1957 World Series Breastfeeding The Adventures of Pete & Pete Piccolo Junior Saga Gag (BDSM) Kim Possible Mnemonic Cosmetics Textile manufacturing Muslim ibn Aqeel Embouchure Jon Secada Knife 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Aerial (dance move) Theory of conduct Oral sex Hip hop rivalries 2000 Australian Grand Prix Time Out of Mind Lip balm Maxilla Memento (film) Harmonica Cat The Dentist Humphrey Bogart Ed, Edd n Eddy Barbed wire Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Saxophone Evidence of evolution The Contender (television series) Queen (band) Characters of Naruto Trumpet Book of Isaiah Procrastination Samuel Goldwyn Dental caries The Legend of Zelda series enemies Salad Fingers Maison Ikkoku H__sker D__ Missouri Compromise Shadow the Hedgehog AFI 100 Years series Budd Dwyer Bon Jovi Tobacco Horse tack Dog training 2004 American League Championship Series Late Night with Conan O'Brien Chopsticks Darken Rahl The Fairly OddParents Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Satchel Paige Frankie Vaughan Milton H.
