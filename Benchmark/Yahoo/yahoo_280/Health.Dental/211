ive got to get braces but im terrifide of needles i faint at the site of them i get them when i go to the hospital for my hips and they have to give me loads of stuff coz i go well weired i got to get atleast two teeth out im not scared of that but of the needle in my mouth last time i bit the dentist by accident but he hurt coz he was trying to do ma teeth then he said he would let me have months as i asked him to wait to see if they become more wobbly i cant have a mask of anasthetic as i often have opperations had so far and only as i had a horrible experience so they have a right job with the needle any advice i cant have laughing gas it makes me sik and i have a fear of things going over my mouth the needle is to get my teeth out you dont have an injection when you get braces i had braces for years and was terrified of needles the only time i didnt mind going to the dentist would be if i was to be seeing my orthodontist because of the lack of needles lol so i know how you feel i had to have teeth taken out as well but it really didnt hurt i had the taken out at the same time so i had to have injections in the roof of my mouth and at the sides so after the first i didnt feel anything it felt great when my teeth were taken out because of the release of pressure on my gums all you'll feel is a little scratch and if you have the taken out they dont give you so much anaestetic in one go because the needle has o go elsewhere so they dont hold it there for as long which i hate dont panic just breathe and try to stay calm if all else fails just dont bite the dentist again remember they are holding the needle just think about the lovely straight teeth you'll get after all the work is done this is the worst part i promise you and even this isn't so bad Dentistry Dental brace Orthodontics Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) -phobia Shaggy dog story Kim Possible Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Dentist Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Drill bit Carpal tunnel syndrome Atomic Kitten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tooth Cocaine Boom Crash Opera Equine conformation Halitosis Breastfeeding One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Jennifer Lopez Ranma __ characters Time Out of Mind Nine Inch Nails Codename: Kids Next Door Late Night with Conan O'Brien Pitaten First aid Diving Shark Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dental caries Milton H.
