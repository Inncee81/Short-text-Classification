how long do i need to wait to get a partial denture i had some teeth extracted april th and wonder how long i need to wait until my mouth is healed enough to get an upper partial as my dentist has not told me anything yet and not having teeth is driving me crazy i'm wondering why your dentist did not fit you with an immediate partial when you were having your teeth extracted i feel that it is better to have an immediate done for a couple of obvious reasons you have your partial with the missing teeth already to wear and it helps to hold the sutures and clots that will form after the extractions by applying pressure against your gums now if the teeth that were removed were not in the front then this could have been the reasoning for not doing an immediate partial but still a temporary partial could have been made and put in after the extractions to hold open the spaces from the teeth that were pulled and worn until the gums healed to get the new permanent partial but healing time is weeks you should have had your partial by now unless there is a financial reasoning behind your not having them already good luck Tooth Dentistry Crown (dentistry) Wisdom teeth Dental caries Tooth enamel Dental brace Oral hygiene Certified Nursing Assistant The Dentist Bruxism Gingivitis Chewing gum Maxilla Tetrapod Internal ballistics Drill bit Mouth ulcer Dental implant Orthodontics Tattoo Tire Body piercing Siphon Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bubblegum Suture Enzyme Babe Ruth Mandible Handloading Earring Manual transmission Gag (BDSM) Social rule Breastfeeding Knife Negima Aloe Charles Goodyear Tongue piercing Glen Jacobs Ammonite Carpal tunnel syndrome Mojave people Equine conformation Condom Screw Horse tack The Contender (television series) Roller chain Halitosis Oz (TV series) Casting Endocarditis Minor characters in Seinfeld Plastic Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma United Kingdom corporation tax Mouthpiece Naruto jutsu Traumatic brain injury Good Times Happy Tree Friends Kodocha Stomach cancer Eucalyptus Medical prescription Tobacco The Jazz Singer Dialysis Scar Dental floss Salad Fingers Sperm Whale Car handling West Side Highway Place of articulation Vulcanization Oral cancer Motorcycle The Amazing Race Freddie Mercury Kurt Angle Bong Diving suit Vernon Schillinger Tractor Jet engine Microeconomics Copyleft Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Poker jargon Gear ratio Lost City (Stargate SG-1) Drowning Revolver
