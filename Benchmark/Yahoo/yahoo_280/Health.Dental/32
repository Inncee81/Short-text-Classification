anyone had a cavity filled by laser tell me 'bout it it isn't bad it's just like a normal filling but they use a laser instead of a drill supposedly the laser doesn't directly stimulate the nerve endings so it hurts less for me that was true at first but for repeated fillings don't think it was on the same tooth it felt just like a regular drill the worst part of it is that your dentist will want to pay for the very expensive laser drill as quickly as possible so it will cost more than a regular filling those machines run about k and the bill is something like more at least for mine but insurance took care of it so i didn't see much of a price difference Tooth Laserdisc Drill bit Dental fillings Health insurance Procrastination Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Oral hygiene Publicly funded medicine Life insurance Laser Casting Modelocking Normal distribution Inertial guidance system Theory of conduct Root canal The Price Is Right Floppy disk Microeconomics Canadian and American health care systems compared Diamond clarity Paintball Growth hormone treatment Laser diode GunBound Dentistry Evan Mecham Inflation Canada Health Act Peter Griffin The Dentist Carbon dioxide After War Era technology Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Glen Jacobs Medical malpractice Cincinnati Bengals Upholstery Prostate cancer Strap-on dildo Education in the United States Wal-Mart Nine Inch Nails Blackjack Printed circuit board Babe Ruth Asbestos Fusion power Population inversion Mutual fund FairTax Philosophical skepticism CPU design Welding PostScript Temporal bone Adverse selection Goodness and value theory Laser engraving Doomtown Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Mach kernel Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Metalworking Apple II family Law of value Radio Yerevan Barbara Boxer Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Weebl and Bob Diamonds Are Forever Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary Commodore International MIPS architecture Methamphetamine Terran (StarCraft) Health care in the United States Economics Homestar Runner Erogenous zone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ford Motor Company National Health Service Future energy development Pittsburgh Steelers Deflation (economics) Firefighter Combine (Half-Life 2) Outsourcing Bart chalkboard gags Economy of the Republic of Ireland Tooth enamel Nuclear power True Crime: Streets of LA Team Fortress Classic Pok__mon Live!
