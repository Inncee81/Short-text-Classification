do crest whitestrips work i got the classic kind that you use for days dont tell me to use another brand because i spent like on these im not going back to the store i just want to know your results thanks please dont tell me to try other things im getting senior pictures taken in weeks i dont have time or the desire to try anything else thanks overall i would say that most of my patient's have had some measure of success with the crest whitestrips some more than others the results are usually pretty quick noticeable in the first few days best in a week or longer it is best if you can do yourself the favor of using them right after you get your teeth cleaned as any staining and buildup tartar or plaque will impede their ability to work also don't use fluoride toothpaste before putting the strips on same reason all of the methods strips trays custom trays in office whitening have the potential to make your teeth temporarily sensitive but will not harm the enamel if you get sensitive use the product every other day in conjunction with a sensitive tooth toothpaste you might try to drink dark liquids through a straw and don't smoke most whitening toothpastes just remove stain on the surfaces of your teeth and therefore are not so effective whatever method you use it will not whiten your teeth for life as you age your teeth will get darker and may need to be whitened again good luck jamrdh a dental hygienist Tooth enamel Fluoride therapy Dental caries Oral hygiene Halitosis Cocaine Tooth bleaching Hydrogen peroxide Dental brace Explosive material Chewing gum Methamphetamine Oral sex Plastic Psoriasis Bong Transformer Insulin Cosmetic dentistry Scarification The Apprentice 2 Breastfeeding Mouth ulcer Dental floss Listerine Textile manufacturing Tobacco Ultraviolet Dairy Raisin Mattress Allergy Japanese tea ceremony Motor oil Sento Insurance Microeconomics Potassium nitrate Dentures Gingivitis Hygiene Acupuncture Chronic fatigue syndrome Shampoo Hamster Social rule Alcoholic beverage Coeliac disease Fasting Sewage treatment Arsenal F.C.
