pain after at home whitening i bought these whitening strips from walgreens i only had them on for minutes supposed to be because my teeth are sensitive to begin with now they hurt with any kind of pressure and it was just the first application but parts of my teeth are super white and other parts aren't affected what gives the whiter spots on the teeth are just dehydrated which is a normal part of the process as the stain is drawn out of the tooth surface and this will go away once the tooth rehdryates if your teeth are already quite sensitive then the dehydration process and opening the pores of the teeth to draw out the stain is probably irritating the nerve of the tooth this sensitivity is even more common in teens which may not apply to you i would recommend to stop the whitening until you use a sensitive toothpaste on a regular basis for a few weeks and see if that helps good luck jamrdh a dental hygienist Tooth Tooth enamel Dental caries Toothpaste Fluoride therapy Oral hygiene Psoriasis Hydrogen peroxide Oral sex Pneumonia White noise Domestic rabbit Halitosis Mouth ulcer Pain Fecal incontinence Tooth bleaching Gingivitis Dental brace Acupuncture Acne Hamster Chronic fatigue syndrome Cosmetic dentistry Crown (dentistry) Chlorpromazine Mandible Plastic Shark Methamphetamine Female genital cutting Dentistry Color blindness Upholstery Fibromyalgia Allergy Local anesthesia Headache Eye Glycerin First aid Medical prescription Toothbrush Chewing gum Cocaine Wisdom teeth Breastfeeding Dehydration Reflexology Drill bit Normal distribution Listerine Potassium nitrate Certified Nursing Assistant Erogenous zone Penis Coeliac disease Radiation therapy Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ultraviolet Sleep apnea Breathing gas Urine Bruxism Western blot Nutrition Fluoride Corrosion Dilbert Traumatic brain injury Massage Paget's disease of bone Microeconomics Glossitis Decompression sickness Sperm Whale Childbirth Dental fillings Mercury(II) chloride Dental implant Dentures Explosive material Teen Girl Squad Tuberculosis Eczema Face Foreskin Multiple sclerosis Aloe Ammonia Pulmonary alveolus Magnetic resonance imaging Leaf Hand grenade Urinary incontinence Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Side Characters (Xenosaga)
