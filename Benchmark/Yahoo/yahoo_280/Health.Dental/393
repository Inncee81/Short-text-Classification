how long should it take for the swelling of an abscessed tooth to go down after starting antibiotics it's been week since i took my boyfriend to the er with an abscessed tooth where they proceeded to open the abscess and drain it they prescribed antibiotics and vicodin which he has been taking religiously he's down to pills left but his poor face is still horribly swollen looks like he has a lemon stuffed in his cheek and he still feels crappy should i take him back to the er or is this normal if they drained all the pus then he should be better by now typically people will start feeling better hours after starting antibiotics for a simple bacterial infection the fact that he's not feeling better suggests that either the bacteria causing the abscess were resistant to the antibiotic that was prescribed or there is still a pocket of abscess somewhere that wasn't drained the abscess gets a thick wall around it that the antibiotics can't penetrate if it has been a week and he really isn't getting any better then i would have someone take a look at him again Pneumonia Group A streptococcal infection Abscess Cellulitis Antibiotic Mastoiditis Gonorrhoea Psoriasis Penicillin Common cold Meningitis Guinea pig Boil Streptococcus pneumoniae Tuberculosis Tonsil Fancy rat Conjunctivitis Pelvic inflammatory disease Traumatic brain injury Helicobacter pylori Bacteria Antibiotic resistance Dialysis Gangrene Brain abscess Pharyngitis Otitis externa Chronic fatigue syndrome Dysentery Breast Otitis media Inflammation Cystic fibrosis Staphylococcus aureus Virus Lymphogranuloma venereum Prostatitis Ulcerative colitis Iatrogenic Rosacea Vancomycin Diarrhea Mouth ulcer Gingivitis Tooth Clostridium difficile Melioidosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) First aid Breastfeeding Infectious disease Infectious mononucleosis Transformation (genetics) Halitosis Eczema Legionellosis Crohn's disease Shrimp farm Domestic rabbit Plasmid Cephalexin Chancroid Dental caries AIDS Ciprofloxacin Phage Malaria Anthrax Beta-lactam antibiotic Erysipelas Amoxicillin Multidrug resistance Epididymitis Nutrition Body piercing Tofu Medical prescription Bubonic plague Syphilis Methamphetamine Wisdom teeth Diverticulitis Sexually-transmitted infection Capital punishment Nocardia Fistula Chlamydophila pneumoniae Necrotizing fasciitis Dracunculiasis Foodborne illness Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Cholecystitis Urinary incontinence Escherichia coli O157:H7 Livestock Sinusitis
