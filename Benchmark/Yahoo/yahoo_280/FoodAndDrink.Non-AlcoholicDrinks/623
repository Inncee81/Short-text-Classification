why is snapple tea so inconsistent in flavor i like lemon snapple tea but in tastes lousy why is that have these people not heard of quality control is it perhaps produced on east coast and changes in transit en route to wc does it change as it ages short shelf life often when it tastes bad a lot of sediment is in bottom sometimes not often when safeway has a sale well you guessed it what's up with snapple inconsistency it could be all of those things you mentioned but i think that primarily it's the batch of tea that they use tea leaves are not a chemical so each batch will not be the same the leaves could have been dried differently from a different region of the world from a different blend etc to add to this the brewing process at snapple if they do brew it could be different the temp of the water the length of steeping the tea leaves could be different the best thing to do is to brew your own tea and put it over ice and add sugar sugar is not the same as high fructose corn syrup Tea Coffee Brewery Beer Rum Honey Snapple Homebrewing Sugar Green tea Soft drink Bread Cuisine of the Philippines Black tea Sugar beet Herbal tea Oolong Lemonade Yerba mate Rooibos Corn syrup Diet soda Coca-Cola Alcoholic beverage Brewing New Coke Sprite (soft drink) Gatorade White tea Sweet tea Tofu Fujian tea ceremony Lemon Horehound Chinese tea culture Hop (plant) Maple syrup Illegal drug trade Cider Scotch whisky Carbon dioxide Ice cream Tequila Ayahuasca Teapot Peruvian cuisine Gin Sewage treatment Cheese Vitasoy Soy sauce Food preservation Japanese tea ceremony Tea bag Cigar Cha chaan teng Coffea Cuisine of Malaysia Wheat beer Starch Samovar Cuisine of the Southern United States Cajun cuisine Biochemistry Cuisine of Singapore Pu-erh tea Date Palm Golden syrup Vinegar Erosion Ethanol Hong Kong tea culture Jewish cuisine Tea Classics Japanese cuisine Kit Kat Yoghurt German cuisine Cuisine of Argentina Cantonese cuisine Mead Cigarette Miller Brewing Agriculture Cinnamon Bengali cuisine Single malt Scotch Cocaine Lambic Stout beer Shochu
