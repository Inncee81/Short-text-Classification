how do i tune a violen i can tune a guitar i'm great at the guitar but how do i tune a violen do i have to use the stink thingy to hear the notes or could i just pick the strings to tune it oh and where to i tune with the modules at the top of something else hi samail to tune a violin you will need to have one of the following a tuner either violin or chromatic tuner you can find more information in the tuners section perfect pitch you can discern the pitch of a tone without the aide of any other device a keyboard or a tuned piano this is to give you a reference while tuning a violin teacher there are ways to tune a violin tuning pegs or fine tuners also called string adjusters tuning pegs are used for tuning when the string is at least a half note out of tune while the fine tuners are used when the string is less than a half note out of tune fine tuners' tuning range is a lot smaller than the tuning pegs for more experienced players you will find that their violins are not equipped with fine tuners on a d or g strings only e string is equipped with a fine tuner this is because e string is the most fragile and requires the most care during tuning if strings are very out of tune you need to take extra care while tuning if all strings are very out of tune gradually tighten each string in the sequence of g d a e the reason for starting from g string is to prevent damaging the thinner e and a strings tighten only note higher on one string at a time then tighten the next do not tighten one string all the way to the desire pitch while leaving the other strings very loose this will create unequal pressure on the bridge causing it to fall since the tuning will cause enough movement of the strings and sway the bridge you need to make sure the bridge continues to stay perpendicular to the violin surface while being tuned make sure the bridge is completely straight especially where it makes contact with the strings if it has become tilted carefully make it straight the violin bridge is neither glued nor screwed onto the violin it is the tension from the strings that keeps the bridge in its place in order to keep the tuning pegs from slipping you will need to apply inward pressure on the tuning pegs toward the violin head as you turn the tuning peg tuning pegs are tapered hence the inward pressure will ensure that they stay in position once released if you have tuner pluck the string and the tone will get registered on the tuner if you have a chromatic tuner it will tell you what note you are on and how much further you have to go if you have a violin tuner the tone will not register on the tuner until the tone is within the tuner's detection limit this is usually note below or above the desired pitch once you are within notes from the desired pitch you can use the fine tuners to adjust each string if you cannot tighten a fine tuner any more loose the fine tuner half way first then bring the string closer to the pitch by using the tuning peg then use the fine tuner again for the adjustment depending on the design of the fine tuner fine tuners that are tightened all the way are more likely to dent the violin top since the space between the violin top and the fine tuners is very small if you cannot loosen a fine tuner any more tighten the fine tuner half way first then loosen the string closer to the pitch by using the tuning peg then use the fine tuner again for the adjustment if strings are slightly out of tune you should always follow the instruction above you may be able to tune the strings with just the fine tuners however you should always check to make sure the bridge is still straight after tuning i would suggest that you either take a few violin lessons to get started or view the following sites to be perfectly blunt however nothing can take the place of an actual teacher when one is attempting to learn a new instrument good luck the violin is an absolutely exhilarating instrument to play http www
