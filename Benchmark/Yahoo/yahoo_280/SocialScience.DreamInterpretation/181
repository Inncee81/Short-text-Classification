a bizarre dream last night interested in your interpretations what would you have to say see details briefly in a far off european city i'm in an affluent suburb village irish people think dalkey other people think riveria only not as sunny i'm in my s and yet with my mother who wishes to be with me as i go around meeting people i meet a friend i haven't seen in ages then suddenly i'm flying gliding over the crest of a tidal wave which sweeps ruthlessly over the village but luckily my mother and friend is further uphill and hence safe when the waters recede i'm with sara sidle csi investigating it seems there was a carved chair with an eagle on top of the chairback actual carved chair from my childhood which was bought in an antiques shop this chair is jinxed the eagle is broken in half but the new owner was about to restore it chair in pieces my mother happy my friend and i go off for a drink with sara sidle i would give you some background but i think it would colour some of your interpretations thanks your desire to see the world seems to be hampered by the opinion of your mother who's opinion you feel you must take into account she is worried that you will encounter danger you meet an old friend which is you wanting to widen your social circle the tidal wave you are flying or gliding over this tidal wave which is your inner knowledge that adventure is scary but even though it feels slightly out of control it is an enjoyable experience even if the consequences are catastrophic you are confident that yourself and your loved ones will be ok the chair represents your childhood which you have out grown jinxed chair is unwanted someone was going to restore it which means restore the confines of childhood but it is now smashed never to be rebuilt your mother can see this and is happy so you continue on your life knowing that it is resolved you've outgrown the protective confines of your childhood and wish to demonstrate it to your family who will be worried about you but you know everybody will be ok in the end good luck and enjoy Knots Landing Sara Sidle The Amber Spyglass CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Shaggy dog story Pitaten Tears for Fears Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jacob Pavlovitch Adler Wood carving One Tree Hill (TV series) Sin City Pysanka Characters in the Smurfs Goodness and value theory About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Paragliding Parachuting Transsexuality Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Narcissism Brave New World Initial D Tide Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ron Weasley Peter Pan Twin Peaks Care Bears Daredevil Haven (TNG episode) The O.C.
