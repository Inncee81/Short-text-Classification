what does my dream mean last night i had one of the best sleeps ever but i had a naughty dream about a young guy i work with he's and i m i think he's sweet but don't fancy him he's a little bit nerdy but in my dream he was quite sexy strong and i remember him being very protective of me and i got the sense that he really cared for me as i say i don't fancy him but it felt very real i spoke to him earlier today and he's so friendly i am in a relationship years but i know some dreams have hidden meanings or you work through problems in your dreams what do you think it meant simple somewhere at the back of your mind you want either him or your boyfriend to be like the person you saw in dreams please note it is the apearance of the personb in your dreams which you are attracted to and not the person i guess Dream Social rule Jon Secada Avenue Q Cliff Richard Lucid dreaming Time Out of Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Philosophical skepticism Out-of-body experience Theory of conduct Megan Griffin W.I.T.C.H.
