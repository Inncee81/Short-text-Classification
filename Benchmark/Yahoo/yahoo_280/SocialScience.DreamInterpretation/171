i have had this nightmare for years wat can it mean since i was i had this dream were i had a clone one was a good one and the other one was bad my good clone would be trapped in some sort of bubble with stars inside and nobody could see me they only can see the bad clone and in my dream i see my bad clone killing my family and the good clone is forced to watch the bad clone kill and laugh and make strange faces at my good clone wat can this mean i have these dreams since and im now i have these dreams like twice a week i dont have a grudge against my family im not a dream interpreter but dreams are dreams fictional i think the reason you may get this re eccurance is because you are watching too many movies or violence or something that relates tot the dream you saw in a movie and also because you keep thinking about it and what it means that it comes back if you dont think of much else that day and only think of one thing over and over it will be repetitive also try getting more sleep it sounds like since your having nightmares its due to lack of sleep and do you really have a grudge against your family no or at least i hope so so dont think about it Dream Boba Fett Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones Shaggy dog story Notable lines in the Star Wars series Force (Star Wars) Bad Wolf Lucid dreaming Death Star Wes Craven's New Nightmare The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Dean Koontz Avenue Q Mulholland Drive (film) Characters of The Sandman Sadako Yamamura The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie K' Scenes from a Memory God Emperor of Dune Obi-Wan Kenobi Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith IBM PC compatible Social rule The Cursed Videotape Bubble Bobble The Pilgrim's Progress Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Human cloning Sin City Nute Gunray The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nightmares (Buffy episode) Kimi Finster Punk ideology Crime film Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Luke Skywalker Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Treehouse of Horror V Paul W.
