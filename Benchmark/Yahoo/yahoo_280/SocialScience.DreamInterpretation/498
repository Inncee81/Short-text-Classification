what does this dream mean well i remember there was a row of us sitting on the floor somewhere and i was sitting next to this guy and i think we started play fighting or something then we kissed and then he tried to look down my top and i pushed him away laughing and he tried to pull me closer again the boy i regonise him as someone in the year above me at school we have never ever spoken so i have no idea why he appeared in my dream i also find the dream weird because i've never kissed anyone before also i've never been out with anyone seriously they wouldn't want to go out with me anyway haha chances are that particular boy being in your dream is just a coincidence your brain throwing a random boy into that situation however you've got to remember there is reason for your brain creating the dream in this manner you could want to date to kiss someone or something along those lines but be worried about what the consequences would be Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q 50 First Dates Dream Milton H.
