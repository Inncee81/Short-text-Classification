what do you make of it i had a dream a while back that i still vividly remember i was jogging through a neighborhood i lived in when i was a kid when i spotted the playground there i sped up to check it out and see if it was as i remembered it i glanced back to see a dark hooded figure standing in the middle of the road so in panic i began to run away i turned left around a corner but the figure was now in front of me it was menacing and i remember being scared for my life i whirled around only to find myself not in my old neighborhood but in a place i had never seen i was surrounded by oak trees with leaves padding every step i suppose it must have been autumn maybe a couple hundred feet from me i saw a house one of those traditional two story new england houses i ran inside and for some reason thought i would find my family there my shoes were loud on the hardwood inside the house as my calls echoed through its empty rooms moving towards the door i felt the urge to look behind i did and found the cloaked figure at my back again in fright i turned and dashed for the glass paned front door but the cloaked man was now again in front of me before i could react a knife found its way into my abdomen and i awoke i'm pretty sure i remember him having one of those grim reaper style scythes at first according to dreamcrowd to dream that you are jogging suggests that you are proceeding through life in a steady pace you are not really taking any action toward changes some people have reoccurring dreams about a small kid while others from time to time dream about unfamiliar children the kid in your dream could represent your inner self or the child within the dream could be based on childhood memories and it may carry a specific message or bring up long buried issues on the other hand the dream could simply be a pleasant memory children in dreams could symbolize a need and an eagerness to learn simplicity intuition new endeavors and many other positive attributes of childhood occasionally the child in your dreams may be pointing to your own childish ways therefore consider all of the details and the tone of the dream before making an interpretation try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Glossary of partner dance terms The Time Machine Tag Contredanse Scenes from a Memory Episodes of Lost (Season 2) House of Leaves Volleyball The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Paul Is Dead Professional wrestling holds Dream Shaggy dog story The Dalek Invasion of Earth Marching band Social rule Fast bowling Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Japanese tea ceremony Columbine High School massacre Blackjack G-Man (Half-Life) The Shining (film) Salad Fingers The Empty Child Running Death (personification) Aerial (dance move) Jon Secada Blood (computer game) Haibane Renmei Parade (military) StarCraft Secret Missions Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories One Tree Hill (TV series) The nature of God in Western theology Characters of The Sandman Miss Saigon The Pilgrim's Progress Fischer Random Chess Shadow the Hedgehog Urinary incontinence Equine conformation Father's Day (Doctor Who) Glossary of American football Time Out of Mind Sin City About a Boy Swingout Out-of-body experience Horse gait Transformers: Armada The Inside Expert system The Doctor Dances The Death Gate Cycle Mickey Mouse Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pitaten Skateboarding trick Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) False memory K' Dead Like Me Vegeta Wood carving Professional wrestling aerial techniques StarCraft: Uprising Cliff Richard Alexander Technique Avenue Q Softball Customs and etiquette of Japan The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind American football Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Gospel of Mark Macbeth The Subtle Knife Doctor (Doctor Who) Dissociative identity disorder Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism House of M Datalore (TNG episode) Miracleman Figure skating Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Friends Japanese toilet Indianapolis 500 Collision detection
