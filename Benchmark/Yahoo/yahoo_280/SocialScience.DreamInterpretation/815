you close your eyes surrounded by silence you are relaxed and without worry where does your mind take you my mind goes to a peaceful location deep in the forest there is a small hill at the top of the hill above a lake and towering spruces there is much sun magnificent sunflowers grow there tall and majestic little birds have planted the seeds there one day i will lie beneath these flowers and be with someone special we shall not have any cares or upsets close to nature in our own paradise we will embrace i will pluck a small bloom for my hair talking for literally hours and hours our souls we will bare sipping wine and giggling as i look deeply into his eyes we share a lingering and tender kiss a kiss of all kisses two hearts will then feel as they are beating as one this is exactly where my mind takes me in such moments Sunflower Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Japanese tea ceremony Milton H.
