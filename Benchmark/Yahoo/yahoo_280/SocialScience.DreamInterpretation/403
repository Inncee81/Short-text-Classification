death dream i live in a small apartment and i dreamt that i woke up one night and saw all these round figures landing on the ledges and on top of the airconditioners on my building and on the one opposite my building as i looked on when the figures landed they extended a bit and i realized they were humans one landed right in front of my window then they did backflips of the ledges and landed on the ground some shook violently before they died and i could hear their bodies landing making loud flops as they impacted the concrete then some medics and people on the ground went and attended to the 'jumpers' who were still having seizures i woke up and it was dark and some light was coming into my room through the blinds from my window which was towards the end of my room it was exactly like my dream before the guy who landed in front of my window did a backflip onto the ground i saw his face he was determined and looked like he knew exactly what he was doing i live on the th floor in a private building here in hong kong right below my building is a private area so there are not much people going by my window is right at the foot of my bed all the jumpers had shaved heads like myself but they were chinese in my dream i heard a lot of thuds but i only actually saw about jumpers i know there were more no i did not watch any action movies before i went to bed i had dinner watched letterman sent out some emails and went to bed mmm try not to think complicated thoughts your dream just means that you need to worry a little less cheerios Avenue Q Opportunity rover Sento The Shining (film) Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling attacks Skateboarding trick Sin City Out-of-body experience Equine conformation Milton H.
