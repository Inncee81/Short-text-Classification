end of the world i dream of scenes like the movie days later it's the end of the world and there are few humans and many walking dead granted it is a horror movie and things like that give people nightmares but this seriously disturbs me i remember hearing that people only have about a couple nightmares every few months i have these dreams a few times a week in the dreams all i do is hide from them and stay as quiet as possible so what does this mean if you are contemplating some change such as moving ending a relationship even redecorating you may be afraid of the change 'ending a world' so to speak or maybe a friend or family member is changing in a way that makes you feel abandoned anyhow try to think of things that you are happy about especially at bedtime the theme seems to be fear or abandonment count the ways n which you are secure The Shining (film) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jon Secada EastEnders Wes Craven's New Nightmare Dream Freddy Krueger Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Horror film The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath A Series of Unfortunate Events Care Bears Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Ten Commandments Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Lucid dreaming Social rule Jiddu Krishnamurti Marilyn Monroe Cliff Richard All Quiet on the Western Front Characters of The Sandman 1957 World Series AFI 100 Years series Fantastic Four Paranoia Agent A Nightmare on Elm Street (series) The Amber Spyglass Buffy Summers Goosebumps The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hellraiser Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Little Shop of Horrors The Exorcist III Philosophical skepticism Big Brother UK series 6 Nightmares (Buffy episode) Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) The Emancipation of Mimi Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban A Nightmare on Elm Street Rais massacre Scenes from a Memory The Tale of the Body Thief Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Pitaten Obi-Wan Kenobi Gorillaz The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Book of Isaiah Father's Day (Doctor Who) Memento (film) Spider-Man 2 Kodocha Volkert van der Graaf Wheel of Fortune Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
