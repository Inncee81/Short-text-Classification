last night i had a dream and in it i had a pet fox he was very cute a little like a puppy then today while driving home i saw one cross the road i had to step on the brakes so fast anyways do you think this means anything or are dreams just dreams btw there were feeligns of my pet fox being in trouble at times and i was worried for him the fox crossing the road today could have been a coincidence but i think your dream means that there is a project of some sort that you are fond of that you have some doubts about or maybe someone you know who is a little sly that you think needs to watch out our dreams don't always make sense to us but it is our inner mind processing the info that we receive every day sometimes its nonsense but i watch mine because they always have a meaning to me Philosophical skepticism The Pet Sounds Sessions Dream Housebreaking The nature of God in Western theology W.I.T.C.H.
