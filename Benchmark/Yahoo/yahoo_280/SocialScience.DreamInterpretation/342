really weird dream want to know what it means ok i had a dream that i was a mermaid who wanted to go to live on land so when i did i was caught by an older lady and she put me to court and i kept on blowing my cover like my fins were peeking out of my skirt and when i opened the water it was squirting into a waterfall and i was turning into a sea creature i felt really lonely and i just remember wanting to go back to the sea then i woke up and fell back asleep and had another dream that i was at a grocery store with my friend and we saw this really cute register guy and we were so excited but he didnt like us back and we were getting a poster of him and then we found out that the poster was stolen so we had to give it back the peculiar thing about this dream was that everything was dark and dreary like this horror movie like there were clouds and everything was empty except cars i really wanna know what this means according to dreamcrowd to see water in your dream symbolizes the meeting between your two states of mind the sand is symbolic of the rational and mental processes while the water signifies the irrational unsteady and emotional aspects of yourself it is a place of transition between the physical material and the spiritual to dream that you are on the beach and looking out toward the ocean indicates unknown and major changes that are occurring in your life consider the state of the ocean whether it is calm pleasant forbidding etc to dream that you are looking toward the water suggests that you are returning to what is familiar to you alternatively you may be adapting or accepting to the changes and circumstances in your life to dream that you are relaxing on a beach signifies that the coming weeks will be calm and tranquil for you your stress will be alleviated and you will find peace of mind to dream that you are working on the beach might signify a business project that will consume most of your time try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation The Amber Spyglass The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Psychoanalysis Lucid dreaming Dream Jon Secada Modernism Characters of The Sandman Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Sigmund Freud Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Consciousness Futurama (TV series - season 2) A Course In Miracles Soul One Piece minor characters Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Shaggy dog story Force (Star Wars) Scientology beliefs and practices Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Characters in the Smurfs Meditation Edgar Cayce Waking the Dragons Cognitive science Mantra Hypnosis Infantilism Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shark Artificial consciousness Changeling: The Dreaming Opportunity rover The Little Mermaid (film) Obi-Wan Kenobi God Emperor of Dune Cannabis (drug) Book of Revelation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alcoholics Anonymous Ten Commandments Marilyn Monroe Avenue Q Social rule Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Clinical depression Human Autism Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Urinary incontinence The Invisibles Scientology Objectivist philosophy Sant Thakar Singh Funeral W.I.T.C.H.
