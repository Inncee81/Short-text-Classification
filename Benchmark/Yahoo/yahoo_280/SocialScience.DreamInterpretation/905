how is it we see ppl in our dreams whom we have never come across or met or never seen i see soo many ppl in my dreams who i have never encountered with then how is it possible that i see them according to dreamcrowd it is very common to dream about all kinds of faces strange faces and familiar faces alike are frequent images in our dreams interpret your dream by considering the face and the general content of the dream a stranger's face could represent different parts of your personality or psyche you think that you are seeing a stranger but in actuality you are seeing a different part of yourself jung said that the stranger is a part of you that comes from the unconscious a comic face may indicate that you have a conscious or unconscious need to mock or snub the conventional featureless faces suggest that you may feel unnoticed and unappreciated on the other hand some believe that the blank or unclear face represents a teacher that is someone who is there to show and teach you a lesson but you are unprepared for it and the face is blank smiling faces are representative of happy thoughts and feelings and possibly anticipation of a joyful event in the near future always remember the compensatory nature of dreams and their ability to point to the opposite of what you experience in daily life try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Carl Jung Dream Consciousness Unconscious mind Analytical psychology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Collective unconscious Psychoanalysis James Hillman Oneiromancy Fictional character Alexander Technique Karen Horney Lucid dreaming Arthur Schopenhauer Free will Happiness Narcissism Meaning of life The nature of God in Western theology Gestalt therapy The Giver Artificial consciousness Near-death experience Drama Carlos Castaneda Philosophical skepticism Current teachings of Prem Rawat Scenes from a Memory Jungian psychology Modernism Michel Henry Cyberspace Episodes of Lost (Season 1) A Course In Miracles Edgar Cayce Synchronicity Shadow (psychology) Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Characters of The Sandman Myers-Briggs Type Indicator God Emperor of Dune Theory of conduct Objectivist philosophy Eyes Wide Shut Jiddu Krishnamurti Stranger (Myst) Socrates Milton H.
