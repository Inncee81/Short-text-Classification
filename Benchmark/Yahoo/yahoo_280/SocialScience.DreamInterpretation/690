dreams about my ex bestfriend i met my ex best friend when i was and we were best friends for years not until our first year of college which was last fall of she turned her back on me after she joined a sorority to make the long story short i constantly have dreams about me and her meeting again and confronting each other about why we broke up and eventually we become friends again the same scenario occurs a lot just in a different setting i e at my house bumping into her at a store walking by etc also in my dreams we're always crying of sadness because we miss each other sometimes i wake up feeling emotional because it felt so real as much as i dislike the person she's become does this mean that i still care for her and that i wish she were my best friend again or what's the deal keep in mind that i have these dreams a couple of times a month at first it was just a dream that happens once and only once but it comes back all the time please help hi you are clearly hurt and confused by your friend's behavior she has abandoned you and betrayed your trust as a friend and confidant these long term relationships that are so cruelly ripped away can be as devastating as a loss in your own family it would be highly unusual for you not to be grieving some for your friend who hasn't even asked you to join this sorority these kind of breaks can challenge our beliefs about friendship and its meaning can make us question our own value to others as a friend can make us question what it is that we may have done to cause such a betrayal this makes me very sad friendships are often more important than family relationships your feelings are normal and if you allow your feelings to surface and deal with them time will heal your great loss meanwhile look forward to reaching out in other environs such as a club at school or sport to replace what you lost it appears she was not a good friend but a social climber you must prepare for the eventual return of this person she may discover her mistake and seek you out for rapprochement she may not but she will experience similar symptoms to your own when not too busy with her new sisters meanwhile good luck and god bless One Tree Hill (TV series) Miss Saigon T'Pol Pitaten Infantilism Social rule EastEnders Clinical depression Transsexuality Knots Landing Eddie Guerrero Jean Grey Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix W.I.T.C.H.
