what does it mean when this happens lately i've been getting a lot of feelings many more than usual that seem to be accurate about certain things i don't understand this but they are things that some certain people know and i couldn't have known unless i was there which i wasn't i also keep getting these religious dreams that are somewhat confusing but not bad at all what is this something else odd a bit ago i had this dream that i visited a friend of mine in the dream i was wearing this white dress and standing in her doorway i wear a t shirt and shorts to bed not a white dress but she told me that she could swear she had a dream of me standing in her doorway with that white dress i had never told her of the dream what does this kind of stuff mean and yes i've seen a doctor i thought it was mental illness but i was told all is normal what else could it be a lot of people have psychic experiences it's simply something that's not talked about as to what it all means you're the only person who can answer that it means what you think it does Milton H.
