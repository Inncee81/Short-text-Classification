friends from school i keep having dreams of people that i went to school with nothing in paticular is going on just normal day to day stuff i figured its because i have a myspace account but half the time its people who are not on my friends list these people just come out of nowhere i am years old and the last time i seen some of these people was years ago but in my dream they look the same as when we were kids why according to dreamcrowd our dreams are full of symbolism with their messengers being all different types of people it is very common to dream about our friends these are individual that are emotionally valuable to us and we learn about ourselves through them dreams are very rarely prophetic thus whether your dream was good or bad don't expect it to come true this dream is more than likely attempting to bring up uncomfortable feelings that you have about yourself or others remember uncomfortable does not necessarily mean bad dreams are created by our own thinking processes our own thoughts conscious or unconscious create dreams thus the mind that created the dream also knows its meaning see also people try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Dream Unconscious mind Sigmund Freud Consciousness Out-of-body experience Social rule Lucid dreaming Carl Jung Edgar Cayce Artificial consciousness Psychoanalysis Gender role Repentance Psychology of religion Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Jon Secada Surrealism Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Theory of conduct Art Infantilism Objectivist philosophy Milton H.
