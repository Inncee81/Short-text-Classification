what does it mean when you see yourself going up in a red elevator i saw myself going up in a building with a red elevator and i reached the roof and when i got there there were a lot of young people in some kind of a pool party i'm young also so i didn't like to party and went two floors bellow i sat in a balcony closed my eyes and i could feel the fresh air what does this means thank you in advance thank you sugar babe red and elevators symbolize a rise in passion the fact that you didn't join the pool party party is self explanatory interacting with your peers and water pool is a kind of freedom a relaxing of inhibitions a link to the primal self since you went down floors retreating from the pool party it seems to me that you have decided not to give in to your primal urges and to not indulge in lowering your inhibitions especially since you found the air floors down refreshing my compliments good for you World Trade Center King Khalid International Airport William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham Sauna Stairway Freedom Tower Urban beach Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Solar power Mid-levels Milton H.
