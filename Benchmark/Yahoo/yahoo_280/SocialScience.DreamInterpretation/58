can you interpret my dream last night i was having a dream where i was being chased around a market by bad people but i had done nothing wrong then i jumped over this fence ran across a field with them still chasing me i got to a kind of lagoon with some really weird giant plants in it think jurassic park jumped in the plants were scary to the people chasing me but they gave friendly vibes to me helped me breathe under water then i climbed out the other side the bad people were preparing to come after me i climbed up these rocks went through this passage when i got to the other side there was another world but exactly the same landscape as the old one i ran back to check saw the old world the baddies coming for me then walked back into the new world it was full of all my friends but like parrallel universe friends i felt safe loved decided to stay there knowing the bad guys couldn't get me i woke feeling amazing the best feeling ever at peace with me the bad people were troubles that you have in your life either past or present that you haven't been able to escape i believe the dream represents the struggle to overcome these problems and the different routes that you have or wished you had taken to escape these troubles the fact you woke feeling amazing reflects the fact that you have now achieved closure from your troubles and can start again fresh Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tag The Amber Spyglass W.I.T.C.H. 1957 World Series Jon Secada The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie One Tree Hill (TV series) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Lovely Bones Escape from New York Theory of conduct Pok__mon Live!
