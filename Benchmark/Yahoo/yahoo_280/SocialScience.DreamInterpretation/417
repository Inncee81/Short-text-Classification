dream help the other night i had severely violent dreams it wasn't mindless violence i was trying to protect my friends and family my dream had two parts the first i was in my house and there were these people there that i just knew were my friends even though i don't know them now that i'm awake this pale guy with long dark hair and this girl showed up outside my house then they tried to beak in to kidnap someone i grabbed the shotgun and tried my best to shoot them but for some reason it would not work no matter what i tried i think they took a few people and this other guy showed up trying to shoot someone in the house through a window i positioned myself so that i could shoot him and check everything on the gun and when he was about to shoot i pulled the trigger then my dream changed with no known result of my previous efforts i had been kidnapped and this guy was trying to hold up this business with me i guess as a human shield i then broke a glass tabletop to hit him i do have precognitive dreams sometimes but what does this mean some dreams are not directly related to the outside world or the happenings i think this one is related to something internal i cannot make the exact connection yet the first impression and this is what flashed in my thoughts is that you have something internal going on that is trying to or almost trying to kill you im sorry if that scares you but you have the chance to correct and fight back and change the outcome before it carries you away email me if you want me to detail best wishes Jon Secada Sin City Scenes from a Memory Columbine High School massacre Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Donald Neilson Out-of-body experience EastEnders Bad Wolf Reservoir Dogs The Invisibles Shotgun Gun politics The Amber Spyglass Team Fortress Classic Kurt Cobain Perfect Dark Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Poker jargon Knots Landing Internal ballistics Philosophical skepticism Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an StarCraft: Uprising Salad Fingers Bob and George YuYu Hakusho Airsoft Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Shaggy dog story Syphon Filter House of M Methos Kyle Broflovski One Tree Hill (TV series) Rod Stewart Trigun Wyatt Earp M16 (rifle) Pretty Good Privacy Miss Saigon Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Taxi Driver Milton H.
