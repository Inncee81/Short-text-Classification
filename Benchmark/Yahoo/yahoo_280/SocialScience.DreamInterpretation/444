i've been having a dream of a stalker it is the nd time this has happened but in both reams they were different people in the first dream i was driving my friends van i don't know why and i had alot of clothing with me and my dog as well i pulled over to ask directions from a police officer and in a car on my right this pyscho started hitting on me i started speeding up to get away but eventually we got stuck in traffic and he got out of the car i got out of the car started running and it all ended in my being raped i then made some agreement so that this man wouldn't harm my family even if it meant hurting me eventually i got home all my my stuff including my dog and the van were home as if nothing had even happened my father and my brothers went nuts when i told them and the mad hunt began by the time we were all in the car ready to go the station i woke up the nd dream is a little different i was new at college and i only knew people there my older brother and this other guy i had all my things with me my dog my clothing and i was moving into the dorm but for some reason i kinda skipped the me settlnig into the dorm part and we kinda went straight into socializing on the campus there was this guy blonde hair blue eyes tall and built just gorgeous woh was apparently one of the most popular guys at the school somehow this guy had his eyee on me but i refused so he kept pushing andi kept saying no eventually this became a dangerous situation whenever he saw me he would go crazy doing everything in his power to get to me and i would be running and hiding and he'd be breaknig down walls to get to me there was this other girl who had a crush on him but hated me b c he had his eye set on me anyway the last thing that happened in the dream was a school party and we were all in a huge gym and for some reason i thought he was dead but he wasnt someone told him i was there and he came after me i had to run into the basement then sneak into someone elses dorm room this girl who let me go to her dorm had a crush on my brother either way by the time i got there i realized that the girl who hated me was there i followed her into another room after she had scoffed at me but whne i got there she disappeared then i woke up i think i also should mention that the dorm rooms looked like old dirty jail cells for some reason only a few of them looked like regular rooms also i know this is getting long lol but i'm not going to a sleep away college i'm currently attending a community college which is why thisthe nd dream struck me as very strange i also should add that i havent actually seen stories on the tv about stalkers i make it a way of life not to watch the news unless its the weather or read the newspaper unless it involves something in my career choice according to dreamcrowd to see or drive a van in your dream symbolizes convenience and or practicality consider the load that you are carrying and what you can handle don't stress yourself out dreaming about the police could symbolize many different things so please consider all of the details carefully if the police are chasing you it suggests that you may be feeling some guilt about something that you have done or have been thinking of doing the police could be addressing karmic law as well as the laws in our physical world if you are feeling that you can't meet all of your obligations and fear repercussions due to an unmet commitment the police may be an unwelcome sight on a more positive note and depending on the details of your dream the police could symbolize support and protection your emotional response to the dream will provide you with good clues to interpreting this dream accurately old dream interpretation books say that dreaming about police is an indication that you will obtain unexpected assistance with a current problem try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Sin City Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) EastEnders Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) The Catcher in the Rye W.I.T.C.H.
