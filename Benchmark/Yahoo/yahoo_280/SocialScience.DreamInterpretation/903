i have a dream nemesis why does she keep popping up okay a little back drop about my dreams i have lucid dreams all the time so for the most part i have control i am also tuff as nails i can be fighting zombies and kicking some major bum but be darned if this little nemesis keeps popping up it is basically a foot tall blond hair darkened out eyes porcline doll in a yellow and pink floral dress with curly hair and red ruby lips never seen this doll before i only see her in reflections and i am not even thinking about it i will be enjoying a lucid dream then look into a mirror and there she is behind me staring up at me with dark hollow eyes i just freeze up or wake up the way i have been dealing with it is just avoiding mirrors in lucid dreams the tricky hussy got around that by appearing in the reflection on a door handle when i turn around she isn't there but then i am too afraid to look back to the reflection how can something harmless like that cripple me when i have so much power in my dreams it could mean a couple of things do you have a friend or someone that you know that is perfect at almost everything if that's the case it could be that girl the perfect doll that seems to bug you because you think she's too perfect and flawless i've had a dream just like that except she wasn't a doll she was like everywhere in my dreams and everyone adored her or it could have to do with yourself since you're saying that you're tough as nails maybe there is a soft side to you a feminine side the cute dress the blonde hair to you that you want to come out but you feel it's going to change your life and might risk something also to dream that a doll comes to life signifies your desires to be someone else and escape from your present problems and responsibilities dolls may serve as a means to act out your wishes to see a doll in your dream symbolizes childhood innocence and light hearted fun those dreams are common you're spiritual self can take the place of any inanimate object and try to bring out some message Lucid dreaming Characters of The Sandman W.I.T.C.H.
