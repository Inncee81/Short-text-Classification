really bad dream ok i had this dream that my mother was on her death bed she was almost all gone and i could not find a way to go see her but the crazy thing was that every one was at my house my dad and sisters and they had there friends over and they were all drinking what do ya make of that dreams are made up of symbols that help us deal with problems that we face during the day the symbols help make it easier for us to deal with in my opinion i think you are feeling like the only person to take responsibilities in your life that you feel all alone and that no one cares about anything but you i think these feelings of responsibilities are making you feel trapped and unable to fulfill your responsibilities and that no one else notices this while you are doing what you know has to be done you feel that every one else is just kickin' back and enjoying life Social rule Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten Shaggy dog story About a Boy Friends W.I.T.C.H.
