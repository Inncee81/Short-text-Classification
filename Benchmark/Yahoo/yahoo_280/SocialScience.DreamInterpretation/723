dream help there are dreams that are all the same but each have different elements so i will post all three on here and please tell me what you think they each mean i would appreciate it if you would please answer all three i shall write them one after the other as fast as possible thanx here is number i am standing in the air i mean the whole area is just complete sky i look down there is no ground nothing just sky then as i stand there stairs comeout of nowhere in front of me leading up i hear a voice that tells me to approach and climb the stairs i do as they say and reach the top then a cloaked man with a large beard pops up and begins to talk to me as he is talking to paths come up out of nowhere i can not see where either leads on one path is some of my friends from school and on the other is my girlfriend the sage tells me to choose which path to take because one will help mankind and the other will end it so i choose my friends continued below then as soon as i take my first step the whole area becomes black and then i fall and hear the sage tell me that thanx to me all humankind is dead what does that mean remember please answer my others as well more detail is revealed through each dream whenever i look at dream content i would look at the dream content as symbolic rather than simple representation though it is possible that in this case your friends could simply represent your friends and your girlfriend could represent your girlfriend it's also possible that these represent aspects of yourself for example your friends could represent your childhood when you were younger and more carefree and went along with the gang and your girlfriend represents you as a young man as you are growing older and maturing and accepting responsibility for yourself and the world around you you need to think carefully about these people and what they represent to you in your heart and mind to get a better understanding of their place in this dream given the storyline though my tendency is to interpret this as a dream about you feeling divided in your maturation process you feel as if you are somewhat adrift in your life and unsure where you are going the cloaked man in the dream seems to indicate the presence of an elder man or wise man or some spiritual guide that gives you some direction but ultimately you do understand that you have to take responsibility for yourself this is somewhat frightening to you which is where the imagery of the end of mankind comes in you feel as if a bad decision you make will be ruinous to mankind as much as good decisions will be helpful to humanity you come to the point where you must make a decision whether to be responsible or to remain somewhat childlike and have taken the path of least resistance the one where your friends are this is the one which has caused the ruin of mankind i think that this is your subconscious tickling you about something perhaps you have or are considering succumbing to peer pressure when you know that it's not the right thing to do this is a normal part of being young of course but it's something that you feel is not right and you feel that you should have outgrown by now this is your dream self telling you that it's time to start growing up a little more One Tree Hill (TV series) Human Religion Pitaten Ten Commandments Infantilism Kain (Legacy of Kain) Incarnations of Immortality Shaggy dog story Scientology beliefs and practices Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Sri Aurobindo God Emperor of Dune Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Past teachings of Prem Rawat The nature of God in Western theology Original sin Scenes from a Memory Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Socrates K' Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religious Society of Friends Transactional analysis About a Boy Hinduism Simone Weil The Time Machine Social rule Parsifal Dream Revelation Carl Jung Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Avenue Q Gautama Buddha Book of Revelation Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Glen Jacobs Urantia God and gender Justification (theology) Storytelling God Victor Cousin Fast bowling Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Meaning of life Jiddu Krishnamurti Deluge (mythology) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Neo (The Matrix) Education Empathy Origin belief Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Ages of Myst Salvation Sant Thakar Singh Children of Dune Daredevil Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones Paranoia Agent W.I.T.C.H.
