please help me interpret this dream i think i am having premonitons which i have been having for i guess a year now my nanna died two years ago this november and then my poppy died nine months later in july please help me interpret this dream because when i went to a web site they could'nt fully interpret it i was in my omi and opa's house but instead my poppy was sitting where my opa sits usually then all my family was there asking my poppy how florida is and etc then i looked over at my poppy and i saw a person who looked like my nanna and was holding a black cross i screamed poppy what is that sadly no one else saw it so i glance over at the tv and something is there it had one blue eye and one brown eye this person did not look like my nanna and had blonde curly hair she looked aged s maybe i screamed again and sadly again no one else saw it so i looked again and it was gone so then i looked over my poppy and there it was again i grabbed her hand she told me her name was linda and that my nanna wanted her to sorry couldn't finish it not enough room so as it continues come and talked to me in a calm peaceful voice she told me your nanna loves you and your poppy is going to be happy now and then i woke up when i woke up i was crying for some reason two days later i found out my poppy died please be serious about this and the really weird part was that my nanna was buried holding a black cross please help me you have no idea how much this is appreciated thank you for your time and hopefully your answer what does this dream mean please do not answer with dreammoods i was there when the dream first happened and they did not answer my question at all we were veryyy close my nanna was like my best friend so was my poppy actually come to think of it my nanna's best friend's name is linda but she doesn't look like the one in my dream and my nanna was only when she passed away wow i am adding a lot of extra details lol but if any one of you has any more info on this dream and you already answered my question but you also had a few questions and i was a little unclear please e mail me asap last extra detail normally this wouldn't be very confusing but to someone that is just a preteen me it is really confusing please help i'm terribly sorry about your nanna and poppy did you happen to see that black cross with your nanna before like did she use to carry it around with her bits and pieces of your memories usually end up in a dream together as for linda she could be a representation of death obviously but not like the grim reaper do you know anybody named linda she's like an angel here to tell you that everything is okay she's like a messenger she could also have been a friend of your nanna if you knew a linda or if your nanna was around i remember having elderly neighbors the old lady died and then the old man was left alone it's definitely hard when you are old and lost the one that you truly loved so i mean i'm not saying your poppy's death shouldn't have happened that soon but it's hard to deal with old age and losing your wife at the same time so maybe it could have been a coincidence which is a word i hate to use especially with dreams that your dream and the death happened at the same time Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Pitaten Dead Like Me Marilyn Monroe The Amber Spyglass God Emperor of Dune Little Britain Theory of conduct Knots Landing The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 2) House of M Blood on the Tracks Time Out of Mind The Inside Avenue Q Meaning of life Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mary Poppins Piccolo Junior Saga Reservoir Dogs Jon Secada Jean Grey Miss Saigon Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Methos Kasparov versus The World "Weird Al" Yankovic Salad Fingers Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Father's Day (Doctor Who) The Pilgrim's Progress Kurt Cobain The Ashlee Simpson Show RuneScape quests Mojave people K' StarCraft: Uprising Humphrey Bogart She Loves You Insane Clown Poppy The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Social rule Waking the Dragons Night (book) Philosophical skepticism Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blonde on Blonde Rei Ayanami Theodicy Paul Is Dead W.I.T.C.H.
