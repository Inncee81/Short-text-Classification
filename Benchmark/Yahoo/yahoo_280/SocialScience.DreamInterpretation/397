i had another wierd dream what could it mean it was like i was in my bathroom which has a window that looks out into my backyard and i was looking out the window then i saw my mom and sister playing with the robot thing there's this group of trees on the outside of our fence and when i looked over there i saw this little troll doll you know the things with the crazy hair and stuff walking out of the group of trees it wasn't a robot or anything it was just a troll doll then it walked over to my sister and mom then i woke up d what could it mean weird don't take any of this too seriously and disregard the dramatic text in the excerpts from a book someone gave me as a gift because i was always having the wierdest dreams glass 'to dream that you are looking through glass denotes that bitter disappointments will cloud your brightest hopes ' window 'to see windows in your dreams is an augury of fateful culmination to your bright hopes fruitless endeavours will be your portion after this dream to look through a window and see strange objects appear foretells that you will fail in your chosen avocation and lose the respect for which you risked health and contentment ' mother 'for a woman to dream of her mother as she appears in the home signifies pleasing results from any enterprise ' sister the book only had something on stepsisters go figure but 'to romp and play with children denotes that all your speculation and love enterprises will prevail ' gargoyl similar enough to troll 'means that you and a close friend will part ways to dream of one coming to life signifies that sorrow and misfortune are imminent ' trees or woods 'to dream of woods brings a natural change in your affairs depending on the nature of the woods if they appear green the change will be lucky if stripped leaves it will prove otherwise ' my vague interpretation of these separate components combined is that there is something in business or a relationship you have been working hard on and had high hopes for and which has been thriving and successful so far signified by your playing mother and sister its present prosperity is going to change signified by the trees woods for the worse with a parting of ways signified by the troll and the glass window Pysanka W.I.T.C.H.
