i have a recurring dream that i encounter and survive a tornado what does it mean the details of the dream vary for instance if i am out in a field or the woods or in my car the recurring part is that a sudden storm sets in i look up and see a tornado of mass destruction headed right for me in every dream i am able to either outrun or successfully hide from the tornado i think i am usually alone when facing the tornado any ideas a tornado symbolizes cleaning like think of the landscape after a tornado has gone through it might be that you have just gone through a torrential part of life and now you are feeling cleansed and ready to start anew the other aspects of the dream woods field car etc may symbolize the parts of your life that have been cleansed and how you escaped every time may symbolize how you dealt with each cleansing i say may might and maybe because this is only a basic guideline dreams are unique from person to person so what is a symbol in someone's dream isn't necessarily the same thing in yours Lisp programming language Disaster Thomas Cole Carl Jung God Emperor of Dune Meaning of life Artificial consciousness Royal Air Force Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Shaggy dog story GunBound Binary numeral system Final Fantasy magic Severe weather terminology (United States) Scenes from a Memory Dream Transformers: Cybertron Laws of cricket The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Page Falkenberg Twister (film) Insurance Halting problem Writing system Meaning Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak Turing machine Paranoia Agent Unconscious mind Characters of The Sandman Infinite Ryvius Obsessive-compulsive disorder Tarot Haibane Renmei G__del's incompleteness theorem Carlos Castaneda Iconography Apocalypse Kirby's Adventure Avenue Q Professional wrestling throws Modernism Dramatic structure Sin City The Amber Spyglass Linked list Therion (band) Aikido Kashrut Autism Theory of conduct Nationalism Traumatic incident reduction Music Immortality Phaedo Database management system Logic Philosophy of language Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Pikmin Glossary of graph theory Out-of-body experience Consciousness Gestalt therapy Extreme Programming Infantilism Philosophical skepticism Drill bit Tornado Silent Hill War of the Worlds (2005 film) Datalore (TNG episode) Natural disaster Tropical cyclone Architecture Supersymmetry Tri-State Tornado The Endless Nihilism Recursion Revolutionary Girl Utena DDT (professional wrestling) Umbra (World of Darkness) The Parting of the Ways 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Zerg Urantia Soul Please Save My Earth Eternal return Mount Vesuvius Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Humanist Movement Legendz Lucid dreaming Animism K' Scientology beliefs and practices 2channel
