i keep having dreams about guys i don't know last nite i had a dream that i met this guy at a party and we were really in to eachother but he said he is so i did not want anything to do with him cuz am and he's then few night's ago i had a dream about a hot guy named ryan who is way way older then me i think he is over but that is the only person i knew in my dream's it's like every nite i met someone else i don't know y it's weird then i had a dream about my stalker i did have one in real life she was in love with me and she would email me all the time and say very nasty and sexural things y am i thinking about that scary lady again and guy's i dont know am not scared of boys i have had boyfriends i told my best friend about that weird lady and my friend said something to her and she left me alone maybe it's trying to say that you shouldn't judge someone by their age for both scenarios with the guys you seemed to like them but you didn't do anything b c of their age and about the stalker it's kinda hard not to dream about scary things in life dreams are usually your thoughts in the back of your head that sometimes appear in your dreams so if something like a stalker was upsetting you or you just thought about it for a second you probably thought about it more in your dreams the best way to not dream about this stalker is to tell a close person that way there's a chance that you won't dream about it Jon Secada Friends Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart The Ashlee Simpson Show Scenes from a Memory The Lovely Bones Hall & Oates "Weird Al" Yankovic EastEnders Guy Chambers Phoebe Buffay's songs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City Marilyn Monroe Time Out of Mind Blood on the Tracks Extras (sitcom) Mary Jane Watson Social rule Daz Dillinger Jean Grey The Amber Spyglass The Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Jeopardy! in culture Cliff Richard The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Fictional crossover Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Transactional analysis Miss Saigon The Smoking Room Thinks ...
