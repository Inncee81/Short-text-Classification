i have this reccuring dream about my ex i've had twelve dreams about my ex in the past month and my grandmother even had the same dream that he and i have gotten back together this is creepy we broke up on really bad terms and actually can't stand each other and we haven't been together since march this year we don't even speak to each other we don't even acknowledge the fact that either one of us is alive we're dead to each other so what could this be about when you sleep your mind continues to think about all the issues that need resolving i think the clear concise answer is just that there is something unresolved about this relationship you say that you broke up on really bad terms and that you are dead to each other well you had a relationship with him you had a chance and romance and a friendship ending poorly leaves many many questions the hardest ones are within yourself was i fooled by him how could i be such a poor judge of character was there something wrong with me even if these don't seem to really be that important to you your brain is still trying to work it all out so get on to answering these things and allow yourself to fully move on best of luck my life used to be filled with such things Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Knots Landing Pitaten Nicomachean Ethics Friends Goodness and value theory Days of our Lives Everwood Samuel Goldwyn Avenue Q Social rule The Amber Spyglass Animism Phaedo SCO-Linux controversies Current teachings of Prem Rawat Love Hina main characters One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Consciousness Sharon Tate Numerology Meaning of life 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Smoking Room Coming of Age (TNG episode) Calvin and Hobbes Poker jargon Abortion debate Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Incarnations of Immortality John Lennon The Death Gate Cycle Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Scientology beliefs and practices Neighbours Spanish verbs Shaggy dog story Philosophy of language Philosophy of mathematics Haibane Renmei Polyamory Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Trinity EastEnders The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Philosophy of mind Edgar Cayce Crossing Jordan Originalism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Game show Twelve Swords of Power Uzumaki Naruto Deconstruction Sin City Luck Soul The Unquiet Dead Mat Cauthon Resurrection of Jesus Phoebe Halliwell Glen Jacobs Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ocean's Twelve Scenes from a Memory Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Shining (film) Conker's Bad Fur Day Carl Jung Halo (video game series) John Berryman Ontological argument Philip J.
