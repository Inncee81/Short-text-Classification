a proffesional dream interpritators opinion ok so yesterday i spent the day on the computer like i usually do and i looked at tupac alive therios for the majority of the time now when i went to bed i dreamed i was at my cousins house and there were a lot of my family there well later on in the dream i am at the dinner table with my mom and i look at the window and a vision appears its a black and white picture of the white house and the sky is pitch black clouds and the moon is tupac and he has the pose like george wasington on a quarter then a table appears the same table jesus was protyaed in his last supper picture exept there were two tupacs sitting down and then one more appeared and said i told you implying i told you im dead idk thats what i would like to know if he came to me in my dream and sent me some kind of message later in this dream i was playing a video game then there was another vision of tupac that scared me and woke me up what does all this mean i dont know what to think of it the fact is this dream had nothing to do with tupac in my dream it was thru my eyes and i saw visions what does it mean if you see visions in your dream and in my dream i was spending time at my cousins house with family and whatnot like i usually do and when i saw that vision i became afraid in my dream i woke up about three times last night i had different dreams and most of them i cant remember i only remember that part and anyone who thinks the tupac alive theories are false and think he is dead should check out this website http www tupac m m com it means you are using your head as something other than a hat rack and that in searching for one truth you find many more and if you can handle the truths behind the lies that lie under the truth that is really a lie all together now all it means is that you are a dreamer and that your dreams like your life can be what you make them so who knows maybe tupac did give you a message work it out Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tupac Shakur Lucid dreaming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Resurrection of Jesus Philip K.
