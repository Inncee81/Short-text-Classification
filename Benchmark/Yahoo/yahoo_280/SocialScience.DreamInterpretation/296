i have had many dreams lately and there is one that is still in the back of my mind in my dream i was in the middle of the ocean with no land in sight there was a whirlpool below me and i had wings the where brownish in color with white feathers i did not look the same and i held a staff across from me was another figure i could not make out his appearance however he had a sword and he had wings and they where black i remember there was lighting and we fought in mid air a battle that lasted for a long time however the sword struct my staff and it broke in pieces i was seriouly wounded and of my wings were broken that was when i fell head first into the whirlpool in the middle of the ocean i looked up only to see the figure looking back at me my first pair of wings i used to wrap around me like a cape since it was very cold i tried to extend my other wings but could not i then saw a light at the bottom of the whirlpool and the pendant i had around my neck started to glow and i just could not stop from falling does ne no what this could mean you have a fear of someone they are represented by the other figure in your dream Professional wrestling throws Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Haibane Renmei Suplex Ko shogi Bassoon Link (Legend of Zelda) Colours, standards and guidons Shen Gong Wu Brewery Battle of Waterloo Weapons of Middle-earth Pearl United States Air Force Aerial (dance move) Capercaillie Kirby Professional wrestling holds Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mattress Vegeta Gandalf Shadow of the Colossus Drizzt Do'Urden Gears and Vehicles (Xenogears) Transformers: Energon Dai shogi Equine conformation Sesshomaru Waking the Dragons Canadian Armed Forces Jersey Devil Piccolo Junior Saga Seabird Ostrich Mario Sub-Zero Atlantic Ocean Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Professional wrestling match types Leopard Battle of Berlin The Legend of Zelda series races Battle of Worth Comanche Ronin Warriors Siegfried Schtauffen USS Taylor (DD-468) Hikari Kamiya Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Battle of the Pelennor Fields Great Mazinger Professional wrestling attacks Yohoho!
