i have a question when i was younger i used to have the same deam all the time it was kind of a nightmare but it wasnt from watching a scary movie or anything it was really weird and it was the same exact dream every time i had it which was kind of alot what is that supposed to mean tia berry umm well it was a dream that an old lady was going to cut my fingers off so i had to hide from her f sorry if u guys got all moody because i didnt say what the dream was about i figured u could just tell me what it means to have a reoccuring dream but whatever u want tell me my gosh what a terrible dream the good news is that the lady in the dream cannot really hurt you and in fact she is probably there to try to help you in some way sometimes nightmares happen because those are the dreams we remember fingers are a symbol for pinpointing a problem now you don't say if it is just one hand or both but having your fingers cut off would suggest giving up your power in some way that also causes you to make a less than positive choice the old lady is you so this is a dream about you trying to get your attention perhaps because there is something you are doing some direction you are taking which is sapping your energy does that make sense in connection to something going on in your life this is a powerful dream and if you can get at the root problem there will be great benefit to you good luck Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Dualism (philosophy of mind) K' A Nightmare on Elm Street (series) Jeopardy! in culture Paul W.
