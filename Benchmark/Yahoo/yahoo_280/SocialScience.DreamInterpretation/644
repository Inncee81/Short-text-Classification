can you explain my dream i had a strange dream i was over a my boyfriend and he had a girl that he work with and he told me that his going to sleep in the same bed as her and i got the couch and in my dream i didn't care just walked out and told his sister that i am breaking up with him as i left i smiled did you like the smile do you want to break up with him and felt relieved to have a good reason to do it before he dumped you were you smiling because now he is her problem lol or were you smiling because you saw what needed to be done and felt pride in yourself that you had the courage to do it so well or something else now take the feelings out of the dream scenario and put them where you think they best fit in real life do you have a difficult decision to make about something that will alter your life in a big way perhaps your dream is telling you to choose the answer that takes courage and tough love or maybe it is telling you to generally trust in your own personal strength you will be able to make the choices that make you feel pride in yourself or maybe g d forbid it is a premonition i don't hold to that personally but some folks do if you need to ask any questions of your boyfriend in order to feel more secure then just remember how you reacted in your dream if there is a problem drop it like you mean it and say it with a smile W.I.T.C.H.
