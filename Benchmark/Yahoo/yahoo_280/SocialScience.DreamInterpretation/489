help my dream thats slightly different each time i keep dreaming that i suddenly sat in the backseat of the car the car is moving but no one else in it i get worried the car will crash on the road so i have to hop into the driver's seat to start driving it before there is an accident as soon as i touch the steering wheel the car starts to get a little hard to control so i have to concentrate to keep it on the right side of the road i'm only and having taken a driving test but i have had lessons what does this mean my mother found apples on the floor when she was walking through the park there were no apple trees nearby does that mean anything special let's start with the apples you don't have to have apple trees in order to find apples on the ground people can drop apples anywhere this is actually considerably more relevant than it seems people often overlook the obvious when attempting to determine cause and effect this can lead to all kinds of superstition and religious belief i e 'we are here so 'god' must have put us here' or 'life is complex so it must have been created' as far as your dream about being in the back seat of the car that's a no brainer you are afraid of losing control while driving unless you are riding in the back seat and the driver decides to bail out that situation will never occur however you will run into situations while driving where you might lose control of the vehicle and being inexperienced you are right to be concerned about this keep a few things in mind always obey speed limits and if conditions are bad rain slow erratic traffic etc then slow down or even pull over always keep your hands on the wheel and do not talk on your cell phone put on makeup eat or do anything else while driving Car handling Indianapolis 500 Automobile Tire Ayrton Senna Driving Road traffic accident Manual transmission Car safety Drag racing Bike lane debate Rules of the road Motorcycle Skateboarding trick Fast bowling Rain Man Road safety 24 Hours of Le Mans Formula One regulations Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Traffic light Driver's license Shaggy dog story Hitchhiking Drunk driving (United States) Airbag Cruise control 2000 Australian Grand Prix Badaling Expressway Anti-lock braking system Rear wheel drive Rail terminology Four wheel drive Sport utility vehicle Steering Formula One Jackass: The Movie Hybrid vehicle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Crash test dummy Aerial (dance move) Tank The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) Bicycle Back to the Future Seat belt legislation Steering wheel Recumbent bicycle Tenshinhan Mercedes-Benz A-Class Fire fighting Traffic Billboard (advertising) Roush Racing Mach kernel Auto racing Escape from New York RISC Paul Is Dead Taxi Driver Headlight Predestination Formula One cars One Tree Hill (TV series) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Dodge Charger Seat belt Horse gait Transportation of Los Angeles Autobahn Railway signalling Gliding School bus Tractor Mitsubishi 3000GT Mario Bros. 2003 United States Grand Prix Mazda Miata Star Wars: Battlefront Road-rule enforcement camera 2001 Formula One season Dale Earnhardt
