why doesn't glue stick to the inside of the bottle if it's a solvent glue the solvent stops it from sticking when exposed to air the solvent evaporates leaving the glue itself to stick this is why solvent glue smells so much you can smell the evaporating solvent the solvent spreads away from the glue so it can stick in the bottle the solvent still evaporates but it can't go anywhere so the glue doesn't stick to the bottle as eventually it reaches an equilibrium so solvent particles leaving the glue and re entering the glue mixture as there's more and more air in the bottle however there will be less and less solvent in the bottle so glue will become more viscous over a long period of time in an empty bottle Solvent Adhesive Acetic acid Ammonia Concentration Perfume Ethyl acetate Water (molecule) Bong Dry cleaning Cyanoacrylate Opportunity rover Nuclear fallout Evaporation Polyethylene terephthalate Chloroform Chromatography Dimethylformamide Tetrachloroethylene Paint Coffee Vacuum Water Hydrogen peroxide Soluble Solution Reverse osmosis Printed circuit board Timeline of the Universe Viscosity Black hole Piccolo Junior Saga Brewery Benzene Navier-Stokes equations Colloid Water vapor Cross-country skiing Radio controlled airplane White phosphorus incendiary Air pollution Phase (matter) Distillation Micro-encapsulation Ocean thermal energy conversion Varnish Glacier Hawking radiation Laundry detergent Air conditioning Water resources Rain Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Clinker (boat building) Concrete Event horizon Diethyl ether Nail (anatomy) Weapon Tetrahydrofuran Lacquer Liquid crystal Mass spectrometry Ethanol Polychlorinated biphenyl Charles Goodyear Inhalant Dairy Instant coffee Petroleum The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Klein bottle Chemical equilibrium Multiple chemical sensitivity Action potential Aerosol spray Carburetor Tofu Dimethyl sulfoxide Stuck Together, Torn Apart Alcohol Incandescent light bulb Guitar Lightstick Homer Simpson Cocaine Alkane M__bius strip Hash oil Tissue engineering Alum Alcoholic beverage Floppy disk Honey Casting Solid solution Gilding
