why doesn't glue stick to the inside of the glue bottle okay i'm not disputing the fact that air makes glue dry and stick to stuff but even if you left the cap off the glue long enough for all the glue in the bottle to dry it still wouldn't stick to the bottle so i guess the real question is why doesn't glue stick to plastic because any time you put glue on plastic it doesn't really stick with very little effort the glue will come off the plastic so what's the property between plastic and glue that they don't stick to one another many glues don't stick to plastic but some do in general smooth materials like plastic especially teflon or metal are difficult to glue but porous materials like wood or paper or even fabric are easy to glue if you look at the surface of the paper with a magnifying glass you will see a lot of little bumps and dips the glue penetrates in there imagine what happens to the glue when it dries inside the pores it's acting like a bunch of little claws plastic surface is too smooth for a regular glue you need to use special glues that partially dissove the plastic and make it stick superglue works like this or epoxy resins Plastic Printed circuit board Casting Wood Pottery Adhesive Manifold Electrophysiology Boat building Bong Hamster Screw Radio controlled airplane Epoxy Laser engraving Screen-printing Violin Textile manufacturing Sheaf (mathematics) M__bius strip Seismic retrofit Hand grenade Strap-on dildo Floppy disk Chopsticks Cookware and bakeware Polyethylene terephthalate Knife Stucco Cyanoacrylate Ice core Leather Drill bit Upholstery Guitar Model aircraft Ceramics Graphite-reinforced plastic Smoking pipe Fiberglass Deck (ship) Welding Internal ballistics Mouse (computing) Brush Reinforced concrete Printmaking Theory of conduct Homebuilt aircraft Cello Turquoise Billiards Corrosion Table tennis Cross-country skiing Ammonia Teflon Concrete Bicycle frame Weapon Fire extinguisher Stereoscopy Baby bottle Time Out of Mind Volleyball Textile manufacturing terminology Sandpaper Bottle Friction Roller hockey Building material Faster-than-light Recycling Waste management Cardboard Aerial (dance move) Carnivorous plant Tire Bullet Mattress Magnet Slide rule Etching Little Britain Amateur telescope making Polymethyl methacrylate Campfire Jute Explosive material Clinker (boat building) Timpani Carbon fiber Sol gel Organic peroxide Soldering
