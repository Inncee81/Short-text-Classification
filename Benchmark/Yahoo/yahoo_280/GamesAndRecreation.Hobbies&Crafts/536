how can i make find cubes of crushable white foam this is an odd query but i'll try to explain where it's coming from i am looking for a way to create a material or find retail kinda like styrofoam but crushable like a dried mud ball weird huh if anyone is a star trek fan and remembers the episode with the kelvens who turned people into crystalline cubes actually cubes with their corners hacked off that's what i'm trying to re create they were white seem to have started as cubes and looked rather like sponges but they crumbled when you squeezed so that's it quite a challenge i think but you just never know who's got the knowledge you need thanks all i can hardly wait to give your idea a try artistpw thanks and i'll post here how it turns out hi i remembered them too i was able to get a little video of this episode by going over to www startrek com and doing a search on 'kelvan' and from there it let me see a little video of that episode that showed those cubes the material sort of looks like pumice stones that are used to remove calluses but those are too hard to crush in your hand you would just need to find the material to make the items from you might be able to do this perlite looks a lot like styrofoam granules but it is a rock product that has a lot of uses and you can get it from garden centers you could probably mix some perlite up in a medium like a flour and water paste like that which might be used for paper mache you would probably want to cook the paste to make it thicker and then mix the perlite in i'm thinking of a thick paste sort of like the flour mixture made for cream puff type pastries but without the sugar eggs or fat after heating you could probably mix in a drop or two of campho phenique for its preservative properities i've used this for making pastel sticks and it works well to prevent mold from forming on a gum tragacanth solution but it can't take heating i don't know how permanent you might want to make these but i think as long as you dry this out well you would run into any problems with moldering and the items might be able to be crushed in your hand you might be able to dry items made with this concoction in a slow oven at about deg f i'd probably experiment with this mixture before going to the trouble of making a mold once you have your compound to mold you could sculpt a cube like this using a clay like plastlina and get a mold making compound check out the compleat sculptor website for a lot of supplies to make molds and if you check out the wetcanvas website the sculpture channel has at least one step by step article that has directions for making a mold from a d object wetcanvas is a wonderful online artist community and basic membership there is free there are currently more than worldwide members you can browse the site as a guest if you want too hope this helps and at least gives you some ideas email me if you want and i can try to help more i like trying to figure stuff out like this Casting Brewery Plastic Polystyrene Bread Pottery Coffee Tofu Plaster Hydroponics Flour Glass Ice cream Opportunity rover Cookware and bakeware Japanese cuisine Sugar Houseplant Strap-on dildo Sand casting Origin of life Thermal power station Cuisine of Denmark Cheese Soap Polymer clay Japanese tea ceremony Fire extinguisher RuneScape quests Pancake Bulk vending "Weird Al" Yankovic Carbon dioxide Tea Cuisine of the Philippines Sculpture Dairy Star Trek Customizable Card Game Explosive material Pastel Puff pastry Enzyme Callus Textile manufacturing Iron Wood Jewish cuisine Drawing Idli Sun Food preservation Woodworking Fecal incontinence Legal research Origin belief Soldering Microwave oven Vermicompost Citric acid Hamster Charles Goodyear Paint Psoriasis Ice Gas metal arc welding Sugarcane Dumpling Soy protein Jet engine Chocolate Diatomaceous earth Theory of conduct Nutrition Renewable energy Bengali cuisine Drill bit Kosher foods Water (molecule) USB flash drive Motorcycle Fire fighting Sushi Google Pasta Extreme Programming Code: Lyoko Cuisine of Brazil Cake Sudoku Characters in the Smurfs Bong Homestar Runner Little Britain Diablo II
