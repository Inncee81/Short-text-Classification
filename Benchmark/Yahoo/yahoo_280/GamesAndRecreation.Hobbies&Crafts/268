buy great knives online anyone know how to get an online business off to a good start my parents started theknivery com which sells all sorts of knives but they don't know how to get any business anyone got some ideas it's appreciated there are three suggestions i would make first of all i would encourage your parents to make their site more than just an online catalog what i mean is they need to add some content to their site lots of content they should add information that people are searching for like the history behind certain styles of knives swords etc pages about uses for particular knives how knives were are made etc that is just a few suggestions with brainstorming i'm sure they can come up with more the reason they should do this is because websites are ranked higher by the search engines if they are content sites if they provide information for web surfers who will then find their site when searching for that information here's a free ebook that you can download to help you understand the concept better it is called make your site sell http myss sitesell com angie html secondly they need targeted traffic that means visitors who are actually looking for knives not just people paid to read emails or click on ads to understand the importance of targetted traffic and how to get it http traffic sitesell com angie html lastly they need to look for places they can build incoming links to their site like forums you can type in knives forums and look for places where people are discussing knives or swords or whatever is relevant to the site that way you can join in the discussion and put their website address in their signature as a link some people may check it out just because they are interested but the main benefit is that you gain more relevance in the search engines with more incoming links to your site i hope this helps if you have more questions about what i mentioned feel free to contact me through my profile best of luck Search engine optimization Web traffic World Wide Web Google search Website Spyware Internet fraud BitTorrent Gmail Cross site scripting Spamdexing E-mail spam Uniform Resource Locator Google Open access Spam (electronic) Neopets HTML Legal research Opera (web browser) HyperText Transfer Protocol Fark.com Advertising Online marketing Blog Ajax (programming) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act RuneScape cheats Stopping e-mail abuse PHP PageRank The Standard Representational State Transfer Web crawler Internet Web page LiveJournal Web design Open Directory Project Computer virus Search engine XML Phishing Mozilla Firefox Amazon.com Mozilla Application Suite Wireless Application Protocol Deep web Comparison of web browsers Denial-of-service attack Thumbnail gallery post The Internet Movie Database Wiki Internet censorship in mainland China Web hosting Science Knife E-mail Electronic commerce America Online Dictionary HyperCard Cyberspace Wget Internet privacy Pretty Good Privacy Link spam Anonymity History of the Internet Advance fee fraud Internet troll Arianne Aikido H2G2 Education HTML element Software agent Webcomic Web analytics SAML RuneScape Anonymous remailer Gross domestic product Social software Cloaking Hyperlink Martial art Orkut Proxy server Domain Name System Common Unix Printing System
