which wool is good for sensitive skin i would like to knit myself a jumper but i find wool itchy next to bare skin as i live in a rural location i would need to buy it online can anyone recommend a really soft wool suitable for adults not baby pink can you also recommend a good website for sensitive skin and people with wool allergies the best natural fibers are alpaca llama and cashmere people who are allergic to wool generally are reacting to the lanolin in the wool alpaca does not contain lanolin and is generally hypoallergenic and it's cheaper than cashmere baby alpaca is even softer my favorite alpaca is a label called prime alpaca naturally colored undyed and peruvian tweed color twisted yarn from undyed naturally colored alpaca alpaca is revered in the high andes previously in peru alpaca fibers were only worn by royalty llama is similar to alpaca but it's not as widely available cashmere comes from the cashmere goat the cheapest cashmere yarns are imported and produced in china and inner mongolia one of the leading market producers of cashmere is italy which has quality cashmere yarns but the prices are a little higher other great alternatives if you're not allergic to wool are merino wool and merino wool blends one of my favorite yarns that i get from a supplier is a cashmere and merino wool blend other great soft blended yarns that i like are merino silk merino silk mercized or pima cotton and pima cotton silk pima and mercized cottons are very soft and a nice alternative for people who have sensitivities to wool and mohair silk is awesome but it can get pricey so the cheaper and more common option is to find a silk blend yarn i don't recommend mohair for sensitive skin even though both cashmere and mohair come from goats it seems that more people are sensitive and allergic to mohair if you do like mohair and are not allergic to it then make sure the you get kid mohair which is much much softer regular mohair can be coarse itchy and scratchy i don't know where you are but these us based sites are great because the prices are low and or they're for people who want to buy in bulk like for a sweater project http www discountyarnsale com great bulk prices http www knitpicks com they have their own line of yarns http www elann com http www smileysyarns com outlet of yarns basically Yarn Domestic goat Knitting Textile Goat Mattress Spinning (textiles) Jute Llama Carding Allergy Economy of Mongolia Weaving Plastic Undergarment Upholstery Linen Peanut Cotton Tattoo Agriculture Peruvian cuisine Agriculture in Australia Livestock Hay fever Dye Wine Tariff Lama (genus) Hydrogen economy Eczema Stocking Fecal incontinence Biodiesel Inca Empire Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Petroleum Supply and demand Milk Lanolin World Wide Web Uranium Bulk vending Carpet Domestic sheep Bolivia Gobi Desert Economy of Bolivia Aran Islands Guinea pig Saxophone Indigo dye Pisco Industrial Revolution Gasoline Black tie Cloth Drill bit Alcohol fuel Leather Potato Flour Cat Airsoft Clothing Coeliac disease Nylon Rock (music) Dietary fiber Sling (weapon) Gramophone record Billiards Tofu Light-emitting diode IPod Free trade Motion picture rating system Electronic commerce ATI Technologies Volleyball Economy of Peru Coffee Uniform Resource Locator
