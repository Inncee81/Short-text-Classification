crochet help please hi this is confusing me sc in next ch sp sc in next sts so does this mean single crochets in one stitch skip spaces and the single crochets in the next stitches i am so confused and it doesn't look right i believe it means that you do single crochets in the space created by chain stitches done perhaps in the previous round and then do a single crochet in each of the next stitches whatever stitches they are as you didn't indicate them it's hard to explain further or fully without seeing the previous instructions relevant to this hope this makes sense and helps you out goodluck Crochet Knitting Textile manufacturing Textile manufacturing terminology Tatting Lace-making Knot Bookbinding PDP-11 Stitch (Lilo & Stitch) Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch Poker jargon Lilo & Stitch Bubble Bobble The Kinks File Allocation Table President (game) Point groups in three dimensions PDP-8 Gemini 9A Information warfare Textile Have I Got News For You Carpet Quotation mark Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Theodicy Jaynestown Page table Separation axiom Redundant array of independent disks Yarn Exponentiation Shaggy dog story CPU cache Cross-stitch Knitting needle Kim Possible The Star Wars Holiday Special God Emperor of Dune Compiler optimization Filet lace X86 assembly language ALGOL 68 Haven (TNG episode) Scientology beliefs and practices Only Fools and Horses Model-view-controller Non-native pronunciations of English Jean-Luc Picard Legacy of Kain Grammatical aspect Volkswagen Golf M-theory Fictional crossover Blink-182 Xenomorph Whitney Houston Croke Park Ra (board game) Extreme Programming Data General Nova Unidentified flying object Texas hold 'em Many-worlds interpretation Placeholder name Terminal ballistics Manifold Melt-Banana Lilo & Stitch: The Series Path integral formulation Star Wars: Galaxies PostScript Remix RISC Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Subroutine Procrastination Green Lantern Piccolo Junior Saga Citizens' band radio Space Quest Charles Goodyear Dynamical system Second language acquisition The Warriors Philosophical Investigations Causality Dominoes Knuckleball Sewing Shadow the Hedgehog The Sims 2 Apollo Guidance Computer Euro Out-of-body experience Vector processor Playoff
