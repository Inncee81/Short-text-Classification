question about scrubs the uniform kind if you could buy scrubs cheaper would you first of all i am not sure if this is the right place to ask this question or not but any way here it goes if you could buy your scrubs cheaper than you do now would you i mean they are not name brand scrubs or anything like that they would be home made the color that you want and so on and so forth you could even pick out the material that you wanted your scrub made with all i want to know is if they were cheaper and was made good would you buy them the reason i am asking this is because i am thinking very seriously about making scrubs to sell i was looking in stores a couple of days ago for scrubs for a new job that i am going to get i was very shocked as to how much they are i got to figuring it up and realized that i could make them in most cases a lot cheaper than the stores sell them does any one think this would be a good ideal no i am not advertising either just wondering if it would work or not if it is worth trying or not scrubs made in manufacturing plants are not reproducible at home in your house for anywhere the same price or the same quality they get price breaks on huge amounts of material and many are made overseas where the labor cost is very low you would be losing money because you could not recoup the amount of time you pile into them however there might be a market for custom sized scrubs i know lots of people can't find them small enough or big enough or maybe they don't wear the same side top and bottom tx mom Microeconomics Supply and demand Illegal drug trade Tesco The Apprentice 2 Mutual fund Gross domestic product Wal-Mart Inflation Digital photography Atari ST Sweatshop Solar cell Ford Motor Company Tariff Bulk vending Internet fraud Arbitrage UK Singles Chart CPU design RuneScape economy Nintendo Computer Commodity Price discrimination Hyperinflation Labour economics Lionel Corporation Mortgage Alcohol fuel Filling station Loss leader Citigroup TLC Labor theory of value Dairy Hydrogen economy Berkshire Hathaway Economic growth Diamond Plastic Rail tracks My Little Pony Hard disk Poker jargon Day trading Offshoring Tax Prices of production Deflation (economics) Outsourcing Gramophone record Grid energy storage Sears Holdings Corporation Gold as an investment Publicly funded medicine Video game crash of 1983 Paintball Iron Philatelic investment Overclocking Bong Rational pricing Capitalism Health insurance Compact audio cassette Solar power Cable television Slide rule Airline FairTax Coffee ATI Technologies $ale of the Century Surplus product Inventory IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family Apple Computer Economics IPod Capital accumulation Floppy disk Make money fast Sento Bretton Woods system Growth theory Extreme Programming Binoculars American individualist anarchism Best Buy Trading Places
