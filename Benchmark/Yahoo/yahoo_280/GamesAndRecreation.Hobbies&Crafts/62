how do you sew a collar on a shirt using interfacing fabric i'm not sure if that is the right term but i m sewing a shirt that has an interfacing piece to attach the pattern is very unclear does anyone know about this thanks i just can't figure out the pattern should i just adjust it okay so i m pretty much an idiot i thought that the interface pattern was the whole thing not half of it if i cut it on folded fabric it produces a longer collar does that sound like the correct way lol that's kinda funny usually you cut the piece of interfacing the same size as the collar and just stitch it to the wrong side of the material of the collar then just sew the collar as normal the interfacing helps to stiffen up the collar and keep it in place Textile manufacturing terminology Shirt Sewing Sewing machine Undergarment Knitting Mattress Floppy disk Kimono Bookbinding Skirt and dress Clothing Chemise Applique Upholstery Cross-stitch Casting Kilt Textile manufacturing Collar Suit (clothes) Academic dress of Oxford University IBM PC compatible Black tie Necktie Canadian Armed Forces Manual transmission Stocking Quilting Rigging Order of the Garter Blood on the Tracks Mars Exploration Rover United States Marine Corps Dress shirt Pattern (sewing) Carpet Equine conformation Tincture (heraldry) Beavis and Butt-head Climbing equipment Chainmail Comanche Kayak Starfleet ranks and insignia Glossary of nautical terms Clothing terminology Metalworking Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Reconfigurable computing Tennis shirt Embroidery Plastic Knife Tatting Shit Drill bit Salwar kameez TRS-80 Aloha shirt Antenna (radio) Earring Ironing Sea Scouts (BSA) Heavy metal fashion Basic English Trailer Park Boys Baseball cap Sniper MAD Magazine Numerology Dog agility Bonus Stage Diamond cut Negima Wrench STS-61 Clerical clothing Penis Clavicle Hat Suture Swimsuit Sternum Autopsy Horse tack Windows XP Binoculars Jack plug Bow tie Dog training Doctor (Doctor Who) Sword making Lace-making Glossary of climbing terms Dog Desk Blue-collar worker Katana Dog collar
