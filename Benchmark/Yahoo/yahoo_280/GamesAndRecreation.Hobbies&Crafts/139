journal scrapbook ideas i have a blank journal with no lines and i need an idea of what to do with it it's about inches long so it's not that big i was thinking of writing a story in it but i want some more ideas i was also going to put cut outs of magazines in it but there aren't good cutouts of magazines i get like us weekly are there any good ideas out there for my journal four inches is just not that big i am working on an x scrapbook right now and even that is limiting i usually work with x 's so as the most important part of scrapbooking is the journaling i would use a small picture of whatever it is you want to remember and then write down something about the picture so you won't forget and generations to come will know what your picture was about include dates and names in your journaling if there is room for more then add a few embellishments to spice up the page cover it with patterned paper or solid color card stock to match your photo have fun Scrapbooking Marathon (computer game) Gramophone record Extreme Programming Ira Gershwin Photography Comics British comic Stereoscopy Marching band Poker jargon 50 First Dates Floppy disk Plame affair Frank Herbert Scientific journal Fischer Random Chess Screenwriting Manga Patricia Ford Rubber stamp Dodge Charger Have I Got News For You Charles Dickens CPU cache Milton H.
