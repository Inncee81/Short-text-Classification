im going to be my mom wont let me use tampons im going to be sixteen and i play ice hockey so pads are the most uncomfortable thing to play with as if i didnt have enough pads on already my mom thinks that only women that lose there virginty should use them and because she doesnt like em she thinks i wont how do i get her to let me use them well sweetie this could be a really tough situation not tough as far as actually using tampons that part is pretty easy what may be tough is doing something that seems so clearly against your mother's wishes i don't know you or your mom or your religion beliefs so i'm kind of flying blind here it is clear that she cares for you and she may be concerned about how losing your virginity can change you emotionally and mentally as well as physically for every woman i have ever spoken to about this losing her virginity to a partner was painful and scary and was not at all what they had pictured their first time would be like tampon use on the other hand was generally not painful and scary for them and they had an instruction sheet to read beforehand some women consider losing your virginity to mean the first time they have intercourse penetration with a sexual partner human or vibrator therefore this would not mean that using tampons equals losing virginity but as i said before i don't know your family's religion or beliefs religion and beliefs are important foundations but can sometimes also be the shackles that bind us to obsolete ways please know that i am not judging you or your mom or your family's beliefs i do want to give you as much information as possible then you get to think for and choose for yourself also don't take my word for anything do your own research ask friends that you trust look up the facts be informed so with all that said here's what i want to share with you from the physical physiological standpoint some young women have a hymen the hymen is a thin membrane that covers the vaginal opening however not all women have or ever had a hymen it has been mistakenly thought for many many years that if the hymen is intact the woman is a virgin however very often as a young woman gets older the hymen recedes on its own it can also be torn by physical activity so having a hymen or not having one is truly not a reliable indicator of virginity in centuries past young women were inspected before marriage by female family members and often the groom's mother too can you imagine to make sure the hymen was intact thereby ensuring that the family's investment in the young woman was a good idea imagine if that young woman happened to never have had a hymen what a scene keep in mind that in that age women were usually married before the age of because people often did not live past the age of and women had to bear families quickly it's unfortunate that many people religions etc today still place so high a value on a woman's virginity when it is an ancient standard for the business arrangement marriages were that no longer applies there is also a practical side to your question that is undeniable pads are bulky sticky i hate when the adhesive gets stuck to my hair ouch and sometimes messy i discovered tampons when i was i was miserable because i badly wanted to go swimming but was on my period my girlfriend suggested tampons and i truthfully didn't ask my mom i just tried it because there was a box in the cupboard mom and i never really talked about such things there were instructions in the box and i felt desperate i clearly made the choice on my own to try them and i've used tampons ever since and never regretted it for you though i recommend a different approach here's what i suggest but please trust your instincts and do what you think is right do online research about tampons and the consequences of using them read all the warnings do not be offhand about inserting something into your body if you are religious look for sites that include information and opinions from a trusted source in your religion e g a reputable church community leader or discussion group maybe do your research at a friend's house so your mom doesn't catch you trying to inform yourself and get all twisted up about it your call on that armed with information sit down with your mom and tell her what you want to do and why let her know that you are thinking of it strictly in terms of hygiene and practicality be gentle with her imagine if you had a daughter talking to you about this she may be afraid that you'll suddenly be wanting and or having indiscriminate sex because you want to use tampons by the way tampons are nowhere near the size of an erect penis unless that penis is very very small also be mature about it don't throw a fit if she doesn't agree to your wishes just say that you need time to think about what she said and go do something else you can then choose whether to talk to her again or make a different choice perhaps you then talk with a trusted adult friend instead ultimately what you do with your body and the choices you make are solely up to you but for now the rules are hers since you are a minor and you are living under her roof you also owe her respect for years of providing for you and raising you the best she knows how if you do make the leap to using tampons give yourself plenty of time to practice you may need to try more than once before the tampon feels comfortable you will need to be patient with yourself especially if this is the first kind of exploration you've done 'down there' i highly recommend you read the instructions that are usually included in the box i'm totally serious the instructions are quite helpful and also very informative also for a beginning tampon user i'd recommend regular or slender sizes do not try supers to start you may also need to wear a panty liner very thin pad as backup especially since you'll be playing a very active sport so there may be some leakage tampons should never ever plug the vagina that can be very uncomfortable and may also increase the risk of toxic shock syndrome again read the instruction sheet to learn more i hope this was helpful on as
