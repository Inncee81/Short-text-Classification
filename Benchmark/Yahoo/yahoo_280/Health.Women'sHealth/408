strange periods after coming off pill brown discharge hi sorry to go into detail but after stopping the pill a few months ago i have had regular day cycles which is great seeing as i'd been on the pill years however my 'period' only lasts about days and there is no blood only a light brown discharge and it's so light i don't even need to wear a pad tampon is this normal i expected the first one to be unusual but not cycles in when i had my pill breakthrough bleeding there would usually be blood thanks for your help thanks for your replies i was on cilest i have no cramping or pms symptoms just this brown discharge ok well a few more details would be good for example what pill you were on however it isn't abnormal for periods to take up to a year to get back to normal after coming off the pill the brown discharge is most likely a very light period give it time and all will be back to normal however if you are worried please visit a gp to put your mind at ease Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Menstrual cup Endometriosis Sanitary towel Apollo 8 Urinary incontinence Sleep Symbiosis (TNG episode) Timeline of alternative rock Endometrial cancer Migraine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Treehouse of Horror V Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pregnancy Childbirth Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Inside Mid-Autumn Festival Multiple sclerosis Psoriasis Tampon Shaggy dog story Milton H.
