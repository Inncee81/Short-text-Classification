help i just got my period this morning and of my mates are coming to use my pool today i dont know how to use a tampon i've never needed to use one what can i do hey i can understand how nervous you must be tampons seem scary at first but after you try them they are nothing to fear first relax then by a package of playtex gentle glide unscented regular size tampons with the plastic applicators the smaller the tampon the better so use regular rather than super i think the plastic applicators are easier to insert and the unscented kind are better for your body next go into the bathroom and carefully read the directions before you give it a go the directions in the box will give you step by step instructions on what to do and will also have illustrations to let you know how to do it now the key is to relax if you are nervous you will have a hard time getting it inserted if it helps you can take deep breaths and on the last exhalation insert the tampon as you breath out if you follow the directions the tampon should feel comfortable while inside if you feel any discomfort the tampon is not inserted far enough and you should pull it out and try again with a new tampon i hope this helps i was terrified the first time i used one if you get really scared ask your mom or someone who has experience to talk you through it Menstrual cup Tampon Menstrual cycle Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Strap-on dildo Anxiety Floppy disk Urinary incontinence Condom Sewage treatment Kenny McCormick Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amazing Race Hamster RuneScape quests Shaggy dog story Drill bit Ron and Fez Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Aikido Sleep apnea Trumpet Milton H.
