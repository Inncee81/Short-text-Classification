is it true that u cant get pregnant when on ur period question can you get pregnant during your period answer yes it's possible but highly unlikely you'd have to have a very short menstrual cycle which is the time from the first day of one period to the first day of the next period or a tendency to have long periods this would bring the time of ovulation closer to the time when you would start bleeding conception occurs when an egg and sperm meet in a fallopian tube sometime during the middle of your menstrual cycle most likely between the th and th days an egg reaches maturity in one of the two ovaries the ovary releases the egg into the abdomen where it's quickly sucked up by the tulip shaped opening of the nearest fallopian tube an egg can survive in your fallopian tube for about hours after it's released from the ovary so the only way you can get pregnant is if sperm are present in your fallopian tube during this window of opportunity if the egg isn't fertilized it's shed along with your uterine lining during your period typically when you have your period another egg is developing in preparation for release during the current cycle but not every woman's cycle length is the same many women have a cycle that's about days long but some have cycles as short as days long if you have a shorter cycle you could ovulate just a few days after you have your period and considering that sperm can survive in your reproductive tract for up to three days it's theoretically possible for the sperm to hang around until you ovulate again it's also possible to mistake breakthrough bleeding spotting between your periods for a regular period so you may be bleeding right at the time of ovulation when you're most fertile the time that it takes for an egg to develop or mature within the ovary can vary and therefore the actual day of ovulation can vary by several to many days some ovulation kits also base the fertile time on rising estrogen levels rather than the peak of luteinizing hormone or lh which is the actual trigger for egg release in those situations the fertile time may seem to be longer Oral contraceptive Estrus cycle Endometriosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Fertilisation Sexual reproduction Emergency contraception Infertility Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Female reproductive system (human) Ectopic pregnancy Progesterone Ovarian cancer Endometrium Obstetrics Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ovarian cyst Pelvic inflammatory disease Birth control Gynecologic hemorrhage Sexual differentiation Intersexuality Flowering plant Fetal development Uterus Sterilization (surgical procedure) Breastfeeding Ovum Gynaecology Amenorrhoea Carpel Testicle Androgen Human chorionic gonadotropin Gonorrhoea Grasshopper Pachypodium brevicaule Endometrial cancer Swyer syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual intercourse Spider Premature birth Twin Niddah Krill Pachypodium bicolor Pachypodium baronii Childbirth Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Embryo transfer Vaginal bleeding Man Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Tsetse fly Cryptorchidism Urinary incontinence Anovulation Dead zone Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Estradiol Morphology of Pachypodium Fruit Prostate cancer Conifer cones Menstrual cup Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Sex organ Xenomorph Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Menopause Octopus Tide Earthworm Human sexuality Testosterone Flower Sex Rabbit Antarctic krill Tampon Hair Sperm Whale Species
