whats the big deal with anal sex just curious i mean what is it about it the taboo feeling of it all does it really feel all that wonderful only serious answers please i mean is it for the mans pleasure or does the women feel pleasure with this too i just can't see it i've met some women a hand full not a lot that do enjoy anal sex more than vaginal sex other women like it but as an occasional practice instead of the norm the anus is rich with thousands of nerves i read in a book written by proctologist that said that about half the nerves in the pelvic region end at the anal area if these nerves are stimulated properly they can produce extreme pleasure on the other hand if stimulated wrong they can cause extreme pain generally the pain is caused by anal tension during sex i think that the women who enjoy it are women that knew themselves what they were doing or tried it the first few times with someone that knew what he was doing anal sex is not something that you can just jump into like they make it appear in porn movies at least not at the beginning i've tried it with most of my ex girlfriends and all have liked it a lot but again it takes patience and know how at the beginning once she get used to it this start happening much faster and it s not because she s getting loose back there like some ignorant people think what really happens is that the anal sphincter muscles the muscle at the opening of the anus are part voluntary and part involuntary muscles which means that we have some control over them but not complete control in fact we have very little control over them the sphincter muscles are control but the ans autonomic nervous system the same part of the nervous system that controls breathing and other auto functions of the body if you tried to go too fast and these muscles have not relaxed enough on their own you will experience pain the more the guy forces himself into you the more pain you will experience which only compounds the problem when you experience pain it s only natural that these muscles are going to tense up instead or relaxing causing more pain that s why women who have had failed anal sex attempts have to be even more patient at learning to relax done right the anal sphincter learns to relax making anal sex pleasurable for both involved whether is a man woman or man man combination once those muscles have learned that anal sex is pleasurable they start to relax very fast with a bit of experience you ll have the guy inside you in very little time i ve been with some girls that can insert a penis in themselves in as little as one a minute or less i m estimating here based on experience and these are girls that are not loose from back there girls that unlike the myth says they don t poop in their pants even when they had an upset stomach and diarrhea anal sex can be very pleasurable for the receiver physically it s a fact that there are women who can experience an orgasm during anal sex and they claim to feel different than vaginal orgasms and some even claim that they like it more but there are some psychological factors to consider as well some people find it exciting because they are doing something dirty and taboo some women have told me that they also get pleasure from knowing that they are pleasing their partner men enjoy anal sex because the anus is tighter than the vagina in addition some men enjoy being penetrated themselves by their partner and i'm not talking about gay men i'm talking about straight men the men's g spot the prostate is located within a few inches from the anal opening when the prostate is massaged right by the use of fingers a penis dildo vibrator etc it can feel very good and even induce orgasms this is why men find having their anus stimulated so pleasurable as well many men report that prostrate stimulation during a oral sex can give them the most intense orgasms sometimes leading to further anal experimentation in many cases this experimentation will culminate with full on penetration by their female partner i read the results of a survey that was done about years ago by good vibes of their customers which showed that about to of strap ons are purchased be heterosexual couples to be used by the female on their male partners since then i ve read another two more recent surveys by other researchers that show similar findings for what i understand that type of practice is on the rise at least that's what some experts are saying i think that it's a combination of factors more couples are experimenting with that type of activity but i think that more couples are being open about it as well like a female friend of mine told me many years ago if it feel good for us women why wouldn t it feel f good for guys back there we are pretty much the same the key to anal please is education and an open mind if you don t have an open mind it s not going to happen to you if you into it doing it for someone else rather than for yourself you are not going to enjoy it you need to see anal sex and anal play with a very open mind and have the desire to explore with it forget about anal sex to start with just explore with anal play using lubed fingers and other smaller objects to explore yourself good lubrication is critical none of the k y junk buy some latex gloves some good lub and experiment with your finger s doing it while masturbating may and generally does increase sexual excitement the key word here is exploration don t try anal sex with a partner off the bat chances are that you ll fail one more thing do educate yourself don t listen to most people here who are very ignorant that way you ll be able to make an educated decision for example some people here have said in other similar questions that anal sex is dirty and that there are feces in the rectum and so on the truth is that feces are not stored in the rectum they are stored in the sigmoid colon once you feel the urge to go to the bathroom the feces pass from the sigmoid colon through the rectum and out the anal opening if you experience any feces in the rectum during anal play it may mean that your diet is not high enough in fiber and you have soft stool it can also mean that you developed bad bowel movement habits like straining too much while at the toilet good luck Human Japanese toilet Out-of-body experience Toilet humour Weight
