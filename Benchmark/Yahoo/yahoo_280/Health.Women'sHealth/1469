my period is something wrong ok so last month i started like normal i dont keep track though cause they are kinda irregular right now idk why but my blood was really really thin and it was very heavy i wasnt doing anything athletic but after i got out of the shower in the morning it was so bad sometimes that i would put a regular tampon in cause thats the biggest i can fit in there and ten minutes lator i had to change my undies and put a new one in really i saw what time it was when i put it in i was very bloaty and its been a long time and i still ahvent lost some of the bloat i felt so crappy i didnt want to get out of bed but my step dad made me go places with him i was the biggest bitch for a long time i was so hormonal now after i stopped my discharge is diff and its pretty heavy too it also smells diff not a strong smell just diff i dont know whats going on and ive been acting kinda different lately i havent worn anything but sweats for the last few weeks which isnt too much like me i also havent been sleeping very well i also kinda get this dull headache sometimes whats wrong oh also im twelve but ive had my period since i was ten also twards the end of it it would stop for a couple hours then start again p s this sucks my moms not very open about this stuff and i dont have an obgyn and she doesnt take me to the doctor too often anyway so one of those wouldnt do much if i can never see them but it is totally different than it usually is well ive told her but she said we should go to the doctor but she never takes me and if i say something again she gets mad thanx anyway try using a thick pad instead of tampons tampons if left in too long can cause serious problems if the change is significant since you first got your period at i would see a doctor if thick pads and midol still don't keep it from disturbing your daily life definitely see a doctor i know it's hard to talk to your mom about this stuff i got my period at like and i didn't even tell my mom so i didn't even have pads or anything i would just go to the bathroom every minutes when i was on my period lol finally she found some bloody laundry and found out talk to your mom it's embarassing but it happens to her too so she'll understand and i think she will definitely be concerned about your health and take you to a doctor if it really is serious Menstrual cup Sanitary towel Tampon Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Avenue Q The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Ben Johnson (athlete) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Blood on the Tracks Social rule Teen Girl Squad Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Mattress Chronic fatigue syndrome Recurring South Park characters Oasis (band) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Migraine The Amazing Race Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Grandview, U.S.A.
