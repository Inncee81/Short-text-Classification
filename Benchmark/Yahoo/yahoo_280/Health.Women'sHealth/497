is a hevy period normole i am yes especially at first as a teenager you need to get into a pattern where you do the same thing month after month you're not there yet so try and be patient it will come soon enough i was heavy and it made me continue to menstruate long after i should have stopped try some orange juice or a sports drink and see if it doesn't just plug you up and make you stop next month wait until after days before trying this and see if it doesn't get you to slow down the heavy flow can flush out sodium until you develop an imbalance but if your heavy and you start getting a lot of sodium before it's done you can cramp and bloat you don't need any more of that so pay attention to what you're doing write down the day you start and the day you stop every month make notes if you have to of all the things you do that make it better or make it worse drinking too much coke when just starting can be awful so if you did it and it made you heavier you know not to do that next time it'll be ok next time you'll do better with each time you'll learn more about yourself and it will be easier hang in there Menstrual cycle Action potential Fecal incontinence Intravenous therapy Conker's Bad Fur Day Niddah Shaggy dog story Indianapolis 500 Social rule Endometriosis Paget's disease of bone Piccolo Junior Saga Membrane potential 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Menstrual cup Equine conformation Alcoholics Anonymous Premenstrual stress syndrome Norway national football team Fanta Charles Darwin's illness Time Out of Mind Stuttering Hydrogen economy Theory of conduct Dietary fiber Milton H.
