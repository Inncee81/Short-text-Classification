help could i be pregnant i am on the nuvaring birth control i have been on it about a year it is a ring that you leave in for three weeks then take it out for a week to have your period then you put a new ring in i always take my ring out on a sunday and i use to start my period by that tuesday after a while my period didn't start coming until wed now it is not coming until thursday is this normal i have to put my new ring in the following sunday and now that my period is not coming until thursday i am still on my period a little when i put my new ring in also is it ok to have sex with my husband while my ring is out is their a chance of pregnancy between the time when my ring is out and my period starts sunday to thursday we normally always use a condom during this time but last month we didnt wear a condom between the time i took my ring out and my period started this month i am waiting on my period and the last three days i have been very nauseated could i be pregnant note we had sex last month before my period started while my ring was out but i did have a period and we have not had any unprotected sex since then well technically you did mix the recipe for a baby so you could be the chances of it are not all that high though the failure rate is up there with the regular bcp if you use it as directed what you are likely seeing is the accumulated effect of the hormones one effect of the hormones is a lighter flow each month and not building up quite as heavy a lining in the uterus so over the months it's not unusual to see the monthly period get lighter you are not likely to get pregnant during the time the ring is out because it's been supressing ovulation for the previous three weeks the drop in hormone level is what triggers the period to begin not ovulation to happen you really don't need to be using a condom during that time unless you are not sure of your partner or need to have protection against some type of std the quickest way to ease your mind is just to go buy a pregnancy test and use it it will more than likely be negative but then you will have an answer in hand if you are really concerned just make an appointment to see your gynecologist for a professional opinion it may be the hormones are a bit much for your system which would cause the delay in cycle and possibly the nausea and it could be the nausea is just you reacting in fear to the possibility of motherhood minds and fears can have a strong influence on the stomach and it wouldn't be the first time it happened that way Fertility awareness Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Condom Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Birth control Puberty Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Breastfeeding Sexual abstinence In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Safe sex Endometriosis Abortion EastEnders Pelvic inflammatory disease Childbirth Abortion debate Sex education Oral sex Infertility Intrauterine device Ovarian cancer Ovulation Miscarriage Knots Landing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Twin Estrus cycle AIDS Gregorian calendar Progesterone Morning sickness Prenatal diagnosis Prolactinoma Human chorionic gonadotropin Herpes simplex virus Pregnancy test Liturgical year Turner syndrome Anal sex National Football League Tocopherol Psoriasis Sexual intercourse Human penis size Sex assignment Diabetes mellitus Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Pornographic movie Stuttering Sexual reproduction Chemotherapy Stomach cancer Hebrew calendar Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Chemical abortion Acne Social rule Growth hormone treatment Monday Night Football Niddah Traumatic brain injury Gynaecology Postpartum depression Ocean's Twelve 2005 NBA Finals Estradiol Insulin Biology and sexual orientation Hypoglycemia Marilyn Monroe Computus Human sexual behavior Cryptorchidism Endocrinology Teenage pregnancy Traffic light Growth hormone deficiency Slow Train Coming Paracetamol Elephant Transsexuality Hypertension Autism Big Brother UK series 6
