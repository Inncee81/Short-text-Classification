how long does the depo shot birth control last in the body i have taken the depo shot for several years i have decided to stop taking them now that i am married and just let nature take its course how long does the drug stay in ones body can i get pregnant immediately or will it take several months to be able to become so if you have an answer please cite your source please thanks in advance three months because you get the shot every months but hold on this is what it says on the site if you decide to become pregnant the first step is to stop receiving doses after the effect of the last dose of depo provera had diminished of women got pregnant at some point within a year this number is similar for women who did not use any form of birth control eighty five percent of women who did not use birth control conceived within a year so when you stop using depo provera you will return to your underlying level of fertility but if your goal is to become pregnant within the next year depo provera is not recommended being able to get pregnant after using depo provera has nothing to do with how many shots you've had whether you've had dose or it's the same for some women it takes more time and for other women it happens faster good luck Depo Provera Birth control Folic acid Fertility awareness Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tocopherol Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Doxepin Spina bifida Bipolar disorder Emergency contraception Abortion debate Malaria Glucocorticoid Endometriosis Nuclear fallout Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guinea pig Ice hockey Ionizing radiation Chlorpromazine Isotretinoin Infertility Prolactinoma Obstetrics Paroxetine Chemical abortion Growth hormone treatment Drug abuse Amiodarone Herpes simplex virus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Friends Cytomegalovirus Omega-3 fatty acid Premature birth Antiretroviral drug Cancer Water polo LSD Heir Apparent Health issues and the effects of cannabis Sulfasalazine Golf Lucille Ball Acne COX-2 inhibitor Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Baldness treatments Maprotiline Antipsychotic Breastfeeding Cyanide Knots Landing Gonorrhoea Radiation therapy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder One Tree Hill (TV series) Vitamin C Lung cancer Estrogen Androgen insensitivity syndrome Nicotine Abortion Sexual intercourse In vitro fertilisation Four square Sharon Tate Thimerosal Grand Theft Auto (game) Caffeine Coffee Diazepam Mystique (comics) Childbirth Paracetamol Haloperidol Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Incarnations of Immortality Football (soccer) Overpopulation Dioxin Cannabis (drug) DDT Table tennis Reservoir Dogs Kodocha Alternative medicine Dietary fiber Weight training Expert system
