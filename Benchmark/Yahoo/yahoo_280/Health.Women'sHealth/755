how does one insert a tampon there are instructions that come in the box basically with any tampon that comes with an applicator are three main parts i son't know what they're called but i'll label them the tampon the cover and the plunger there is the cover for the tampon itself and the plunger that pushes the tampon out of the cover you want to hold the tampon at the base of the cover with your thumb and middle finger and insert it into your vagina following your natural curve you'll know it using a slight twisting motion when you feel like it's in a comfortable spot you shouldn't feel it use your index finger to push on the plunger it will push the tampon out of the cover and put it in place then pull out the cover it's easier if you do this for the first time on a day when your flow is a bit heavier that's pretty much it there are also diagrams in the instructions Tampon Sanitary towel Condom Strap-on dildo Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Gesture CPU cache Chopsticks M4 Carbine Menstrual cycle Clarinet Finger Fast bowling Floppy disk Professional wrestling holds Internal ballistics Pinball Hand M16 (rifle) Bleeding Textile manufacturing Toxic shock syndrome Trumpet Stereoscopy Public-key cryptography Kenny McCormick Eye Control flow Milton H.
