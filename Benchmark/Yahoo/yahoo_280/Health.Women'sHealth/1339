whats wrong with this picture ok i'm years old i had my period over months ago that was the same time that i started my period i've gain wieght during that time any doctors out there it's normal when your first start to get your period that it comes irregularly so don't worry it is perfectly normal if you feel like something is wrong you should mention it to your mother and ask questions it will take your body some time to get regulated i could be that you have been stressed gained or lost a lot of weight traveled alot many things tie into late periods but i'm thinking it's mostly because you just started if you have a family doctor you can call them and ask questions you don't have to tell them your name if you don't want to just explain to them the same thing you just told us and they will be happy to help you in the mean time don't worry everything is going to be alright Social rule Theory of conduct Philosophy of language Shaggy dog story The Long Game Kodocha Yoko Ono Milton H.
