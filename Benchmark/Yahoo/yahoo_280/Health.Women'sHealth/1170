period is longer than usual after endoscopy i had an endoscopy done about a week ago i found out i have an ulcer i got my period tuesday and its now friday and i still have it i always get my period on a wednesday and its over by thursday night thanks to my birth control im going on vacation next week and i dont want to have my period then is this normal i think it might just be that you were stressed by the findings of the endoscopy also if the doctors have given you medicines for your ulcer this might be interacting with your bcps and causing your period to be a bit longer than you're used to either way i would venture to guess that your period will most likely stop within the first or days of your active pills so just bring some protection with you just in case and have fun on your trip there are worse things in the world than a period on your vacation believe me Coeliac disease Helicobacter pylori Peptic ulcer Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Ulcerative colitis Psoriasis Mouth ulcer Tuesday Urinary incontinence Wednesday Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Liturgical year Good Friday Thursday Hurricane Katrina timeline Lent Stomach cancer Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Holiday Holy Week Menstrual cycle EastEnders Lynbrook High School Gregorian calendar Calculating the day of the week WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
