bleeding during sex i had sex fr the first time a year ago the guy fingered me and i think had a jagged nail we had sex three time three different nights and i bled every time i can understand bleeding the first time i had sex due to breaking the hymen etc but is it normal to bleed on the nd and rd time would a jagged nail cause this to happen for nights on a row or do some people just bleed a few more times even after the first time i'm worried to have sex with a new partner in case i bleed again and just feel it would be a bit disgusting for this guy i have only very recently been seeing and i'd feel so embarressed really want to sleep with him thogugh any thoughts or help bleeding is normal for the frist time and there ather for a wile too it should stop in time but if you thing that it has being going on for a wile to long then go to your doctor abouth the guy that your seening then you should talk too him and don't be worried abouth being embarressed abouth telling him abouth it andif he make a big thing a bouth it them his not worth it Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
