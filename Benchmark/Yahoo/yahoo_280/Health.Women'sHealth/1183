can you have your period and still be pregnant i know its possible because two of my friends have been pregnant while taking birth control they took the entire pack one month period and all and then the next month when they started taking the inactive pills they started having morning sickness anyway the reason why im asking is cuz i was seeing a guy who would ejaculate inside of me whenever we had sex because i was on birth control we've had sex like times probably now im back with my boyfriend and im kind of scared cuz we've had sex too and now i've been thinking im pergnant im taking loestrin and there's only inactive pills instead of the ususal so my period only lasts days but it wasnt heavy at all i've looked up online that you can have periods while pregnant sometimes for up to months i want to know if birth control has a factor in this or i just want to hear stories about others having periods while pregnant or getting pregnant on birth control sorry its so long its detailed stop sleeping around i have a boyfriend and no so stop answering questions if you're not gonna give insightful information which i doubt you even could and wasting your time my wife had her period two times after she got pregnant my advise is go to your doctor to see if you are pregnant my wife was on yasmin before we tried for a baby and is back on it now that we had one it's a very good birth control Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fertility awareness Friends Jon Secada Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate Birth control Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neighbours Kodocha Avenue Q Sex and the City Urinary incontinence Trainspotting (novel) Oral sex Emergency contraception Apollo 8 Charmed Masturbation Alois Hitler Childbirth Jam (TV series) The Inside Sin City Puberty Sleeping Murder Psoriasis History of sex Boston Public Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Boom Town (Doctor Who) Folic acid Phoebe Halliwell Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind One Life to Live StarCraft: Uprising Kurt Cobain Ocean's Twelve Obstetrics 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Days of our Lives Melanie Wilkes Premature ejaculation Mary, the mother of Jesus The League of Gentlemen (comedy) The Time Machine Tocopherol The Ashlee Simpson Show One Tree Hill (TV series) Lauren Bacall Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sharon Tate Strap-on dildo Miscarriage Endometriosis Prostate cancer Soap opera Futurama (TV series - season 5) Social rule In vitro fertilisation History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Katelyn Faber Sexual intercourse Blood on the Tracks Isotretinoin Anne Boleyn Menstrual cup Ginger Lynn Breastfeeding The Long Game Mid-Autumn Festival Characters of Lost Elvis Presley Guinea pig Blonde on Blonde Aliens of London Everwood Brave New World Pornographic movie The Parting of the Ways Eddie Guerrero Infantilism Babe Ruth's Called Shot Depo Provera Series finale Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pink (musician) Rei Ayanami Trouble (comic) Autism
