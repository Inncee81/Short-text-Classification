plan b okay so here is my story my last period was on july and i usually have a fairly normal day cycle about july or i was messing around with my bf we did not have sex or any penetration but i got nervous that some ejaculation as it was close to me about two hours after i went and got plan b and took it immediatley and then took the second does twelve hours as instructed about two days later i took another dose of plan b after messing around again today august i woke feeling very dizzy like i might pass out and a little nauseated i decided to take a urine pregnancy test which came back negative i am very worried still i know that it is very unlikely that i could be pregnant seeing as there was no actual penetration i guess my question really is what is the latest anyone has had a period after taking plan b i still have a few days until my normal period time also how long should i wait to get a blood test from the dr thank u for ur considerate answers i am aware that taking two doses was not the ideal way to go about this and i understand that it is not the same as regular birth control this was unplanned and i do plan on starting a regular safe birth control plan also from what i have read the plan b pill is not a abortion pill it is an emergency prevention i would appreciate encouraging and informative answers i already know that what i have done is not ideal thank you people are annoying that don't answer exactly what your asking they should waste someone else's time i'm sure you know that taking doses isn't good thankyou captain obvious anyways i took plan b on the th of july too i wasn't due for my period till august th i got it days ago days early plan b will make you feel like crap it did it for me i was fine the st hrs and then days later got sick it happens definitely it's a huge dose of hormones and being that you took i can see why your dizzy your not pregnant so don't stress that or it'll make your period later everyone's different you might get it soon or might get it late i don't think your going to have to take a blood test being that there was no penetration but since you took doses you may actually not get your period if anything you might spot that's normal good luck and don't let these people get to you Birth control Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Urinary incontinence Tocopherol Obstetrics Prostate cancer Vitamin C Social rule Apollo 8 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diazepam Sleep EastEnders Breastfeeding Endometriosis Hypoglycemia Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hypertension Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Diabetes mellitus Human sexual behavior Androgen insensitivity syndrome Caffeine Shaggy dog story Miscarriage Ben Johnson (athlete) Cancer Masturbation Insulin Abortion Puberty Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Pitaten Sex education Knots Landing Time Out of Mind Condom God Emperor of Dune Housebreaking Maprotiline Folic acid Chronic fatigue syndrome Nuclear fallout Psoriasis Sharon Tate Chemical abortion Tour de France Growth hormone treatment Paracetamol Premature ejaculation Childbirth Guinea pig Controversies in autism Multiple sclerosis Scientology beliefs and practices Baldness treatments Prenatal diagnosis Doxepin Turner syndrome Singlish Tobacco smoking Ionizing radiation Haloperidol Shit Vitamin D Coming of Age (TNG episode) History of sex Sin City Neighbours Aortic dissection Symbiosis (TNG episode) Kodocha Propranolol Medical prescription Milton H.
