has anyone ever asked has anyone asked their doctors about using tampons before they started if so how did you ask and what was their response also was it really uncomfortable and how did you come up with the courage to ask i'm nervous to ask my pediatrician and trying to come up with idea on how to ask i've had my period for a while and want to switch because of sports trust your doctor there's nothing to be ashamed of if you're interested in how to care for your body don't try to put that godarn thing in withou talking to someone first believe me i have experience your doctor is always best my doctor is really cool about everything when i ask her stuff like that she's really clear but she doesn't act like i'm retarded for not knowing if you're not comfortable with your doctor or you don't like them you have a problem i switched doctors when i was twelve years old because dr what's her face just wasn't working for me just find a doctor you like and you'll be much more comfortable asking it's a little awkward but it's better to know then to hurt yourself it is possible good luck Social rule Theory of conduct Milton H.
