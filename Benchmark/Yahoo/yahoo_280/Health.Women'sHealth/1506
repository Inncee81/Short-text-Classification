why have i been bleeding for weeks nothing like this has ever happened to me before i have not been under any more stress than usual a couple of weeks before my period or whatever this is began i had unprotected sex with a new guy for the first time if that could have anything to do with this i also had moderate cramps for about a week following having sex with him and then when i got my period it was very light and brown blood for the first few days and since then it has switched between being a moderate period with normal blood back to brown blood and then back to heavier red i used to be on the pill but had stopped a few months ago and started taking it again when i got my period if that could have prolonged it i just have no idea if there is something wrong with me or if there is any explanation as to why my body is acting this way i was on the depo shot and after i got off of it i didn't have a period for months then when it came it was a horrific it lasted for weeks very very heavy then stopped for a day then started up again very heavy it took me about months before it got normal again the only thing you need to worry about is if your bleeding so bad that you have to change your bad every hour that is too much blood loss so monitor your bleeding and changes and if you can make an appmt with you doc if things don't get better but relax and try not to stress your stressing will only make the issue worse hope you get better soon Menstrual cycle Childbirth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Social rule Urinary incontinence Miscarriage Migraine Puberty Dialysis EastEnders Shaggy dog story Stomach cancer Stroke Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling slang Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Blood on the Tracks Milton H.
