taking birth control pills i've been taking birth control pills for about a month now i talked to my doctor about everything but then tonight i had some questions i hadn't thought to ask him when about will i get my period will it be right after i take my first inactive pill or shortly after also my doctor told me that women on birth control pills usually experience shorter periods well i noticed that i have seven inactive pills does this mean my period will last seven days or will it start after i've taken a few inactive pills and end before i've taken them all my periods normally last three days and if i'm going to have it for every day i have an inactive pill well i really don't want to go from three days to seven yuck i think it's different for everyone it takes me or placebo pills so or days before my period starts and then it only lasts days once you're on the pill for a few months you'll know exactly which day you're gonna get your period it's awesome to know you can plan all your beach activities around that one week or days another thing the pill does is make your periods very light which is also cool good luck if you ever have any questions you can also ask your pharmacist Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Menstrual cycle Placebo Fertility awareness Psoriasis Baldness treatments Urinary incontinence Birth control Endometriosis Apollo 8 Alanis Morissette Jennifer Lopez The Ashlee Simpson Show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pregnancy Antidepressant Migraine Slow Train Coming Childbirth Social rule Abortion debate Mid-Autumn Festival Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Depo Provera Friends Medical prescription Tocopherol Soap opera Randomized controlled trial Theodicy Aliens of London Oh My Goddess!
