birth controll pill side effects i was taking birth control pills i was on ortho try cyclin lo i started taking them i took the first pills of the pack then i made the decision to stop the useage due to the bad side effects that i was getting from the pill so i has been days since i have not taken the pill and today in the morning i had spotting i didnt have any spotting while i was taking the pill my question is is it normal for this spotting to occur even though im no longer taking the pill i have not had sex in the past month so im not preganat as one the post states the spotting is probably your body's reaction to the withdrawal of hormones it had been getting it's the same principle as when you start the placebos at the end of the pack it's normal if it doesn't go away in a week or so call your doc for advice i know those side effects are awful but you only gave the pill days it can take months for all of the side effects to subside if you can handle it i think it's worth it to be patient however i know sometimes it's just too much and some women's bodies just will not accept those hormones do what's right for you Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Acne Emergency contraception Psoriasis Fertility awareness Antidepressant Endometriosis Prostate cancer Birth control Depo Provera Urinary incontinence Tocopherol Placebo Androgen insensitivity syndrome Glucocorticoid Abortion debate Amiodarone Puberty Caffeine Nutrition Vitamin D Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Homosexuality and transgender Transsexuality Baldness treatments Diazepam Randomized controlled trial Allergy Pregnancy Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Folic acid Hormone replacement therapy Testosterone Cancer Turner syndrome Sex education Human penis size COX-2 inhibitor Sex assignment Stomach cancer Radiation therapy Alanis Morissette Atherosclerosis Breastfeeding Childbirth Legal aspects of transsexualism Insulin Growth hormone treatment Intersexuality Syphilis Obstetrics Paroxetine Signal transduction Herpes simplex virus Hypoglycemia Homeopathy Maprotiline Breast Gregory Goodwin Pincus Mid-Autumn Festival Social rule Breast cancer Bupropion Haloperidol Progesterone Hypertension Drug addiction Multiple sclerosis Strap-on dildo Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 Chemotherapy American football Sleep Hormone Rocky Mountain spotted fever Baldness Placebo effect Gallstone Morning sickness Anabolic steroid Neighbours Pharmaceutical company Migraine Adverse effect (medicine) History of intersex surgery Resident Evil Outbreak Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clinical depression Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sexual revolution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tag Treaty Growth hormone deficiency Sexual differentiation Dietary fiber Katharine McCormick
