girls only i'm trying to see if i can get a lot of answers please help i have a few questions that i have been wondering about lately i was wondering if anyone here has asked their doctors about using tampons before they started using them i was also wondering how you asked if you did and what their response was also did the doctor try to make it as comfortable as they could and how embarrassing was it after you said it also how did you bring yourself to ask if you haven't asked what are some ways that i could ask my pediatrician i have a female doctor i trust her and all but i am just to nervous to ask about tampons but i want to hear what she has to say i have no one else to talk to about this and i do not want to just try them before i talk to my doctor i have tried several time to ask but i chicken out i know that every girl has to deal with period but i still find it so embarrassing what can i do i play a lot of sports and am very active so i really wanna switch i didn't have anyone to ask either i'm now everything i learned about anything came from reading the pamphlet lol even to this day my mom tunes out any sort of talk i have an yr old sister that got a yeast infection and my mom called me at work i told her there was medicine in the cabinet so my mom sent my little sister up to my older sister house so she could explain it to her hun don't be ashamed or scared you're doctor knows you and how to talk to you if you can get to the doctors office then just tell her what you said here i would like to try to use tampons but i would like for you to explain how they work any risks and how to use them or what you can do is make the appointment and when they nurse asks what for tell her you want your doc to explain tampons you know what might be easier if you have a girlfriend that can make that call for ya that way you don't have to feel embarrassed by talking to the nurse and when you get to the doctors office she will already be prepared and you won't have to initiate anything good luck The Ashlee Simpson Show Avenue Q Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.
