bumped my elbow hard why does my wrist hurt i was on the floor putting some books on a low shelf when i brought my arm down after shelving a book my elbow kind of on the upper side of it hit hard on the corner of a large plastic box which has a sharp corner the pain wasn't like hitting my funny bone it was much worse i swear it brought tears to my eyes and my whole arm went numb from the elbow to the tips of my fingers what i want to know why do my wrists and fingers hurt bad now too my elbow is really sore it hurts to bend it out all the way and honestly the pain just type it bad i have a bruise now showing up where i hit it any idea what's wrong oh yes i will watch out for plastic boxes now and i won't type anymore lol there's a tendon that runs from your elbow to your wrist that's probably what you hit and why your wrist and fingers are bothering you i have tendonitis and my elbow is extremely tender in one spot but when it flares up my wrist gets sore and my pinky finger goes numb hopefully you will feel better in a couple days but if pain lingers talk to your doctor Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling attacks Carpal tunnel syndrome Diving Boxing Humerus Elbow bondage Repetitive strain injury Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gesture Elbow-joint Strike (attack) Fast bowling Milton H.
