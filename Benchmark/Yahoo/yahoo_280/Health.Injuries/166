ouch i hurt i spent hours jet skiing in mexico muscle help anyone i'm wondering which muscles you are supposed to use jet skiing my quads abs pecs triceps and trapezius all hurt was i doing it totally wrong or am i just that out of shape any opinions on how to make the pain go away warm soaks and ibuprofen aren't cutting it stretch those musles stretch in every way possible until you find the perfect position where the aching feels assuaged and relaxed all though there is not much you can do about your abs have someone help you stretch lay down on a bed and have someone lift your legs up to your stomach you dont need to go that far but you get the idea it may hurt a little but when they let go all the blood rushes back into your leg and the aching will temporarly vanish i also like it when i use tons of lotion and rub it into my hands while pushing firmly down on my arm or leg with my fingertips and palm better yet is to have someone else do it d if warm soaks and ibuprofen arent working there isnt much else you can do i played tennis for years and after all that running and arm swinging the best thing ever is to sleep in a comfortable bed and get hours of sleep so your body can repair at night Massage Professional wrestling holds Mattress Weight training Aerial (dance move) Menstrual cup Professional wrestling throws Carpal tunnel syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Strap-on dildo Backstroke Professional wrestling attacks Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Manicure Insomnia Iditarod Equine conformation Breaststroke Diving Naruto jutsu Osteoarthritis Cramp Volleyball Childbirth Abdomen Suplex Glossary of ballet terms Sin City Sleep Swimming Textile manufacturing Shaggy dog story Waterbed Arm Breastfeeding Acupuncture Spanking Mr. Olympia Out-of-body experience Fecal incontinence The Inside Professional wrestling aerial techniques First aid Repetitive strain injury Violin Back pain Social rule DDT (professional wrestling) Drowning Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Scapula Salad Fingers Swingout Milton H.
