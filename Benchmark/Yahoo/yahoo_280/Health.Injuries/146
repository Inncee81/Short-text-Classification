ankle sprain i got an ankle sprain today while playing basketball it's quite bad i came home and put ice for an hour then i applied deep heat cream and tied a bandage is there anything more i can do i am also confused because half the people told me to relax it while others told me to walk normal it hurts umm pink panther i was not so concerned but now i am scared i had ankle sprains before but different people were experimenting different methods to fix it but it never took more than a week to heal i just wanted it straight this time you should give it a rest now and then when it doesn't hurt much start walking to make it heal faster truth is as always between you should ice it for the first day or two to stop blood inside why deep heat cream you should apply it after days not earlier first cold and rest while the process inside is still going on then heat and walking carefully and with a bandage to stop the consequences of the process Bruise 1957 World Series Massage First aid Professional wrestling holds Sandy Koufax Ice cream Dialysis Carbon dioxide Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Theory of conduct Dairy Professional wrestling slang Sento Poker jargon Snakebite (bite) Shoe Kurt Angle Hiking Donovan McNabb January 2005 in sports Survivor: Guatemala Tourniquet Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
