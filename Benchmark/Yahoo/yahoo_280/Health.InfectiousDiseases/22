bladder infection so last year in november i got this semi bladder infection it had the symptoms such as urgency to urinate fequently and pain when urinating however it did not test as a bladder infection i have it again right now and im wondering what i can do to help it go away thank you as i said it didnt test as one so i was wondering what else i can do my mom had suggested last tiem that i drink this cranberry juice or something similar but it was disgusting so i was wondering about things like that you appear to be a little confused uti stands for urinary tract infection which means the infection is somewhere in the urinary tract not necessarily the bladder bladder infections usually present with a certain level of bacteria whereas other utis have more or less if it's really bad it could be a kidney infection which is what you're describing plus sharp stabbing pains in your lower to mid back not a backache like someone is taking a inch serrated steak knife and stabbing you in your kidneys there are over the counter products such as azo that will help as far as cranberry juice goes it helps a lot with the pain something about it kills whatever it is that makes it hurt when you pee which is why everyone says drink cranberry juice i would recommend ocean spray cranberry juice which is a bit tart mixed with sprite over ice it's the only way i could get it down but even two glasses of that a day helped also make sure you drink lots of water it will help flush all the nasty bacteria out of your system drinking too many caffinated beverages will dehydrate you which can cause a uti in the first place that's how i get mine it will help relieve pain too Urinary incontinence Urine Urinary tract infection Kidney stone Prostate cancer Kidney Cystoscopy Medical analysis of circumcision Pneumonia Urination Vitamin C Vulvovaginal health Dehydration Gout Escherichia coli O157:H7 Cider Cranberry Benign prostatic hyperplasia Breastfeeding Prostatitis Gonorrhoea Bearberry IgA nephropathy Nephrology Urethra Acute renal failure Ethanol Paget's disease of bone Escherichia coli Leptospirosis Hydronephrosis Diabetic neuropathy Pyelonephritis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rum Diabetes insipidus Legionellosis Aspartame Hyperglycemia Antiretroviral drug Group A streptococcal infection Autoimmune diseases First aid Endometriosis Soft drink Water Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Obstetrics Guinea pig Diabetic ketoacidosis Medicine Penis Hip fracture Anthrax Lesch-Nyhan syndrome 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Coffee Beer HIV test Tea Epididymitis Dialysis Hypertension Herpes simplex virus Nutrition Lupus erythematosus Cirrhosis Psoriasis Tattoo Pig (zodiac) Urolagnia Milk Abdominal pain Back pain Ebola Cheese Gastroesophageal reflux disease Cytomegalovirus Conjunctivitis Dysentery Alcoholic beverage Malaria Paracetamol Interstitial cystitis Survival skills Replacement joint Sexually-transmitted infection
