shigella virus ok if you look at my other post you will see the long drawn out scary story about my son and the problems finally there diagnosed him with shigella he stopped diahrea for days then began again thurs so the doc is fianlly calling in antibiotics well today is monday and i have got diahrea and no insurance assuming it is what he has being i havent been anywhere else should i try to get antibiotics too or will it run its course i have no insurance for myself so your right it is a bacteria my ignorance for overlooking such my son is years old and has had it for almost weeks we have been to the doctor and the hospital and in contact with the doctor by phone they have prescribed him antibiotics as of last night i have done all the precautions washed his sheets toys disenfected everything cleaning the potties everytime anyone goes he picked it up in summer camp he has had it to the point it has caused bloody stools just concerned because i do not want to pass it back to him he has an immune deficiency and this has been well point blank hell on him first a point of clarification shigella is a bacterium not a virus it might seem a little nickpicky but as a microbiologist i feel i need to correct this i hope i am not portraying a holier than thou attitude just wish to clarify now it is very likely that you contracted shigella from your son most mild infections of shigella will resolve themselves in a few days of course those few days will be quite miserable at this point i would not rush to see a doctor quite yet if your diarrhea last more than five days i would see a doctor who will probably prescribe some antibiotics for you more severe infections will last longer than days and might require hospitalization i'm sorry i haven't read your other posts if your son is quite young or under the infections probably will seems worse in him than in you as these infections are generally more severe in the really young and old i really don't want to tell that everything will be alright because i really don't know that all i can say is see how you feel in a few days if you don't start to feel better or get worse then i would suggest you see a doctor just out of curiosity what antibiotic is your son on Pneumonia Diarrhea Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Escherichia coli O157:H7 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Common cold Foodborne illness Fecal incontinence Tuberculosis Stomach cancer Psoriasis Antibiotic Conjunctivitis Group A streptococcal infection Gonorrhoea Ebola Infectious disease Medicine Anthrax Legionellosis Cystic fibrosis Infectious mononucleosis Crohn's disease Virus Hepatitis AIDS Cytomegalovirus Lyme disease Prostate cancer Smallpox Dysentery Clostridium difficile Rotavirus Helicobacter pylori Dialysis Gastroenteritis Biological warfare Rocky Mountain spotted fever Acne Cellulitis Rabies Traumatic brain injury Sexually-transmitted infection Cephalexin Urinary incontinence Reiter's syndrome Ulcerative colitis Cirrhosis Coeliac disease The Shining (film) Staphylococcus aureus Hepatitis C First aid Homeopathy Influenza AIDS reappraisal Shigellosis Immune system H5N1 Intravenous therapy Cystoscopy Operation Market Garden Medical analysis of circumcision Folic acid Medical prescription Pasteur Institute Milton H.
