what are the symptoms of mono am i at risk i made out with this guy about weeks ago and tuesday morning i got really sick i'm still really sick now anyway the guy who i made out with he got sick tuesday morning too it turns out that he has mono am i at risk i didn't want to see a doctor because i feel too sick to leave the house i figured it was just a cold and would go away quickly what do you think mono is not treated with antibiotics as one person said a doctor will only prescribe antibiotics if they think you have a different bacterial infection at the same time or if they misdiagnose it the first time if you have mono and are on antibiotics call your doctor to ask whether or not you should finish the prescription never stop taking an antibiotic without a doctor telling you to do so if you do have a bacterial infection and you stop taking the antibiotics before finishing them all then the infection may still be there and may become resistant to the antibiotic you were taken you can then spread this resistant infection to others mono however is not caused by bacteria it is caused by a virus viruses and bacteria are completely different so the medications that kill bacteria are useless against viruses if your dog was hungry you would never think to give him plant fertilizer as food right you would realize that a dog and a daisy are completely different organisms and what's food for one is not going to work for the other the same goes for killing viruses and bacteria they're just as different from each other as plants and animals are taking antibiotics for viral infections will not help at all only use antibiotics for bacterial infections and always finish the entire prescription any other use only contributes to the growing problem of antibiotic resistant bacteria there are some anti viral medications for some viral diseases but many viral diseases are treated by alleviating the symptoms so the patient is more comfortable while their immune system fights off the virus for instance when i had mono swallowing was so painful that i couldn't eat or drink more than a couple of mouthfuls each day my doctor gave me low dose steroids to reduce the swelling so i wouldn't end up in the hospital for dehydration there are some slight risks to this as there is with any treatment so you'll have to talk to your doctor to find out what's best in your own specific situation Diarrhea Group A streptococcal infection Infectious mononucleosis Tuberculosis Gonorrhoea Conjunctivitis Foodborne illness Crohn's disease Stomach cancer Rabies Antiviral drug Sexually-transmitted infection Cellulitis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Herpes simplex virus Pharyngitis Acne Cirrhosis Bacteria Ebola Medicine Anthrax Asthma Prostate cancer Infectious disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cytomegalovirus Nutrition Traditional Chinese medicine Smallpox Vitamin C Antiretroviral drug Hepatitis C Streptococcus pneumoniae Eczema Sickle-cell disease Legionellosis First aid Malaria HIV HIV test Hepatitis HIV vaccine Ulcerative colitis Kaposi's sarcoma H5N1 Penicillin Lyme disease Traumatic brain injury Clostridium difficile Allergy Marburg virus Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Biological warfare Cancer Helicobacter pylori Shrimp farm Leptospirosis Lung cancer Influenza Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Migraine Antibiotic resistance Fibromyalgia Cystic fibrosis Chemotherapy Dysentery Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Colorectal cancer Poliomyelitis Livestock Medical analysis of circumcision Mouth ulcer Diabetes mellitus Balance disorder Encephalitis Upper respiratory tract infection Iatrogenic Pelvic inflammatory disease Folic acid Gastroparesis Diseases of the honeybee Urinary incontinence Leukemia Bubonic plague
