foot and mouth what is the problem why can't the animals be vaccinated against f m they have said that there is no plans to mass vaccinate the first thing to know about fmd is that there are seven 'serotypes' layman's term subspecies of the virus furthermore each serotype has several subtypes of its own what this means is that a vaccine for one type of fmd infection tends not to be effective as a vaccine for any other types of fmd infections so you'd need tends of different vaccines to cover fmd bottom line it's tough to vaccinate prophylactically routinely as a preventative measure there are vaccines available though contrary to the above answerer and any particular infection is caused by only one serotype so it can be done secondly and far more importantly countries importing meat prefer it if the country is both a disease free and b vaccine free why the latter well there are concerns about vaccination in some quarters does it mask the actual disease does it cause the actual disease etc in other words it literally pays countries not to vaccinate as odd as that sounds in fact the european union actually bans prophylactic vaccination although it is less strict on emergency vaccination i e once an outbreak is confirmed it is permissible to vaccinate others to stop the disease but you can't vaccinate to prevent disease in the first place however the eu would subsequently ban the export of the 'emergency vaccinated' animals for six months so governments are reluctant to do this one final important point it is exceptionally rare for humans to get infected with fmd and when they do they always recover this puts things into quite a nasty perspective we are not vaccinating against fmd simply because people are scared of the vaccine instead we resort to slaughter of animals with any chance of having the disease we could still make a reasonable case for this if we were were sure that the vaccine was so terrible but are we Rabies H5N1 Influenza 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis Smallpox Avian influenza Malaria Influenza pandemic Vaccine Poliomyelitis Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Ebola Cancer Measles Anthrax Meningitis Human papillomavirus Adenoviridae Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Pneumonia AIDS Rotavirus Monkeypox Herpes simplex virus Singaporean measures against avian influenza Mumps West Nile virus Spanish flu Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dengue fever Virus Autism HIV Cytomegalovirus Epidemiology Yellow fever Tuberculosis Genetically modified food Sexually-transmitted infection Hepatitis C Antiviral drug Escherichia coli O157:H7 Vegetarianism Quarantine Marburg virus Louis Pasteur Vaccination Cervical cancer Computer virus Externality Medical analysis of circumcision Thimerosal Andrew Wakefield Vaccine controversy Bioterrorism Kashrut Common cold Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mathematical modelling in epidemiology Autism epidemic Safe trade Lyme disease Ferret Pandemic Food and Drug Administration Coeliac disease Hepatitis B Condom Precautionary principle Ulcerative colitis Allergy Lassa fever Tobacco smoking Tsetse fly Democracy Biological warfare Urinary incontinence HIV test Colorectal cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Jonas Salk Chagas disease Diphtheria
