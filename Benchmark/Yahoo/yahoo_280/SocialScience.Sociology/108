how can i learn to be less sensitive i have a very hard time not taking personal offense to any negative comment or vibe that comes my way i get very emotional whenever someone accuses me of something or points out one of my faults mistakes how can i become more guarded without becoming overly caloused how can i learn to stand up for myself the only way to become less sensitive is to accept the fact that the world isn't out to criticize you everyone needs a reminder once in a while that they're human so don't be offended if someone offers you advice on how to improve something as for taking personal offense to negative vibes you're probably misreading people if this happens a lot take it from someone who has learned the hard way you are your own worst critic when you can understand and come to terms with that you'll be more comfortable with other's opinions be proud of who you are and the decisions you make and remember to keep a positive outlook on life A Course In Miracles Internet troll Sin Transactional analysis Alcoholics Anonymous Shit Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Slander and libel Theory of conduct Pedophilia Political correctness Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) God Emperor of Dune Polyamory Esperanto as an international language The nature of God in Western theology Plame affair Traumatic incident reduction Emotional intelligence Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Surveillance The Apprentice 2 God and gender Past teachings of Prem Rawat Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rape Zoophilia Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Blood on the Tracks Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sexual orientation Cultural relativism Alexander Technique 2005 United States Grand Prix Lie Numerology Emotions (album) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Capital punishment Abortion debate Happiness Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nuanced voices on the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Child sexual abuse Arguments for and against drug prohibition Whose Line Is It Anyway?
