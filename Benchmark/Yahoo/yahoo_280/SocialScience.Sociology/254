why are people uncomfortable with issues such as depression why is it still such a taboo issue in society well depression isn't really a taboo in any society for that matter its just that people who are depressed cannot express it or are unable to express it or they maynot be such an open person some people do not tell about their depression because they feel that people won't be able to relate to their problem and will only end up fussing over them for nothing other reasons could be like they may think that they have a 'reputation' to protect and by showing their weakness they are just ruining their 'image' people also feel that depression should not be shown since that will obviously make their loved ones feel worried and depression for some reason or the other ends up bieng suppressed and not bieng shown thus the ideas on depression bieng 'taboo' well you certainly are right about people bieng slightly uncomfortable about expressing their views on depression because the majority of so called 'sensible people' relate showing depression with bieng pessimistic a person needing psychatric help and also suicide without actually weighing the problem or issue whch is leading to depression but when you can be happy yaar why be depressed Goodness and value theory Transsexuality Social rule Anonymity Anger management Fathers' rights Breastfeeding Human sexual behavior Polyamory Theory of conduct Ethics Rape Oral sex Clinical depression Suicide Narcissism Bernard Williams Sexual orientation Child sexual abuse Pedophilia Pitaten Utilitarianism Unemployment Cross-dressing Homophobia Arthur Schopenhauer Joy Division (band) Keynesian economics Property (ownership right) Consensual crime Anxiety Religion and sexuality Intellectual property Asperger syndrome Modernism Adoption Freedom of speech Cult Conservatism Psychosis Alcoholism Psychoanalysis Democracy Peter Singer Brave New World The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Karen Horney Misanthropy Bertrand Russell Borderline personality disorder Melanie Wilkes Incest Abortion debate Incest taboo Hikikomori Simone Weil Charles Darwin's illness Strap-on dildo Self-harm Monarchy in Canada David Hume Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deflation (economics) Indian English Joni Madraiwiwi Empathy Alignment (role-playing games) Statutory rape Sexual intercourse The Critic Magical thinking Philosophy of language Autistic community Democratic Party (United States) Reinhold Niebuhr Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Taboo food and drink Mach kernel Derek Parfit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human Objectivist philosophy Anarchism and society Tariff Methamphetamine Refugee Friedrich Schleiermacher Zoophilia Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 British Rail Class 42 Consensus decision-making Bipolar disorder Great Depression Paul Feyerabend Single Transferable Vote Piano Leonard Cohen Depression (mood) Vulcan (Star Trek)
