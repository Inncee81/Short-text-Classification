questions about sociology that are very interesting and confused me a lot please share your opinion inequality permeates educational institutions as jonathan kozol s essay shows what specific inequalities in education does he note do you see these reflected in the school in your community how does kozol s description of urban schools show a connection between race and class inequality one way that sociologists think about education is as a route to social mobility others see education as only reproducing the inequalities that exist in society as you observe education today what evidence do you see for each of these perspectives on the role of education in society i don't think my opinion will help here because these appear to be questions for a class you are taking but i can provide some information of course this will not be directly relevant to whatever answers you have to come up with but i will try to clarify the questions first i assume we're both familiar with kozol's work kozol lists actual resources that are found in some schools but not in others this is what the question means by inequality permeating educational institutions some schools have some have not you can pick out the specific things that are present in some schools but not in others as noted by kozal according to your interest in them the next part of this question asks whether these same resources were unequally distributed among schools in your own community kozol describes how some schools have resources that other schools lack and therefore what children have and lack certain resources children of a certain race class have while kids of another race class do not kozol points out a strong connection between race class and unequal distribution of resources needs in schools 'education as a route to social mobility' means that when someone in a society is educated they have more and greater opportunities to succeed 'education as reproducing the inequalities that exist in society' means that the cream rises to the top that education functions to sort people according to their natural gifts and talants the first is of conflict or critical marxist theory the other is of consensus theory or functionalist perspective the question then asks you to decide which perspective conflict or consensus fits your observations the best i really have no idea what examples cases you've looked at so i hope that restating the questions has clarified them a bit good luck with your ideas Capitalism Labor theory of value Economic inequality Law of value Philosophy of language Sociology Sociocultural evolution Anarchism and capitalism Social psychology Jonathan Kozol Economics Ethics Democracy Culture Social justice Philosophy of science Feudalism State Postmodernism Karl Marx Anarchism and society Deconstruction Relations of production Libertarian socialism Anthropology Microeconomics Autism Frankfurt School Education Sociology of religion Tripartite System Surplus product Power (sociology) Exploitation Intelligent design Second language acquisition Capital accumulation Science Theory of conduct Feminism Sexual orientation Liberalism Philosophy of education Objectivist philosophy Voter turnout War Intelligence quotient Consensus decision-making Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transformation problem Scientific method John Rawls Bayes' theorem Criticism of libertarianism Education in the People's Republic of China Surplus value Extreme Programming Intelligent design movement Universal pragmatics Anarchism Political economy GED Tonality Autism rights movement Goodness and value theory Altruism Natural deduction Jean-Jacques Rousseau Antonio Gramsci Psychology Bureaucracy Cultural relativism School of Salamanca Unemployment Property (ownership right) Epistemology Simone Weil The Bell Curve A New Kind of Science Karl Popper Meaning of life Social Criticisms of socialism History of science Anarcho-capitalism Market failure Free trade Pseudoscience Noam Chomsky Primitive accumulation of capital Philosophy of mathematics Teach the Controversy Productive and unproductive labour Family Bayesian inference Open source culture
