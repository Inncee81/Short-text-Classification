why do i make myself isolated everytime my friends ask me to do something or go somewhere i just don't i hate group projects at school and the few friends i have annoy me because they say i never go over their house or spend time with them i avoid them alot in school and just don't want to be bothered with them everytime my family and i move i say i'll be more outgoing but it never happens everyday i eat lunch alone even when i see people i know why am i like this all i do for fun is watch movies listen to music and go on the computer at home why do i find social situations to be bothersome and pointless how do i change this wow i thought i was the only one who felt this way at first i thought that maybe i was just shy and had low self esteem but now as i grow older i think that this is not necessarily the case it has become apart of my personlity some days i can be energetic a little social but people in general to me are just annoying their energy just drags me down of course i may have those family members and two or three friends that i really enjoy spending time with but sometimes when i see them on campus or somewhere i still don't feel like being bothered with them even though i know they didn't do anything wrong sometimes i don't have the energy to smile to interact to start and partake in conversation and it really makes me sad to feel like this but i just like spending time with myself enjoying my nice collection of music watching my favorite tv programs and surfing the web it gives me time to emerse myself in my own thoughts get in touch with my feelings and enjoy myself without any distractions i have been diagnosed with bi polar depression so this is probadly why i act this way do you feel depressed Shaggy dog story Hikikomori The Catcher in the Rye Pitaten Milton H.
