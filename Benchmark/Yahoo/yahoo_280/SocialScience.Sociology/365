why do you think that the weirdest people function as the simplest numbers have you ever heard about the 'guns and roses' and how they relate to numbers like if axil is pi and slash is e we could use them as ways to universally define how these numbers relate to things not only that but if we could calculate these numbers all of their plans would be perfectly predictable what Axl Rose Determinism Mathematics Derivative Microeconomics Polynomial Fibonacci number Slash (musician) Factorial Manic Street Preachers Riemann zeta function Digital circuit 0 (number) CPU cache Lambda calculus Computer numbering formats Propositional calculus Dither Combinatory logic Standard deviation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Division (mathematics) Probability Manifold Density functional theory Boolean algebra Temperature Mass Pi Sociology Faster-than-light Database Gravity Scientific method Leaf Lebesgue integration Collision detection Exponentiation Empty set Cellular automaton Doomsday argument Combinatorics Phoneme Naive set theory Capitalism Integral Transformation problem Logarithm Monopsony Internal ballistics Information entropy Labour economics Separation axiom Gamma function Comoving distance Topological space Specified complexity Trigonometric function Potts model Equation of state Taylor series Gilby Clarke Steven Adler Exponential function Velvet Revolver Explosive material Metric space Normal distribution Standing wave ratio Partition function (statistical mechanics) Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics) Laws of Form Appetite for Destruction Phonon Gun politics Duff McKagan GunZ The Duel Chemistry XML Law of value Economics Modified Newtonian dynamics C plus plus Computer chess Rational number Shipping (fandom) Impedance Atom Surplus product Mandelbrot set Forcing (mathematics) General relativity Determinant L.A.
