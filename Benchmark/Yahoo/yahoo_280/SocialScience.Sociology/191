is this a weird thing smart folks help is it wrong to contemplate life a lot the world you live in soceity this is something i think about quite a bit just how people are and what we are what's wrong with us why can't it be like this appreciate that love that person you said you did integrity virtue all these things you know what saying i try not to let this consume my every being and every thought but i never really stop thinking about it ever its always in the back of my mind tucked away just that constant thought of life is that weird not weird at all i find that i become most pre occupied with those very things when i'm kind of in a transition in my life sometimes it's triggered by finding out that someone close to me is seriously ill or someone dies sometimes there are triggers like a world crisis for instance i also go through that obsessing when i'm at a crossroads in my life like when my life is going to change for instance starting a new school finishing school a new job moving i think we need to meditate and think about life and the world and our spirit as well as our future our past i think it's like doing a personal inventory and it can be extremely cathartic if you feel lonely with your thoughts and could use a sounding board by all means seek someone to share some of your thoughts with on the other hand if you feel as though this is an 'obsession' that you are working through on your own don't even worry about it i think it's very good that you are thinking about your values your virtue and integrity the love you feel or don't feel evaluating yourself and how you fit in the world around you is an important part of maturing and 'evolving' and is on going for all of your life the fact that you feel that you are a little consumed by it at this time in your life could be an indication that you are about to enter a different phase of your life and trying to determine just where you stand on a lot of important issues you are obviously seeking wisdom go to a library and see what you can find there that may help you answer some of the things that have been niggling at you you'll be just fine i wish more people would take the time to think as you are instead of just spinning their wheels and running their mouths good luck on this intense life journey Extreme Programming Socrates Nicomachean Ethics Theory of conduct Social rule Friedrich Schleiermacher Goodness and value theory Philosophy of language 2000 Australian Grand Prix The nature of God in Western theology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Past teachings of Prem Rawat Meditation Love Traumatic incident reduction Friends of the Western Buddhist Order Time Out of Mind Autism Philosophy Pitaten Shaggy dog story Philo Jon Secada Arthur Schopenhauer Stoicism David Hume Predestination Epistemology Modernism Friends Ken Wilber Rudolf Hermann Lotze Summa Theologiae Scenes from a Memory Kodocha The Apprentice 2 Narcissism One Tree Hill (TV series) K' Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity A Course In Miracles Obsessive-compulsive disorder About a Boy W.I.T.C.H.
