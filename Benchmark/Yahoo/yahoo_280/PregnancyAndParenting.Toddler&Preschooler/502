sahm's how do you spend your day with your children stay at home mom's i am curious how you spend your day with the children i am always interested how other families spend their time together what kinds of games do you play do you stay at home a lot or prefer outings how much tv does your kids get to watch any special bedtime rituals what frustrates you about your child just would like a run down of your day with your children maybe you'll have an idea of something i can do with my children thank you in advance for sharing at the moment i have children soon to be a year old boy a one year old boy and a one year old girl to be honest we don't do nearly as much as i would like to i know they watch way too much tv and i feel bad about it and i am in the process of weaning them off of it this pregnancy i am due in december has left me completely and totaly exhausted and my parenting is suffering because of it i think a routine is key for stay at home families not necessarily a schedule but more like a certain order that things happen if i had the energy i wish i had our day would go something like this i would get up at about to get myself showered and dressed before the kids wake up around diaper changes fix breakfast while the kids watch a baby einstein movie or something else educational eat clean up get the kids dressed then spend some time outside if the weather is cooperating or some structured play we would all play with musical toys or play 'store' with the shopping cart and groceries or build a fort or a tunnel with the couch cushions blocks or big legos inside if it's raining or cold around the kids would all sit in their high chairs and color or play with play dough something stationary so i wouldn't have to sit them in front of the tv again already while i fixed lunch then we would eat clean up change diapers and lay down for a nap at this point i nap with the kids i really need the extra rest but if i didn't i would use nap time to wash the dishes and pickup the toys then sit down with a book or magazine they usually sleep for about hours sometimes as long as hours when they woke up we would have a snack something healthy like fresh fruits or veggies and dip then we would change diapers we go through a lot of diapers and have some unstructured play time with each child doing whatever catches their eye i would use this time after snack and before dinner to go somewhere once or twice a week like the park or the parent resource center or a playdate then i would try to get the kids involved with something that would keep them busy for a half an hour or so a board game when they get a little older or coloring or music a movie if i have to so i could fix dinner daddy gets home just before dinner and the diaper changes for the rest of the night belong to him then we would eat clean up and try to keep the rest of the evening relatively calm we try to eat dinner all together at the table every night i feel that's really important for the kids to grow up with as a ritual and it's a nice time to re connect with daddy after dinner daddy plays with the kids while i wash some dishes he gets to pick up the toys after they go to bed around the babies get their milk everyone brushes their teeth then they all have a bath i take them out of the tub one at a time and they each get a rub down with the night time baby lotion lavander scented then into clean diapers and pj's then we read a book or lol and they get into bed around or as soon as they are in bed i try to finish up whatever else needs to be done so i can wake up to a relatively clean house most of that was what i wish i did with my kids like i said it will be easier to accomplish once i get a little energy back and there will be a lot more i can do with them when they get a little older i can't wait until they're old enough to play board games and do arts and crafts there are lots of books that have ideas for things you can do with the kids the toddler's busy book tv free activities you can do with your child i plan on picking a couple of these idea books up very soon good luck i hope i helped at least a little Breakfast Infantilism Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Comanche Hamster Care Bears Breastfeeding Poker jargon Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Garfield The Family from One End Street Sento The Contender (television series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Textile manufacturing New York Giants Milton H.
