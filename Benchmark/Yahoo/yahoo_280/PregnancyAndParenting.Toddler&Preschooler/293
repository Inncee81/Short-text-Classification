how can people yell at their children i work at a daycare i volunteered there for years before i got hired when i had my th bday not long ago i sometimes see parents yell at their kids and i could never do it how do they i mean i may be in a room alone with screaming kids no they don't follow max capacity rules there but i somehow manage to calmly but firmly set the rules and settle the kids down they all obey me pretty well but screaming i never could spanking yelling any of that stuff is just horrible to me i'm so calm around the kids and i love each and every one of them and screaming just seems wrong does anybody agree with me by the way i'm due in december with a boy very excited that is really great and congrats it is different watching other children and raising your own child children are more comfortable with their family and most kids minus the ones who are terrified of their parents act worse for their parents than they do for other people some people think it is bad parenting and some of it is but it is a natural thing don't you remember giving your parents some trouble but that is just an explanation that doesn't mean it is ok to yell or spank or whatever we have all been raised differently and that affects our parenting whether for the good or the worse Theory of conduct Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spanking Calvin and Hobbes Miss Saigon Shaggy dog story The Inside Little Britain Codename: Kids Next Door The Jeffersons (South Park) Milton H.
