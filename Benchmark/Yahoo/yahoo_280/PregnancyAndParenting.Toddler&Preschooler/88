school background check my older sister has an austictic child who will be starting school soon she'll be in april well my sister is really afraid that the school will mistreat her daughter nobody else is worried and we all think it's a good school my sister has had to schedule meetings with the staff so they can see the child and make sure she's eligible for the special start program i don't think a school that checks out the children numerous times would abuse them but my sister says she's having nightmares she's worried that they're not going to see her as a child but as a retarded kid who's worthless i've tried talking sense into her but she's letting the stress affect her health i'm stationed in japan and i can't do much for her but tell her it will be ok how can she check out the school to see if it's ok she thinks if she asks the school directly they would lie to her would you admit to child abuse so how can she put her fears to rest i have an autistic child and she will be fine once the child is in school as parents of autistic children we tend to be overprotective anyway if she has scheduled meetings with the staff already met with them and toured the school that should alleviate some of her worries quite honestly my son's teachers always tell me how bright he is and the fact that he is so intelligent they have had to increase their standards for him to hold his interest i have had one problem with a teacher in his preschool she was of the mindset that all children should always sit still and never speak i teach kindergarten and was appaled by what i saw there so out he went her best bet is to do precisely what she did the visiting meeting etc it will be ok just keep reassuring her thank goodness you care so much even though you are so far away god bless Education in the United States Autism Education in the People's Republic of China Gifted Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Autism rights movement Kodocha Controversies in autism Ethical challenges to autism treatment Milton H.
