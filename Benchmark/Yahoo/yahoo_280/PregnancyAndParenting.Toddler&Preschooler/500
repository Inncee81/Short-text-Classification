what does everyone think did anyone hear on the news last night about the educational videos out for babies and toddlers no names being that in recent studies they have slowed the develpoment of children's vocabulary and speech does everyone think that this is because of the videos or beacuse they are not used correctly or because parents use them as babysitters all day long and don't interact with their children etc just looking for everyone's opinion hi christy i think you hit the nail on the head my daughter had a few of these we watched them together from time to time i would talk to her about what we were seeing do you see the blue doggie look at those hands where are your hands and so on she even started to speak some sign language which was amazing the videos are not to blame and probably are not worth what we pay for them but as a parent you try not to buy into everything you hear but there is this driving force that says what if my kid doesn't have or do this and then lacks in some way later on my daughter spoke early i have video of her at months saying things like bottle talk talk talk to your babies and read to them also ask them questions as they learn to speak to sort of encourage them speaking listen to them even when you don't understand them Autism Baby Blues Second language acquisition Humphrey Bogart MTV Wheel of Fortune Sharon Tate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hearing impairment Milton H.
