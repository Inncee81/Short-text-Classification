how do you get marker off my year old my year old son got ahold of a marker covered his body in lovely artwork this morning lol apparently though it wasn't washable because it's not coming off and we have a family bbq to go to in a few hours where some ppl haven't seen him in a year please tell me what i can use to get it off i've tried washing it over over with no luck i wouldn't sweat it he's two so that sort of thing is cute just explain it to your relatives they will all get a good chuckle out of it the marker should come off on it's own in a few days as your son's skin exfoliates on its own just gently scrub him every night at bath time that's what i do when i get marker or ink on myself Physical attractiveness Psoriasis Time Out of Mind Customs and etiquette of Japan Sauna The Cure Situation comedy Tattoo Soap Acne Roswell UFO incident Hyperthermia Clothing Milton H.
