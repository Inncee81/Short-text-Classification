toddlers sharing bedroom i have a son that will be three in sept and a son that will be in nov months apart i would like to get them sleepin gin the same room different beds but i am nervous to try i know i know i need to just try it any advise i thin kthey will just play and not go to sleep they will naturally want to play a little so it is important to stand firm i would suggest enlisting the help of the year old in the bedtime routine since he is the oldest tell him that you need his help making sure that his baby brother goes to bed on time so after the teeth are brushed and kisses are given he can help tuck his little brother in and then head of to bed himself giving him some responsibility may make him more willing to follow the rules EastEnders Mattress Insomnia Melanie Wilkes Chronic fatigue syndrome Blankets (graphic novel) Textile manufacturing Sudden infant death syndrome Yelena Davydova Daylight saving time Bruxism Stewie Griffin Sleep Sin City Anne Boleyn Oral sex Shaggy dog story She Loves You 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Humphrey Bogart Sleep debt Zhao Yun Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Child sexuality Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Kimberly-Clark Corporation Aerial (dance move) Bedroom Urinary incontinence Co-sleeping Breastfeeding Jam (TV series) Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Living with Michael Jackson Buckingham Palace One Life to Live What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
