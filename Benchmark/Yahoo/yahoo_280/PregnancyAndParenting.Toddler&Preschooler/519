potty training a boy he knows what to do he just won't he's and he knows when he's going and he tells you he's pooped he just won't go in the bathroom i got him spider man drawers and big boy boxers just like daddy and he even says he pee peed on spidey but he won't go near his potty chair he even changes himself he takes the pull up and puts in the garbage and grabs another one and knows not to mess with it when there's poop oye what else can i do relax and remember that just because he realizes that he went and needs to change his pullups doesn't mean he's made the conection with feeling the urge to go and being able to make it to the potty especially when it comes to doing 's it's hard for them to figure out how to make those muscles work when sitting down i've noticed my little boy is able to poo if he's standing up or squatting but even with that he'll try on the potty and not be able to make it come out also consider getting a step stool and a potty ring my boy was very big on doing it as a big boy which he equates to not the little potty since mommy daddy doesn't use the little potty also remember boys take longer then girls to figure the potty out completely kevin had the pee part figured out at roughly and after but is now and a half and only just learned how to do poo in the potty and we had a bit of help with a stomach virus giving him tummy pain before he had to go it will happen on it's own and the less you force it the easier it will be just set a good example for him Toilet humour Professional wrestling holds Fecal incontinence Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling throws Sin City Aerial (dance move) The Inside Spidey Super Stories Humphrey Bogart Mnemonic Blood on the Tracks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Breastfeeding Piccolo Junior Saga Shawn Michaels Ron and Fez Pitaten The Fairly OddParents Milton H.
