my month old won't drink anything two days ago my husband picked up our son from the babysitter's house and discovered his favorite bottle had a large hole in the side of the nipple he unthinkingly threw it away and gave him a sippy cup instead with his dinner my son who usually enjoys drinking out of sippies and cups with straws refused to drink out of it i went out and bought a similar bottle that same night but he still refused to take it it has been days now and i can tell he is so dehydrated from his dry diapers he will occassionally take a drink of milk or water from one of our cups but won't drink enough to keep him hydrated how can i remedy this before it gets ugly it's not that he doesn't want milk or juice or anything it's that he doesn't want to drink it out of anything but his old bottle since he is old enough to use even a normal cup the reason he refuses to drink is because of the emotional attatchment to the old bottle the older it gets the more the attachment my son stopped at yrs it was hell i suggest trying to rehydrate him by feeding him sips of water like a baby rather than leaving it up to him because u have a serious health issue on your hands i would be reluctant to offer sweet drinks because that is not healthy also while it is not enough liquid juicy whole fruits like oranges and strawberries will hydrate him a bit as a special treat take him out to buy a new cup babies that age are not impressed by ur a big boy now but the novelty of selecting a cup allow him any cup will create a sense of ownership Baby bottle Breastfeeding Tea Breakfast Milk Wine Infantilism Dairy Alcoholic beverage Yerba mate Fecal incontinence Coffee Hamster Soft drink Bong Dehydration Cuisine of the Philippines Rehydration Ice cream Rum Infant Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Drink Ship naming and launching Gatorade Champagne (beverage) Knots Landing Bubble tea Sin City Diarrhea Chocolate Beer Indianapolis 500 Hyperthermia Sake Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Vitamin C Rooibos Guinness Joke Characters in the Smurfs Piccolo Junior Saga Fanta Soy milk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Coca-Cola Fasting Textile manufacturing Sugar beet Milkshake About a Boy Mountain Dew Watermelon Water Mango Poker jargon Jackass: The Movie Alcohol Insomnia Hangover Yoghurt Ron Weasley Chlorpromazine Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Cat Escherichia coli O157:H7 Cha chaan teng Gin Phil Hendrie The Super Milk-chan Show Drinking Japanese tea ceremony Tomato Nalgene Drinking game Domestic rabbit Phoebe Buffay's songs Food Wu-Tang Clan affiliates Shaggy dog story A Clockwork Orange Food preservation One Piece minor characters Fancy rat The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ocean's Twelve Baby Blues Kitchen Diaper Vitasoy Beer Pong Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Genericized trademark Toilet humour Vodka
