how do you make a boy stop playing with himself my son is and has been playing with himself for quite awhile probably since about age i let him do his thing or asked him to go in the other room but now its getting to a point where its too often for me i dont want to tell him not to but when were in public its embarassing when teachers friends family etc ask does he have to go to the bathroom because hes grabbing at himself and i have to explain to them no he doesnt how do you approach this without making him self concious about it i dont want him to have a complex but i also want him to learn to be respectful about it what to do with my kids i likened it to going to the bathroom there is nothing wrong with going to the bathroom but it's very private you can tell him that he wouldn't go to the bathroom in front of other people at the store or at school so he needs to touch his privates only in the bathroom or his bedroom start making privacy a routine in your home if you don't already make sure to close the door when you change or go to the bathroom and encourage him to do the same make sure he understands clearly that privates are private as long as you are respectful to him like it seems he will learn privacy not shame Friends Rick Santorum Shaggy dog story Japanese toilet The Shining (film) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Buckingham Palace Blood Simple Infantilism Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
