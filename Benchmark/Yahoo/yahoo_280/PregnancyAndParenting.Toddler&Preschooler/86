dealing with my almost year old girl my daughter is almost four and i am watching an awful transformation we have gone from a completely angelic baby in every way to a whiney moaney child with horrendous selective hearing she breaks down at any minute little thing which has been going on for months i have tried all sorts of disciplining and more attention etc of this to no avail she is very selfish with her brother and screeches at him and lashes out at him he is two i want to know if the mood swings i am witnessing are normal for her age or if there is something we are doing not doing for her they talk about terrible twos but i think they are easy in comparison to three and four year olds your advice and experience would be greatly appreciated in this matter help mums p s she is in a lovely mood today i have implemented her going to her room anytime she screeches this morning which seems to be working so far but then it is only half way through the first day ah the fabulous fours it seems like every two years you get some new wild beast possessing your once wonderful child but here's the good news it's perfectly normal for your angel to turn into a screeching monster time to try a new tactic she's screeching and hitting because things aren't going her way she's getting frustrated and losing her temper these are emotions she's going to have to deal with her entire life she may as well start learning to cope with them now next time she starts getting crazy crouch right down to her eye level hold her shoulders or her head so she has to look right at you and tell her in a calm and soothing voice to take a deep breath then demonstrate for her by doing it yourself make her continue doing the deep breathing two or three more times until she's a little more calm then ask her to use a nice voice and tell you what's going on don't let her get ramped up again if she starts crying or screeching make her take a deep breath then remind her to use her nice voice let her tell you the situation in her own words then ask her questions to try to get her to see it from the other person's point of view was brother being mean when he did that or was it an accident then ask her what she thinks you should do about it ask her to come up with a fair solution you'd be surprised at what kids can come up with at four she's starting to see that other people have feelings too finish up by reiterating the positive outcome and making sure everyone apologizes if needed then it's hugs all around and happily ever after until the next blow up you accomplish several things this way you teach her some self control you end on a positive note and you involve her in the problem solving process plus all your friends will marvel at what a great parent you are strangers will approach you in the grocery store to tell you what a brilliant mom you are and teachers will be calling you to thank you for such a wonderfully behaved student okay maybe not but your life will be a little more calm until the next crisis Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Jon Secada EastEnders The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Past teachings of Prem Rawat Milton H.
