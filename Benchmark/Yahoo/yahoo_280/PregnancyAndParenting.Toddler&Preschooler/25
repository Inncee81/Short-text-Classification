what are your thoughs on baby leashes or harnesses i recently bought my month old one i feel a little embarrased sometimes but i do it for her safety last month she ran out in front of a car and her grandma yanked her by the arm and pulled her arm out of socket so now im afraid to even touch her arm my daughter likes to walk and she's too heavy to carry ive heard people say how degrading they are and mean but i feel its ok since its for her protection what are your thoughts only serious ones please excuse me destiny but i am grateful to my mother in law i'd much rather she hurt her arm then get hit by a car and no my child wont hold my hand she's a baby she wants to run around so if your not going to be helpful to my question why dont you go answer someon elses question to all you people who said that a leash is for a dog and to either teach your kid to stay by your side or use a stroller do not take their young children for walks it is hard for a young child to understand that running infront of a car is dangerous it is even harder for them to hear even the best of parents that tell them no stop or any other appropriate word of caution it is not at all comfortable or natural for a young child to hold hands all the time when walking if you are tall it can actually become painful when they don't have to stretch to hold your hand they are old enough to not need a leash and be able to mind you this can be anywhere between and it is a great idea for any child under the age of to be leashed or harnessed when they are in a place the that can slip out of your hand and get hurt or kidnapped be it the sidewalk supermarket or amusement park also there is no exercise benefit or independence for a child in a stroller not to say that they won't like it for people that don't have access to large areas that their children can run about a walk around the block or through the mall is great for them it lets them explore things and help promote an active lifestyle any parent that does think that a leash is degrading should also remember that these are little people that poop in their pants suck on bottles and scream and throw themselves on the floor when they don't get their way the degrading part is to the parent who is more worried about their image than that of their childs safety Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Aerial (dance move) Humphrey Bogart The Shining (film) Baby transport Kodocha Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Obedience training EastEnders Kitesurfing Escalator Futurama (TV series - season 5) About a Boy Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Satchel Paige 2000 Australian Grand Prix Infantilism Professional wrestling match types Strap-on dildo Singlish Father's Day (Doctor Who) Yoko Ono Trailer Park Boys Professional wrestling holds Ten Commandments Knots Landing Sin City Rose (Doctor Who) War of the Worlds (2005 film) Ayyavazhi mythology Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Reservoir Dogs Equine conformation Jam (TV series) Horse tack Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Death Gate Cycle Ben Johnson (athlete) Rais massacre Glossary of American football Scenes from a Memory Childbirth Maison Ikkoku The Human Stain Social rule Characters of Lost Jackass: The Movie Adoption Journey (band) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Time Out of Mind Hitchhiking The Inside Sailing Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Professional wrestling throws Toilet humour Paragliding Columbine High School massacre School bus The Apprentice 2 Kyle Broflovski The Curse of Fenric Montgomery Burns Bondage (BDSM) Fathers' rights Piccolo Junior Saga Transactional analysis Ty Cobb Swingout The Life and Times of Juniper Lee A Course In Miracles The Parting of the Ways Melanie Wilkes The Lovely Bones Theory of conduct Volleyball Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Infant Russian joke The Marshall Mathers LP Incarnations of Immortality
