at what age can i use bumper pads in my daughters crib ok i know they are dangerous and should not be used under a year to prevent sids my daughter is now almost months what age did you put bumbers in your toddlers crib any sites that do not recommend using them even over a year you shouldn't use them once a baby can stand because they can be used to assist climbing out of the crib also there is more chance of an older child becoming entangled because they are more inquisitive basically they are useless http www hc sc gc ca cps spc legislation pol bumper bordure e html however when used correctly bumper pads should not protect infants from bumping against the sides of a crib or from having limbs become entrapped between the slats of the crib this is because bumper pads are supposed to be removed from the crib by the time that the infant is able to roll over and sit up unaided a development milestone normally reached between and months of age which represents the same time frame in which it is expected that the infant would be able to move over and approach the side of the crib it must also be noted that for the most part infants do not sustain major injuries from banging their heads against the sides of their cribs because they are incapable of generating enough force to seriously injure themselves through head banging the frontal bone which is the part of the head most frequently struck during crib head banging is the thickest bone in the body and therefore is capable of absorbing the shock associated with this type of behaviour it should also be noted that it remains possible for an infant to entrap his or her limbs over or under the bumper pads and that infant limb entrapment between the slats of a crib in the vast majority of cases results in no injury or minor injury such as bruising in summary aesthetic value the risk of limb entrapment and the risk of a child hitting their head against the side of their crib are overshadowed by the hazards of entanglement entrapment strangulation and suffocation potentially leading to death that children are exposed to through the use of bumper pads Airbag Equine conformation Sudden infant death syndrome Cascading Style Sheets Cytomegalovirus Wound Diving Breastfeeding Breech birth Bleeding Abortion debate Glossary of climbing terms Spanking Crash test dummy School bus Fast bowling Cephalic disorder Urinary incontinence Fire fighting Mattress Hip fracture Cancer Aerial (dance move) Tooth enamel Volleyball Professional wrestling holds Traumatic brain injury Androgen insensitivity syndrome Decompression sickness Childbirth Pneumonia Bone marrow transplant Drowning Professional wrestling throws Medical analysis of circumcision Insurance Bruise Combine (Half-Life 2) Road safety Tobacco smoking Asbestos Penis HTML Infant baptism Tourniquet Chair Myocardial infarction Bicycle helmet Kimberly-Clark Corporation Bone fracture Seat belt legislation Boxing Empress L__ Zhi First aid Bodyline Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stroke AIDS Anorexia nervosa Seismic retrofit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Milk High-voltage hazards Abortion Tocopherol Assassination Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Skull Tsunami Glossary of wildland fire terms Infantilism Growth hormone deficiency Sailing Race X James Bulger Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Tank Prostate cancer Star Wars: Galaxies Swimming Intracranial pressure BASE jumping Baby transport Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Infant Pinball Intersex surgery Avalanche HyperText Transfer Protocol Terminal ballistics Chevrolet Camaro Snakebite (bite) Survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks Year 2000 problem Oasis (band)
