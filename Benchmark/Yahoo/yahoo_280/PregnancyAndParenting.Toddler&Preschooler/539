what are some good ideas for flying with a year old in septemeber i will be flying with my year old son for the first time and it goes without saying that i am a bit nervous like all other year old boys my son is not a fan of sitting still for long periods of time my plans are to bring books movies and games for him with that said are there any other items i should bring or any tips or tricks that anyone can provide to help make this flight a little more enjoyable for those around us on the plane i've been flying internationally and domestically with my children since they were months now at least three trips a year are the children and i traveling internationally alone here are some tips and advice that have always worked for me and i hope will help you you will need to have all your son's documents in order it is a good idea to keep a copy of this notarized birth certificate with you if it is an international flight you will need a passport and possibly a visa for your son as well verify what travel documents you will need in advance to make sure you have everything you can take a stroller and gate check it this means that you will be able to use it all the way up until the time that you board and one of the handlers will take it and put it in a special compartment for you when you exit the plane it will be waiting for you at the door as well since your son is at the age where he has to have a seat i advise using a crs child restraint system because it is safe for the child especially during turbulence makes them feel secure is more comfortable for both parent and child and gives both of you the opportunity to relax a bit a crs is a hard backed child safety seat car seat that is approved by the government for use in both motor vehicles and aircraft in order to be certified for use on an airplane the car seat has to met the federal motor vehicle safety standards check the labels on the side of your car restraint for a sticker words will be printed in red for verification that your seat is safe for airplane use many airlines offer half price tickets so parents can be guaranteed that their child can travel in a crs device you should call your airline to ask for a discount and or ask what the airline's policy is for using empty seats for take offs and landings the best thing you can do to help with the ear popping is give your son a bottle or something to drink formula milk water juice it doesn't matter or a pacifier baby formula is fine to take and you are not limited to the amount you can bring aboard as long as your child is with you do not worry http www tsa gov travelers airtravel children formula shtm new regulations allow you to take beverages including water from home as long as they are less than oz or beverages including water of any size that you have purchased from inside the security area onto planes you can bring a limited amount of baby food onto the plane with you other good things to bring are just add water packets of food cheerios goldfish animal crackers dried fruit etc http www tsa gov travelers airtravel prohibited permitted prohibited items shtm save your money when it comes to buying water though because the flight attendants will provide you with hot or cold water or any other drink free at any time that you request no matter how many times you request it another trick is that if your son is not taking to the pacifier or wanting to drink gently rub his neck from the chin down to the chest several times this will cause a swallowing motion which will help with the ears popping make sure to pack plenty of things to entertain your son such as a few books toys a portable dvd player or a laptop with a few movies and one or two comfort things such as a favorite blankie or stuffed animal my children like to bring along their own coloring books a doodle pad their leap pads with a few booklets and scrap paper so that they can make their own drawings with and play games such as tic tac toe my daughter used to like to bring along a doodle bear when she was younger so that she could draw on that as well you might also consider going to the store and letting your son pick out his own carry on bag and a few inexpensive toys that will be used only once on the plane be sure to pick out a few toys without your son seeing so that he has an extra surprise when he opens his carry on don't be afraid to get up and walk the aisles with your son this will help to break up the length of the flight and let him stretch his muscles it's actually a good idea for the whole family to do be sure to pack changes of clothes for your son you will need this in case he gets sick spills something on himself or in case your luggage gets lost keep your diaper bag well stocked with plenty of diapers wipes ointments and other essential things baby nail clippers and scissors are not allowed though just remember the new regulating liquids gels and such and pack accordingly you can usually find travel size baby products in stores and they are wonderful for plane use if your son is still in diapers you should be respectful of other passengers and always change your child's diaper in the restroom they do have diaper bed changers in there although they can be a little small keep your doctors name and number with you also get the name and number of a doctor where you are visiting in case an emergency should come up it is a good idea to have a check up with your doctor before leaving to make sure your child is healthy enough to fly if he has even a slight cold the pressure in his ears during take off and landing even if you do the precaution methods could leave his ears aching for days after the flight most doctors recommend that if anyone is sick such as being stuffed up or already having an earache not to take the flight because of the potential damage to the ears i know my husband and other pilots do not work if they are sick because of this danger bring any medications that you might need for your son should he get sick or that he takes regularly remember that if they are not prescription medications the oz rule applies to them and they must be kept in a clear plastic bag do not give your son medicine with the hopes of it making him sleep this is not only cruel but dangerous as well keep your calm if you get stressed out your son can pick up on it and it will make the travel that much harder last but not least if help is offered to you take it try to get your older child to help from time to time as well if i can be of any more help or assistance please feel free to
