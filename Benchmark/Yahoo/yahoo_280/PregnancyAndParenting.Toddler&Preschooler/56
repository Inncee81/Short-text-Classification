how do i make my daughters th birthday special we have just moved from virginia to texas last month and my daughter just started at her new daycare today her birthday is on the st of august what can we do to make her th birthday special i feel really bad that she really doesn't have any friends yet i know we could have a family party but really there are no kids in the family to invite would it be too early to give her classmates invitations to her birthday party if that is a good idea should the party be at our apartment or maybe chuck e cheeses or gymboree maybe i could really use some advice and suggestions for my children their th birthday was really the first time that they were conscious of having a birthday and a day in your honor i wouldn't focus so much on the birthday party itself but rather on making the whole day special maybe a big happy birthday sign when she wakes up with balloons everywhere instead of a single orgy of unwrapping presents which can be so overwhelming try distributing the gifts throughout the day so she can appreciate each one alot more the institutional birthday parties a la chuck e cheese are pretty simple and cheap to organize but i have yet to see any kid really enjoy themselves at them and believe me i have been to plenty the birthday kid feels they are not sufficiently the center of attention and the rest of the kids are ground down by the noise and crappy food cupcakes in the preschool classroom if permitted will definitely make her feel special i would suggest inviting two or three kids from her class over to your house for a playdate with a birthday cake instead of all of the kids she could care less about out to some noisy place some of the gymboree parties that i have been to have been pretty successful but if she doesn't have a bunch of friends to invite i think she would prefer just going someplace that she loves to go with her family and maybe a restaurant where they can make a big deal out of dessert Birthday Cuisine of Denmark Kindergarten Spidey Super Stories Day care Friends Boston Public 50 First Dates The Ashlee Simpson Show Humphrey Bogart Happy Birthday to You Avenue Q Dr. Seuss W.I.T.C.H.
