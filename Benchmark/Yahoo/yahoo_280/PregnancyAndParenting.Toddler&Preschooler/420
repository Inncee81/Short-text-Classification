daycare decision my son will be in less than a month our current babysitter is a relative who we pay just like we would any other daycare provider we love and trust this relative and we are very grateful she was able to watch him up until now here is the thing i am feeling like my son now needs to be in an environment that teaches him we try and work with him in the evenings but i think it would be better if it was reinforced during the day as well i found a daycare provider who not only watch kids but educate them as well get this for the same prie my question is knowing he is with family and safe is priceless but so is education should i can the fam and go with the new provider lot's of really good answers here i would give it another year and start at if you don't feel like you family member is doing enough you go go to the site below and use as a checklist of thinkg to work on with the child another thing that is great at this age is the mommy caregiver and me classes at the park district or local ymca if you have those options there's tumbling art all sorts of adult participation classes that are affordable where the child will get interaction outside of the home if those aren't options places like little gym and or gymboree are an altrernative my point is at this age getting the child out and around other children is helping him learn socialization skills so when you do send him somewhere he'll have learned that good luck Day care Infantilism Kindergarten Education in the United States Homeschooling GED Autism Education Social rule Boy Scouts of America Transactional analysis Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Kender Education in the People's Republic of China Economic inequality Early childhood education Unemployment Montessori method Children of a Lesser Clod Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Transsexuality Paragliding Drama Sydney Riot of 1879 Education in England About a Boy Education in Romania Dissociative identity disorder YMCA Philosophical skepticism Playground Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart No Child Left Behind Act Education in France Attachment theory Education reform Kimi Finster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Education in Germany Education in Hong Kong Pitaten Past teachings of Prem Rawat Scientology beliefs and practices Sex education Tripartite System Criticism of libertarianism Waldorf Education Dualism (philosophy of mind) Palliative care School choice Melanie Wilkes Socrates Breastfeeding Experiential education Happiness Philosophy of education Social psychology A Course In Miracles Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Epistemology Toastmasters International Laura Schlessinger Asperger syndrome Shaggy dog story Poverty Expert system Autism rights movement Singlish Swami Vivekananda Martial art Richard Feynman Children of God Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Brown v.
