my year old is out of control everytime we can't see her she's eating something bad or on the top bunkbed jumping or playing with the window air conditioner or standing on a dresser the list could go on what do we do we tried time out yelling no snack no tv everything she doesn't ever want to eat her meals she's been like this forever how do i get her out of it she rarely gets sweets my kids never drank soda and they play outside alot and she does this outside too climbs on top of the swing eats rocks and bugs and everything and i also have a yr old for her to chase after and a month old that runs after them with me my yr old almost always listened they are night and day and another thing is we always explain why she is in time out and have her repeat it she's in that stage where you have to let them explore i have children and one right now that is they just are exploring their environment and right now at their age they will do extreme things just to do it when my children put things in their mouth and things like that we tell them its caca and take it out of their hands they like to test you at that age to see what they can get away with i believe that the time out thing just doesn't work and yelling surely doesn't work as far as the tv goes your only hurting yourself in that area they eat what they want when they want its part of their make up and every kid goes through this stage you just keep offering them things to eat and eventually they will start eating things on their own you won't be able to get her out of it until it is time the only thing you can do is maybe divert their attention with other things like toys or things of that nature distraction is the key they will get bored of one thing and go to another don't be distraught its a part of their makeup and every kid goes through it some just handle quicker and easier than others hope this helps Aerial (dance move) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Teen Girl Squad Theory of conduct Conker's Bad Fur Day Hamster Social rule Dog training Ron and Fez Double the Fist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Meaning of life GunZ The Duel Extreme Programming Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Fairly OddParents Pitaten Tooth Jon Secada Procrastination The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fecal incontinence Shaggy dog story Tag Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Billboard Hot 100 Mnemonic Game programming Humphrey Bogart Jackass: The Movie Piccolo Junior Saga Passover Meal Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Little Britain Indianapolis 500 Breath of Fire III BZFlag Hypoglycemia The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jumpstart 3rd Grade 1957 World Series Mountaineering I Want to Hold Your Hand Diving The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Apprentice 2 Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist RuneScape quests Dim sum Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Trailer Park Boys Bon Jovi Time Out of Mind Ron Weasley Fast bowling Tom and Jerry (MGM) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Volleyball Pikmin Vegeta Mario Professional wrestling attacks Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Inside KDE Garfield Professional wrestling aerial techniques Stuttering Recess (TV series) Invader Zim The Offspring Cardcaptor Sakura FLCL Intellivision Traditional animation Calvin and Hobbes Queen (band) Fiddler on the Roof Book of Isaiah Customs and etiquette of Japan Shit IBM PC compatible Blackjack Blood (computer game) Donkey Kong 64 613 mitzvot Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Debugging The Critic Conspiracy (TNG episode) WNNX (FM) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Saints and Soldiers The Flintstones Salad Fingers Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide
