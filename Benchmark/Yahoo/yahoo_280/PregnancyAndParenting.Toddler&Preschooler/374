has anyone done foster care i am thinking about foster care but i don't know of anyone that has done it and i want some tips on it i have boys now is years old and the other is years old any thoughts would be wonderful thanks a lot of people choose to preserve the birth orders in their original family by taking only children who are younger than their youngest child this is important to some people but not so much to others it was better for me to be the oldest child in a family because of my nurturing maternal personality though so it worked well for me to be in a family that did not worry about that a suggestion i would make is to be sure that your first placement is not a child with attachment disorder you might decide to take a child with this diagnosis someday but i would not suggest it for your first placement or while your children are so young because this is one of the most challenging and potentially dangerous diagnoses for the families to deal with when they are caring for a child also think about what you think you can and cannot handle can you handle working with the birth parent and trying to see things from their side can you handle a child going back to their birth parents before you think the birth parents are really ready to have them back can you handle misdirected anger can you handle a child who does not love you as much as you love them can you handle a fire starter a bed wetter a child who hurts animals if not you need to be upfront about all of this when you are working on getting your foster care license there are lots of kids to whom none of those things will apply but unless you say otherwise workers tend to assume you will accept the difficult cases Transsexuality Adoption Breastfeeding Child abuse Autism Abortion debate Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Transactional analysis Social work Divorce Postpartum depression Autism rights movement Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hikikomori Reactive attachment disorder Controversies in autism Dissociative identity disorder Prenatal diagnosis Friends Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anorexia nervosa Fathers' rights Parenting Polyamory Anger management Unemployment Taxi Driver Grief Jon Secada Foster care About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Childlove movement The Giver Calvin and Hobbes Spanking Hypoglycemia Charles Darwin's illness Anxiety Surveillance Gender identity disorder Melanie Wilkes Dead Like Me Bipolar disorder Cephalic disorder Terri Schiavo Down syndrome Family name Asperger syndrome Evil Epilepsy The Fairly OddParents Narcissism Hamster Milton H.
