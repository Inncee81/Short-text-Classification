can anyone tell me when to get my babys ears pierced she is weeks old thanx i dont want to get them done to soon i thank you for answering assuming you are an american it is generally best to wait until they get st immunizations sp shots done i had my first girl done at mos did myself w a 'kit' never had a problem my nd lil girl i had done at mall after her wk check up shots she was fine w them until about age two kept taking them out i worried they would close i needed the screw on backs and couldn't find them anywhere in a new town however she is now and i tried to put earrings in for a special occassion and they went right in no prob so her holes are there for life now i think the younger the better cos they bearly cry but it is similar to circumcision an individual choice some are religious about not doing it at all and some relgions do days after birth however removing a shmuck aka foreskin is much more painfull than piercing a baby girls ears good luck i think lil girls are adorable with them Earring Foreskin Penis Breastfeeding Medical analysis of circumcision Body piercing Lil' Mo Friends Circumcision Body modification Comanche Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Baby (rapper) Missy Elliott Piccolo Junior Saga Condom Atomic Kitten EastEnders Gia Carangi Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Inside Humphrey Bogart Hip hop collaborations Pitaten Abortion debate Hepatitis C Kodocha Blood (computer game) Female genital cutting Obstetrics Brit milah Gospel of Thomas Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ja Rule Infant Kurt Cobain Foreskin restoration Lil Wayne Mary, the mother of Jesus Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Scott Storch Religious conversion Incarnations of Immortality What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
