seven year old three year old two year olds i am babysitting for these kids tonight while their parents go to a movie and am looking for things to do i am bringing colors and blank paper but wondering what else i am almost ideas maybe have them help you bake something like cookies bring some dvds i don't think the colors and paper will last them long their attention spans will be shorter than that if you know any card or magic tricks they'll love that bring special snacks like popsicles or pudding to reward them but don't give it to them right away besides that you could always try some board games or hide and seek if all else fails they probably just want to watch some tv except the two year olds probably too young to just plop them in front of a screen good luck The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Yu-Gi-Oh!
