help my yr old son is having elimination problems he wet's and soils himself often in the daytime and i do not know why he does this i have had talks with him but that has not worked i have taken him to the doctor and we figured out that he apparently holds it as long as possibble and has little accidents because of this but it still happens i have taken him to my therapist and she says he shows no signs of abuse that he seems psychologicaly fine he will be in months and i am embaressed that this continues to happen it is also expensive i have to buy him new underwear all the time because it is just too soiled to wash my therapist suggested that i make him wash them in a bucket as well as washing himself off in the shower this has been a horribble ordeal for me and him he makes an awfol mess trying to clean himself up so i usually step in to help i am absolutley sick of this does anybody have any ideas why he's doing this and ideas to deal with it please help this is complex to fix and takes much parental involvment as a infant and toddler was he constipated often did he have very solid bowel movments familiarize yourself with the term nasal fatigue older children who still soil themselves suffer from it your going to have to set times during the day that he must sit on the toilet and go the best time is after a meal because chewing and swollowing kick starts the digestive tract while you are in this set potty time mode you must alter his diet feed him things that will make it easier for him to go peas corn beans fruit veggies etc stay away from starches or anything white pasta alfredo sauces bread tortillas you may also want to add a childrens laxitive for a period of time but only after consulting your pediatrician as for the urination you must go back to basic potty training ask him every minutes if he has to go make him try to go at least every hour if he has a night time problem with soiling as well as daytime you must set your alarm drag him out of bed and make him try to go i believe if you stick to this for a month solid you and he will be rid of your problem it's alot of effort and trial and error but it pays off a child i cared for had this problem and working this plan his mother and i were able to fix it remember be patient with him this more than likely stems from sub concisous memories of painful bowel movements and or urination in his early years i wish you the best of luck and if you have any questions or need advice feel free to e mail me at isisrocca yahoo com Fecal incontinence Hypoglycemia Coeliac disease Crohn's disease Japanese toilet Folic acid Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Housebreaking Diaper Hamster Milton H.
