need ideas on how to wean month old twins off of their night time bottles we have tried many things already sippy cups with milk before laying down going to bed with a toy or blanket mixing water with the milk etc please help us they haven't used pacifiers since they were months old but we can't break the bottle habit at bedtime and naptime we recently went through a spell with my mth old daughter where she was waking in the middle of the night asking for chocolate milk and getting it from her daddy when this was just once a night it was sorta acceptable but it soon became two or even three times a night which was far from ok i eventually convinced my husband that we would have to stop as she didnt need it although she really wanted it and it was causing all of us to miss out on our precious sleep so we went cold turkey on her and the first few nights were very difficult we could just tell her no she would get breakfast in the morning and she would have to wait she cried for probably half an hour the first night then min the second less than the third and for the past few weeks she either has slept through or has come in to see us in our room pretty quietly and goes back to her own bed and to sleep without any problems at all i think she just wants to reassure herself that we are in fact still there in the room next to her i dont know if this would work it sounds like you've tried the gradual approaches and they havent worked can you stand to let them cry for a little while i really hate to hear my daughter cry but i realise at this age there are some things she shouldnt get no matter how much she begs for it my daughter does have a favorite stuffed animal that she sleeps with which really helps her to soothe herself i would probably keep trying to get your twins to get attached to something besides a bottle like a stuffed animal so they can cuddle with it while they drift off good luck Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insomnia Breastfeeding The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mattress Breakfast Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sleep The Shining (film) Sin City The Star Wars Holiday Special Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Big Brother UK series 6 Apollo 8 Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Romulus and Remus Milton H.
