potty training question my daughter has been potty training for about a month but just the last few days we have done somthing that is working great we are keeping her in panties all day long in and out of the house i keep taking her potty and sometimes she tells me she has to go but not often i think if i had a good month with her doing this she will be set but she is suppose to start preschool in two weeks the class she is in don't really potty train but they said they will try and work something out find out more tomorrow i think if they put her in the next class which i doubt they will do they will potty train her but if they keep her in the class she is suppose to be in they won't really make a point to go out of their way for her which they are saying they will try to do if i put her in preschool i will probably work evenings so i will potty train her in the morning afternoon preschool for hours days a week and daddy in the evening my question do you think she should start preschool in two weeks or give her that month and start her next semester or maybe earlier if they have an opening the days she is not in preschool i will be home with her all day my daughter is months and her class does not potty train the class the potty trains is months old but i have already started earlier and doing great annie i have always been big on not changing too many things at once and for some reason that slipped my mind i am almost sure we will wait even though we wasted some money i think what is best for her is more important thanks a bunch everyone don't give her too many things to handle at once some children don't take to preschool right away so the potty training will add to her anxiety i'd potty train her first then put her in preschool next semester when she feels she's a 'big' girl you sound really sensible are putting your daughter's interest first which is great for everyone Social rule Dog training Education in the People's Republic of China Sydney Riot of 1879 Education in Germany Education in the United States Housebreaking The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Toilet humour Kindergarten Jon Secada Good Morning, Vietnam Slow Train Coming Soap opera Ben Johnson (athlete) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Fairly OddParents USS Yorktown (CV-10) Time Out of Mind Dorama EastEnders The Sims Charles Peace Jennifer Lopez James Hanratty USS Waters (DD-115) Avenue Q Friends Blonde on Blonde Full House USS Tunny (SS-282) Moe Berg Extreme Programming AFI 100 Years series 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story About a Boy Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Chemical Brothers The Critic Ravi Shastri Wheel of Fortune USS Ammen (DD-527) Rugrats The Citadel (Military College) Ocean's Twelve Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Elimination communication Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Craps Recess (TV series) Ron and Fez David Hume Sant Thakar Singh The Ashlee Simpson Show The nature of God in Western theology USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Milton H.
