how do i i babesit mi yr old cuz who luves spider man how do i get him go da uze da potty first off he is only two years old second of all you are the babysitter you are not the parent have you consulted with his parents about potty training their child or did you just decide that you were tired of changing diapers if the parents are wanting to potty train him and he seems to show interest in using the toilet then he may be ready maybe you could get some spider man under ware when i trained my boys i took them to the toilet every hour and every time they would start holding themselves use positive reinforcement every time he goes make a great big deal and make him feel like a big boy i wouldn't buy him stuff because then he will think that every time he goes to the bathroom he will be rewarded don't punish him for having an accident he is still learning would you want to wear under ware if every time you peed you pants you got in trouble i suggest using the real toilet so that it isn't so messy if he is to short to stand up it may be easier to sit him down in case he has to do a doo in the future if you are going to ask a serious question please spell correctly i know you must be much smarter than that Toilet humour Infantilism Toilet training Fecal incontinence Kimberly-Clark Corporation Toilet Married... with Children SpongeBob SquarePants Urination Parenting Diaper Humphrey Bogart Urinary incontinence Menstrual cup Feral child Elimination communication Future-Drama Shaggy dog story Jackass: The Movie Scooby-Doo Timmy Turner The Fairly OddParents Rugrats Milton H.
