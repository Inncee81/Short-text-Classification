help please my yr old doesn't listen to me i ask her to do something and she tells me no or if i tell her no then she calls me a bad name i have similar issues with my four year old daughter though she doesn't call me bad names the main thing that i have found to work is consistency no matter what type of punishment you decide on stick with it if you only enforce things half ass then she will always test you i send my daughter to her bedroom for time out since she hates to be alone and we have had great results now when she acts out i give her one warning then she's off to her room no messing around try to use a punishment that would suit your daughter for example if she loves to play at the park tell her she cannot go to the park for the day s hope this helps Great Teacher Onizuka Le Malade imaginaire Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an True Crime: Streets of LA Pitaten The Death Gate Cycle Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Phoebe Halliwell Theory of conduct Friends Daredevil EastEnders Kodocha Poker jargon Pip (South Park episode) Shaggy dog story Incarnations of Immortality Jumpstart 3rd Grade Theodicy Venom (comics) Oh My Goddess!
