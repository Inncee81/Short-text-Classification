what would happen if you isolate toddlers from parents last night my yr nephew struck his cousin for attention it was a publicity stunt that failed and toddlers were sent running and crying everyone was watching david blane do tricks on tv leaving the toddlers neglected by their parents and the teenaged and pre teen cousins could only watch as trouble unfolded my nephew ima teen struck ferious blows with giggles and smiles directed toward us at another or yr old toddler making her cry and then the parents came and said bad these parents dont know any severe punishments but saying bad is enough to hurt a spoiled brat so if toddlers were put in a place where no parents could see them where no feel of neglect could ever be felt because its not possible without parents what would the toddlers do ive seen my nephew make messes and throw things around for attention sometimes toddlers trying to understand grown ups cause too much trouble try to answer the main question by something like a thought experime if i sound inconsiderate or mean or unthoughtful or neglectful its just because im curious all i could imagine happening is that the toddlers would become philosophical in nature and try to solve problems and answer questions of their own mysteries children need love without it they become needy and struggle with relationships when they are older kids that are hit hit kids that are yelled at yell toddlers do things to find out what will happen if he hits another child and is laughed at and not told its bad he will continue to do it if he is smacked for smacking someone he will continue to smack people the cries of a child when they are hit by another child arent as significant to the child that hit them becasue they havent yet developed a sense of empathy and therefore dont realsie i hurt them this is learned it needs to be explained to them until they develop further so saying bad isnt as good as saying look what you have done that is very naughty you hurt hurt her him how do you think it makes him her feel and take somethign away that they want eg no more playing left to there own devcies understanding such things at this age particularly would be impossible and learning it wouldtake an extended amount of time give them attentio for being good and they will try to be good dont give attention for being bad or they will continue to be bad Social rule Theory of conduct Narcissism Autism EastEnders Spanking Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Flintstones Friends Teen Girl Squad Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Transactional analysis Pitaten Simone Weil Piccolo Junior Saga Abortion debate Goodness and value theory Jon Secada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Marshall Mathers LP Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Mojave people Infantilism Incarnations of Immortality Futurama (TV series - season 5) Theodicy Justification (theology) Silent Night, Deadly Night The Lovely Bones About a Boy The Sims 2 Supernatural Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Current teachings of Prem Rawat Columbine High School massacre 2000 Australian Grand Prix Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Muslim ibn Aqeel Philosophy of language Rugrats Boston Public Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Nicomachean Ethics W.I.T.C.H.
