naughty year old who just seems to cry all the time help my year old son just seems to be so naughty these days and we really don't know what to do with him or what is wrong with him as a two year old and a three year old he was as good as gold but just recently he has started trying it on with us all the time he goes to nursery and is really well behaved there and if he is at friends or relatives he is reaaly good there too some days it feels like he cries for me from the minute he gets up til the minute he goes to bed i don't know what's wrong he has every thing he ever asks for it is getting me and my husband down and my other son who is nearly two any advice thanks for al your comments so far i don't think there has been any changes at home to trigger this change in him so i don't think that is the answer i do need to stay calmer with him when he acts up as it seems some days i do nothing but shout back at him as its becoming harder and harder to deal with the constant tantrums and crying i don't mean that he cries for me because i am not with him i just mean he cries alot when he is with me but not when he is with other people i get upset as i just think its me that is making him unhappy yet i love both of them so much feels like the bad times outweigh the good times these days four year olds love to push the limits with there parents so whatever you do do not give in to his demands if he spends a lot of time daycare nursery then he might just be really used to a schedule do you still have a schedule when you are at home he is probably used to activities throughout the day and a routine so he might just be getting bored too shower him with extra attention it sounds like he might just be trying to get it but at the same time don't let him break the rules hope this helps Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Sydney Riot of 1879 Kodocha The Beatles discography Friends Day care Avenue Q Oasis (band) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Ashlee Simpson Show Internet troll Utilitarianism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Britain The Apprentice 2 Muslim ibn Aqeel Zhao Yun Kindergarten Babe Ruth The Emancipation of Mimi Poker jargon The Catcher in the Rye One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Cindy Sheehan God Emperor of Dune Phoebe Buffay's songs Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Year of the Spider Billboard Hot 100 Silent Night, Deadly Night Piccolo Junior Saga Mina Mongoose Transactional analysis Iggy Pop The Isley Brothers Miss Saigon Hey Jude The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jam (TV series) About a Boy Laura Schlessinger Fancy Crane My Parents are Aliens Milton H.
