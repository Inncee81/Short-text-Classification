how often do your kids change interests i am enjoying watching my daughter grow into her own individual self she is almost years old and i can't help but wonder what kinds of things will interest her later on in life right now her favorite things are babies animals and music which these have been her favorites pretty much since she was born she will either be a caregiver a vet or a singer when she grows up lol just kidding of course her interests can easily change as she gets older i'm wondering just how often those interests will change and how drastically lol right after we spend alot of money on one of their interests they decide they don't want to do it anymore Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
