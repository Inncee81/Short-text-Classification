toddler with chipped tooth my month old little boy has chipped his tooth is a chipped tooth painful he doesn't act like it bothers him i'm thinking of taking him to a dentist incase it can cause the tooth to go bad early i've got another question on here too about dry skin should've put them together my son at yrs old was running around a relatives house and put big chips on his top front teeth almost to the point of breaking them both right in so naturally i took him to a dentist well this dentist's solution was to knock him out and pull them both in about months time when they could give me an appointment to do it i was also told to put him on a soft foods only diet for that time hence we proceeded to a different dentist the nd dentist told us to just leave him be if they aren't bothering him at he just lost the nd one since that first day he never had any problems with them though he is a big brushing fanatic every hour if i was to let him even with the teeth like that he was still able to eat even corn on the cob w o a problem while it may cause the tooth to go bad early it did for both of my son's but by that point the dentist said eh they will fall out with in a year don't bother with the cost most likely unless it is really painful a good dentist won't jump to take it out or fill it no point really in doing major work on a tooth that will be gone in years at most if he starts exhibiting signs of pain i would take him immediately but until then i wouldn't have it as a major major concern for him Tooth Dentistry Dental caries Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Dentist Fancy rat Fecal incontinence Dental brace Domestic rabbit Equine conformation Procrastination Kodocha Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Knots Landing The Fairly OddParents Theory of conduct Mouth ulcer Pittsburgh Steelers Glen Jacobs Halitosis Wisdom teeth Guinea pig 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tooth enamel Medical prescription Satchel Paige Craps Cruising (maritime) Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Drill bit FoxTrot About a Boy Hun-Apu Shaggy dog story Chris Benoit Goodness and value theory Textile manufacturing Extreme Programming Elephant Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Humphrey Bogart Indianapolis 500 Dog Kurt Angle Vernon Schillinger Hal Trosky Carpal tunnel syndrome Garfield Hamster Theodicy Breastfeeding Dog training Happy Tree Friends Teen Girl Squad Recess (TV series) Comanche The Ashlee Simpson Show Escape from New York 1986 National League Championship Series Punisher Clomipramine Big Brother (USA TV series) Diving Norway national football team Dentures Shark Motorola 68000 Dualism (philosophy of mind) New England Patriots Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Russian joke Nine Inch Nails Mark Calaway Adjustable gastric band CPU design Dental fillings The Amazing Race Eddie Guerrero Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pyramid (game show) Maize Plame affair Blood on the Tracks Babe Ruth The Amber Spyglass Oral hygiene Wyatt Earp Root canal Wheel of Fortune Liam Gallagher Cindy Sheehan The Karate Kid, Part III 2005 English cricket season Rocko's Modern Life Michael Savage (commentator) Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Miss Saigon
