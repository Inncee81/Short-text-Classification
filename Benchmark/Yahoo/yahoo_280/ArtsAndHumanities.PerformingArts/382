violin help i have been playing the violin for years and after the second year i keep popping my wristes and my shoulder out of socket and when i pratice my chain really starts to hurt i went to a profession store made just for stringed instroments and they gave me a new chin and shoulder rest do you have any tips i am very greatful for any help the right chin rest and shoulder rest do make a world of difference if those haven't fixed the problem then you need to examine your technique do you have a teacher if the answer is no then get one immediately before you cause long term problems and physical damage to yourself if you feel pain while you are playing other than callouses toughening up then you are doing something wrong and you should stop and rest if you do have a teacher then have you discussed these problems with him her it sounds to me like you aren't holding the instrument correctly there should be absolutely no tension whatsoever when you hold and play the instrument correctly i know it's easier said then done if you do have a teacher and they can't seem to find the problem or help you fix it then i recommend finding another teacher or at least take a few lessons from someone else to see if they can help you should take this seriously playing with improper technique for long periods of time can cause permanent damage i know people who have been forced to end lucrative professional careers because they didn't catch things until too late good luck Violin Tai Chi Chuan Harp Diving Bass guitar Professional wrestling holds Cello Viola Boxing Shaggy dog story Timpani Theory of conduct Fast bowling Social rule Aerial (dance move) Floppy disk Vibrato Debugging Weight training Alexander Technique Goodness and value theory Carpal tunnel syndrome Saxophone Spanking Orchestra Golf Fecal incontinence Music lesson Aikido Embouchure Abortion debate Hurdy gurdy 1957 World Series Halting problem Billiards Archery Bow (music) Guqin Equine conformation Trumpet Professional wrestling attacks Glossary of climbing terms Frank Zappa Authentic performance Current teachings of Prem Rawat Clarinet Romantic music Scientology beliefs and practices Menstrual cup Infantilism Volleyball Bow (weapon) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Repetitive strain injury Sergei Prokofiev Music Earring String instrument Brian Close Teacher Philosophical skepticism Theodicy Breastfeeding Procrastination Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pet Sounds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Viol Bubble Bobble Pitch (music) John Cage Professional wrestling throws Frogman Asperger syndrome Bondage (BDSM) Prostate cancer Charles Ives Education in the United States Ethics Operation Market Garden Contredanse Guitar Piccolo Junior Saga GunZ The Duel Photography The nature of God in Western theology Aesthetic Realism Sonata (music) Jon Secada Socrates Piano Strike (attack) The Yardbirds Dualism (philosophy of mind) Stuttering A Course In Miracles Kodocha Ice hockey
