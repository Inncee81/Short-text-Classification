broadway i have always dreamed about being on broadway when i go to see shows in nyc i get chills that cover my body i watch in awe of the hardwork talent and energy that the stage evokes and portrays for the audience i not only enjoy watching broadway shows but also i like to perform in local shows i am a grand fan of show tunes and hopefully one day i will be able to sing some of these songs with the most talented people in nyc broadway performers but as much as i love theater the stage productions performing i do not want fame strongly dislike competition so i would not want to go and audition in the city for commercials and such my questions are how can i make it to broadway without fame if anyone out there has ever performed on broadway what advice and experience can you share with me how can i achieve my dream and still remain a normal person how can i work my way up to becoming worthy of the broadway stage what else can you share with me about broadway thanks i would not say that i hate competition but i fear it i am young and still confused about what to pursue and how to go about it all i know is i love theater does anyone who has ever been on broadway have any stories and or advice to share with me you don't necessarily need fame to get to broadway but you need talent you have to be passionate you have love what you're doing and you have to live for competition if you don't like the competition don't do it you'll never make an audition if you can't handle the competition if you don't have fame you're going to need experience start off broadway first and if you can make it there you can make it on the great white way a wise producer once told me that all of the talent was off broadway anyway when you feel that you are ready to jump on a broadway stage i know you probably feel like you can now but just humor me go to open casting calls they use these for major productions 'wicked' had theirs in chicago in late may 'rent' advertises theirs on playbill com i'm sure you can find more on sites like broadwayworld com and playbill com too about the equity card you don't need that either it's like actormyk said if you attain a job in an equity run theatre aka broadway or with an equity run company you automatically become equity so long as you hold an equity job and equity deems you 'worthy' of attaining the card and or you build up point towards the card basically land a spot in the theatre through an open audition and you become equity if that's wrong i know from experience that it's not far off and i was talking with some other actors who were trying desperately to explain it to me in theatrical terms that i understood but we were speaking two completely different languages and what one of us said the other one just stared smiled and nodded the downside to not being equity and going to an audition you have to wait and wait and wait until all of the members of equity have auditioned before you can go and actually show the auditioners maybe not a word but the word i use what you've got check out the actor's equity web site for more on that it's very helpful and once you become equity they post equity auditions on the site you want to know how to still be normal that's not tough to answer you're still you no matter what you do and you have to remember where you came from and who you really are i have a great family who when i forget myself and get a diva complex kick me back in gear until i feel about two inches tall and they make me build myself up again you probably have people like that in your life who would be more than willing to tell you that you have forgotten yourself and your place oh and broadway does not mean fame in this day in age you're a normal person to everyone even after they've seen your show there are a few die hard fans who only know broadway forget the movies these people do not go to the movie theater 'theatre' is spelled 'theatre and if it is not it is spelled incorrectly and ten dollars to watch a bunch of people on a flat screen is so un cool that they'd rather shell out the dough who get star struck and forget themselves and get giddy in the presence of their favorite broadway actor or actress most people are pretty much ignorant in the world of broadway and just sort of shun all of the stagedoorers again not a word unless you are are me i've been walking down the street on my off days and seen the fans lining up outside of the theatres after a matin e show or even after the late night show and heard star struck tourists asking excitedly why there's a crowd if i answer them they usually look disappointed say 'that entire crowd is waiting for that ' and roll their eyes before walking away makes you kind of angry really my best advice is go for it if you persevere you can do anything just because you have to wait tables to pay the rent or you get told by someone that you would have to lose eight sizes before they would even think of casting you or you think you did horribly at an audition doesn't mean you have to quit you might even find something you like more than acting while you are trying to get to where you want to be
