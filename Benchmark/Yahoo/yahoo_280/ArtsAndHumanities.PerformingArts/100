buying a cello i am going to start to learn the cello and i would like to now what price they run at and what brand i should get and anything else i need to know cellos can be found that cost anywhere between and millon you'll almost certainly not find anything of any quality under though and if you can afford it you'd probably want something even better than that but price alone is not a good indicator of quality you need to try a bunch and find one that feels good to you however as an absolute beginner you're not going to have a feel for what you like and don't like in an instrument therefore you must find a reputable teacher right away and meet with him her to discuss what to look for in an instrument where to look in your area etc he she can also help you figure out what a good amount to spend on a first instrument based on how serious you are about learning oh and every instrument is different so brand often means very little in terms of cello only fairly low end instruments will have brand names as they are made in factories higher quality ones are identified by luthier the person who made the instrument Cello Violin Gross domestic product Goodness and value theory Trademark Harp Bond Sonata (music) Inflation Commodity Stradivarius FairTax Amateur astronomy Labor theory of value Clarinet Paintball Supply and demand ATI Technologies Yo-Yo Ma Tesco Microeconomics Monetary policy No Child Left Behind Act Double bass Authentic performance Education in the People's Republic of China Cigar Mutual fund Value Price discrimination Real estate bubble String instrument Predatory lending PRS Guitars Luthier Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Brand Binoculars Summa Theologiae Bow (music) Sergei Prokofiev Offshoring Fender Mario Davidovsky Ford Motor Company Information Services Procurement Library PLATO Just In Time Education in the United States Viola Illegal drug trade CPU design Biodiesel AvtoVAZ Arbitrage Antonio Stradivari Capitalism Aikido Deflation (economics) Tax Musical works of Mozart Mattress Technical analysis Shit Progressive tax Airline Hyperinflation RuneScape economy Externality Timpani Publicly funded medicine Aldi Mortgage Interest Stars!
