audition help i play clarinet in a symphony and auditions for seats are coming up for those who do not know what im talking about i mean seats as in a competition for the first seat as in whos the best i have really strict parents and they really want me to get first seat i agree with them i really have no reason not to get first my parents have bought me the best quality instrument but still im so frustrated i noticed that recently ive kinda fallen out of clarinet i dont feel the same feeling when i play anymore i feel like ive lost a part of me i feel so ashamed cause i know i shouldnt feel this way the audition peice is not very hard at first but if u analyze it closely there r some small things that make a big difference and its so hard to llearn everytime i go over it it seems like im not improving no i cant quit now i trie to listen to other clarinet players in hopes that it will inspire me but it just makes me feel pathetic what can i do hard work is never wasted you've posed two questions one is how to win that audition and the other is what to do about feeling uninspired as for the first part play clean and get to the pretty notes charlie parker find some way to put your own stamp on the music and express yourself listen to recordings of the piece so you can get some more ideas and that will set you apart from the rest record yourself periodically and you will hear the improvement as for the second part you should try going to a different teacher or taking a masterclass or even just listening to some really awesome music that inspires you i'm a classical player but nothing inspires me more than listening to some burning jazz i was in the rd year of my music degree when i felt like you feel and i went to a week long flute camp that gave me enough inspiration to continue through to the end of my year degree just because it was a different teacher with a contagious passion for music Clarinet Sonata (music) Charles Ives Big band Bass clarinet Saxophone Music Authentic performance Vibrato Music genre Philip Glass Charles Mingus 20th century classical music Jazz Timpani Sampling (music) Bassoon Past teachings of Prem Rawat Olivier Messiaen Poker jargon Double bass Violin Steve Reich Blues King Crimson Marching band Sergei Prokofiev Blood on the Tracks Flute Trombone Arnold Schoenberg Black Sabbath European classical music Transposing instrument Concert band Mario Davidovsky Journey (band) Igor Stravinsky Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Jethro Tull (band) Chick Corea Video game music Musical works of Mozart Roxette Miles Davis Therion (band) Classical music era Spice Girls Jon Secada Charlie Parker Recorder John Cage Captain Beefheart March (music) Musical ensemble Henry Cow Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Elliott Carter Concerto Nashville Skyline Joseph Haydn Henry Cowell Lil Hardin Armstrong Oboe Louis Andriessen The Selmer Company Harmonic series (music) Microeconomics Social rule Piano trio Bitches Brew Popular music Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Smiths Symphony No. 10 (Mahler) Pet Sounds New York Knicks Highway 61 Revisited Alex Ferguson Johannes Brahms Definition of music Choir I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Heitor Villa-Lobos Joy Division (band) Parsifal W.
