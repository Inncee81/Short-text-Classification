best alto saxophone reeds i've been playing sax for years but i'm ready to try some new reeds i am currently using hemkes thanks i play classical it really depends on what mouthpiece ligature set up you have a good general rule to go by is if you use a french mouthpiece then use french reeds and if you use an american mouthpiece use american reeds i'm using the rico jazz select reeds at the moment and i find them very good but i only really play jazz when i'm playing classical however i like to use the vandoran traditional reeds trial and error is the only way you'll find the best reeds for you but it's worth it good luck Saxophone Harmonica Tenor saxophone Baritone saxophone Clarinet Big band Sarrusophone Embouchure Oboe Mouthpiece Rahsaan Roland Kirk Bassoon Reed (music) Trombone Trumpet Woodwind instrument John Coltrane Jazz Adolphe Sax Ornette Coleman Sonny Rollins Horn (instrument) Charlie Parker Alto horn Electronic organ Harmonic series (music) Mike Watt Michael Brecker Tin whistle Bagpipes Miles Davis Bass saxophone Joe Locke Lou Reed Illinois Jacquet King Crimson Blues Music genre Eddie Harris Flute Charles Lloyd Anthony Braxton The Selmer Company Vibrato Harmonium Bitches Brew Albert Ayler Old-time music Music of Brittany Flugelhorn Chet Atkins Ra (board game) Normal distribution Archie Shepp Latin alphabet United States House of Representatives Mahjong Cor anglais Oliver Nelson McCoy Tyner Keith Jarrett Tim Hodgkinson Sonny Stitt Charlie Haden Pet Sounds Pipe organ James Morrison (musician) Expert system Pee Wee Russell Herbie Hancock Decision making Grover Washington Jr. Organ (music) Bass clarinet Eric Dolphy NBA Finals Dave Brubeck Extended technique Bebop Benny Carter Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band Mister Fantastic Julian Cannonball Adderley Musical instrument classification Instrumental rock Marching band Coleman Hawkins Transposing instrument New York Knicks Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1 Music of Barbados David Sanborn John Zorn Grammy Awards of 1999 Latin America Rudy Pompilli International Phonetic Alphabet Sonny Criss Kansas City Chiefs Wardell Gray
