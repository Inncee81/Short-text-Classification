oboe or clarinet or flute which to learn i would like to learn a new instrument and am unsure which would be best i know that i can get a tune out of oboe and clarinet but do like the sound of a flute which i have not tried i know how to read music and will teach myself as far as possible but would like this as a new hobby as i reach mid life crisis looking for advice from experinced musicians or those who can offer some advice as much as i'm sure you're enjoying reading about other people's experiences with the instrument it's not really good advice if you can play the clarinet then you don't really need to work on getting the reed to vibrate which is frustrating to most first time players with the flute however you could spend your first few hours playing with your mouth and never make a sound the oboe can take a very very long time to get a good sound out of and i wouldn't suggest making that your first instrument i'm sure you already know what you want to play just do what sounds best to you Clarinet Reed (music) Oboe Transposing instrument Flute Embouchure Pet Sounds Harmonic series (music) Woodwind instrument Orchestra Concert band Musical instrument classification Mario Davidovsky Music of Brittany George Crumb Marching band Bassoon Big band Authentic performance Recorder Heitor Villa-Lobos Musical works of Mozart Timbre Bagpipes Vibrato Multiphonic Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias Bass clarinet Louis Andriessen Johann Sebastian Bach Piano trio Rahsaan Roland Kirk Trombone Olivier Messiaen Philip Glass Musical ensemble Steve Reich Sergei Prokofiev Harmonica Brian Jones (musician) Native American music Giacinto Scelsi King Crimson Music history of the United States during the colonial era Resonance Key (music) Harmonium Original Dixieland Jass Band Henry Cow Tin whistle Synthesizer Mute (music) Sun Ra Music of the Republic of Macedonia Violin Music of immigrant communities in the United States Farfisa Western concert flute Baritone saxophone Music of Ireland C.G.
