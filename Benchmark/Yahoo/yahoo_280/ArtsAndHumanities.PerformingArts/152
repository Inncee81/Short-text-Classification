how do i take in my shirt it's too wide and it's slim fit already i want to taylor it to fit me better how does this fit into performing arts sewing maybe how could it be slim fit already i'm confused well if i think i understand you the sides have to be taken in you do that by turning the shirt inside out and pinning the shirt and then try it on to see how it now fits if it's still not right move the pins in a little more until it fits the way you want it to you didn't say if it had sleeves or not because that would have to be considered when taking it in you would have to go up the sleeve and around but do this all by pinning first and then sew when right hope you get this Sea Scouts (BSA) Professional wrestling holds Gurkha Contingent Sleeve valve Shirt Comanche United States Marine Corps Arsenal F.C.
