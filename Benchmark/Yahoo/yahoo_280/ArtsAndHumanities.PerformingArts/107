what is the best way to unstick a trombone tuning slide i recently picked up a used bundy student model trombone it is a simple slide trombone but the tuning slide is stuck i was wondering if there were any effective safe ways to unstick the tuning slide without having to take it in to a shop for repair spencer's idea is valid but get penetrating oil from dad's toolbox or the local hardware store you'll have to clean well when you're done your local repair shop has a tool for this purpose and if that tool works easily they may not even charge you to get it out as it would only take a couple seconds trying to get it out yourself could cause damage to soldered joints or braces and just isn't worth the risk if the letting penetrating oil work overnight idea doesn't work it's shop time if it's seriously stuck in there as would be with corrosion the repair tech will desolder the joints and remove them then he will knock the tubes that are stuck out using a mandrel and a hammer then he will strip the contacting surfaces polish them up and resolder all of those joints back together not your typical quick home repair Soldering Trombone Guitar Knife Solder Drill bit Seismic retrofit Screw Floppy disk Violin M16 (rifle) Bong Lathe Welding Brazing GLOCK Friction Manual transmission Tire Bass guitar Radio controlled car Johnny 5 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Woodworking Circuit design Internal ballistics Aerial (dance move) Operation Petticoat Manicure Computer Airsoft Naval mine Motor oil Motorcycle Hard disk Strap-on dildo Hand grenade Oral sex Extreme Programming Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Tesla coil Slide rule Autogyro Disc brake C programming language Earring STS-114 History of computing hardware Oscilloscope Volleyball Glossary of climbing terms Beretta 92F/FS Two-stroke cycle Curling Password Upholstery Second Battle of the Atlantic Heinkel He 112 HMS Ramillies (07) Windows XP Devil sticks Tattoo Electric guitar Big band Mach kernel Corrosion Marching band Firefighter Gasoline USS Vestal (AR-4) Tampon Electroshock gun Printed circuit board Winning Streak Gun safety USS S-38 (SS-143) Protoss Handloading Fossil fuel power plant Professional wrestling attacks Ammunition Guqin Nuclear power Piano Skateboarding trick Carbon dioxide Textile manufacturing Personal weapon Password cracking Table saw Compiler optimization Thermal power station USS Waters (DD-115) Ultraviolet Olduwan Bassoon Pinball
