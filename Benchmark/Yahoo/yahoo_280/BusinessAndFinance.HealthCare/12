possible to be an rn hi my son recently married a girl from the ukraine she said she is a registered nurse and her name is on the california list of rn's here is my question is it possible for this person to be spervisor or director of nursing without ever having taken an anatomy class she admits this because my daughter was taking a class and she couldn't answer any questions in my daughters book and also when i asked her what my son'd blook pressure was she stumbled a bit then said over my son and her have been together for less than a year and she is leaving her job to follow here to follow her boss who is moving to sacramento hours away my son will need to quit his job and move she refuses to work for anyone but this one person i always thought it was very difficult to pass the rn exam in california hours of testing etc she is currently working in a convelescent hospital any input on whether it is possible to be what she says she is would be helpful my concern is not them moving away as we are moving even further away in sept my concern is the marriage being built on dishonesty the straw that broke the camels back was the fact that in order to continue working in her industry she insisted on following her boss and the fact that this decision has to made and completed by the end of august seems like a a situation with no time think also they have been married months and they are already expecting none of it makes sense byw my son is the one who mentioned she should look for another job where they are currently located or stay with the new boss who is taking over the facility all nursing schools in this country would require anatomy to be passed in the first year of school and certainly any legitimate school in any other country would require this as well it is possible to purchase fraudulent phoney degrees on the internet and i am very concerned that she has done this or in some way is a pretender of being an r n it is possible that people with the same name would explain her name being on the california list of rns and she is pretending to be the real rn you could request a picture of the real nurse from the california state board of nursing or her employer could your son certainly does not have blood pressure of over or he would be unconscious certainly unable to walk that is the blood pressure of a newborn infant ask her some questions that any nurse should know like i gave blood last month and they told me that i was blood type d negative what is your blood type of course there are only type a b ab and o which can be either positive or negative you could ask her my friend donated a kidney to help a dying patient i would like to donate one of my livers who should l contact to do this we all have only one liver and usually two kidneys please follow through on this it is very dangerous to have fraudulent nurses in the health care delivery system at any level f Nurse Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Medicine National Kidney Foundation Singapore Breastfeeding Dialysis Pneumonia Stomach cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Theory of conduct Cytomegalovirus Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Cancer Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses GED The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pitaten Drug test Education in Portugal Childbirth Mental Health Act 1983 Stroke Transactional analysis Social rule EastEnders Triage Blood type Hikikomori Graduate school Folic acid St. Elmo's Fire (film) Health insurance Hypoglycemia Killian documents First aid Friends Urinary incontinence Tocopherol Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Diabetes mellitus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wal-Mart National Health Service Coming of Age (TNG episode) Ebola Terri Schiavo Traumatic brain injury Humphrey Bogart Juris Doctor Legal aspects of transsexualism Expert system Abortion debate T'Pol Kodocha Fight Club Neighbours Clinical depression Intelligent design movement Code: Lyoko Days of our Lives Nursing home General practitioner Sin City Plame affair Chiropractic Hogwarts subjects Driver's license One Tree Hill (TV series) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Medical prescription Publicly funded medicine Transsexuality Medicare (Canada) Nursing Terri Schiavo timeline Ranma __ characters Obstetrics Hip fracture Tuskegee Syphilis Study Consensus decision-making Strong Medicine Unemployment Hepatitis C Big Brother UK series 6 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Food and Drug Administration
