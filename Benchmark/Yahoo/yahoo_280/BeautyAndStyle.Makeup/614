origins halo effect anyone tried it i'm thinking about buying this product from origins and wondering what others think about it does is work for pale skin as far as enhancing the brow area and cheeks does it feel greeasy or look funny let me know thanks it looks exactly and works the same as benefit's high beam for origin's halo effect lasts longer and it has a nice scent it does not feel greasy at all and i prefer this highlighter over benefit's even though i'm a big fan of benefit use it on your high cheekbones nose a tiny dot on your forehead and chin for that nice looking glow try not to apply to much powder on top and preferably wear a translucent powder just to set if you use a heavy powder over it you will loose the effect you want to look fresh and glowy not cakey just a few helpul tips i hope you don't take them the wrong way good luck and i would definetely spend those halo is all worth it Cosmetics Halo 2 Galactic Civilizations Covenant Elite Marathon (computer game) Halo Drill bit Head Halo: Combat Evolved Tobacco The Covenant Physical characteristics of the Buddha Lightsaber Tattoo Shaving Light-emitting diode AFI 100 Years series Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Microeconomics Radiohead Brewery Social rule GunBound Tea Diamond Skiing Tai Chi Chuan Japanese tea ceremony Diving Roxette Upholstery Shaggy dog story Lightning Dry cleaning B-24 Liberator Gross domestic product Tiny Toon Adventures Haibane Renmei Avenue Q Cliff Richard Ringworld Care Bears Michael Jackson Universal Century Technology 2004-05 NHL lockout Dairy Noseband Dark elf First Battle of the Atlantic Aluminium Copyleft Terminal ballistics Methamphetamine Cat Explosive material Milk Cubic zirconia Clown Perfume Cathode ray tube Drowning M16 (rifle) Incandescent light bulb Bon Jovi Powder metallurgy Rosacea Singlish Rampancy Joke Rifle Firework Gaia Online 2000 Australian Grand Prix Krag-J__rgensen Dragon Booster Breastfeeding Jennifer Lopez Bulk vending Mouse (computing) Halo (megastructure) Externality Car handling One Piece minor characters Tocopherol The Who Sell Out Nine Inch Nails Paramount Pictures Gesture U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Leaf Paris Hilton Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Vitreous enamel Face Casting Poker jargon Saga (band) Elephant
