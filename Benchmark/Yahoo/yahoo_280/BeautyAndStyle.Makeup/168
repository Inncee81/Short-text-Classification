how can i make my eyes bigger i want my eyes to stand out from the crowd if that makes sense i'm saying intensely large eyes with the help with makeup can any one give me very direct steps i don't follow so easily on how to achieve great eyes even a picture provided for a guide so i know by looking if that makes sense thanks for anyone who takes time answering d anything that mixes shimmer black liner and mascara sounds good my friend has tiny eyes and hers look gorgeous w makeup and it is very apparant that she uses those so any guides on how to do it is great also any colour that is good my eyes are rich brown this is going to be long but ive included pictures so i hope that helps i also have brown eyes and i've experimented around with color to see which ones make them pop i've found that dark purples work the best when mixed with lighter colors in general lighter brighter colors make the area appear larger and darker colors create a shadow okay are you ready here we go heres a diagram that has labels that i will refer to in the steps http www temptalia com images eyeparts jpg one start with a light bright color in the brow highlight area and in the inside tear duct area this isnt labeled but if youre looking at the diagram its just left of the inner lid i like a shade like this http www marykay com color eyes viewall default aspx you wont really see the color just the brightness which will make the eyes look bigger two choose a slightly darker shade for the inner lid and middle of lid i like a little pink tone something like this http www marykay com color eyes viewall default aspx again this will make your eyes appear larger three this is where the shimmer comes in choose a dark purple color to apply to the outter lid and outter crease the purple will make your eye color pop and the shimmer will make it look bigger i'd choose something like this but with some shimmer http www marykay com color eyes viewall default aspx be careful when using shimmer because too much of it or the wrong kind can make it look very little girl ish go with more of a sparkle four choose a lighter shade to put in the above crease area this color can have shimmer too i'd pick something like this http www marykay com color eyes viewall default aspx for special occasions you can use the same color you used in step three but this might be too much for everyday five now its time for the eyeliner you can wear black just be careful that you dont use too much because this can look harsh too much dark color also makes the eye look smaller apply the liner to the outter lower lash line you can also smudge the liner into the upper lash line to make the lashes appear thicker but do this first before you apply any shadow six now for mascara apply two coats of very black mascara on the upper lashes and one coat to the lower lashes i hope this helps i know it works on my eyes so i hope it does good for you too good luck Color theory Color Dragon Booster Sunglasses Cosmetics Stereoscopy Light-emitting diode Extraterrestrial skies Diamond Fluorescent lamp Eye CIE 1931 color space Fast bowling Cascading Style Sheets JPEG The Contender (television series) Kylie Minogue Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wassily Kandinsky Wood Gas metal arc welding Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Jon Secada CPU cache Wallpaper group Diamond cut Color blindness Empire Burlesque Eye color Sega Saturn Grace Cossington Smith Social rule Saxophone Geology of the Moon Gramophone record Pysanka The Ashlee Simpson Show Bicycle lighting Yu-Gi-Oh!
