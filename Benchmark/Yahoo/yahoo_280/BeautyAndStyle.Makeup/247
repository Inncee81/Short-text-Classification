makeup tips for the nose hi i don't really like my nose so i was wondering if anyone knew any makeup tips i have a skinny bridge and the tip of my nose is very round i think it kind of looks like an upside down lollipop lol what can i do to make the tip of my nose skinnier thanks to all who answer i don't know if there is a way to make your nose look skinnier but you can try using a concealer of any brand and pressed powder if you make the edges of your nose look less shiny with the pressed powder it can result in a deeper look so the roundness of your nose won't be that noticeable and the concealer to cover up blemishes my best advice is to go to a make up store such as mac and ask them for advice they may be able to help you or better yet if you are eager to get an answer now go over to www covergirl com and make yourself an account they have real live agents ready to help you with whatever it is concerning make up hope this helps let me know if it did you can contact me on lrnchen yahoo ca Skateboarding trick Plame affair Skinny Puppy Diving Cosmetics Snowboard Violin Leaf Tobacco Ren and Stimpy Karl Rove Ammunition Internal ballistics Unidentified flying object Handloading Saruman Drill bit Jessica Lynch Terminal ballistics The Ashlee Simpson Show The Arsenal of Freedom (TNG episode) Stall (flight) Girls Aloud Gisele B__ndchen Knife Barack Obama Dum-dum Sherbet Roswell UFO incident B3ta Geology of the Moon First Battle of the Atlantic Escape from New York Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Domain Name System M16 (rifle) Stairway Opportunity rover Beetle in an Anthill Tattoo Spaceward, Ho!
