can anyone reccomend a facial cream that will control mega shine and when i say mega i mean it i'm and since i was i have had a horrible complexion i have very oily skin to the point where it's a full blown oil slick minutes after washing i have tried everything under the sun and nothing works i am lucky i don't have bad acne just the ocassional pimple or two but like i said my major concern is the shine i only wear powder since foundation doesnt work very well and after minutes of application the powder is virtually gone revealing the sine i currently use clinique's t zone oil control and it worked great for about a month but it seems my skin has grown used to it and it's not as effective i've tried just about everything at local drugstores but does anyone know of a good product similar to clinique that might be found at a high end department store such as origins estee lauder mac etc i have tried a similar product by mary kay once that worked maybe i will give that another shot thanks hi there i know how frustrating oil can be the best product i know of is pricy but soooo worth it it's by a line called fresh the lotion is called the umbrian clay lotion its totally oil free the umbrian clay absorbs oil and balances your skin you can also but the clay on its own and use it as a mask love it cheap makeup artist trick im not just saying this i work on set with hot lights and i swear by this to keep oil off my models get some milk of magnesiua sp from your drugstrore yes the stuff for going to the bathroom apply a thin layer and leave on for minutes rinse and apply makeup or leave a very thing layer on its amazing also make sure the powder your using doesnt have any mineral oil in it just because its powder does not mean its oil free and last get some oil blotting paper so you dont need to continue to pile powder on your pretty face Cosmetics Acne Milk Est__e Lauder Inc.
