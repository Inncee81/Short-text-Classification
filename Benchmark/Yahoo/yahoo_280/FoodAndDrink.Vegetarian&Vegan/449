vegetarian chicken noodle soup i know there is some but where can i find it or vegetairan soups the ''chicken''with tofu you know the simply asia soups are good but not exactly the same things where can i find the imitation chicken broth amy's no chicken noodle soup is really good a little expensive though i've seen it at whole foods stores and my local regular grocery store sells it as well with the other canned soup if you have time i also suggest trying to make it yourself it's not really hard and turns out just as good i use seitan instead of tofu though it's more chicken esque and holds together a little better i cook it in a pan with a little liquid smoke and other seasoning to make it even more realistic before putting it in the soup Japanese cuisine Chicken soup Cantonese cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Ramen Chinese cuisine Seitan Korean cuisine Russian cuisine Taiwanese cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Thailand Shanghai cuisine Barbecue Nabemono Stock (food) Minestrone German cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Campbell Soup Company Veganism Hakka cuisine Gumbo Cuisine of Vietnam Burger Cajun cuisine American Chinese cuisine Inventory Food Dim sum Chinatown Udon Cha chaan teng Buddhist cuisine Chili con carne Iron Chef Meat analogue Pizza Cuisine of Myanmar Egg (food) Jewish cuisine Value added Beef noodle soup Chinatown, Las Vegas Miso soup Soybean Breakfast Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of Laos Cheese Wok Chopsticks Cuisine of Cambodia Hot pot Pea soup Taboo food and drink Cookware and bakeware Cuisine of Austria Pasta Cuisine of the Southern United States Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Hainanese chicken rice Bak kut teh Dumpling Tomato Saimin Pancake Chaaru French cuisine Street food Curry Mayonnaise Vegetarianism MRE Fried chicken Shark fin soup Risotto Cuisine of Denmark Kosher foods Hell's Kitchen (television) Vitasoy Cuisine of Brazil Cantharellus Sauerkraut Laksa Portable stove Sausage Sushi Red Dwarf characters Miso Ph___ Burger King Canadian Chinese cuisine Tamale Fish and chips
