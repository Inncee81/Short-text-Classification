what is skinny b tch all about i keep seeing people reference it but i don't really know what it is does it discuss veganism as a diet or something thanks it's what made me go vegan so yes it's about being vegan it's intentions aren't really clear though if you just read the introduction of the book when i had picked it up i just wanted to buy a good diet book if i had known it was about being vegan i wouldn't have bought it it's a really good book and as someone else said it's very blunt making it easy to follow and interesting to read it doesn't only talk about being vegan it talks about food in general and has interesting facts about diet sodas and oils and other foods oh and the fda it also goes in to exercise and at the back it has a whole day by day diet plan that i think last three weeks it also has a nice section on vitamins and list every vitamin you need and where it can be obtained from i think it's a good book to have but not necessary if you're already a well informed vegan and know about everything you eat thats mainly what it does just informs you of what you put in your body and emphasizes to always read labels and things Dieting Vegetarianism Raw food diet Vitamin Vegetarian nutrition Hard-line Omega-3 fatty acid Food guide pyramid Dietary fiber Fecal incontinence Atkins Nutritional Approach Coronary heart disease Egg (food) Folic acid Cyanocobalamin The Catcher in the Rye Super Size Me Vitamin D Vitamin C Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ethical consumerism Nutrition Rickets Word of Wisdom Animal rights Anorexia nervosa Organic food Prostate cancer Wall Street Trans fat Binge eating disorder Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Acne Malnutrition Vegetarian cuisine Chocolate Cheese Fruitarianism Genetically modified food MyPyramid Coca-Cola Dietary supplement E number Grammatical mood Eating disorder Sugar substitute Scientology beliefs and practices Paleolithic diet Stomach cancer Chopsticks Soybean The Pet Sounds Sessions South Beach diet Food Humphrey Bogart Morgan Spurlock Ramen Obesity Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Adjustable gastric band Tooth Reservoir Dogs Social rule Kosher foods Natural Hygiene Breastfeeding Theodicy English grammar Sucralose Kender Domestic rabbit Donald Rumsfeld Garfield Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Punk ideology Gross domestic product Anne Rice Guinea pig Cat Hamster Time Out of Mind Buddhist cuisine Nicomachean Ethics Plame affair Shampoo Phytochemical Little Britain Garlic Life extension Surveillance Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diet soda Spanish verbs Food coloring Piccolo Junior Saga
