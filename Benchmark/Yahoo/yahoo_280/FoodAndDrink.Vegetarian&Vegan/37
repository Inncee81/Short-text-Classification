morningstar farms grillers meal starters what should i do with them i was thinking burritos with refried beans would that be good if you've had them before please tell me how you prepared them thanks these are the things that i guess are like ground beef i think they recommend using them in chili but i hate tomatoes bitter yes they are the same thing they used to be called crumblers but they changed it at least where i live i moved away to an area that wasn't vegetarian friendly and when i got back the name and packaging was changed thanks for the suggestion too they're great for tacos just cook them in a skillet and add the taco seasoning burritos refried beans corn and queso dip inside with your choice of veggies and sour cream on top and white lasagna dishes there are tons of recipes online just substitute the crumbles for whatever meat they suggest you can also use them for stuffed peppers i don't eat tomatoes either so i have plenty of recipes modified to avoid them here's the stuffed pepper recipe ingredients large green bell peppers tops sliced off and cleaned out and rinsed bag of the grillers clove garlic minced onion chopped cup cooked spanish rice without the tomatoes you can use white or brown rice if you prefer but i like the flavor myself jar queso dip or you can make your own if you prefer salt and pepper to taste cup shredded mexican cheese or cheddar if you prefer preparation preheat oven to degrees place peppers on a microwave safe dish with the sliced end on the plate cover well microwave on high for minutes place peppers with sliced end up in a baking dish the appropriate size to accomodate the peppers without them tipping over so a small square cake pan will usually work brown the grillers with the garlic and onion add the rice and salt and pepper stirring until well combined and heated through put this mixture in a bowl heat the queso sauce in the microwave then pour on half on top of the grillers mixture stir until well combined quickly fill each pepper with the mixture then top off with the rest of the queso you may not use all of it and add cheese to top cover and bake minutes uncover and bake an additional minutes or until cheese is melted and slightly browned you can also substitute other sauces for the queso i just happen to really like cheese and spicy foods i have a friend who prefers brown rice and italian dressing in hers it's up to you Cuisine of Vietnam Sushi Kraft Dinner In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of Thailand Cuisine of Cambodia Coffee Cookware and bakeware Cuisine of Greece Satay Cuisine of Africa Salad Chile pepper Kebab Russian cuisine Roman eating and drinking Tea Rice pudding Risotto Common bean Mayonnaise Vegetarianism Burrito Sauce Chicago-style pizza Quesadilla Chicken soup Gumbo Food Nachos Ice cream Cholent Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Dolma Chocolate Cooking Vinegar Gyros Kosher foods Cuisine of Puerto Rico Veganism Potato pancakes Nabemono Bacon Burger Meatball
