when a person declares themselves a 'vegetarian' a certain philosophy and behaviors seems to be expected from them so if you don't conform to what people think of as vegetarian behavior you get grief from both other vegetarians and meat eaters so i have decided i will no longer declare myself as a vegetarian it is getting to be too trendy anyway although i doubt my eating habits will change much i just don't like the expectations put on me from other people i don't like labels of any kind so any comments i know what you mean i know some veggies who walk around with some kind of holier than thou aura and their yoga mats just the same way some meat eaters act defensive and drive around with i love animals they're delicious bumper stickers to each his own i just feel better when meat is not in my diet period i don't say anything about it unless i'm invited to someones home for dinner Mojave people Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Hamburger Vegetarianism and religion Vegetarian cuisine Hindu Kashrut Lisa the Vegetarian Veganism Fasting Dieting Buddhist cuisine Cat Egg (food) Animal rights Christian Vegetarian Association Punk ideology Binge eating disorder Social psychology Food Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Meat Theory of conduct Happiness In-N-Out Burger Buddhism Animal Liberation Front Consciousness Unclean animals Peter Singer Salad Fingers Altruism MRE Sant Mat Ron Weasley Environmental vegetarianism Prem Rawat Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Taboo food and drink Didache Mahatma Gandhi Don Imus English grammar Economic vegetarianism Meat analogue Hot dog British cuisine Christian anarchism People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Abstraction (computer science) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Halaal Whaling French cuisine Simone Weil Goodness and value theory Social rule Sabbath Hinduism Burger King Bhagavad Gita Chili con carne Tiger German spelling reform of 1996 Slaughterhouse Korean cuisine Japanese tea ceremony YuYu Hakusho Bengali cuisine Sex and the City Korban Human nature Gender role Bread Vegetarian nutrition Meat Loaf Sangha Carnivore Jewish cuisine Food guide pyramid Soul Chinese cuisine Brahmanism U.S. presidential election, 2008 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religion Friends Tofu New Age Phoebe Buffay Patriotism Religious Society of Friends Evil Dog Milton H.
