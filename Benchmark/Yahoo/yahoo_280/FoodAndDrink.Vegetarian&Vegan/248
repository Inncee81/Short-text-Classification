healthy eating ok here's my daily eating schedual it is usually pretty regular please tell me how healthy it is oh yah i run a mile a couple times a week skateboard and usually climb a lot of trees smiles so i usually get a lot of excersise but i sprained my wrist and so the doctor said no more skateboarding or tree climbing anyway here you go one bowl of crispix cereal with organic milk a glass of oj potatoe chips blushes i guess it's a pre menstrul thing vegetarian lasagna a salad and some chocolate some chocolate at the movie what can i do better for your first meal of the day cereal isnt so bad but try to eat an orange or maybe an apple and feel free to toss some peanut butter on it with breakfast its important to eat lots of fruit and in the morning if you eat something with just a little fat in it like peanut butter your metabolism gets going faster also you need protein peanut butter has it instead of potato chips look for fruit ripples they're these awesome little chips made from apples with a bit of strawberry they're delicous and one little pouch is only calories they also count as a serving of fruit http www fruitripples com when you eat dinner hopefully you're starting with the salad again that will keep your metabolism going and you've put some veggies in there sliced red green yellow or orange peppers pepperoncinis cukes tomatoes etc mushrooms olives carrots etc the lasagna isnt bad but if you can use wheat whole grain noodles and or lowfat cheese it'll be even better for you maybe instead of just eating chocolate try making some chocolate covered strawberries everyone loves them and then you're more likely to eat less chocolate on its own and more fruit and for the snack try again to stick with fruit if you can its hard to get a healthy snack at the movies but if you can pick something light thats better at the end of the day you're less active so if you eat something heavy or with lots of calories you're probably not going to burn it off before you go to bed also i'd try to toss a few more snack in there you want to eat small amounts but every few hours that keeps your metabolism going so you'll burn more no butter popcorn fruits or chocolate covered fruit veggies with fat free dips celery with low fat peanut butter etc it sounds like you eat better than average but by adding little things and making little changes you can get even better results also avoid soda one soda a day can add lbs on to your body mass and that just wont go unless you drop it instead try to get low calorie iced teas or lemonades or juices that are a high percentage of real juice and not from concentrate Cuisine of the Philippines Chocolate Vegetarianism Snack food In-N-Out Burger Food Peruvian cuisine Vegetarian cuisine French cuisine German cuisine Pancake Dieting Bread Veganism Coffee Russian cuisine Sandwich Tofu Salad Kit Kat Cuisine of the Southern United States McDonald's Ice cream Full English breakfast Dim sum Hamster Milk Meal Potato Food preservation Pizza Barbecue Cuisine of Brazil Korean cuisine Tooth Hot dog Fecal incontinence Happy Tree Friends Omega-3 fatty acid Cuisine of Argentina Hamburger Cuisine of Malaysia Tea Potassium Cha chaan teng Roman eating and drinking Tomato Cuisine of Africa Polish cuisine Peanut Wine Fruit Atkins Nutritional Approach Happy Meal Soft drink Ramen Bacon Avocado Healthy eating Cadbury Schweppes Fish and chips Chicken soup Serbian cuisine Fanta Oreo Nutrition Cuisine of Austria Cajun cuisine Butter Bengali cuisine Cold Stone Creamery Food guide pyramid Cheese Chili con carne Mango Last meal Bagel Soup French fries Alcoholic beverage Maple syrup Nabemono Chinese New Year Apple Insulin
