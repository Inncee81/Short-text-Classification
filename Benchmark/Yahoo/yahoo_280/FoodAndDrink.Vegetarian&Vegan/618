is it wrong to eat meat replicas think about it would you want someone eating a meat replacement for human flesh i think we as vegans should stop eating garden burgers simply because of what they represent they represent a slaughtered cow and i think that is wrong to even try to imitate eating dead animals oh my god ashley you are an absolute id ot phew sorry but you really are annoying the hell out of me with all your stupid questions a vegan burger doesn't represent a slaughtered cow it represents food and it shows that we can still enjoy tasty things which meat eaters do without causing any suffering to animals if anything we should buy more of this food to support the companies which make them that way they will become more popular and might actually be able to sway a meat eater into considering a vegetarian vegan diet surely it would be better if there were less meat burgers on the supermarket shelves and more veg ones and to answer your question yes i would love someone eating a meat replacement for human flesh as long as it wasn't actual flesh i'm sure we're not hurting any animals' feelings it's not like they look at a veggie burger and think that's a me subsitute if they did think this i'm sure they would have more sense than you and would probably deduce that it's better these products exists if they're keeping happy those that don't choose to consume their flesh vegan burgers don't represent death they represent a choice we have made for life that's just like saying we shouldn't eat animal shaped biscuits or a carrot that just so happens to look like a squid or the head of a horse grow up ashley and stop giving us a bad name Veganism Vegetarianism Hamburger Kashrut Vegetarian cuisine Animal rights Meat People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Taboo food and drink Vegetarianism and religion Peter Singer Burger King Kosher foods Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Original sin Food Theory of conduct Cat Theodicy Buddhist cuisine Burger Livestock Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dieting Animal Liberation Front Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an In-N-Out Burger Tofu Unclean animals Goodness and value theory Shark Meat analogue Sausage Homer Simpson Fiddler on the Roof Buddhism Factory farming MRE Carnivore Slaughterhouse Environmental vegetarianism Horse meat 613 mitzvot Punk ideology McDonald's Chicken Vegetarian nutrition Meat Loaf Japanese cuisine Utilitarianism Cattle Philosophical skepticism God Simone Weil The nature of God in Western theology Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Orca The Amber Spyglass Soybean Sperm Whale Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Soul Cuisine of Denmark Mortification of the flesh Cassava Abrahamic religion Whaling Pitaten Meaning of life Jewish cuisine French cuisine British cuisine Healthy eating Hindu Hard-line Organic food Domestic rabbit Christian eschatology Adam and Eve Bill Maher YuYu Hakusho Michel Henry Sin City Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Ethical consumerism Shit Singlish Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Gray Wolf Guinea pig Cannibalism Food guide pyramid
