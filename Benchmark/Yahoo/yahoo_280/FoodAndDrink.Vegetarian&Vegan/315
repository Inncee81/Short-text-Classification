suggestions for what i should do i'm vegetarian my family is going to simply fondue for my moms birthday my mom half convinced me into eating chicken i really don't want to eat chicken so when we go there for a meal all they have for entrees is meat should i just eat before we go there or stomach the chicken a slight pinch are you f ing out of your mind i honestly think your answer has had the reverse affect on me peeled turtle i think i'm skipping the chicken actually the cheese is kind of in the appetizer yeah and my grandma is going to be so skeptical and disapproving it will be hard to bear if you don't want to eat the chicken then don't eat it maybe you could call ahead and talk to the manager at the restaurant and explain that you're going there for your mother's birthday and that you're vegetarian and ask if they have a vegetarian entree option that they can make for you if there are vegetarian appetizer options perhaps they can just turn one of those into an entree for you or you could order the appetizer for your entree and supplement it with a green salad etc if you're concerned that it won't be the most complete meal for you since there won't be a good vegetarian protein source then make sure you eat a little extra protein for breakfast and lunch that day to help make up for it as far as your grandmother and other family members go i've found that it helps to simply say something like i've made a personal decision to be vegetarian because of and briefly state your reason concern for animal rights personal health whatever your reason if anyone presses you about it over dinner and you don't want to talk about it because it seems like a hostile situation adn you don't want to cause a fight at your mom's birthday dinner try saying i'd be more than happy to discuss this with any and all of you another time but we're here tonight to celebrate mom's birthday and i don't think that everyone at the table wants to spend the evening talking about my eating habits if you want to talk about this with me then let's pick a time tomorrow next week to sit down and talk about it and i'd be more than happy to answer your questions that way you keep the lines of communication open and avoid overshadowing your mom's dinner Meal Vegetarianism Cuisine of Denmark French cuisine Veganism McDonald's Dieting Egg (food) Breakfast Food Cheese Hamburger Pizza Stomach cancer Menu Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Korean cuisine Lisa the Vegetarian Prostate cancer Jewish cuisine Sandwich Dinner Kashrut Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Culture of France The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy MRE Tofu Peruvian cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Passover German cuisine Garfield Salad Fingers Hell's Kitchen (television) Chicken Chinese cuisine Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Shaggy dog story Little Britain Theory of conduct Barbecue Fasting Calvin and Hobbes Cuisine of Brazil Rocko's Modern Life Buddhist cuisine Tea (meal) Japanese cuisine Chili con carne Omega-3 fatty acid The Ashlee Simpson Show The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Joke Fiddler on the Roof Cuisine of the Philippines Social rule Recursion Goodness and value theory Fast food The Smoking Room The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Kodocha Public relations Friends Cuisine of the Southern United States Ben Johnson (athlete) Phoebe Buffay's songs Oral sex English grammar Bengali cuisine Aerial (dance move) Milk The nature of God in Western theology Delicatessen Peter Singer Domesticated turkey Satay Chinese New Year Treehouse of Horror V Fecal incontinence Vegetarianism and religion Roman eating and drinking Game show Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of Ethiopia Steak n Shake Birthday French fries
