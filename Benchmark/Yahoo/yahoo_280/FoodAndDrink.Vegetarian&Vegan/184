to vegetarians vegans why i know it's to save animals and stuff but why go through all the tofu i know some of you like it and in that case good luck to you have fun to those who eat tofu and gag of the time why whats the point yea well all that's not as bad as when ya'll try to force it upon us omnivores i hate that what makes you better than the rest and empowers you with the right to moan and groan when we want our steaks if you dont want meat thats you so dont eat meat then i still will why do you feel like its necessary to tell me that a poor innocent cow was shot in order for me to have this cheeseburger dont you think i know that i can't believe how arrogant some of you can be i know it goes both ways but arrogant vegans shouldn't stereotype omnivores i honestly dont care what you eat its when you inflict your views on me that tells me you dont respect me and your somehow better and why would you go to burger king to get a vegan burger when you know that of the money you just spent on that veggie patty is going to a company that kills poor innocent cows if you really cared that much wouldn't supporting a commercial chain of animal slaughterings just as bad as eating the poor beast itself oh and one more question just curious why no milk i understand its from an animal the cow but its not like its hurting the cow at all so why is it taboo i even think that if a cow isn't milked for a certain period of time they get pissed and cranky and actually start to be in pain so not milking them has the same to a lesser degree to eating them in my opinion whats the deal with milk why did you come into the vegetarian and vegan section to moan about us moaning about meat eaters hypocrisy its in the dictionary as are stupidity and education its not like its hurting the cow at all no idea have you try reseaching these milk related topics artificial incemination every year hormone enriched feed bribe feed caged carousels killing bulls excess calves and free martins at week old excess feeding to produce lites of milk per day intensive rearing means low husbandry checks removing calves from mothers after colostrum feed killing the cow at years old Veganism Vegetarianism Dairy Kashrut Animal rights Dairy cattle Cattle Factory farming Vegetarian cuisine Breastfeeding Livestock People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 613 mitzvot Milk Theory of conduct Beef Guinea pig Kosher foods Animal husbandry In-N-Out Burger Teen Girl Squad Sacred cow Buddhist cuisine Joke Punk ideology Vegetarianism and religion Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ron Weasley Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Soybean Vegetarian nutrition Dieting Dairy farming Breast milk McDonald's Zoophilia Burger King Meat analogue Burger Insulin Orca Korban Egg (food) Chocolate Invader Zim Karma in Hinduism MRE Poker jargon Singlish Ethical consumerism Foie gras Environmental vegetarianism Unclean animals Lisa the Vegetarian Conker's Bad Fur Day Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield Cheeseburger Horse Agriculture Hard-line Cheese Prostate cancer Russian joke Nutrition Fiddler on the Roof Wang Mang Horse meat Hiberno-English Dog Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Goat Drawn Together Ranma __ characters Blood (computer game) RuneScape quests Tooth Shark Domesticated turkey Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Kodocha Organic farming Mr. T Billboard (advertising) Whaling Hip hop rivalries
