turning into a vegetarian good idea or what real question what can vegans not eat many things have animal products in them in order to preserve them maintain texture smell good etc to my understanding yogurt cheese toothpaste shampoo all have animal products in them what other food products or things have animal products in them can you name the specific products like dial family doctor was just wondering i am not a vegan just exploring different parts of society i have been vegetarian for five years and vegan for four i believe that the more people there are that can respect the lives of cows chickens fish and even shrimp the more likely they are to respect differences in other people and contribute to a more peaceful society there is much mystery surrounding an animal free diet but only because tradition and powerful industry have been very effective in clouding people's judgments on the issue if you would like to learn as much as you can on how to make a strictly plant based fungi algae and bacteria products may be included diet please visit the following site http www veganhealth org sh there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm all of those things that you listed have animal free alternatives yogurt cultured soy cheese soy rice almond cashew and other cheeses all toiletries and personal hygiene products have vegan alternatives as well i would say that all products marketed by the likes of proctor gamble and unilever contain animal ingredients i should not ignore the fact that they conduct redundant and cruel tests on countless animals vegan implies that a person does everything within their ability within reason to eliminate animal based or related products from their lives a car or bicycle may have animal based glues or tire ingredients clothing may have animal based chemicals in the bleaching or dying process my computer may not be animal free and the first video recordings used as tools in our movement may have had gelatin in them these things are trivial when compared to what those products have done to allow us to function as parts of society and give our message everlasting media if our our uncertain future were to realize our goals in a few hundred or thousand years p all of the substances and methods that made those things non vegan would undoubtedly be eliminated this is my current edit on how to deal with parents while transitioning from a diet that includes flesh it always followed by the next entry that i have provided there is a japanese analogy proverb that goes like this the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down people are like this everywhere when you tell your family that it is your personal belief that animals should not be eaten they take a look at themselves and it can be subconsciously translated into what you do is wrong and i choose to be right your parents have probably been taught a huge amount of misinformation by their parents and their teachers while growing up you really need to research vegetarian diets and health before you even think about saying the v word in front of your parents when you have gathered enough information and feel confident in a vegetarian diet's ability to maintain or even improve health you may mention to them that you have made the decision they may be shocked angry worried curious or many other things but you must never react to their behavior and always stay calm if they are able to speak to you and respect your choice please tell them everything and answer all questions if they are rude inconsiderate judgmental violent or verbally abusive refuse to continue any conversation until they can speak to you with respect the best advice is to study everything that you can about a healthy vegetarian diet and keep yourself in good shape better than most people your age or than your friends family if possible if nobody that you know shows a genuine positive interest in your choice don't give them the privilege of the knowledge that you have gathered work your way around any attempts they make to trivialize your beliefs and if possible go shopping with your parents and buy things that aren't obvious veggie fare instead of trying to sneak fake meat into the cart toss in lentil soup peanut butter pasta fruits veggies or anything else that you have learned is needed to fill any gaps in your diet this is my current edit on general transition information if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions this is my current edit of my favorite meals given as an idea of what can be included in a vegan diet if cooking skills are developed i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple
