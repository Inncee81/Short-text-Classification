reasons to go vegan hey guys i know i've asked questions about veganism in the past but this is a bit different what are reasons to go from vegetarian to vegan thanks you guys lostsoul to defend the vegans out there it's obviously pretty easy if others can do it that's my take on it next time answer my question and not make rude comments thank you hidebehindthesun all i have to say to you is grow up bitter bats i love your answer i'll leave it open for now for others but i'll most likely give you best answer i'm also a veggie for animal rights skully what well it depends on your reasons for being vegetarian i'm just going to go ahead and assume you're vegetarian for animal rights if that's true well then yes you should go vegan dairy cows and egg laying hens actually might even have it worse than the ones being slaughtered because they're kept alive longer so they spend more time being tormented rather than killed off as soon as possible like the ones meant for slaughter oh also the dairy industry does directly contribute to the veal industry so being vegan is definitely a great choice for those concerned about animal rights as far as health goes vegans can be just as healthy even healthier than omnivores and vegetarians with a properly balanced diet there shouldn't even be a need for a vitamin but if you insist on taking one you should run a blood test to see if you're really missing out on something don't forget to make sure the vitamin is vegan friendly too vitamin b and other vitamins and nutrients sometimes thought to only be found in meat and animal by products are actually found in soy milk and most cereals i've been vegan months and feel healthier than i ever have and no longer have to feel guilty after i've eaten something i don't miss any non vegan foods either at first i missed cheese but i'm over it soy ice cream is great by the way in fact i think it's better than dairy ice cream good luck on going vegan you won't regret it Dairy Egg (food) Milk Soybean Food Tofu Vegetarian cuisine Kashrut Animal rights Dieting Vegetarian nutrition Meat analogue Cyanocobalamin Cheese Livestock Organic food Soy milk Kosher foods Raw food diet Factory farming Food guide pyramid Omega-3 fatty acid People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Prostate cancer Taboo food and drink Vitamin C Vegetarianism and religion Nutrition Breastfeeding Fecal incontinence Buddhist cuisine Chicken Tocopherol Agriculture Vitamin D Theory of conduct Environmental vegetarianism Coronary heart disease Simone Weil Cat Folic acid Chronic fatigue syndrome Halaal Yoghurt Peter Singer Soy protein Cattle Dog Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Dairy product Domestic goat Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Genetically modified food Dairy farming Ice cream Japanese cuisine Social rule Domestic rabbit Healthy eating Paleolithic diet Slaughterhouse Unclean animals Pizza Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Coeliac disease Tlingit Guinea pig Lisa the Vegetarian Meat The Lovely Bones Abortion debate Fruitarianism Gelatin Vitamin Hamburger Chocolate Organic farming Atkins Nutritional Approach French cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Hard-line Punk ideology Retinol Margarine Pasteurization Bengali cuisine McDonald's Avenue Q Lactobacillus acidophilus Acne Agriculture in Australia Theodicy
