parents can't accept me being vegetarian recently i've decided to become vegeratian not only because i pity animals but because the idea of having dead fleash of a once living thing in my mouth disgusts me i've never really liked meat but i ate sausages and burgers to please my parents though refused to eat steak chicken or any meat in the form of meat itself now i've decided to stop eating meat completely because why eat something that i don't like however my parents are having a hard time accepting this i really cant stand the comments that they make over the food i try to eat and the sarcastic jokes that they are making out of me they say that i've ruined my life and it's just a trail to sickness my mum kind of accepted what i'm doing now but my dad is just being horrible to me at mealtimes since he even said that i'm making myself disabeled why can't they just accept the thing that i don't like meat instead of their constant you're just being stupid talks how can i change this i'm there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm there is a japanese analogy proverb that goes like this the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down people are like this everywhere when you tell your family that it is your personal belief that animals should not be eaten they take a look at themselves and it can be subconsciously translated into what you do is wrong and i choose to be right your parents have probably been taught a huge amount of misinformation by their parents and their teachers while growing up you really need to research vegetarian diets and health before you even think about saying the v word in front of your parents when you have gathered enough information and feel confident in a vegetarian diet's ability to maintain or even improve health you may mention to them that you have made the decision they may be shocked angry worried curious or many other things but you must never react to their behavior and always stay calm if they are able to speak to you and respect your choice please tell them everything and answer all questions if they are rude inconsiderate judgmental violent or verbally abusive refuse to continue any conversation until they can speak to you with respect the best advice is to study everything that you can about a healthy vegetarian diet and keep yourself in good shape better than most people your age or than your friends family if possible if nobody that you know shows a genuine positive interest in your choice don't give them the privilege of the knowledge that you have gathered work your way around any attempts they make to trivialize your beliefs and if possible go shopping with your parents and buy things that aren't obvious veggie fare instead of trying to sneak fake meat into the cart toss in lentil soup peanut butter pasta fruits veggies or anything else that you have learned is needed to fill any gaps in your diet if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have

someone is rude or makes fun of you for being veg which is very likely to happen at some point laugh do it with a smile when they say something stupid just laugh don't do it at them or even in their general direction completely ignore them with your body language but make sure they are aware that you think what they are saying is funny if they call on the phone and say something about it laugh i don't know what is wrong with some people but if you act like a happy person that is confident in her choices they will probably not get their childish kicks out of opening their ignorant mouths their lack of respect is funny how can someone be so dumb and rude it's hilarious you are right and they are wrong not because they eat meat but because they can't let you be different and make your own choices even though you are making a choice of compassion and wisdom keep your chin up and keep your face bright and smiling and they can't touch you if your dad is a total jerk about it maybe you shouldn't laugh then but never let him see on your face that what he is saying is getting to you then again if i were you i think i would laugh if my dad told me i was disabled or being stupid over not eating meat
