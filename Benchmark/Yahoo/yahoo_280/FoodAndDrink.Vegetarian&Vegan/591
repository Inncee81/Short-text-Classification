raw foodists i am starting a raw food lifestyle today any tips on sprouting this sounds weird to me can't i just buy things already sprouted sprouting is a fun hobby i sprout fenungreek chia peas lentils brocolli clover radish alfalfa sunflower and all sorts of other sprouts on a daily basis i rotate my trays so i have a fresh supply every day you wont find many sprouted items at your local grocery store thats for sure my favorite sprouter is kitchen crop brand although i use several methods including just a mason jar covered with clean pantyhose its fun to watch the sprouts progress so quickly i can sprout them one day and eat them the next in most cases but by keeping the trays rotated daily i can let some of them sprout for a little longer which changes the texture of the sprout young sprouts days are really tender day sprouts hold up better in wraps salads etc its worth the little effort to do it yourself be sure to rinse the sprouts daily and discard the rinse water it contains anarobic bacteria that produce as the sprouts grow i use the rinse water for my houseplants but dont consume it directly good luck i keep about percent raw percent cooked or lightly steamed it makes it easier to manage and that way i can still use condiments such as vinegar etc Sprouting Tofu Cuisine of Denmark Hot dog Fish and chips Dairy Food Sauerkraut Vinegar Escherichia coli O157:H7 Japanese cuisine Alfalfa Hamburger Bread Cantonese cuisine Plastic Idli Bengali cuisine Tea Domestic rabbit Dishwasher Sushi Cuisine of the Philippines Potato Jewish cuisine Cannabis cultivation Domesticated turkey Raw food diet Bean Cheese Agriculture Organic food Banana Salad Foodborne illness Acetic acid Fugu Japanese tea ceremony Cuisine of Laos Kosher foods Mattress French cuisine French fries Chopsticks Hydroponics Houseplant Breakfast Barbecue Vegetarianism Kitchen Common bean Waste management Veganism Cuisine of Malaysia Ramen Mayonnaise Korean cuisine Tobacco Hay Sears Holdings Corporation Pickling Sausage Broccoli Cuisine of Brazil Guinea pig Hamster Fluoride therapy Seed Apple Egg (food) Chili con carne Vitamin C Soba RuneScape skills Milk Halitosis Menstrual cup Sugar beet Roman eating and drinking German cuisine Ham D__ner kebab McDonald's Weed Cuisine of Singapore Inventory Tlingit Chocolate Wok Delicatessen Local food Chicken
