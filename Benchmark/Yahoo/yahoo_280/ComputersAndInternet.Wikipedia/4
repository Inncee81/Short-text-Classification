why does wikipedia bsod me wikipedia causes my otherwise perfect xp laptop to go to a blue screen of death it can happen quite rarely when browsing articles strangely not as a result of clicking a link or doing anything it did it once after i had been reading a long article for about quarter an hour and moved my mouse an inch it does it a lot more often when i try to edit articles i am very computer savvy and i know that it is definately wikipedia causing the problem i don't know what it is doing to the laptop to crash it however the bsod refers to some odd sys file which i can't remember off the top of my head it isn't a firewall or anti virus that is clashing i have tried with and without both and the problem still exists does anyone else have this problem or a hypothesis as to why i have this problem it's not my cookies i constantly clear cookies cache and anything i can and i cannot blame ie because it only ever happens on wikipedia it is something in the wikipedia code that is wrong you'd think they would make it compatible with the most common browser ie isn't perfect i'll admit that but in some ways it is more hardened than firefox it has been patched for many many exploits that firefox has never seen because it isn't the largest target however if a hacker believed firefox was popular enough he or she could very easily exploit it in ways ie is now a bit more immune to i've never had anything like this happen to me on wikipedia Mozilla Firefox Gmail Spyware Windows XP Mouse (computing) Cascading Style Sheets Macromedia Flash Opera (web browser) Internet Explorer Phishing Rootkit HTTP cookie Web browser Microsoft Windows Mozilla Application Suite IBM PC compatible USB flash drive Computer security AmigaOS Laptop Hyperlink CPU cache Emacs Malware WYSIWYG XML Browser wars Cheating in Counter-Strike Virtual memory OpenBSD Comparison of web browsers Diablo II: Lord of Destruction 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Windows 2000 Forth programming language Computer Cross site scripting Mandriva Linux Linux kernel Floppy disk Computer virus Internationalized domain name GameFAQs History of Microsoft Windows IPod ZX Spectrum CPU design PaX Stopping e-mail abuse Theory of conduct Bluetooth Google Apple II family 64-bit Windows Server 2003 Hash table Philosophical skepticism Bayes' theorem Wiki Firewall (networking) Digital rights management PlayStation Portable Common criticisms of Microsoft Minesweeper (computer game) C programming language Debugging Mozilla Wget Internet privacy GunZ The Duel Hello world program Internet security Copy protection E-mail spam PlayStation 2 Architecture of Windows 2000 Bayesian inference User agent Apple Macintosh Denial-of-service attack Files-11 Commodore 64 Objective-C Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Linspire Pretty Good Privacy Buffer overflow Code: Lyoko Cache Linux Mach kernel Microsoft X86 assembly language Spam (electronic) Color Unicode
