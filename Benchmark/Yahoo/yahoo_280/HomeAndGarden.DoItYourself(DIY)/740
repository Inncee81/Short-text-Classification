i just bought a ' palm harbor double wide mobile home this mobile home is in very good condition and i will be moving it to a acre track that i own i would like some advice about setup and whether or not it would be a good idea to make a few changes to the interior i'm going to put the home on concrete runners and from what i understand the home will be approximately to inches off the ground after it is put into place my question is why does it need to be so high off the ground i would like it to look as much like a site built home as possible just my preference can i set the home lower than inches i own the home outright if i do set it up lower than the usual inches will that prevent me from selling later comments please another thing is it doesn't have tape and texture on the inside i am thinking about adding drywalls to the living room and master bedroom is this a good idea would i need to take the paneling off or just put it over it how costly would this be if i did it myself together its about sqft removing the axles and affixing the manufactured home to a permanent foundation such as concrete runners will help in the resale value of your home and help future buyers obtain financing easier financial institutions are more willing to do a loan on a mobile home permanently affixed also all manufactured homes are required to have tie downs they will put metal tie downs in your cement runners before the cement dries and then use cable to more firmly affix the home to the concrete pad it's more stable in storms and another reason the banks like this type of set up to your question about to it is required to have a minimum of clearance you can't put the mobile home directly on the ground because the moisture will eat up the underbelly and start to corrode your plywood floor also plumbing problems septic or electrical problems can occur over time you need for a person to be able to get underneath the home to fix things it would definitely limit the number of people who would be attracted to your home should you decide to resell beauty and practicality will matter to buyers also has one of the answerers already mentioned there are so many great options out there for skirting which really adds a look of stability to the home be glad you will have to to show this off if that does not appeal to you installers offer backfilling this is where they push direct up the skirting and gradually slope it down creating an impression the home is flush with the ground but here is a website for the skirting which looks like stone www stonecote com even if this provider is not in your area it is available nationwide just ask a local manufactured home dealer what company they use to install the new homes they sell pretend you are interested in buying one once you get the name go to that company and get a bid for them to do the skirting or to obtain it they know where to get it i heard tape and texture is needed to help avoid hairline cracks sounds great you own your home outright congratulations on that accomplishment Floppy disk Seismic retrofit Kitchen Stairway Dundas Square Mantelpiece Drill bit Mattress Magical objects in Harry Potter Wood RuneScape quests Gramophone record Tudorbethan architecture Wilton House Ringo Starr Fireplace Equine conformation Forge Strap-on dildo Brick Wood carving Computer CPU cache Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Mountain bike Mazda Miata Resident Evil (video game) Santa Claus Textile manufacturing Surveillance Chimney Queen Anne Style architecture Light-frame construction 64-bit Punt (boat) Nippur Illegal drug trade Wood fuel Colours, standards and guidons Saw Winchester Mystery House Winslow Hall Toyota Camry Solomon's Temple Odyssey Linux Ford Crown Victoria Mouse (computing) Manifold CP/M Hamster Tire Gideon Mantell RISC Lepenski Vir IPod Unemployment Skateboard Windows Vista Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an New York Giants De Lorean DMC-12 Perl Imperial (automobile) UFO conspiracy theory St Pancras railway station Tribes 2 Sailing Architecture of the California missions Laws of cricket LaTeX Bass guitar Tank Chair Peterhouse, Cambridge Yaodong Table saw Panzer II Sega Saturn Opportunity rover Endgame Rathfarnham Stave church Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Effects unit Red Line (MBTA) Rapid transit Table tennis RuneScape cheats Comics Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Mazda 323 Theory of conduct PIC microcontroller Buick Regal Virginia State Capitol Adobe Panzer I
