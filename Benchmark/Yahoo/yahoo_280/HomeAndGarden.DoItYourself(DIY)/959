how do i cut power to my heat pump i am trying to install a new thermostat and my fuse panel does not have a fuse labeled for the hvac system am i missing something i have looked for another separate fuse panel and there is not one where could i cut the power to the system so i can do the change safely patrick are you sure the supply transformer is in the outdoor unit most i've encountered are in the indoor unit there should be an on off switch similar to a light switch near the air handler look for the power conduit running from the air handler to the wall the switch should be close by this conduit if no switch is present you will have to start the indoor blower fan then shut one breaker at a time until the fan stops write down on the panel which breaker is for your indoor air handler Crayfish Tank Autonomous building Solar power Thermal power station Dairy Shrimp farm Agriculture Hydrogen economy Straw-bale construction Moult Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends Fire fighting Brewery Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Domain Name System Cave diving Dairy farming Tilapia Air conditioning Southern American English Fishing Mercury Atlas 6 Crew Exploration Vehicle Transformer Welding World Wide Web Energy development Livestock Sea-Monkey Climate of the United Kingdom Mount Pinatubo Space Shuttle program Hydroponics Free trade Motorcycle Tasmania Space shuttle main engine Factory farming USS Tunny (SS-282) Fish farming Amazon River Gmail Hemp Novelty (locomotive) Tobacco Seismic retrofit Wind power Chicken Solar variation Thermoregulation Harley-Davidson Scuba set Gas turbine Deep lake water cooling First Battle of the Atlantic Great Depression Platypus Operation Market Garden Home repair Campfire Turbocharger Engine cooling Tier One Solar collector Refrigerator car Adiabatic lapse rate Rice University HVAC History of the United States (1918-1945) Karl Rove Diablo II Space Shuttle external tank Passive solar Terran (StarCraft) Vacuum tube Microeconomics E85 Shining Time Station Subsistence farming Water USS Nautilus (SS-168) Anne Rice Cetacea Armored Core Addressing mode Electrophysiology Knife Bong Atmospheric circulation Casting Nuclear power Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Illegal drug trade Ice cream Central processing unit Garfield Mitigation of global warming Diving suit
