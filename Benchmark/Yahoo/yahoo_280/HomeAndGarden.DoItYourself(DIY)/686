a question about bricks i want to buy himley crown buff code on jewsons brick library http www jewson co uk en templates bri how much per brick are they about i know they are all different but a guideline please we are building a large raised bed in the garden and are hoping these bricks are appropriate for the job has anyone any thoughts on these bricks through experience etc i also want a pale mortar to 'match' a nearby wall what should i ask for thank you in advance hi anoni a very nice brick and ideal for what you have in mind jewsons will be very expensive for purchasing these bricks unless you have a trade account or trade with them on a regular basis they will give you minimal or no discount your best price will probably be from a small independent builders merchant for the mortar if you use yellow sand and mix it at a ratio of parts sand to of portland cement this will give a pretty good colour match for these bricks you can mix a small trial batch of mortar and let it dry to see that the final colour is to your liking remember the more cement you use the darker the mortar will be if you require a tinted mortar then you will need to purchase the required 'dye' again from the merchants again it's a good idea to mix a sample batch and let it dry to ensure you get the colour you require it is important to ensure all batches of mortar that you mix are to the same ratios otherwise you will end up with various coloured joints some lighter than others the cost of this brick will depend on where you are located if it is a brick that is used a lot in your area for other work and is therefore readily available then it will be cheaper than if they are not if 'not' they will have to be purchased through a merchant directly from ibstock the manufacturer and i am told the minimum amount would have to be a pallet quantity approximately where i live this is not a commonly used brick and ibstock would require minimum for delivery to a local supplier you may need to allow also for a suitable coping stone to 'top off' the bricks The Brady Bunch Sea star Rubber duck Rubber Wallpaper group Flotsam and jetsam Peanut Donald Duck Color theory Barium Microsoft Paint Pok__mon Snap Blue Man Group Color Glass James McNeill Whistler SpongeBob SquarePants Blue Piet Mondrian VeggieTales One Piece Paint Colours, standards and guidons The Warriors Casting Brett Whiteley The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Mario Kart 64 BNSF Railway Wassily Kandinsky Koopa Troopa Georges-Pierre Seurat Patrick Star Rubber stamp Zinc Chromium Sesame Street Sea urchin Koopa Kid Pigment Eye color Light-emitting diode Crayola Gamut New York City Subway nomenclature The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Paul Is Dead Japanese toilet Bathroom Palazzo Pitti Antimony Crown-of-Thorns starfish Camouflage Bernard Palissy Mary Cassatt Ultramarine Yellow Dice Rainbow Islands Plastic Pointillism Starfish Prime Green Queensbridge Common bean Scrubs Nintendo 64 Fairy Tux Paint Harrow School Color blindness Mario Friends British Rail Class 50 The Land Before Time Union Pacific Railroad Seijuu Sentai Gingaman Kingdom Come (comic) Namir Deiter Pysanka Bloody Stupid Johnson Henri Cartier-Bresson Fist of the North Star Oxygen Firework Chlorine Vishnu Toilet humour Impressionism Octopus Handspring Ammolite Animal White House Mercury (element) Pac-Man Soane Museum Air pollution Athens Bikini Bottom
