why does water bubble up from my shower drain if water bubbles up from the shower drain without using the shower then you have a main line stoppage it may be a partial stoppage but i'm willing to bet that it bubbles up when you flush the toilet you'll need a plumber to come out and clean out your line he will either need to pull up the toilet and run his snake through the pipe for the toilet unless you have a cleanout outside somewhere a cleanout is for the purpose of cleaning out your main sewer if you have a cleanout then it will be cheaper than pulling a toilet some plumbers go up on the roof and run their snake through the vent pipe some homeowners try to rent a snake and do this themselves but i dont recommend that due to the fact that if you dont know what youre doing that the machine can hurt you bad hope this helps and goodl luck Hydrogen economy Petroleum Alcohol fuel Natural gas Propane Nuclear power Portable stove Biodiesel Monopoly Autonomous building Microeconomics Gasoline Explosive material Natural monopoly Gross domestic product Fuel injection Sewage treatment Town gas Energy development Renewable energy Future energy development Alternative fuel Filling station Hybrid vehicle Wal-Mart Gas turbine Nuclear power phase-out Turbocharger __lectricit__ de France Transformer Internal combustion engine Airsoft Diesel engine Fusion power Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Carburetor Enron Corporation Gas metal arc welding Gas turbine-electric locomotive Fuel cell Solar cell Coal Alkane Electricity meter Automobile Toyota Prius Pebble bed reactor Tax Law of value Free trade Liquified petroleum gas Central processing unit Price discrimination Wind turbine Life insurance Annuity Economics Implications of peak oil Publicly funded medicine Energy Policy Act of 2005 Tariff Welding Hubbert peak theory Privatization Wood fuel Jet engine Economy of Russia Wankel engine 1973 oil crisis Tesco FairTax Internal ballistics Broadband Internet access Single-stage to orbit Rebreather Rational pricing Paintball Helium Power station Digital photography Cruising (maritime) Uranium Porsche 911 Inkjet printer Dairy Fire fighting Hydrogen
