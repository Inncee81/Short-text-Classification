dual button toilet cistern stopped filling can't remove panel help please our toilet cistern has stopped filling it has a dual push button arrangement in a small plastic panel on top of a ceramic tank i can't see how to get into it as the button and panel seem to be locked together somehow and the whole lot attached to the internal mechanism i can see all this by peeking under the panel when lifting an edge any ideas how to undo such an arrangement anyone if i can get into the cistern i guess it will be a small matter of freeing up the float mechanism which may be stuck but until i'm in thanks hi if the ring doesnt turn as jayktee suggests there may be a retaining screw under the buttons push one of the buttons down and insert a small screwdriver under the edge of the raised button very gently lever the button upwards remove the second button in the same way is there a screw underneath if so turn it anti clockwise and remove it you should now be able to remove the panel before removing the buttons make a note of which is the 'short flush' and refit when you have finished repairs by replacing the screw and pushing the buttons back into position Electrical wiring (UK) Switch Dimmer Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Lightning IPod Mercury Atlas 6 Light switch Ethernet Mouse (computing) Overhead lines Action potential 25-pair color code Violin Fuse (electrical) Vehicle registration plate Light-emitting diode Vacuum tube Distribution board Television Wild ARMs 2 Wire wrap Railgun Telegraphy Mattress Photography Oscilloscope Colours, standards and guidons D-subminiature Snooker Transformer Railway electrification system Diamond Circuit design Anamorphic widescreen Spark plug Mess dress Time Out of Mind Naval mine Residual-current device Railway signal Cloud Electrical wiring Transistor Kryptonite Wu-Tang Clan affiliates The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland HyperText Transfer Protocol Glass Quiz Call Missingno.
