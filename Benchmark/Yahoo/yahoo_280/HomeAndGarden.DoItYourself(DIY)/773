can some one give me a step by step process to tiling our kitchen floor i am wanting to put tile down in our kitchen could you please give me what products i will need and the step by step process to tiling the floor thanks this q has been asked and answered often and can be checked thru q a search pretty much because detailing it here is lengthy after installing multiple thousands of sq ft of tile though i'd be happy to detail deeper in e mail the obvious is measure the room and choose a tile style and size the size might be best dictated by the size of the area you want to cover the examples are also pretty obvious as for the most part they relate to feet either in inch or larger combined not knowing at all what the finish of the floor is currently that is an issue i remove any existing finish surface once the sub floor prep has been accomplished the floor checked for level voids rises then it's time to square the room the point is to measure and depending on your choice of tile size determine the layout to square a room run two perpendicular lines snapped as close to a center point as possible from those intersecting lines determine the layout i usually do lay out a course in either direction to best get an idea of the finish and any cuts example in a room that measures ft wide for instance and your choice is tiles you'll add an inch to the tile size every tiles for grout lines assume then at the perimeter you'll have cuts lay out the center allowing that cuts are either on one side that might not be so visible or split the difference if need be that equates to actually being able to move off the center lines depending on your room size layout and and obstructions etc it might also be important if you transition to an adjacent room once the sub floor has been prepped well cleaned and your layout determined i suggest remove any cove base molding begin in that middle but allow that you won't paint tile yourself into a corner you can't get out of using the proper mortar i use a poly blend thin set mix a bucket to allow that you work in small easy to manage areas ie sq ft at a time always moving away from the set tiles i use a flat edge blade mortar trowel with inch teeth once the mortar is applied excess moved to an empty space and no voids are left then place your first and every piece use rubber spacers to keep the grout lines and tiles running straight press gently down on the tile no need to mash into the mortar with a heavy hand i use a level and my hand to determine one flush with any adjacent you can use the rubber spacers to remove any mortar squeezed up into the grout lines save cuts for last and make them all at the same time to install the next day hours is usual for mortar set dry the issue should allow that your cuts are the same width at least as a grout line from the perimeter walls cabinets etc for kitchens i usually remove move both the stove and oven not the cabinets if you have pantry or closets in the kitchen they will likely need additional cuts once the cuts have been set and another hours perhaps if you have the time then begin the grout that as should the mortar be mixed to the consistency of mashed potato the issue with grout is that it sets in the bucket a bit faster than mortar so again work small areas again i use a poly blend with a paint stick paint scraper etc and or the rubberized grouting trowel you'll have to buy i suggest or more work the grout into the grout lines allowing that it presses to the sub floor and you get out any possible air bubbles which will become voids trowel at angles to the grout lines the process is designed to use the tool as a squeegie and at angles you aid the leveling of the grout again work small areas and have help if possible one to apply one to clean after in that small area take the flat large grout sponge just damp and wipe at angles as you did with the squeegie to get up any excess grout as the grout sets the sponging can be increasingly more wet that process if the squeegie was done correctly can be stages the grout will be just below the actual floor tile surface but should fill to the depressed edges of the tile piece once you gotten the grout to what seems to be relatively clean stop wiping don't over sponge or over wet in the process water as needed as it is also inhibits or degrades the agents in mortar or grout within another hours you'll see a film on the tile that can be mopped away given the proper procedures and timing the floor can be walked on and used by the third day hopefully when replacing tables chairs bakers shelving etc carry the piece to its place don't drag it across the new floor replace the cove base hiding the free space and any possible ooops buy no less than over what you need for waste and cuts btw my thought about equalizing cuts in size might equate to using one piece of full tile for two pieces of cut tile at the perimeters steven wolf if i've confused you or left out any
