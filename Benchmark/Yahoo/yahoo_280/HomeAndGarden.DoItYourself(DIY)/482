anyone out there make rag rugs with a frame or without im just starting to use a frame i would like a few pointers thanks to make your loom you need straight boards x 's or something like that cut them so that are feet long and are feet long for a rug about x feet you can reposition one short board to make a smaller rug at another time nail the boards together at the ends then reinforce the corners with corner braces now measure across each board and make a mark at every inch pound small nails on every one of these marks all the way around the boards nail them about deep now gather all of your material to make strips use the same type of fabric in one rug ie cotton polyester wool to make the actual strips cut them straight not on the bias cut them in wide sew the ends together with a bias seam taking a strip fold in of left side in towards center then turn right side under about in and then sew down that seam folding and turning seam as you go along this process covers all the raw edges and your rug will look much better when you have enough strips take them to your loom tie one end to the nail on the top left hand side of the loom then draw it down to the other nail at the bottom left hand side of the loom then pull it around the second nail at the bottom up to the second nail at the top around the third nail at the top down to the third nail at the bottom etc until you have completely covered the entire loom all the way to the right side tie the end on the last nail use a firm type of cloth strip for this it will not be visible when your rug is finished now take the other cloth strips and starting at the top and bottom ends tie one to the left side nail and weave it through to the right side then either loop it around the next nail and continue weaving it back to the left side or tie it off match your strips to the top and bottom of the loom and do the center area last while you are weaving the strips you will need to use an old toothbrush handle to push them down tightly at some point you will experience the joy of artistry and the resultant euphoria as you begin to create a beautiful pattern enjoy the excitement of your creation and when you are finished the rug slip the loops off all the nails sew the loose ends to the rug if you have changed fabric strips at every nail you may need to finish the edges by cutting all ends even and covering them with a narrow cloth border or just sew them down all the way around for a more fringed effect have fun Kitchen Woodworking Furniture Wood carving Lathe Desk Sears Holdings Corporation Secretary desk The Brady Bunch Saw Drill bit Columbine High School massacre Jigsaw puzzle Plane (tool) Wood router Woodworking machine Shaggy dog story Product Lifecycle Management Abbey Passenger car Wal-Mart Apple Macintosh Computer Table saw Dormitory The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Best Buy Chair Frankfurt kitchen The Inside Chatsworth House Screw Copyleft Library Intellivision Oxford English Dictionary Upholstery Japanese tea ceremony Quality control Refrigerator Portsmouth Block Mills Atari 2600 Surveillance CPU design Station wagon Drill The Apprentice 2 Powel Crosley Jr. AmigaOS Mouse (computing) Wooton desk Floppy disk Dave Matthews Band Extreme Programming Emergency preparedness Computer virus Monticello Chopsticks Amiga Trademark Universal Serial Bus CPU cache Commodity Sears Catalog Home Linux File system Berkshire Hathaway Katamari Damacy Knife Software engineering IBM TARDIS Mattress Microsoft Windows Apple II family Culture of Korea Grandview, U.S.A.
