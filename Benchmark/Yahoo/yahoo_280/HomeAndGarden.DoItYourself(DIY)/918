stud grade x lumber has splits is this okay hello building a house in georgia they are putting up the walls using x lumber however the lumber is marked 'stud' nice lumber but some of of them have splits in the wood is this okay the lumber is marked stud because that is what it is they come pre cut at so they are the correct and uniform length needed to build the wall when building a home whole bundles are sometimes shipped including some that are bowed to far have knots or defects or otherwise not usable for studs the responsible builder will cull these from the bundle and use them for shorter pieces that need to be cut end splits are common in lumber bought in bulk it doesn't compromise the strength of the stud unless the split is excessive over in longer lengths for wall plates splits are usually cut out but in studs there is no extra length to cut off Reinforced concrete Pavement (material) Concrete Seismic retrofit Masonry Roof Road Tire Rebar Asphalt concrete Composite material Geodesic dome Aluminium Rail tracks Wood Prestressed concrete Truss Stress (physics) Motorcycle Aggregate (composite) Screw Oil refinery Fatigue (material) Truss bridge Asphalt Building material Boat building Combine (Half-Life 2) Buckling Beam (structure) Casting Suspension bridge Young's modulus Natural building Fiberglass Graphite-reinforced plastic Welding Arch bridge Upholstery Knife Equine conformation Deck (ship) Wind turbine Portland cement E85 Carbon nanotube Beretta 92F/FS Violin Ceramics Metallurgy Rope Straw-bale construction Limit state design Rear wheel drive Mattress Viva La Bam Air-raid shelter Street Balikpapan Bicycle Glossary of climbing terms Gasoline Bridge Pile Textile manufacturing terminology Retaining wall NASCAR Glass Strength of materials Urban heat island Runway Explosive material Space elevator Drill bit Ice core Tensile strength Plaster Anchor Tennis Cocaine Bolted joint Stucco Professional wrestling holds Rail terminology Golf club (equipment) Diving Data Encryption Standard Disc brake Corrosion Deformation Radio controlled airplane Badminton Dam Ridge Route Avalanche Brazing Lincoln Highway Zirconia
