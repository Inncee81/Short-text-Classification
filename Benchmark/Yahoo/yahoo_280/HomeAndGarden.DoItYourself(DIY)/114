how should i clean my newly uncovered wood floors i recently purchased my first home i had the only carpet ever laid over the art deco style wood floors in the living and dining room pulled up the exposed wood floors have some stains which are kind of grayish black and some paint stains other than that i don't think they are in bad enough shape just grime and dirt to need total refinshing what could i use to clean them i've thought of using a buffer machine renting and using a scrubber pad one of the green or red ones and some simple green or murphy's wood soap is this going to give me an ok result you're best off using the most gentle method possible the paint may be hard to remove if the floor has a varnish or polyurethane finish maybe some googone or mineral spirits will soften it up enough to scrape it with a plastic putty knife go with the grain the dark spots may not come out but you could try some extra fine steel wool if the floor is waxed or if there is any raw wood showing do not use anything containing water this includes murphy's oil soap simple green and bleach there are very few instances where any of these should be used on a wood floor if you must use something with water use a hardwood floor cleaner that contains alcohol it evaporates quickly and doesn't leave residue like murphy's or simple green also never use any ammoniated products clean off the paint steel wool the dark areas and reseal then either clean by hand with hardwood floor cleaner or if it has a wax finish apply a very thin coat of paste wax and buff also any type of hardwood floor product that says it polishes is best to be avoided it may be good short term but not long term Upholstery Paint Diving suit Staining (biology) Gram staining Social rule Mattress Campfire Charles Goodyear Leaf Shoe polish Lacquer Dry cleaning Condom Wood Humidity The Shining (film) Personal lubricant Carbon dioxide Laundry Woodworking Rice Hamster Plastic Soldering Menstrual cup Vacuum cleaner Hemp Social aspects of clothing Flax Bedbug 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Strap-on dildo Toilet Cello Bacteria Great Teacher Onizuka Camp Lazlo Soap opera Eczema Primer (paint) McMansion Carnivorous plant Dye Stained glass Dairy Soap The Human Stain Brush Printmaking Laws of cricket Baptism New Zealand flax Knife Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Home repair Pitaten The Adventures of Pete & Pete Vulcanization Sauna AFI 100 Years series Wood carving FoxTrot Casting Fiddler on the Roof Chair Fire extinguisher Israeli settlement Tattoo The Ashlee Simpson Show The Star Wars Holiday Special Air conditioning Cannabis cultivation Sento Haibane Renmei Carpet Jatob__ Sinfest Taxi Driver Compton Wynyates Wound Washing machine Leather Assonet, Massachusetts Friends Wood finishing Mud People Psoriasis Papyrus Sushi Jumpstart 3rd Grade Glass Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Adhesive Martin Luther King, Jr. Holes (book) Cricket pitch
