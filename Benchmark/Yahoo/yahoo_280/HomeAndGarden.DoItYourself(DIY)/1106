how do i repair concrete pilasters i have just had the sign to my shop front replaced however in replacement one of the side pilasters capitals has cracked and broken these are made from a concrete mixture i think and painted over the years deteriorated so crumbling was to be expected i have search the net for answers but can't seem to find if the square decorative parts which are only decorative are called pilasters capitals consoles or corbels there are two one either side of the shop front at the top and protrude slightly from the wall my question is how do i repair them i don't want to get someone to do this as we did had them repaired last year and the builder made a mess of the job i would like to get them back to original shape basically like a think key line around a box firstly anything that jutts out of a wall is called apilaster and a free standing one is called a capital you can repair that by simply taking a bag of readymix concreta and fill the fissures or the part that has come out but please be sure that the surface you are putting this mixture is coarse just puncture it if not so so that the mixture binds to it and cure it by covering with wet gunny bags for days hope this helps Screw Drill bit Vise (tool) Wrench Glossary of climbing terms Clinker (boat building) Screwdriver Screw thread Spark plug Welding Drill Tire Violin Woodworking Hydraulic machinery Lathe Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Gas metal arc welding Seismic retrofit Upholstery Climbing equipment Textile manufacturing Guitar Earring Taps and dies Aluminium Knife Propeller Drilling and threading Printed circuit board Harmonica Clockwise and counterclockwise Rail tracks Floppy disk Bolted joint Socket Incandescent light bulb Floyd Rose Pottery Casting Explosive belt Katana Diving cylinder Lathe (metal) Disc brake Carburetor Sonic the Hedgehog 2 IPod Internal ballistics Timpani Fuse (electrical) Carbon nanotube Die (manufacturing) Derrick (lifting device) Textile manufacturing terminology Fencing Gramophone record Anchor Chopped & screwed Handloading Corrosion Machine tapers Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Drywall Robot Master Oxyacetylene Mercury 4 Equine conformation Hand grenade Sonic screwdriver Mandrel BS 1363 Arc welding Unified Thread Standard Bassoon Reamer Plate armour Protection (climbing) Campfire Motor oil Bulk vending Leica Micrometer Boat building Connecting rod Bicycle frame Knitting Metallurgy Rifle Brazing Dental brace Heckler & Koch G3 Laser Cross-country skiing Stairway Bong Mnemonic San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Nuclear weapon design
