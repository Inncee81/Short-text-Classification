how can i build anyone here know how to build a wooden notepad holder that uses old printing calculator paper tape ribbons with basic woodworking tools like saw miter box or less there were too many that came up in my search so i was wondering if anyone has come across a plan to make this lately sorry precious j you are most definitely not my therapist i happen to believe in recycling i have a office in my home for years i want to recycle the paper that goes with the calculator that just broke yes i had a wooden note pad holder that used them but broke years ago you must have lots of suicides if you regularly address your patients like that licensing board haven't you heard the phrase if you don't know don't answer btw maybe this explanins my mil who refuses meds but has many hobbies i haven't seen any plans for such a notepad but i recall one my parents had that looked fairly simple to make the paper roll sat in a rectangler box that had a lid with hinges mounted on one of the short edges the lid had a wire tied tight between two screws across the lid at the end opposite the hinge the paper came out of the box over the end of the lid and under this wire another wire was tied tight between two screws across the lid at the end near the hinge or it might have been a strip of serrated metal tacked to the lid like you might find on an aluminum foil or plastic wrap box to tear the paper that was pretty much it except for some decoration you would drop the roll of paper into the box and feed the end of the paper out of the box at the end opposite the hinge under the first wire down the lid and then under the second wire or metal cutting strip you would write on the paper on the lid of the box and then pull the paper down under the metal strip and tear it off to take with you Basement Home repair Dehumidifier Autonomous building Road Solar power Poker jargon Houseplant Titanium Windows XP Hydroponics MS-06 Zaku II Septic tank CPU cache Circuit design Hydrogen economy Trademark Animal Crossing Midlothian, Virginia Air conditioning Hard disk Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Piccadilly Circus E85 Cannabis cultivation Apollo Guidance Computer Union Pacific Railroad Overhead lines Toilet paper Domestic water system C programming language Rum Mortgage Objective-C AmigaOS Lionel Corporation Erie Canal Boston Public IBM PC compatible Milwaukee, Wisconsin Publishing DD tank Motorola 68000 Chatsworth House System/34 Surveillance Water tower Plastic Trail Thermal power station Debugging Transportation of Los Angeles Eutrophication Mars, Pennsylvania Renewable energy P-38 Lightning Watercooling Inkjet printer Dynamic Systems Development Method Mac OS X Common Fisheries Policy ZX Spectrum United States House of Representatives Nuclear power Automatic number plate recognition Steam (content delivery) Ammonium nitrate In vitro fertilisation Imperial Crypt Town gas Sewage treatment Motor oil Francis Bacon (painter) 2003 North America blackout MDAC Internet fraud Spring operating system System/36 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Betting (poker) Pretty Good Privacy Computer virus The Miracles Docklands Light Railway Penske Racing Torquay United F.C.
