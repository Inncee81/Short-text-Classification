wood finshing question i made a shelf and i put finsh on it but where i cut it the finsh doesn't look good it's hard to explain i sanded it really good but still the same is there any finsh that will cover the ends really good help surjestions what you are describing is the difficulty with staining the cross grain the other answers are correct in that the cross grain will definitely absorb a much larger amount of stain than the other surfaces here's the reason why a piece of wood is very much like a bundle of microscopic straws laying side by side in multiple layers if you pour water on the sides of the straws it doesn't take much to cover the surface but if you pour water on the end of the straws it takes a lot more water to fill it up so what's the solution now that you've already stained the cross grain there's not much you can do short of cutting the shelf shorter and starting again you could buy moulding or laminate the ends and stain that to match in the future to prevent over absorption of stain by the cross grain apply a coat of shellac to the cross grain before staining the shellac seals the cross grain and limits the amount of stain absorbed Bedbug Leasehold estate Poker jargon Theory of conduct Social rule Avenue Q Estoppel Housing cooperative Public housing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Apartment Babylonian law Plame affair Rent control Harlem Health insurance The Commons Leasing The Inside Humphrey Bogart Mental Health Act 1983 Vista Way 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rosa Parks Karl Rove Rent (musical) National Kidney Foundation Singapore Animal Crossing Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Diseases of the honeybee Prostitution Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Leo Frank Friends Monopoly (game) Contract Freeters The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Meat Loaf Eviction Chatham Square Ashton-Tate W.
