how do you keep a small room with no air conditioner fresh my room is a small room but it has no aircoditioner and it usually feels damp and yucky how can i keep it smelling fresh first step would be to get a dehumidifier damp and yucky mildew mold and lots of germs you could get sick if you can't afford one of those i'm not sure how much they run try putting bowls of salt around i know that salt will absorb moisture from the air also you might try putting out some rice i know it might look odd but i'm trying to offer you some cheap alternatives that are going to fix the underlying problem with it not smelling fresh air fresheners may just make it more damp using a fan to cool the room even a little can help freshen it some since cool air holds less moisture therefore there is less chance for mold bacteria and viruses to grow don't leave dirty clothes in your room they can increase the chance that mold will grow if your room is damp also open your window airing out the room can go a long way towards refreshing it also turning the fan so that it blows out of the window will help to blow out the damp musty air and hasten the process also i have seen in a store in my town called central market a product that they sell that is a lamp made from a large piece of rock salt so if you do put out the bowls of salt maybe rock salt will work better and you should probably figure out a way to heat it a little bit maybe nestle a candle in the middle of it anyway what it does is the light inside of it helps the salt to stay even drier and attract all of the excess moisture in the air and it cleans the air and does all kinds of other neat things i'll include the link it should be the last one down there anyway good luck Inkjet printer Computer printer Plastic Textile manufacturing terminology Drawing Konica Minolta Craps PostScript Upholstery Printing press Digital photography Printmaking T-shirt Mattress Undergarment TeX David Beckham Common Unix Printing System Desk Book Monopoly (game) ASCII art Dot matrix printer Photographic film Mac OS X Bookbinding Ironing Typewriter Paper size Typeface Floppy disk Windows XP Offset printing Open access Solar cell Integrated circuit Commodore 64 Digital camera Universal Serial Bus Printed circuit board Dots per inch RISC Surrealist techniques CPU design Gucci Shirt Textile manufacturing Xerox ZX Spectrum Education in the United States Photography 2D computer graphics HTML Animal Crossing IPod Mars Exploration Rover Outsourcing Polyester Opera (web browser) Mario Postage stamp Bluetooth Redundant array of independent disks Carl Barks Chester Carlson Photocopying Webcomic Linen Editor IBM PC compatible Control character Clothing Staples, Inc.
