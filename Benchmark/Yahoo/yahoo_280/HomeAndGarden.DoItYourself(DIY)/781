should i use colored grout sealer grout dye i tiled my kitchen about days ago everything looks great however the grout lines have already become discolored and i have one oil stain that won't come out i'm guessing that i didn't do a good enough job sealing re grouting is not an option that i want to undertake i don't want to use a harsh chemical to clean because it is a colored grout i wonder if anyone has had any experience with those colorant grout sealers aka grout dye can i effectively recolor my grout line with a colored sealer and once that is cured finish it with a grout sealer finish i've' seen sites like groutarmor com and tilestone ca is this method of restoring grout lines recommended furthermore has anyone had first hand experience and can recommend a brand or company that i can purchase from and do it myself the color of the sealer is a light brown it's called haystack i tried cleaning the grout with vineager water in an inconspicuous area and the grout became discolored i tried again with a different product in a different area and it really discolored the grout line the reason i am interested in the sealer is because i live with messy roomates and the kitchen grout will not last i figured that a colored grout sealer would be best a lot of them have to year warranties where if properly maintained you would only have to reseal once every years if i have to clean the grout before i color the grout that's fine the colorant will evenly coat the grout so the dicoloring from cleaning won't matter after thousands of sq ft of tile and gallons of grout i personally don't like sealers obviously they sell the market pretty much dictates that one must use sigh with all due respect what color might the grout have been most are in colors anyway re grouting would be a mess labor intensive and possibly damage tile i suggest chemicals to at least attempt the cleaning certainly i'd never advise sealing dirt in grout sealer usually is clear as i said i've been at this long time and have always been skeptical of the success rate beyond that sealer needs constant maintenance and re sealing for a dye to be most effective at this point you'll have to clean the tile and grout lines steven wolf Minute of arc English unit Inch Apollo Command/Service Module U.S. customary units History of measurement Metre New York Navy Yard Angle Opportunity rover Fossil fuel power plant Imperial unit Yardarm Lacrosse Grand Union Canal Metrified English unit USS Hoel (DD-533) Metrication arguments and counter-arguments Mount St. Helens Iowa class battleship Tallit Chain (unit) Hurdling Comparative metrology Dimensional analysis Admiral Hipper class cruiser USS Vincennes (CA-44) Sniper Pressure Hume's principle Super Bowl XIII Comparison of Canadian and American football 3.7 Inch Mountain Howitzer R33 World's Fair (New York City Subway car) Stanley Cup HMS Electra (H27) Textile manufacturing Brown v.
