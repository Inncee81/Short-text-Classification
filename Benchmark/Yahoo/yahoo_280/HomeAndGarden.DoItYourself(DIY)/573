clogged toilet pls i need your help right now my cousin went to watch the mets game and i am staying here in his house i used his bathroom and the toilet clogged there's no plunger or wire hangers that i can use there's no liquid that might remove it as well any substitute to remove the clog before he arrives if the water level goes down even if it is slow you can add water slowly that may weaken the plug it my clear up watch close so that you can add the water as fast as it goes down you can take the cover off flush the toilet but only letting in a little water at at time but if it is draining real slow you run the risk of it over flowing it would be best if you had a bucket that you could fill from the bath tub pour that in to the toilet bowl Seismic retrofit Drill bit Screw Light-frame construction Roof Electrical wiring Timber framing Stairway Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Platform framing Stave church Temporal bone Woodworking Ulna Wood carving Fuse (electrical) Solar cell Overhead lines Maxilla Equine conformation Printed circuit board Floppy disk Colditz Castle BS 1363 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Spark plug Straw-bale construction English longbow Palatine bone Naval mine Scapula Avalanche Basement Glossary of firefighting terms Glossary of climbing terms Stopping power Internal ballistics Plywood Knife Optical fiber Violin Whitewater Electrician Sphenoid bone Wood fuel Ground and neutral Rail terminology Nail (engineering) Diamond Casting Geodesic dome Tire Punch card Mouse (computing) Drywall Solar power Glossary of firefighting equipment Enigma machine Hurricane Rita Frontal bone Ice core Wire wrap Occipital bone Harp National Electrical Code (US) Magnet Hand grenade Lathe Spinal cord Log cabin Abdomen Lawn mower Extension Cord Tesla coil Clinker (boat building) Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Mattress Wood Soldering Jack plug Textile manufacturing Christmas tree Electrical wiring (UK) Poker jargon Sternum Light switch Corrosion Tetrapod Mandible Happy Tree Friends 2003 North America blackout Petroleum Distribution board Radius (bone) Urinary incontinence Terminal ballistics Climbing equipment Three-phase electric power
