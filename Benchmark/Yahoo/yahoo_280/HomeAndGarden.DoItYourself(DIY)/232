cockroaches in my mr coffee i am a real slob thats why it started i noticed my first one who always came out the top of my mr coffee now i think their in the eggs etc wirring in the bottem though i do see little ones scamper when i pull the grate out and across to remove the basket for the filter this type of mc has a carafe that need no heat from the bottem so the coffee does not burn away in it i do not want to look for another since my money is tight i know to keep kitchen clean though it may not i don't want to use chemicals since they could go back to the coffeemaker now the colony is bigger seeing more mature dudes in other places i know that i probably will need a new coffeemaker if i am serious about getting rid of them is there a problem if i drink very small cockroaches in my coffee lol thank you i am sorta immune to them in an abcentminded attitude since i lived in an old house at college where there were millions that was a long time ago well ew okay now that i got that out how about putting the mr coffee into the freezer overnight let it return to room temperature before running it and watch for condensation that could cause shorting in the wires the freezing temperature may kill the roaches then i'd run a batch of the vinegar water coffee maker cleaning solution it's just white vinegar run through the coffee maker i guess the only problem i foresee in ingesting cockroach babies or eggs would be if they have been sprayed by or have come into contact with an insecticide then you are drinking some of those chemicals when you include those bugs in your brew cheers to a healthy immune system Band saw Lathe Circular saw Knife Portsmouth Block Mills Wood router Welding Tire Antenna (radio) Guitar Wood carving Movie projector Violin Internal ballistics Sawfiler Fabrication (metal) Gramophone record Metalworking Stairway Textile manufacturing Sword Floppy disk Lawn mower Backsaw Wallpaper group Uniform Resource Locator Machining Casting Shaper P-61 Black Widow Mouse (computing) Heraldry Timpani Milling machine Screw Rail terminology World Wide Web Drill Planetary orbit Forge Tractor Chainsaw VHF omnidirectional range Domain Name System Sawmill Chisel Plane (tool) Japanese tea ceremony Hand saw Fractal Pottery Mars Exploration Rover Wood Radio controlled airplane Figure skating Manifold O scale Open cluster Geodesy Elbow-joint Elevator Bicycle Einstein-Cartan theory Transformer Radar Circuit design Sewing machine Wiki Vise (tool) Bicycle brake systems Website Slashdot trolling phenomena New York City Subway Phonograph Lapping Canal lock Helicopter Rail tracks Oscilloscope File (metalwork) Seismometer Humerus Milling cutter Laser engraving Mandrel Quotation mark Hangul Axe
