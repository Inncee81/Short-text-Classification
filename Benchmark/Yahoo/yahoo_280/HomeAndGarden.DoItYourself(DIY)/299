can i build a partition wall with glass blocks i am want to build a partition wall to make a large bedroom and boxroom into smaller bedrooms it is not a load bearing wall so can i use glass blocks to partition it as one of the rooms is dark and the glass block wall would add some extra light any advice another thought could i just use the glass blocks on some of the top half of a partition wall with all due respect can i depends on a few variables certainly the attempt is valid both your notions are valid as well it might also depend on the intended use of either room in as much as some privacy might be an issue i very much enjoy glass block and as a retro thing they certainly do what karma does go around and come around they can also be found in acrylic lighter in weight as durable as glass and in the same general sense with regard to patterns and privacy block is sold also with framing channels etc for installation for exterior butting walls the install is often done with a type of mortar as is the case with regular block your greatest concern might be in the stability of the wall as opposed to the weight load of it framing a block wall top bottom and sides would aid in that stability you mention of using it as a half wall might mean at some point it wasn't enough or aesthetically pleasing enough those are decisions to be made before the fact however i'd probably choose a half wall first Seismic retrofit Spark plug Drill bit Wrench Plumbing fixture Basement Japanese toilet Soldering Naval mine Tire Kitchen Pliers Bong Residual-current device Solar power Irrigation Handloading Bathroom Knife Toilet Fecal incontinence Big Dig Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Machine tapers Toilet humour Reamer Domestic water system Elevator Rebreather Electrical wiring Menstrual cup Fast bowling Taps and dies Hydraulic machinery Monetary policy Welding The Brady Bunch Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Hogwarts Floor Directory Passenger car Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Strap-on dildo STS-51-L Washroom Glossary of firefighting terms Toilet paper Plame affair Anchor Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Ground and neutral Blood Simple Home repair Atari 8-bit family Rigging Professional wrestling holds Casting War of the Worlds (2005 film) Pipe organ Thermal power station Equine conformation Brazing STS-61 PaX Glossary of firefighting equipment Energy development Novelty (locomotive) HVAC Motor oil USS Trigger (SS-237) Uilleann pipes Soap bubble Super Mario Bros. 3 Pile Universal Serial Bus Trombone Bassoon BS 1363 Fountain pen Daniel Pipes 2000 Australian Grand Prix Electric motor Electrical wiring (UK) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Programming tool Rail terminology Happy Tree Friends Bolted joint Submarine Pottery Johnny 5 Glossary of climbing terms Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Borehole The Sims 2 First Battle of the Atlantic Urinal Dairy
