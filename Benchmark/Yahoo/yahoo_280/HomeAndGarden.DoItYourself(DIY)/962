refinishing floors i've just moved into an old farmhouse where the carpet is older than dirt i lifted a piece of the carpet and saw that there is some type of adhesive it's black so it must be ancient under the adhesive there is solid wood floor i'd like to remove the adhesive and refinish the floor shall i sand off the adhesive or is there a chemical i can use to make the removal process less time consuming thanks in advance i would refinish the floors in this sequence remove nasty carpet and underlay using a clean flat shovel paint scraper or razor blade tool gently scrape all the mess off the wood that you can vacuum the floor well rent a rotary sander looks like a commercial floor polisher from the rental store and buy some sanding pads you might need a few of each grit start with a coarse sanding pad because the adhesive will be coming off on it it will get full of material more quickly than it should changing it will help you do a nice job use progressively finer sanding pads until you have the floor smooth as a baby's bottom sand parts that the rotary sander can't reach by hand vacuum floor very well very important seal the wood with your choice of stain or sealer following the directions on the package by using the rotary sander you will be able to do a fairly fast job my father and i stripped the main floor of our house in a day and our sq ft cement floor back room in one day also it isn't hard just dusty please do yourself a favor and wear a mask otherwise you will have green black material coming out when you blow your nose for a day or two afterwards Adhesive Drill bit Tire Clinker (boat building) Genericized trademark Violin Screwdriver Professional wrestling throws Modem Timpani Hamster Bong Floppy disk Motor oil Electrophysiology Seismic retrofit Spidey Super Stories Radio controlled airplane Aluminium Textile manufacturing Vise (tool) The Inside Loudspeaker Guitar Carburetor Items in the Metroid series Upholstery Woodworking BS 1363 Drill Wrench Printed circuit board Internal ballistics Piledriver (professional wrestling) Drywall Manifold Wonderland (McFly album) Billboard (advertising) Professional wrestling match types Survivor (novel) Dislocation Harmonica Suture Gramophone record Boat building Gag (BDSM) Cello Cyanoacrylate Sandpaper Adhesion Shaggy dog story Staple (fastener) Hand grenade Surveillance You Don't Know Jack Cartridge (firearms) Bicycle frame Die (manufacturing) Propeller Piccolo Junior Saga Plaster Zippo Suppressor Mnemonic Space opera in Scientology doctrine Sin City Piezoelectricity Plywood Drag racing Roswell UFO incident Time Out of Mind Motility Stucco Flash memory Wire wrap Knife Vegeta Friction Bone fracture Ammunition Plastic Metalworking Oxyacetylene Inhalant Snooker Crystallographic defect Letterpress printing Casting Bulk vending Label Straw-bale construction Cell adhesion Hair Incandescent light bulb Battlebots Lighting Cocaine
