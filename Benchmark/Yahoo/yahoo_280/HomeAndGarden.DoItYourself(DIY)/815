how do i keep a plastic pool ladder from floating i tried to tie big rocks sandbags and stuff but it's a bit annoying any other suggestions if the tubes are hollow get a bag of filter sand and fill it with that works well on mine one bag was enough for mine also fill the rest of the ladder with water before putting it back into the pool you'll have to take off the top part of the ladder first of course most should come apart between the legs and the top piece then just pour the sand down the legs if it's an a frame ladder free standing not connected to the deck do a bag in each side Upholstery Casting Plastic Mattress Drill bit Glass Seismic retrofit Wood Woodworking Solar cell Shroud of Turin Wood carving Wind turbine Hemp Pottery Electrophysiology Equine conformation Staining (biology) Wood finishing Alcoholic beverage Textile manufacturing Gramophone record Internal ballistics Hard disk Paint Opportunity rover Tooth enamel Brewery Bong Anchor Extreme Programming Diving suit Flowering plant Tire Knife Beer Fire fighting Naruto jutsu Table tennis Plating Laser engraving Eyepiece Geology of the Moon Yerba mate Flood geology Water purification Unusual types of gramophone record Floppy disk Turquoise Bread Autochrome Lumi__re Crossword Impact crater Heat Nunchaku Poker jargon Dinghy Plane (tool) Diamond enhancement Reinforced concrete Ultraviolet Philosophy of space and time Theory of conduct Hat Cocaine Table saw Baptism Greenhouse effect Golf Gilding Handloading Transformer Primer (paint) Straw-bale construction Leather Naval mine Katana Electron microscope Pebble bed reactor Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Brazing Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Fire extinguisher Cookware and bakeware Drainage Gram staining Scientology beliefs and practices Saw Panama Canal Phase (matter) Volleyball Printmaking Nuclear weapon design Combine harvester Ceramics Ozone depletion
