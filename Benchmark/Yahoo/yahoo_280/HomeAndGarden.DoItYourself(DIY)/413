what is the proper way to paint over paneling we are ameratures hi and you'll have to first sand i don't mean a big horrendous sanding job just roughen up the surface to give the paint something to stick to then you'll need a primer which will prepair the surface for the paint it will also aid in getting a uniform color use a water based primer and you can have it tinted the same color as your paint but i never have then you can paint using a water based paint the differences in finishes are sheen durability and scrubbabillity high glosses are normally used in the kitchen because of cooking and allot of use where the walls will get scrubbed and the bathroom because of moisture the only downfall to the high gloss is it shows all the wall imperfections lower sheen paints such as egg shell or satins are used in family rooms living rooms and bedrooms they get scrubbed but not quite as often flats are used on the ceilings and in the garage where of course doesn't get scrubbed hardly ever the only reason someone might use flat to paint a room is because it's cheaper don't do that though you won't be happy with the outcome use high gloss on all frames and baseboards i don't use oil based primer it's a mess to work with dries slow and is extreamly smelly unless you plan to never paint again don't buy or use cheap brushes that will only give you a cheap looking paint job if you have you'll see what i mean use natural bristles for oil synthetic for water base as for rollers the more textured the wall is the fluffier the roller use smooth rollers for smooth walls use roller tray covers than just toss them out when finished i could go into great details on what kind of tools you'll need what brand which paint or primer to use even how and what to clean up with but i won't you need to discover some of those things on your own everyone's likes and dislikes are different igave you the basics so have fun with it bye Screw Seismic retrofit Wrench Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Kitchen Glossary of firefighting equipment Screw thread Spark plug Plastic Bong Stove Thermal power station Hydraulic machinery Professional wrestling holds Drill bit Carburetor Textile manufacturing Diving regulator Clockwise and counterclockwise Soap bubble Tire Furnace Radio controlled airplane Portable stove Genericized trademark Internal ballistics Violin Professional wrestling throws Wire wrap Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Floyd Rose Two-stroke cycle Hand grenade Dog agility Rebreather Fuse (electrical) Metalworking Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Thermostat Organ (music) Pebble bed reactor Motor oil Hydrogen peroxide Hot air balloon Carbon dioxide Printed circuit board Bolted joint Mars Exploration Rover Fire Solar power Welding Naval mine Snake Mercury 4 Irrigation Steam engine Sling (weapon) Domestic water system Glossary of climbing terms Chevrolet Corvair engine Compiler optimization Siphon Anchor Timeline of invention Rocket fuel Oxyacetylene BS 1363 M16 (rifle) M60 machine gun Universal Serial Bus Cruising (maritime) Apollo 13 Jute Amateur telescope making Shotgun Motorcycle CPU design Novelty (locomotive) Swingout B-47 Stratojet Skateboarding trick Hydrogen economy Saw II Motility Floppy disk Beverage can stove Airbag Casting Gaia Online Snowboard Shaggy dog story Reamer Natural gas
