how do i know if my hardwood floors can be waxed my house is years old and the hardwood floors were installed by the builder when i bought the house the hardwood floors are the tongue and groove planks and have a bit of a shine to them but are losing a bit of their original luster i know there are floors that can't be waxed and i was just wondering how i know for sure if mine can't or can lord knows i don't want to ruin them tia for your replies i would check with the builder first hardwood floors are polyurethaned which would make waxing useless try some of the good hardwood floor cleaners and use them regularly to see if you can get some luster back but it could be they weren't properly polyurethaned if that's the case it could get expensive to have them stripped and redone Seismic retrofit Chimney Masonry St Albans Cathedral Kitchen Stucco Sento Tile Mortar (masonry) Dundas Square Architecture of the California missions Roof Pavement (material) Eifel Aqueduct Diving Drill bit Basement Misi__n San Miguel Arc__ngel de la Frontera Alhambra Mission San Juan Capistrano Washroom USS Vestal (AR-4) Bridgwater Wood Super Metroid Glossary of climbing terms Wallpaper Breastfeeding The Wall Aluminium Blood (computer game) Corrosion Tank Geodesic dome Sauna Antioch, Pisidia The Brady Bunch Reinforced concrete Electrical wiring Pompeii Opportunity rover Portland cement Transformer Arlington House Desert Glacier Nintendo Entertainment System Happy Tree Friends Concrete Fire fighting Ankara Japanese architecture Naruto jutsu Krzeszowice Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Desertification Brazing Violin 10 Downing Street Ceramics Adobe Guitar The Ark in Space Pottery Bass guitar Mahjong Combine (Half-Life 2) Carlsbad Caverns National Park Hulk (comics) Eggerland series Tire Kurt Angle Archimedes Buckingham Palace Thermal power station Home repair Star Wars: Battlefront Fireplace Casting RuneScape quests Air-raid shelter The Legend of Zelda series enemies Equine conformation Ra (board game) STS-114 Fire extinguisher Glossary of partner dance terms Atherosclerosis Temple Mount A151 road Anchor Furnace Semiconductor device Bathing GunZ The Duel Water Lake District Great Wall of China Dam
