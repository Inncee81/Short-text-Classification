how do you lay flagstone we just put in a pool and we were wondering how to lay flagstone around it does anyone know it depends on the kind of stone and the surface you are installing it over if you are installing flagstone into the natural scape like dirt or grass you can dig out a small amount under the stone and place it in gradually the stone will settle in to a natural depth as you walk on it just be sure to keep it maintained by sweeping and pulling weeds around it this application will create what looks like stepping stones wherever you install it if you are installing over a hard surface like concrete you would probably want to fill the entire area so it looks like the entire ground in that area is flagstone if you do that you will have to use a thick mortar bed because the bottom of the flagstone will not be flat use a spec mix or quikcrete and spread it generously in your area lay the flagstone down with as little room as possible between each stone try about of an inch if you can before it dries clean the mortar from between the flagstone leaving a noticeable joint after the stone has dried at least hours pick a grout color and install that in between each stone Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Residual-current device Fuse (electrical) BS 1363 Incandescent light bulb Ground and neutral Alternating current Electrical wiring Distribution board Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Transformer Light switch Electrical wiring (UK) Mercury-vapor lamp Fluorescent lamp National Electrical Code (US) Kitchen Universal Serial Bus Railway signal X10 (industry standard) Street light Enigma machine Spark plug Ring circuit Fireworks Ethernet Lawn mower Wire wrap Circuit design Aluminium Thermal power station Earthing system Dimmer Internet fraud Thermostat Power strip Hand grenade Overhead lines Split phase Buckingham Palace Cliff Richard Seismic retrofit Common electrical adaptors in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom Washroom 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines The Star Wars Holiday Special Family Guy Electrical generator Chandelier Ground (electricity) Three-phase electric power Electricity meter Lineman (occupation) Jack plug Electric motor Episodes of Lost (Season 1) STS-61 Telephone exchange Yoko Ono Surveillance CPU cache World Trade Center bombing Naval mine Sin City Rail terminology Tire Switch Seismometer Suicide methods Modem Light pollution Stage lighting Light rail Computer bus The Matrix Revolutions Relay First day on the Somme Key telephone system Vacuum tube Electrician Railway signalling Love Hina main characters Headlight Fan (implement) Sound recording Telephone switchboard Mains electricity Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Solar power Circuit breaker Automotive lighting War of Currents Mattress George Westinghouse Laptop Piccolo Junior Saga Boom Town (Doctor Who) Care Bears Elevator
