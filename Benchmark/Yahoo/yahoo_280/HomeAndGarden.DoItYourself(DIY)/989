how do you make distilled water at home without fancy equipment quick and easy if i just have to boil it how many times no no no boiling water does not distil it it potentially sterilises it but does not distil it after boiling the water will have an even higher proportion of disolved minerals etc in it than before boil it and then condense the steam on a cold surface and collect the water that runs off that is distilled water a slower way also used as a survival technique for getting clean water from sea water or other undrinkable source even urine get two bottles idealy one transparent fill the transparent one with water then join the two together at the neck then position them so that the one with water in it is in the sun so it heats up and the other kept cool in the shade or covered and angled so that water will collect in the bottom the heat causes evaporation of water in the filled bottle which then condenses in the cooler bottle and collects as distilled water in the bottom of the bottle Drill bit Anchor Seismic retrofit Japanese tea ceremony Textile manufacturing Masonry Tillage Irrigation Casting Flax Equine conformation Drainage Sewage treatment Opportunity rover Naval mine Knife Solar cell Brewery Wood Drowning Eifel Aqueduct Weed control Diamond cut Thermal power station Desert Tuff Roman road Orkney Islands Pile Sundial Death Valley National Park Oak Island Bong Pottery Sento Yosemite National Park Poker jargon Basement Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Diving suit Great Pyramid of Giza Gas metal arc welding Diamond Geography of Bolivia Pavement (material) Illegal drug trade Lighting Mortar (masonry) Paint Blood (computer game) A151 road Architecture of the California missions Upholstery Avebury Skateboarding trick Diving Hamster Sugar beet Lake District 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Stereoscopy Edwards Air Force Base Hard disk Flood geology Manifold Tofu Glass Plaster Lemmings 2: The Tribes Battle of Iwo Jima Aerial (dance move) Geology of the Grand Canyon area Fast bowling Plane (tool) Printmaking Aggregate (composite) Building material Solar power Drywall Lawn Capercaillie Plough Gobi Desert Rail tracks Sidewalk Chaco Culture National Historical Park Swimming pool Chatsworth House Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Wind turbine Fancy rat Strap-on dildo Lechaina Amateur telescope making Fallout shelter
