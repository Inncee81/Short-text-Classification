how do you unclog a sink if drano and liquid plumber didn't work i want to try to do it myself before calling a plumber the sink can drain but it does very slowly don't put any more chemicals down your sink draino liquid plumber and the like don't mix well especially with household chemicals and just because you don't see it doesn't mean they aren't still in the drain buy a snake at the local home depot and use that to unclog the drain if you can get it with a snake then take off the piece of pipe that shaped like the letter j under the sink most clogs happen at that point in the sink if you can't get see a clog there then run the snake through the pipe connecting to the wall while the joint you just took out is still removed and see if you can get the clog there if neither of these work call a plumber because the next step is to snake from the top of the roof and you probably don't want to do that yourself Professional wrestling throws Anchor Glossary of nautical terms Rail terminology Sailing Aerial (dance move) Elevator Rope Rolling-element bearing Textile manufacturing Rigging Blue Man Group Sail-plan Dinghy Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling holds Suplex Roller coaster Glossary of firefighting equipment Marching band Drill bit Mattress Bong Screw Thermal power station Motorcycle Seismic retrofit Electrical wiring Dodge Neon Railroad car Cluedo Hogtie bondage DDT (professional wrestling) Glider Casualty lifting Autogyro M4 Sherman Passenger car Domestic water system Rail tracks Badminton Brewery Cruising (maritime) T-34 Mooney M20 Upholstery Combine (Half-Life 2) Carburetor Drag line excavator Skateboarding trick Fischer Random Chess Wind turbine Paragliding Dairy Yohoho!
