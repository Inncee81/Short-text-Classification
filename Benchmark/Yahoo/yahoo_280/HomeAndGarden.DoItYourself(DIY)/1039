installed nd thermostat i live in a raised ranch house there was only one thermostat installed in the house for both heat and air conditioning it is located on the lower level which is half way below the earth level it works fin in the winter for heating but not very well in the summer for air conditioning gets hot upstairs and always running downstairs to adjust for this problem i installed a very basic honeywell thermostat upstairs fished up the four conductor wire to the new one the wires go to white to w green to g red to rc and blue to y it works but their is one problem when i set the fan to on not auto the air conditioner kicks in the temperature contol has no affect the air conditioner stays on as long as the fan is set to on i know you might say well don't set it to on but sometimes i want to just run the fan by itself what is going on thanks dan the wiring to the thermostat was intended to go to just one thermostat having two of them connected to the same wiring is likely to cause problems especially if one were set to heat and the other to cool but even in the off setting it could have connected outputs together which normally doesnt matter since it isnt feeding them power that cause strange things to happen when the other thermostat is used red is common hot power white is call for heat the blue and green would be for a c and fan not sure which off the top of my head disconnect wires from original downstairs thermostat that run to the furnace if you connect red to white you should get heat probably after a short delay if you connect red to blue you will either get just the fan or the fan with a c the green will do the opposite once you have proved out what wires do what connect the common and heat wires should be the red and the white to the downstairs thermostat dont connect green blue it will now only have control over the heat feed the red green and blue wires to the upstairs thermostat and connect to the fan and a c connections the upstairs thermostat will control fan and a c but not heat most thermostats have a switch which will turn everything off at least as far as that thermostat is concerned never have them both turned on as it might try to heat and cool at the same time not very economical in the summer turn off downstairs thermostat and control a c with upstairs thermostat in winter turn off upstairs thermostat and control heat with the downstairs thermostat Carpet Textile manufacturing Chair Mattress Knitting Textile Strap-on dildo Parachute Upholstery Drill bit Weaving Kimono Knife Plastic Persian rug Heraldry Wool Clothing Cloth Climbing equipment Tent Jennifer Lopez Wind turbine Leather Japanese tea ceremony Fur Jute Undergarment Printed circuit board Tire Equine conformation Bong Fiberglass Camouflage Casting Rigging Pottery Condom Hat Professional wrestling holds Transistor Livestock Symmetry Floppy disk Manual transmission Screw Anchor Violin Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hamster Haircut Gramophone record Mars Exploration Rover Domestic rabbit Stairway Ship Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
