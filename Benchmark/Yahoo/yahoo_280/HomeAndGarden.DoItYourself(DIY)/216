installing outdoor flood lights my house was pre wired by the builder for two floodlights on one switch i have a box with two sets of wires and one ground on the eaves i am trying to install a floodlight and everything i have looked at is only wired for one electrical connection i installed the light but it does not work i am assuming because the second set of wires are an open circuit i capped both individually however i am tryin to figure out a solution to this is there a way fora light wired this way to work with this set up call the builder and ask him what he or his electrical contractor did and why they did not connect the light fixture my guess is that one set of wires is the feed and the other set is the switch leg email me if you want to try to work this out you will need a voltage detector or volt meter Platform framing Stairway Timber framing Electrical wiring Lumber Softball Diamond Screw Drywall Truss Gramophone record Deck (ship) Database Compact audio cassette Carpet Seismic retrofit Cartesian coordinate system Basement Metrication in the United States Plywood IMAX Irrigation Audio tape length and thickness Floppy disk Drill bit Mattress Argyle diamond mine World line Wish You Were Here (album) Laserdisc World Trade Center Metallica Straw-bale construction New York City Subway nomenclature White House Hardness Circuit design Scale model Edison Records Metrication in Canada The Great American Bash Embedded system Synthetic diamond Dynamical system Narrow gauge Baseball field Langstroth hive STS-62 Collapse of the World Trade Center Traffic sign Sound recording Dimensional analysis Knife Electric motor Punch card Chair Chromium Digital video recorder Record producer Honolulu, Hawaii Unity Module Wallpaper group Carbon nanotube Billiards Guitar Tachometer Horsepower Duct tape Typewriter VHS Redundant array of independent disks Diamond cut Suit (cards) Dice Machine vision Kalman filter Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Compact disc Green Day Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Bicycle frame Upholstery Helicopter Rock opera Music genre Apollo 8 Phonograph cylinder Hilbert space Diamond simulant Angle Mouse (computing) Force Phonograph Tensor Opportunity rover Measurement Symmetry Space Nakamichi
