how do i build a base for a shed i am putting up a playhouse for my children and dont particularly want to lay a concrete base do you know of an easier effective alternative i know concrete might sound messy and complicated to deal with but if you choose any other alternative you will probably regret it if you go with wood you would have to raise it above the ground to avoid moisture which would rot the wood and attract insects and rodents it shouldn't be to complex if you are pretty sure that ur ground is solid enough you don't need to reinforce the concrete for a building that size unless you will have brick walls just dig out about inches of dirt and lay plastic sheeting membrane as a moisture barrier and then pour your concrete and trowl it if you want to build it to last longer you can reinforce your concrete slab with mm inch steel mesh and just place it on reo chairs or just small wooden blocks to raise the mesh off the ground then pour your concrete and trowl it that will leave you with a smooth solid floor which will prevent bugs and moisture and last you for as long as you want it to if you have any further questions or would like a sketch of it i'd be happy to help Drill bit Equine conformation Wood carving Screw Timber framing Harmonica Supply and demand Skateboarding trick Krag-J__rgensen Seismic retrofit Nine Inch Nails Woodworking Punt (boat) Tire Glossary of partner dance terms Radio controlled airplane Leaf Cross site scripting Wind turbine AmigaOS Textile manufacturing XML Clinker (boat building) Time Out of Mind Professional wrestling throws Basic English Linked list Gmail Strap-on dildo HTML Katana Preferred number Ajax (programming) Violin Saw Chatsworth House Passenger car Swingout History of the Internet HyperText Transfer Protocol Regular polytope Bicycle frame Ski View camera Fight Club Einstein-Cartan theory Billboard (advertising) M.C.
