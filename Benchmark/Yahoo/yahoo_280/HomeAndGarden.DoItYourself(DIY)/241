aging wood i have some really cheap wood that i used to make something and now i want to age it what is the best way to do so i just use a rag wadded up not folded to apply a stain that way the stain does not go on perfectly even thus leaving light and dark tones the last piece i did was a large chest for the end of a bed i did it with antique blue stain the blue looks like a hundred year old faded paint job some folks use a small propane torch giving light and dark areas before staining keep a damp cloth nearby be sure to go with the grain of the wood so it doesn't look like you're trying to hide something i've seen others actually scratch or ding the material like with a screw driver or a small hammer before and after staining or painting Zippo Pinball Textile manufacturing Pottery Internal ballistics Watkins Glen International Screw GunBound Metalworking Winning Streak Genericized trademark Poker jargon Tire The Joker's Wild Robot Master Lathe Woodworking Mattress Spinning wheel Aerial (dance move) Upholstery Lindy Hop Cotton mill Cotton Kurt Angle IPod Syd Barrett Chopsticks Trolling for fish Figure skating Billiards Taps and dies Undergarment Heckler & Koch G3 Super Metroid Clinker (boat building) Drill bit Spinning (textiles) Disc brake Bicycle Wrench DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Snooker Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Harmonica Professional wrestling match types Timpani Hangul Weaving Textile manufacturing terminology Dredge Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) Atari 8-bit family Our Gang Wheel of Fortune Double bass The Invisibles Grimes Graves Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Tampon Remix Propeller StarCraft Secret Missions Sega Dreamcast Glossary of climbing terms Floppy disk Punt (boat) 1957 World Series Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency Beatmania IIDX Obi-Wan Kenobi Fecal incontinence Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Gristmill Coir Slashdot subculture Autobot Matrix of Leadership Mercury 4 DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Michael Moore Mouse (computing) Gear Slot machine Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Lighter M-209 Rain Man Big band Basic English Steering Knitting Characters in the Smurfs DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Firearm Tattoo Body of Song Stranger in a Strange Land Sail-plan Sandpaper
