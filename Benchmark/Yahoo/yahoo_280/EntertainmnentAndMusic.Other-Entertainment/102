how long do u stay high off of weed for is it a long time and how do u feel does it make u lose weight you stay high about a couple of hours but when you are high you are not really sure how long you have been that way it is a good feeling i hate to admit that i like it even though i no longer do it because i have a child now you feel kind of disconnected from the world it also just makes you relaxed but it can make different people feel different ways i have friends that have tried it that did not like it and did not feel good when on it it can also make some people feel paranoid i also felt sleepy when on it kind of goes along with the relaxed feeling also the longer you go without eating because you will get the munchies when you are high the longer the feeling lasts but in response to the question of weight loss no if anything you gain weight because it has a tendency to make you hungry Binge eating disorder Social rule Fasting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Amazing Race Hikikomori Atkins Nutritional Approach Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Sleep apnea Mojave people Infantilism Borderline personality disorder Poker jargon William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham Rei Ayanami Singlish Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Abortion debate Weight training Felis sapiens Karen Horney Adjustable gastric band Insomnia Alignment (role-playing games) Year of the Spider Gasoline Diarrhea Sola fide Kodocha Urinary incontinence Adoption Knife Fecal incontinence Hot air balloon Sara Sidle Sleep debt The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jeff Gannon 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Religious Society of Friends Cindy Sheehan Premature ejaculation Kasparov versus The World Ken Jennings Obesity Menstrual cup Aspartame Diabetes mellitus Weight loss Atomism Gliding Oral contraceptive Anger management Humphrey Bogart Transactional analysis Theodicy Garfield Jumpstart 3rd Grade Childbirth Stomach cancer Gender role W.I.T.C.H.
