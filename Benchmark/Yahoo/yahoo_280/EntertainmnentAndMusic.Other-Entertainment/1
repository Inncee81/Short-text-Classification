guitar help ok heres the deal i have been playing guitar for a few years but i only own an acoustic and a classical nylon string i am looking for a electric guitar and dont know what i want i like pretty much andy music as long as its good rocks and alternatives my faovurite arctic monkeys kooks bloc party i like the look of the epiphone gibson les pauls but im not a big fan of metal in fact i hate metal and when i youtubed les pauls i could only find people playing metal on them so the next guitar i looked at was a fender telecaster standard im not made of money but unfortunatly my parentals dont like the look of them which sucks considering theyre my funds is there a guitar for me that looks good and sounds like a tele and if not whats something i can tell my parents to convince them to let me get the tele ten points for the best answer first of all les pauls are not only metal guitars they've been around since the early 's and have been used to play every type of music a guitar has been used for the reason people use them for metal is because they have a beautiful tone long sustain and high output so you can get crunchy rhythm and searing leads the one disadvantage they have for metal is lack of easy access to the higher frets from to because the neck heel joins the body at the th fret i guess this can be a disadvantage for any type of music but especially metal since a lot of soloing uses the higher notes i use mine for everything including metal but mostly for blues jazz and rock if you are used to playing acoustic guitar a les paul would be perfect for you because it sounds great and you'd already be used to not having easy high fret access but a les paul plays like butter compared to an acoustic so you really can't go wrong with one why do you think every big name guitarist owns one even strat players like stevie ray vaughn and jimi hendrix had les pauls telecasters are also great guitars and you can get a variety of sounds from them but they don't seem to be as tonally diverse as les pauls they may have slightly better high fret access but they're used mostly for country rock and some blues because of their characteristic bright twang they were the first production model electric guitar ever then known as the broadcaster hence their classic look and feel they also play very well and they're made by fender so they are great quality by the way don't get any les paul other than a gibson at least not a cheap knock off esp makes nice copies as does prs some better quality guitar companies make ok knockoffs but the real thing is the way to go stratocasters are also very nice and very tonally diverse and they offer excellent access to the entire fretboard if you play electric guitar you must own a stratocaster because everyone whos anyone has used them on their records and they sound great they have a scale which is a bit longer than the gibson scale so your hands have to adapt to longer stretches and this also affects the tone and string bending ability the longer scaled strings are under higher tension to maintain the same pitch as shorter scaled instruments such as the les paul and consequently the strings are a little more difficult to bend on a strat but that shouldn't be a factor in your decision because your hands will just become stronger there are a ton of different strat copies out there but i would suggest just spending the extra money from the start to purchase a quality fender and avoid the knockoffs inlcuding fender's own squier this will assure that you have a good quality instrument that won't hinder your playing and you won't have to upgrade at any point you then later have the option to just pick up a different type of guitar another big decision making factor is what sound you're after because strats and teles use single coil pickups while les pauls use humbuckers single coils have more bite they're brighter sounding and they produce a little hum whereas humbuckers have a warmer sound and buck the hum so you don't have to deal with amp noise but you can always swap out your pickups later and use single coil soapbars or coil taps in place of humbuckers for a single coil sound or use a stacked humbucker in place of a single coil for a humbucking sound i've heard from other guitarists that les pauls equiped with coil taps can achieve sounds similar to a telecaster listen to some of your favorite artists and see what they play if you want to achieve something similar to that sound then get a guitar similar to what they use if you want both humbucking and single coil sounds get a fender fat strat with a humbucker in the bridge position so if i were you i would get either a les paul or a stratocaster les paul would be my first choice because that's just my personal preference but a strat is probaly the best electric guitar in the world and perfect for a beginner strats are more affordable as well when comparing lower end models of strats and les pauls the latter are a bit more expensive or you could forget everything i just said and go buy a prs with a compromising scale beautiful tone looks and great playability oh and if you do get a strat get one with a tremolo vibrato bridge and learn how to use it hope that helps Blues Gibson SG Harp Pickup (music) Effects unit Saxophone Brian May Acoustic guitar PRS Guitars Blood on
