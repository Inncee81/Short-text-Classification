how to swim i never got around to it oh and will your head easily float above the water then how do you start moving oh and after i learn do you think it would be embarrasing to have a floatie like the circle just so you can lie down when you're at the beach thx your chest is what keeps you afloat in the water because your lungs are filled with air you still have to keep at least a little lateral motion going when you're floating on your back or your legs will hang down and you do have to use a little neck muscle to keep your face above the water while floating on your back if you float on your stomach you have to use your neck muscles to lift your face out of the water every seconds to take a breath of air remember panic is what kills people when they drown if you body was thrown in the water while you're alive it will bob to the surface almost immediately the more salt in the water the better the bouyancy you just keep slowly using your closed finger hands rotating like a windmill to keep you aloft enough to keep your face above the surface and you can open your eyes safely under water fresh water is better for that though because salt water makes your eyes sting a little when you do it in the ocean i've been a strong swimmer my whole life and i highly recommend you learn not just for the life saving skill that enables but for the sheer fun of it swimming is fun as hell don't miss out on one of life's greatest pleasures Drowning Diving Swimming Breaststroke Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling holds Butterfly stroke Backstroke Front crawl Equine conformation Anatomical terms of location Suplex Professional wrestling attacks Lung First aid Sin City Swimming pool Ecco the Dolphin Personal flotation device Bong Tetrapod Naruto jutsu Blood (computer game) Swingout Diving suit Happy Tree Friends Shark Frogman Suicide methods History of swimming Kitesurfing Sailing Unreal Autopsy Aikido Doom enemies Mercury 4 Medley swimming Boxing Crocodilia Cat Diver rescue Eye Professional wrestling aerial techniques Fishing Volleyball Rebreather Conker's Bad Fur Day Lifeguard Scuba set Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Fugu Weight training Skateboarding trick 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Waterworld Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Piece minor characters Water Buoyancy compensator Snorkel Muscle The Legend of Zelda series enemies Humerus Paragliding Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Shaggy dog story Tenshinhan Triathlon Naval mine The Amber Spyglass Mattress Swimsuit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma GunZ The Duel Eye movements Table tennis Fast bowling Professional wrestling match types Eryops Orca Tag Lemmings 2: The Tribes Horse Sport rowing RMS Titanic Glossary of climbing terms Neckbreaker Panama Canal Uncanny Valley Wave power Combine (Half-Life 2) Water (molecule) Human anatomy
