do you think that girls should wear make up i think that natural beauty is best and that make up is only worn because of the media and insecurities the media shows girls how they should look so they copy it am i crazy in thinking that the world would be better if no one wore make up and had to strive for unrealistic beaty or am i just some wacko who is going against the norm and should be corrected i've never been one to wear a lot of make up and i often receive compliments from both men and women because of it i feel that my face looks washed out w o any make up so usually i try to leave the house with a little eyeliner blush and eye shadow pretty lightly and lipstick just a couple of shades darker than my actual lip color many people think i don't wear any make up at all because it's so subtle but i think it's just a matter of personal taste a friend of a friend of mine i just don't understand how she applies her make up whenever i see her i'm always taken aback because she wears very bright eye shadow and her blush looks like she just puts big red spots on the sides of her face i mean it's her face to do what she wants but i can't understand how anyone looks at themselves in the mirror looking like a clown and thinks my face looks better like this than w o any make up at all but to each her own you know i just remember years ago on tv could have been on oprah that someone was giving make up tips and they said that your everyday make up should be unnoticeable meaning that it should only accentuate your natural features others shouldn't be noticing what colors you have on your face Cosmetics Social rule Lipstick Theory of conduct Physical attractiveness The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Amber Spyglass Gender role Cliff Richard The Shining (film) Color theory Diamond Oprah Winfrey The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends Paul Is Dead Lucille Ball The Emancipation of Mimi Sunglasses Jon Secada K' Aesthetic Realism Humphrey Bogart Empire Burlesque Eye contact Cat coat genetics Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Drawing Time Out of Mind Clothing Unreal Marilyn Monroe The nature of God in Western theology Horse Koopa Kid Color Mario series enemies Negima Scenes from a Memory Eye color Socrates Spice Girls Britney Spears Philosophy of language Grace Cossington Smith Joker (comics) Barbie Ayumi Hamasaki Current teachings of Prem Rawat Angel One (TNG episode) Eye Spidey Super Stories Kylie Minogue Atomism Yu-Gi-Oh!
