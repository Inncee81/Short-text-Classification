would you defend someones rights beliefs even if they are not your own it's funny but i thought that as americans we are suppose to do this very act and on a regular basis i'm certain that many of you will initially think yeah i do that all the time but i bet you're not telling the truth the reason i ask such a question is because of responses i've gotten on this forum i've asked and commented upon people's rights to chose if they can do drugs and then have been called a drug user myself i am not one i have stated that homosexuals should have rights and then have been called gay which i am not with that logic if i believe in civil rights then i must be black here i must be crazy but i was thinking that we are suppose to emulate such people who do exactly what i am trying to do i thought we are suppose to revere characters like atticus finch from to kill a mockingbird and george bailey of it's a wonderful life are they not our rolemodels but i must be mistaken it's sad isn't it frustrating and hope stealing whether it's an idea portrayed in america or not it's an idea that is positive and should be acted out and upon more frequently than not we've become a billion individual voices instead of a billion voices together equality is no longer an issue but self proclomation is now a goal in general the idea isn't to live and let live but to persuade and or con to believe my way i believe in choice so long as it does not imminently affect lives or a life of another as an example if bob is gay it does not pose a life threat on anyone or myself if mary is catholic it does not pose a life threat on anyone or myself that is her life this is mine i don't stand up for someone's religion becuase i believe it but i stand up for it becuase i believe that that person has free right to believe in what religion they choose to without descrimination i won't go into detail about drug use becuase there are many negative factors to consider to wrap it up you're absolutely right as a people what are we doing we don't expand our minds beyond our own hands feet and satisfaction Theory of conduct Same-sex marriage in Canada Libertarianism Sexual orientation Coercion Homosexuality and Christianity Ethics Abortion debate Homophobia Objectivist philosophy Civil rights Federal Marriage Amendment Theodicy Plame affair Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religion Free will Peter Singer The nature of God in Western theology Internet troll Religious conversion Polyamory Social rule Liberalism Little Britain Bayesian inference Scientology beliefs and practices David Hume Predestination Determinism Property (ownership right) Friedrich Schleiermacher U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Constitution of Ireland Roman Catholic Church Same-sex marriage Social psychology Summa Theologiae Microeconomics Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Estoppel Rush Limbaugh Rick Santorum Meaning of life Causality Biology and sexual orientation The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Humphrey Bogart Simone Weil Conservatism She Loves You Infantilism Reality Whose Line Is It Anyway? 2004 Republican National Convention Lawrence v.
