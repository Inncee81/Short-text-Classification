are you the same in the 'virtual' world as you are in the 'real' world i mean do you behave the same way or are do you do or say things that you would never do in the real world because you know you are never going to meet these ppl for real i would say i'm pretty much the same however i am bolder in that i ask questions that i wouldn't necessarily ask 'real' friends and i'm more forward in that i wouldn't approach total strangers in 'real' life and just strike up a conversation how about u dan i wtf i really really hope you're not like that in the real world coz if you are i would be very very worried sarah that's an interesting point alot of ppl don't realise they can be traced through their i p address so if they commit a crime in the virtual world they can be prosecuted in the real world it helps if you know a police officer though that's a really good question as i've been wondering that sometimes you see such nasty rude answers and i think surely in the 'real world' people are nt like that on the same note when someone says something or takes the time out to find you some information or share their knowledge with you i wonder are they doing it for me or for the points thats the cynic in me but its nice to see actually people in the main seem to be saying they are as they appear a few years ago i was a rather selfish being just had been through some hard times and felt like the world owed me but after in having to undergo huge operations and hairloss after it was found i had tumours i really changed and the me i put out there now is the me i am with everyone and i'm proud of this person i say what i think i treat as i am treated and i really want to help support laugh with empathise with everyone i really feel strongly that our beautiful country is all too easily slipping inot a civil war of sorts where we're all afraid of oyr 'neighbour' and dont take the time out this is a good starting point to extend love to someone we most likely wont ever know out of here sorry deviated a bit x Theory of conduct Social rule EastEnders God Emperor of Dune Milton H.
