what can ease drug comedowns hang overs ketmaine speed hi everyone my friends have just bought a night club and the drugs are flowing freely but they seem to be spending the majority of their time crashing to the depths of hell does anyone know any definite help that can ease comedowns please don't say not to take drugs in the first place lol sometimes it is part of the package of being club owners i've heard about vitamine b is that true what have you tried tested and proven thanks a million xx ps i thank you not to simply respond with 'don't take drugs they are bad' i am only asking for any advice with the comedowns not whether my friends should take drugs or not thanks we are in the uk o k the obvious don't do it but anyway with that out of the way and having been to the depths of hell myself i know that's easier said than done without suggesting other 'street drugs' maybe they could go to a doctor and get some valium or halcyon if you can get those there i'm in canada tell the doc that owning a night club is stressful need something to cope but beware taking a lot of k works as a 'depressant' ergo be careful with other 'downers' vitamins are always good i take them 'religiously' a multi and a b compound if i forget to take them maaannn does my drag i don't know that the vitamins necessarily help w the actual d t 's but if someone is using a lot of 'drugs' then it's most likely they're not 'eating very well' so vitamins are good in that sense i also drink ensure the kind with calories it's a meal replacement drink i'm sure you've something similar in the u k sometimes that can also be prescribed by a doc here anyway they are awesome p s speed seems to be the worst drug so far as the d t 's go i wish you all luck and for the kiddies remember try hugs not drugs geezzz i just read your first answer no no no no no no no no no no no oxycontin may very well help 'in the moment' but it's an opiate another very addictive drug 'withdrawal' from that is a different kind of hell the only good thing about getting 'hooked' on that is that you can 'go on' methadone to 'get off' but really why go through all that too two addictions two trips to hell such a vicious circle take care Addiction Drug addiction Arguments for and against drug prohibition Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Clinical depression Theory of conduct Harm reduction Social rule Little Britain Drug abuse A Course In Miracles Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Anorexia nervosa Illegal drug trade Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medical prescription Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Cocaine Prostate cancer Controversies in autism Internet troll Migraine Avenue Q Prohibition (drugs) Fecal incontinence Hypoglycemia Characters in the Smurfs Obesity Osteoarthritis Coeliac disease Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Ketamine Nutrition Fitz Hugh Ludlow Methamphetamine Veganism Customs and etiquette of Japan Physician Howard Hughes About a Boy Bradley Nowell The Beach Boys Medicine Hiberno-English Drug test Religion Breastfeeding Paroxetine Capitalism Dieting Red Hot Chili Peppers Multiple sclerosis Isotretinoin MP3 Pharmaceutical company Paragliding The Emancipation of Mimi Cheating in Counter-Strike Antidepressant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Benzodiazepine Rush Limbaugh American and British English differences Insomnia Dog Retinol EastEnders Quicksort Diego Maradona Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Taxi Driver The Amber Spyglass Shit Plame affair Opioid Psychopharmacology Alcoholic beverage Pitaten Fast bowling Motivation Cancer Dennis Hopper Psychiatry
