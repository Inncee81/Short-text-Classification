should more restrictions be placed on welfare recipients welfare has existed for many years however it has not been so widely used as it is today my mother recieved welfare for three months while in between jobs however there are many who not only live on welfare but conceive and give birth multiple times while on welfare i see nothing wrong with giving someone a hand up when they are having trouble i do have a problem with giving a hand out to people who simply abuse a system created to help those in need especialy when it is at taxpayers expence what if any restrictions should be placed on welfare what would be the long term and short term impact not only economicaly but socialy as well if harsher restrictions were implimented would it increase or decrease crime and would it overflow the job market with unskilled labor also those whom recieve an education through welfare should they be made to pay back the cost of said education very interested to see the responces i think the only way to really deal with this would be to put some kind of time limit or child restriction on it i really don't think people should be allowed to have children as in become pregnant and give birth while they're on welfare birth control no matter what the cost is not as expensive as having a child and people totally take advantage of the system by having another child as soon as their checks are about to stop coming in i don't know what it would do about crime i don't even understand crime my mindset is completely different will education lead to less crime studies have proven this but it's a matter of parents that aren't having children to get a welfare check and having children that they can love nurture educate correctly not about how to mooch the system and actually want for a reason other than the money that they'll get for the next few years basically it's infuriating that as a college student that only makes enough money to cover my tuition per year is taken out of my check for taxes i'm sure a huge portion of which is going to people that make the choice not to work Unemployment Education in the People's Republic of China Economics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Inflation Publicly funded medicine Education in the United States Health insurance Flat tax Abortion debate Tuition Credit card Welfare Supply and demand FairTax Tax Arguments for and against drug prohibition Medicare (Canada) Domestic violence Education in England Social welfare Education in Germany Theory of conduct Poker jargon Education Public policy Child support Psychiatric hospital Economic inequality Life insurance Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Democracy Moral Politics Public domain Divorce Marriage Privatization Bretton Woods system Free trade Centrelink Mach kernel Freeters Blackjack Labour economics Graduate school Liberalism Welfare reform Academia Intelligence quotient Slot machine Capitalism Abortion Ghetto Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of the United States Keynesian economics Progressive tax Tariff GED Debugging Insurance Price discrimination Simone Weil Wal-Mart Adoption New Deal Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Childbirth American Conservatism Social Security (United States) Betting (poker) School choice Carburetor Redundant array of independent disks Separation of church and state Israeli Arab Unemployment benefit Humphrey Bogart Taxation in the United States Trade union Hillary Rodham Clinton American individualist anarchism Property (ownership right) Criticism of libertarianism Subsidy Wealth Model (economics)
