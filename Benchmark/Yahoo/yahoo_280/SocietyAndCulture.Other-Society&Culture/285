eye for an eye tooth for a tooth when i returned back to work after a hospital operation my work collegue who is also a friend who i sometimes go for drinks with didn't even ask me how i was i was away for a week and still to this day she hasn't even ask me anything about it even though we sit nex to each other at work i was quite upset now some time later she too has returned from a stay in hospital after an operation but i still cant forget the time she completley ingnored me and showed a lack of interest into my wellbeing i am feeling like doing the same ignoring the fact she's been away just to give her a tase of her own medicine should i i have been in exactly the same situation in my case i was rushed off to hospital at high speed in the back of an ambulance i spent four weeks in there and for the first ten days i was hanging on to life by a thread within minutes of me returning home my neighbour who is also a friend and fully aware that i have pulmonary fibrosis a progressive and incurable condition came round to say she'd been frantic with worry not relating to my health at all but because she couldn't get into my place to help herself to the contents of my fridge and fruitbowl to save it being wasted before i could even speak she asked me to give her a spare set of keys to my home because she knew i'd been shopping the day before and that my fridge would be full up i told her not to worry as my mum has a set of keys and always takes anything perishable from my fridge whenever i'm in hospital for more than a few days at my request so nothing goes to waste i couldn't believe that this person who calls herself a good friend of mine could be so callous and while i deplore the idea of any food being wasted given the number of starving people in the world i still find it incredible that she could value a few pieces of fruit and a couple of pints of milk at a higher price than my life it was a real shock to discover just how selfish and inconsiderate she really is this all happened about three months ago since which she has been in hospital to have a baby poor thing the baby not her when she got home i went round to see the baby and her asked if she was alright and if there was anything she wanted or needed she wasted no time at all sending me off on various shopping sprees regardless of how ill i happened to be at the time and i stupidly perhaps obliged but i can say i have derived a certain degree of satisfaction from not allowing myself to be reduced to her level even though she did only go into hospital to have a baby it's not as if she was ill or has been since so my advice to you would be to show a certain amount of concern for her following her operation and don't bring yourself down to her level believe me it won't make you feel good if you behave just like her and you never know it might even trigger a pang of conscience in her although i wouldn't hold your breath by the way although i don't know you i do know there isn't a surgical operation that could be described as a remotely pleasant experience so i for one hope that you're fighting fit again and wish you all the best for the future take care michael Theory of conduct Breastfeeding About a Boy Jon Secada Kodocha Knots Landing Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Altruism The Contender (television series) Shaggy dog story Childbirth Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) God Emperor of Dune Humphrey Bogart IBM PC compatible Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices CPU cache Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Mach kernel The Emancipation of Mimi The Amber Spyglass Neighbours Milton H.
