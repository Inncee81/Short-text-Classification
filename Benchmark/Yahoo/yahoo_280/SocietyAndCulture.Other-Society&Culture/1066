do you have a friend that is popular in school like me i had a so called friend last year in school and i really wasnt her friend because she annoyed me and everybody else around me and even though people think she is popular i personaly thought she was a loser because i had found out that she does marujona i cant spell it right anyways i found out because i heard her ask her friend if they woluld like to do it marujona on the weekends i also saw a little baggie in her empty purse but i personaly didnt like her i mean she used to be cool one year and then the next year she was rude mean and hateful she cussed out a year old on the bus when he was clearly being nice to her none of my friends liked her and i stoped liking her the year she started being rude to people i just found it hard to tell her i dont want to talk to her anymore becasue we had to ride the bus to go home everyday the only we talk anyways did you or do you have a friend like that oh so you know the only time i talked to her was when we were on the bus so i thought i would just go along and just talk to her on the bus since it was just on the bus i would think talking to her wouldn't hurt anything as long as you realize she's headed in a different direction than you apparently are being open to talk to her on occasion might also keep a door open for her at a time when she really needs a friend be a positive influence for her but not at the expense of you own principles Kodocha Shaggy dog story Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Avenue Q Azumanga Daioh Ron and Fez Garfield Friends Theory of conduct Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pitaten Hubert H.
