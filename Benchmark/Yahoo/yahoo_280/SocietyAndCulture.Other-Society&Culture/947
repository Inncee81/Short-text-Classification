why are parents creating an entitlement generation of spoiled self indulged brats hi this question goes only to people past age what do you think of the new entitlement generation term for teens youth of today i have many teenage realatives and it sickens me to see all these young teenagers lavished by their parents with brand new cars i pods cell phones and everything else parents foot the bill for everything and these kids act like money grows on trees why do parents today think that parenting means being a friend and giving kids all these material things they havent worked day for kids probably think they should be paid just for getting dressed in the morning thats not how the real world is whats the deal discuss i find it frightening to be honest mine grew up with a very clear sometimes too clear realisation of just how much money i did or did not have to this day i could sob at a few of the discussion we would have before going to the supermarket about please do not ask for anything outside of what i put in the basket but on a brighter side my kids now have a work ethic like you would not beleive they have seen me do jobs that they know i hate just to bring in some extra money and they also know that what they did get was freely given and with all my love and whilst they might not have got everything they wanted they did not go without i also taught mine that i am not their friend never have been never will be but i am their mother and will hold that title for ever and as such will love them forever also as they have grown up they have seen experienced friends stabbing them in the back falling by the wayside when things got tough etc now that things are much better money wise for us we can all still recall those days and have no intention of going back to them and both of them work hard enjoy their lvies but save pay them self first etc very hard as well they also know that before anything else happens bills etc must be paid the parents that give everything and then some are truly not doing their kids any favours as this lifestyle will be expected to be maintained throughout their adult lvies and can see a whole generation coming unstuck at the first sign of a problem due to lack of money as they will always live far beyond their means at the school i taught in there was a reward system and i was instructed to reward this certain child for coming to school with a pen and a book all but lost my job when i refused the gournds of my argument was that if he ever got off his butt to get a job no employer was going to reward him for showing up on time with his unform on apart from getting a pay check at the end of the week and basically was told that we must fulfill their sense of self worth yeah right get right on that not regards ok stepping away from the key board lol lol One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Quarashi Poker jargon Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution EastEnders Pitaten Saved by the Bell Kill Bill Contract The Contender (television series) The Fairly OddParents Boston Public Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye Education in the People's Republic of China Friends Vegeta Insurance Shaggy dog story Money Hikikomori Microeconomics Education Theory of conduct Freeters Avenue Q About a Boy Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Summa Theologiae Scientology beliefs and practices Motion picture rating system The Amber Spyglass Humphrey Bogart Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Obi-Wan Kenobi Great Teacher Onizuka Tupac Shakur RuneScape quests W.I.T.C.H.
