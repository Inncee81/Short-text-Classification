i feel lost in life dunno where to go or what to do please give me some advice serious advice thanks in advance hm im and feel like my life will be wasted not knowing what i want to do i think pronouncing the guy depressed at this stage is a little premature i remember feeling the same way at twenty one in fact throughout my early twenties you're taught to believe you should have it worked out by now you should have qualifications and one foot on the path to where you want to be in the future i'm not convinced that's how it works for most people there's always going to be some people you know who are certain what they want and are single minded about getting it don't let that make you feel inadequate imagine all the opportunities you miss if you are single minded you need to decide what's important to you try not to think too much about 'the future' or 'wasting your life' the future is uncertain and forgive me if this sounds patronising at you're probably judging 'wasting your life' by other people's standards by what's expected of you so what do you want money experience knowledge relationships what do you value most i'd be wary of chasing money at this point money is transient it comes and goes all the other things are permanent they're your life and you get to keep them so i would define a wasted life as one solely focused on career and financial gain unless that's what you love doing who do you admire and why that's admire not envy careful with that one the simple answer is to try everything that appeals to you no matter how off the wall or what anybody else thinks sounds cheesy but follow your heart go travelling read some books meet some people volunteer create something get a job if you want one the only way you can really waste your life is if you don't do what you want to but if nothing appeals to you and you're having trouble with the basics i e getting out of bed in the morning then you may benefit from talking to your doc either way you'll be fine just stop everything for a while and put some serious time into thinking about yourself and what you want the answers will come Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles W.
