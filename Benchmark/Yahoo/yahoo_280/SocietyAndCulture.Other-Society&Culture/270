is it true that brad pitt is opening a sperm bank is it ethical legal i heard on television and even saw on the net that brad pitt is selling his sperm to a select group of women there was actually a poll done on the world's most beautiful man and majority of people from all the continents agreed that he is the most beautiful i heard that he said that there are women that want beautiful babies so of course they'd go for him well i don't have that much money but i too would like to have his sperm and have his child i know with his sperm that i'll have a gorgeous little boy or girl i want his sperm p s my friends and i are in highschool and we're saving up money to have his sperm my suggestion is for you and your friends to continue saving your money and invest it in your future education even if this rumor were true who is going to support financially the child brad hahahahaha he may have a lot of money but certainly he is not going to spend it on raising a string of test tube babies with half of his dna you will be the one supporting and raising the child and that you can do better with a better education no matter who the father of your child may be a child is not a toy it is a human being it deserves to be raised by a set of loving caring parents who can afford to give the child care comfort food shelter clothing and an education of it's own just ask your parents how much work a child is if you want to have brad pitt's baby then start a business making brad pitt baby dolls and sell them you'd be better off brad would be better off and you would spare a whole bunch of pitt babies an upbringing they don't deserve go to school let brad worry about brad and you worry about your future not a brad baby EastEnders Abortion debate In vitro fertilisation Friends William Pitt the Younger Angelina Jolie Transsexuality Jon Secada Adoption Infantilism Hillary Rodham Clinton Father Britney Spears Breastfeeding Charles Lee Ray Kodocha Comanche Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Little Britain Romulus and Remus Bradley Nowell Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Economic inequality My Life as a Teenage Robot Simone Weil For Better or For Worse The Drifters The Incredibles Rais massacre The Amber Spyglass Microcredit Married... with Children Destiny's Child Parenting Fathers' rights Sharon Tate Personal finance Sunset Beach (soap opera) Polyamory Infertility Abortion in the United States Avenue Q Justification (theology) Capital accumulation Alois Hitler Whale Terri Schiavo Artificial insemination Theory of conduct One Life to Live Sears Holdings Corporation Doll Bank AFI 100 Years series The Beach Boys Empire Burlesque Sexual intercourse Charmed U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 John Money 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Descendants of Darkness Hilary Duff Eugenics Autism rights movement Frankie Laine Jeopardy!
