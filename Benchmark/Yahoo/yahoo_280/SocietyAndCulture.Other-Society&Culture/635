shouldn't celebrities have a minimum of questions and answers on yahoo answers obviously yahoo answers is open to anyone with a yahoo account well until they violate the guidelines but these celebrities sign up with their agents then they come up with a decent question to ask then they are shown as official and the question is highlighted and deemed important so hundreds or thousands of people answer the question yet most of the time that celebrity never actually picks a best answer most of those questions are still open after months have passed it is obvious that the said celebrity is not even paying attention to the question so they don't even care what the answer is i notice that a lot of hard working answering people will get their account deleted because of one bad answer or question even though they are just explaining their point of view but they are at least making decent contributions to the answers communities and since celebrities are above normal answers people then they need higher standards and should have to participate more i am pretty sure that bill s is senile i've only seen a couple of questions by celebrities or more likely by their agents who apparently don't have enough real work and i only actually read one of them and i don't remember what it was that tells you how much i pay attention to famous people but if they do post a question they should be required to abide by the same rules we do if they let it go to a public vote it shouldn't stay on the board any longer than ours but better yet they should pick a best answer themselves or else not even bother asking it they have loyal fans who take the time to answer a question expecting that the movie star or whoever will actually read it it shows a lack of respect when they don't read it at all but relegate the whole process to their agents Theory of conduct Plame affair Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus $ale of the Century Wheel of Fortune Altruism The Internet Movie Database The Apprentice 2 Poker jargon GED E-mail spam Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses H2G2 Public-key cryptography National Football League Equal Protection Clause 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Open Directory Project U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Intelligent design movement GNU General Public License Health insurance Match Game Salary cap Discordianism Philosophy of language Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Philosophical skepticism Supreme Court of the United States Contract Article One of the United States Constitution Parliament of Canada John Lott Karl Rove National Kidney Foundation Singapore Creation-evolution controversy Freedom of information legislation Floppy disk Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Copyleft Intelligent design Scientology beliefs and practices Unemployment Hollywood Squares Live 8 Philosophy of mathematics Bill Maher Microeconomics Samuel Goldwyn Jacob Neusner Infant baptism 2003 California recall Extreme Programming First Amendment to the United States Constitution Education in Romania Avenue Q Mensal__o scandal 9/11 conspiracy theories Separation of church and state in the United States Administrative law of the United States Life insurance Socrates Sarbanes-Oxley Act Young Earth creationism I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Terrell Owens Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe SAT Ronald Dworkin Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Philosophy of science Second language acquisition Little Britain Family Feud 2channel Game show Stochastic process Password The nature of God in Western theology Martial art Sponsorship scandal Corporate governance Internet troll Halakha Copenhagen interpretation Software engineering Same-sex marriage in Canada Bah__'__ divisions 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Abortion debate Ra (board game) Bogdanov Affair Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Path integral formulation
