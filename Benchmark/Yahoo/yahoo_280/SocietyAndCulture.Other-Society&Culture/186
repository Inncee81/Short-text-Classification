hi ok so i just have to point out i definately am not racist i just need some advice answers okay here's the deal my mom is single and she's been single for quite a while she's dated and had guy friends and all but recently she got a new job and she started talking to this man it turns out that he has a daughter thats the same age as my little sister so with that said she started taking my sister to the park to have play dates with that man and his daughter well this man is black and my mom is hispanic i know hispanics are horribly close minded even people in my family are this way the other day she was telling me that a few people were already spreading rumors about her and i was telling her well as long as she knows they are just friends but now shes telling me that in the future they might be more than friends i don't know what to do about the people that will talk about her or the people that aren't going to accept them both hispanic and black i am so glad for her because he makes her very happy but what should i do we are in and we still have people that are incredibly ignorant i need help dealing with them hi sweetie i understand you worrying over your mom and i agree people are going to talk about her and her black man it's awesome that you feel so protective about her and her whereabouts however you can't control what other think do or believe i live in an extremely narrow minded country italy where if your fiance happens to be a non italian non european person friends just abandon you in the same country i get scolded and judged for asking to get food without olive oil even when i explain that i have a rare hereditary disorder that prevents me from absorbing fats and if i eat any it's like gulping bottles of phospho fleet finally again in the same country getting medical help for mental illness is considered like being a looser who will never do something with his or her life there isn't much i can do aside from refusing to take any sh t i sure wish they were better persons but i realise that they like to play the bully not just because they know nothing better but because they refuse to grow out of cultural prejudices support your mom her friend and their desire and possibility to get another chance just because one has gotten divorced or widowed once that doesn't mean s he has to be alone and without a whole family together tight hugs to you and your little sister as well Kodocha Friends Theory of conduct Transsexuality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charmed The Smoking Room Pitaten Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Little Britain Vernon Schillinger The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Phoebe Halliwell Recurring South Park characters Sexual orientation The Fairly OddParents Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Pok__mon Live!
