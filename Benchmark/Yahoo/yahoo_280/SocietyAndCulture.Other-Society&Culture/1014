started this job years ago i try to be social but i try or tried to be social show intrests in co workers life i almost feel bad no one really comes up to chit chat with me i see someone look right over me to talk to the person next to me i am not that social or i don't know how to be and some times this bugs me i have esteem and i'm not worried if i'll say something stupid i don't feel like i'm better then them i don't know i confuse myself when i think about it but i guess what i should ask is how can i be more social i was more of the loner type growing up walked around the schools instead of hanging out with peeps in the lunch room and now i see the trend i go out alone for lunch as it is some times rare i go out on a lunch date if there is work or i get the invite i haven't asked anyone to go to lunch well i have i take that back but not much at all i'm not sad about it just wondering you do have your self esteem and that is all tht matters now perhaps you need to work with yourself on how you ''approach'' pple i am not definitely saying you are not but perhaps there is something of the ''loner'' that you grew up with that you keep associating yourself with you feel a bit unsure if your approach is right or wrong you are absolutely fine no disorders all you need is that you need to adapt that when you work its a team around you for starters i would suggest you watch who is who as in get to know your co workers first silently know what they like where they lunch or what they do their families and see how they interact with each other slowly blend in yourself like a ''curry'' lol just kidding it takes time thats all you are not sad because you know you can blend in and tht you are really smart and talented its only ''how'' that matters as of now once you finish your watching session see who is the closest you can approach perhaps the one who sits next to your cabin or next to you and then you slowly after understanding him or her you slowly blend in with him or her by saying ''hey i think u'd really like this '' or anything it could be the simplest of a hello to asking him or her '''wowww i like that too so did u do watch read say anything since you are not sad about the whole situation i assume you are definitely not a ''people pleaser'' and you shud not be no way you are you you are doing fine and you just need to transform yourself from a ''loner'' to a ''social person'' thats all do it slowly no need to people please or panic or rush and you will see that the first person you become freindly with will end up with a network of co workers becoming slowly into your team of freinds start one day a time as i said again one person at a time not all the pple all the time take the first step forward like i told you the next person in ur cabin or sitting next to you make something or cook something or a great place to go out and invite ''''do you like this i just tried it myself and i am not a big fan of my own cooking wanna share my lunch or whatever ''' and you laugh over yourself and there it goes a bit and only a ''bit'' of laughing over yourself doesnt matter at all just sound like you are a really fun person which u are iam sure but just let it out good luck its only the transformation thatyou need as of now which i am sure youwill Social rule Milton H.
