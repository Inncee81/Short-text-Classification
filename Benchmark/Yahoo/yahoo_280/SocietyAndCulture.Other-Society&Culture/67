why do so many people not pick a best answer and just leave their questions for voting a lot of questions i answer and just ones i browse through are left for voting and many of them including ones i've answered are in a tie and everyone has forgotten about them i'm talking a year old it's kind of annoying if you ask a question why can't you just pick a best answer even if no one answered your question why can't you just randomly select one or pick one that you thought was funny or whatever else i agree Game show Social rule RuneScape Random Events $ale of the Century Big Brother (USA TV series) Tic-Tac-Dough U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Hollywood Squares Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Survivor: Palau Jeopardy!
