does anyone else get totally irritated in tescos i sometimes shop in tesco and they have habits which get right up my nose for instance the way that the checkout people are trained to robotically say do you need help with your packing to every customer now if i have a full trolley fair enough but when i've just popped in for a pint of milk and eggs it's totally annoying and patronising i feel like saying yes i do need a hand just so they will have to drag someone from the far end of the store just to put my items into a plastic bag then when i pay with my chip and pin credit card which i usually do there is the annoying way that they say please put your pin number in despite the fact that they can see me looking at the little screen with my index finger poised do they assume i'm in some sort of trance or unable to read the instructions and i hate their computerised do it yourself checkouts apart from the fact that if i am spending money in their store i expect to at least be served by a human being i find it quite funny when i buy one item and im asked if i want help with my packing 'nope i think i can manage quite well on my own thankyou ' i was actually put off a while ago by the store manager i went up to him to ask where the salsa was he asked if i wanted to dance grabbed my hands and danced up and down the isle i was not impressed very embarrassed as for the diy checkouts i'd much rather use them when i'm in a bad mood or feeling antisocial plus i get some kind of satisfaction hearing that 'beep ' trouble is when you get 'please wait for assistance ' or 'approval needed ' that puts me in an even worse mood Tesco Electronic commerce Sears Holdings Corporation Poker jargon Aldi Computer Dairy Loyalty program Futurama (TV series - season 5) Little Britain RFID Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RISC Shaggy dog story Milton H.
