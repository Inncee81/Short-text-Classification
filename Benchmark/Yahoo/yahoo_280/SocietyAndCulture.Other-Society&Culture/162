do you know the colors of the wind thanks in advance for all the great answers i want to sit back and enjoy reading your comments wind is of air and air is mainly nitrogen with of course oxygen at least it is on this planet and gives off a characteristic green color this explains the characteristic green hue of the aurora however there are other gases present also and when you take these into account and factor in altitude as well it is common for the entire spectrum to be visible what a beautiful world it is that we live in but putting science aside and closing my eyes i see wind as green water as blue earth as brown red black and fire as orange red yellow the quest for truth as white and ignorance as black which in the case of racism is rather ironic Color Color theory Rainbow Black body Decompression sickness Oxygen Mars Sun Gamut Diamond color Hydrogen Biogeochemical cycle Nuclear explosion Cloud Power Rangers Planetary nebula Light-emitting diode Solar system Color temperature Solar variation Earth's atmosphere Primary color Material properties of diamond Opportunity rover Optical spectrum CIE 1931 color space Lighting Eye color Color blindness The Covenant Terraforming Snooker Iris (anatomy) Chemoluminescence Rayleigh scattering Garnet Yoshi Ultraviolet Unidentified flying object Laser Vacuum John Dalton Color space Pysanka Nitrogen Fluorescent lamp Diamond enhancement Georges-Pierre Seurat Flame Explosive material Cascading Style Sheets Plasma (physics) Planet Gaia theory (science) Carbon dioxide Ozone depletion Traffic light James McNeill Whistler Blue Diamond simulant Rainbow Brite Flood geology Melanin Huygens probe Lunar Prospector Colours, standards and guidons The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Mario series enemies Wassily Kandinsky Political colour Taikyoku shogi Discoveries of the chemical elements Comet Crayola Pikmin Aes Sedai Lightning Phosphorus Green Lantern Vehicle registration plate Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite Wallpaper group Ozone hole Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Colors of noise Color metaphors for race Advance Wars Renewable energy Neptune Purple Pixel Meteorology Dragons (Pern) Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Dune Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
