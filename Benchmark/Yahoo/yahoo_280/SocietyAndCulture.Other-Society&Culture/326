bit of a rant lately i have tried to give some informed answers and ask some questions however i have found some folk on here seem to decry me for bad grammer or spelling rather than answer the question asked if you have a look at my profile besides other serious ailments i had a stroke wich sometimes interfers with my spelling ability and they always say use spellcheck but in my state it is still a matter of sometimes making a choice do these people have nothing to do than nitpick or is this discrimination against the disabled one thought comes to mind there but for the grace of god go i thanks for reading this and i look forward to reading your answers pax well frank my stepmother had a stroke which seriously confused her brain she had motor movement in all her limbs but her speech wasn't very clear although she did make sense once you'd got through the alien lip movements initially i asked her whether she would like a pen and pad to communicate and she said yes her movements weren't affected by the stroke at all but because her brain was so confused she couldn't write a thing she died a week later as she had also been battling cancer for a long while the stroke was a mercy i think she was a teacher as was my mother and both were very pernickety about grammar spelling and punctuation part of this is in my genes as well i much prefer to read something where someone has made the effort to observe the particulars than something sloppily done when there are good reasons for apparent sloppiness though like dyslexia and illness i think people should stop and think for a moment before they lambast the perpetrators consequently i don't often pull someone up about their idiosyncrasies because i never know what might be the problem if there is one but i will always make an exception if someone is abusive or pointedly arrogant in their posts incidentally your 'question' seems fine to me on all points maybe lacking a comma or two but hey the gist of it is fine and makes good sense Dyslexia Autism Stuttering Free will American and British English differences Scientology beliefs and practices Aphasia Theory of conduct Asperger syndrome GED Traumatic brain injury The nature of God in Western theology Cancer Theodicy Schizophrenia Learning disability Human A Course In Miracles Stroke Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Mental illness Quotation mark Sexual orientation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Psychology Equine conformation Cult Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Infantilism Ethics Avenue Q Abortion debate Milton H.
