why are workers at higher scale malls stores so arrogant i tend to be a very confident person and i'm also very quick sharp and don't take much bs that's just how i am people seem to think it's funny and think i'm entertaining in a rosie o'donnell kind of way but whatever that's just who how i am needless to say whenever i go to a more upscale anything such as a mall or a store and go to the workers they seem to to be sooooo condescending and b tchy and fast paced and irritating i thought i was bad and i thought they'd bow down to me and lo and behold they outdo me what makes them think that they're god's gift they're retail workers and just b c they dress well and look nice means they can be aholes to everyone else i mean okay not to toot my own horn but i just have a very confident attitude and these people are like vulture sharks and they can pretty much chew anyone lol them judges prosecutors at court cops why do these people think they're so special and they don't like tyranny i let no one walk on me and don't take anything from anyone yet these people among others seem to be like tough you're not the boss i am and that leads to clashes and conflicts i guess what i'm asking is since my method isn't working how does one effectively deal with these types of personalities especially when you're one of the same that obviously isn't working here we clash i'm in no way saying that i'm doing the decent thing but i tend to get b tchy and so do they and then it's world war help advice please thank youuuuuu haha i know what you mean i'm exactly the same way being around that type of worker tends to bring out the diva in me i just tell myself that they're working the crappy job and not me frankly i think it's in some of their training to treat customers like that unless they look like they can afford the things in the store for example i went shopping with a friend in boston and walked into dior and the staff gave us looks of utmost loathing i smile and wave it really ticks them off Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Beavis and Butt-head Social rule Customs and etiquette of Japan Ranma __ characters The Smoking Room Mojave people Shopping mall The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Great Teacher Onizuka Boston Public AFI 100 Years series Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Elvis Presley Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Characters of Naruto Goodness and value theory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scientology beliefs and practices Unemployment Diving Utility cycling Negima The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dragon Booster Boston and Lowell Railroad EastEnders The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Urban sprawl Sears Holdings Corporation Neiman Marcus Kim Possible Illegal drug trade Current teachings of Prem Rawat A Call to Arms Codename: Kids Next Door Cliff Richard Charles Darwin's views on religion Fruits Basket Teen Girl Squad Coercion Friends Numerology Anarchism and society Jiddu Krishnamurti Seinfeld The Inside Prince Edmund (Blackadder) John Howard Yoder RuneScape skills Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Russian joke Woodward's Jackass: The Movie Shopping Wall Street Minor Discworld characters Property (ownership right) Brave New World James T.
