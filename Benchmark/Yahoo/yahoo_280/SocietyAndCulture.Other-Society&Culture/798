should we have bought this house remodel years ago my wifes realtor friend told her she better by now i told her we should save our money and wait she wanted to remodel and i said i dont want to she said she would divorce me if i didnt buy it this house is costing us an extra a month over renting i am and will never see it paid off years she said its good for the kids when we die i told her we could get a million dollar life insurance policy for about the same and the kids would be better off we will never get that out of this house who was right you mean built in or most recently remodeled in if it was a genuinely old house that had not been remodeled since it was probably a worthy investment even if you did your own remodeling slowly if it was built in then a lot would depend on how comfortable you could be living in it while you remodeled also whether you would have to hire people to do substantial portions of the remodeling your kids might have helped since they would inherit but hindsight is they say i must admit that i consider a house a more significant investment in the future than an insurance policy cash can be frittered away so quickly and much of it goes in taxes she didn't really divorce you over this did she Insurance Warren Buffett Social Security (United States) Wal-Mart Annuity Variable universal life insurance Economy of Russia FairTax Money EastEnders Personal finance Primerica Financial Services Term life insurance Bond Capital accumulation Taxation in the United States Confidence trick Hyperinflation Lloyd's of London Mutual fund Inflation Microeconomics Gross domestic product Economy of the United States Humphrey Bogart Freeters Deflation (economics) Citigroup Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) National Kidney Foundation Singapore Flat tax Marshall Plan Tax Supply and demand Social Security debate (United States) Donald Trump Charles Ponzi Ponzi scheme Government debt Economy of Africa U.S. public debt PE ratio Keynesian economics Pension Outsourcing Marilyn Monroe Euro Divorce MMORPG Medicare (Canada) United Kingdom corporation tax Derivative (finance) Mortgage Reaganomics New Deal Capitalism Economy of Pakistan Hillary Rodham Clinton Economy of the Republic of Ireland Paul Martin Bulk vending History of the United States (1918-1945) Contra Costa County, California Inheritance tax Alois Hitler Ocean's Twelve Economy of Switzerland Publicly funded medicine Canadian and American health care systems compared Luke and Laura Spencer Nuclear power phase-out Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Individual Savings Account 401(k) Protectionism Lottery Rupert Murdoch Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Economic history of Britain Monopoly (game) Enron Corporation Knots Landing Finance Evel Knievel Make money fast Blenheim Palace Jean Schmidt Hilary Duff Trust (Law) USA Mensal__o scandal Universal life insurance Philip II of Spain Retirement plan Oakland Athletics Progressive tax Poker jargon Meat Loaf Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks
