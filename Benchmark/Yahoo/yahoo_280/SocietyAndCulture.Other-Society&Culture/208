when you were are in school did you find it unfairly controlling unfairly no we had a principal who was a drill sergeant in the army he was very strict and tolerated nothing we couldn't even hold hands with each other no touching at all but there's nothing wrong with that school is a place to learn now my daughter will be a jr in high school this year and it is sickening how it is there they can hold hands kiss practically make out and it's acceptable they 'claim' they have a 'no bullying' policy that's a bunch of garbage it's talk only my daughter was bullied in the grade and it didn't stop because of the 'policy ' it was horrible she went to her counselor to fill out the 'papers' against the other person after she couldn't handle it anymore i went to the counselor nothing done my husband and i went to see the asst principal and nothing was done it's sickening being bullied can ruin a person's life so right now i feel that at least our school district is disgustingly non chalaunt sp about everything the less they 'see' the less they have to deal with let's bring back the drill sergeant anyday Boston Public Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Section 28 One Tree Hill (TV series) Education in the United States Kodocha Bully Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
