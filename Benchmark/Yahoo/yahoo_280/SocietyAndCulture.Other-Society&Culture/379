why oh why do private tennants treat our houses which such disrespect because they have no rights beyond their lousy months tennancy the law is a chocolate starfish for them you can not expect someone to care for a house they have months security in after years in my rented house i have come to the conclusion i will end up being remembered as one of those dreaded tennants he can keep the lino we have put into the bathroom and kitchen at our own expense the roof leaks but i really don't need another dodgy builder like the one that supposedly fixed the electric in my daughter's room i never challenged him on that one it wasn't worth the aggro at the time one of the sockets works now anyway if we had a decent tennancy we could put our own laminate in and put some fresh paint on the walls but a tennancy that gives us months you got to be joking so the next time you ask yourself the question as to why private tennants seemingly don't care for the places they live in would you care if you had months security oh do comment i feel so much better now i have it off my chest armaillo as for the gas certificate i am considering to ask the fire brigade to do a safety check on the house before i leave i would do it now but really don't need the aggro lmao fantastic rant my landlord left us without a gas cert and with a badly leaking toilet for a year he also neglected the property and my fiance fell down a manhole we moved out and the landlord then tried to sue us for damage to his own property that had been due to his neglect prior to our tenancy Leasehold estate EastEnders Plame affair Kitchen Babylonian law Chatsworth House Concurrent estate Leasing Who Shot Mr. Burns?
