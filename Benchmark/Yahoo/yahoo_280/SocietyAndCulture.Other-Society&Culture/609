do you think anyone who wants to come and live in the uk bad enough should have learned basic english prior to putting in their application has it got to the stage where we only want to be encouaging incomers who share our values and want to be no different to us after a generation or two do you think this language clause should be required from all applicants or only from those who come from communities that have already demonstrated problems in their level of commitment to integrate ie muslims on the grounds that we know all the others whoever they are african chinese inuit polish brazillian etc etc etc will be no different to us and speaking perfect english after a generation of uk schooling but that muslims will still want to continue keeping themselves separate not speaking english unless it suits them and wanting to bring in more of their own segregation minded people from poor backward areas of the world i think that is quite a fair thing to say many other countries expect immigrants to speak the language and pass a test before getting resident status i think that there should be stages the entrance exam which requires basic english and then say a year later a more advanced exam which requires a greater understanding in order to get resident status i think asylum seekers should be exempt from taking the entrance exam however as they may have been forced here under very short notice but should nonetheless pass the advanced exam in due time longer than a year as they're at a disadvantage to normal immigrants this should apply to everyone of course people who already speak english well could just demonstrate so rather than having to take an exam making exceptions based on race or religion is wrong muslims are not the only people who keep themselves seperate and they also integrate as well too just look at the british abroad spain for instance they live in british communities speak no spanish use no spanish business people where expats are available muslims are no exception for non integration Education in the United States Graduate school GED Passport Advanced Placement Program A-level Israeli Arab British nationality law Education in Portugal American and British English differences Affirmative action Racism Multilingual Education in Romania Esperanto as an international language Freedom of speech History of British nationality law Separation of church and state Irish nationality law Grade (education) Public domain Juris Doctor Education in Hong Kong Marriage Second language acquisition German language Driver's license Education in Germany Charter of the French Language Hispanic Immigration to the United Kingdom Education in Malaysia Enlargement of the European Union Status of religious freedom in Sudan European Convention on Human Rights Immigration to the United States Languages in the United States Franz Boas Numerus clausus Democracy Education in Australia Divorce Spanish language Visual Basic English as an additional language Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Judicial review XML Same-sex marriage Debugging Cultural Revolution Copyright law of the United Kingdom Education in Taiwan Education in England Extreme Programming English language First Amendment to the United States Constitution Politics of Hong Kong Trinidad and Tobago Speech synthesis United Kingdom corporation tax Demographics of Brazil Chinese language Life insurance Equal Protection Clause Singlish Religious Society of Friends International English Bosniaks Java programming language Simon Commission Expert system Notary public Chinese martial arts Jew Martial art Value system Logic Test (student assessment) Mexico Fair use Ethnic groups of the Philippines Refugee Philosophy Amateur radio Meme Linked list Same-sex marriage in Canada Cantonese (linguistics) Demographics of Japan
