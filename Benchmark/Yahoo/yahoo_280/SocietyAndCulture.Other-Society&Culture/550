should all big girls be skinny the reason i ask is because ive seen so many big girls that become skinny and sometimes they look better big then they do skinny and i'm not even attracted to big girls for example did you people see star jones lately omg what yall think first of all the point of wether or not your attracted to big girls isn't important we all have our own ideas of what is and isn't considered big all of us are what we are and if we try to change that to make another person or society happy then all we are doing is proving that we have low self esteem and will do anything everything to get other's to take notice of us even if you don't take notice of a big girl trust me there is someone out there who will yes some big girls don't look right skinny i e star jones i think she was beautiful big but now she just looks scary i feel for her couse i think she lost the weight the wrong way and for the wrong reasons if a woman wants to lose weight she should do it for her and not for anyone anything else Theory of conduct Social rule Philosophical skepticism Skinny Puppy Humphrey Bogart Utilitarianism Goodness and value theory Spice Girls The Emancipation of Mimi Pedophilia Supply and demand Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Sexual attraction Obesity Transsexuality Current teachings of Prem Rawat American Psycho Poker jargon Peter Singer David Hume Undergrads AFI 100 Years series Star Ocean: The Second Story Barbra Streisand Human sexual behavior The Critic Wonderland (McFly album) Friends Jughead Jones Self-esteem Anorexia nervosa EastEnders The Apprentice 2 Transgender Objectivist philosophy Wedding Crashers Louise Brooks Scouting Hall & Oates Ontological argument Piccolo Junior Saga Value system Social psychology F.
