why racist is such a big problem in us more than any country i dont understand why in the country that claim freedom is the highest value in their life evidently have the higher racist problem from other country who never use freedom to live speak bla bla bla as their value we're not speaking about how nazi kill jew or what happen in bosnia few years ago but in daily life why racist is such a big problem in other country i've never seen it for example in uk there's plenty indian and chinese but it doesnt matter also in germany there's plenty turks arabs italy but it did not clash like this i'm not saying my country is free from racist not country free from racist that's nonsense i live in indonesia where thousand of races exist sumateranese javanese sundanese papuanese etc and yeah we often say 'ow that's because he's sundanese' or 'she's bataknese what could you say ' but i guess we try to be more tolerant these days while from the media and movies i see in us racist problem become bigger lynossa personally i don't think americans in general are any more racist than anyone else i have traveled around the world and i have observed that everywhere people are most comfortable with those who are most like themselves culturally first and then racially don't let the media form your ideas for you yes there are people in the united states who definitely hate folks of other races that includes jews arabs blacks whites native americans chinese vietnamese korean laotian mexicans eskimos etc etc if you look for hate you will always find it if you look for the common ground between all peoples you will also find it in time it is my belief that our species will come to it's senses and learn to live as one family governments do not help when they constantly fan the flames of fear in order to keep us afraid of people of other nations and beliefs that way we let them commit unspeakable crimes against us and our enemies in order to keep us safe all in all considering the huge assault on our culture and traditions in this country that has taken place over the last thirty years i am surprised we haven't had outright race and cultural wars in this nation i don't think any other nation has had to absorb as much change as we have during the same period of time i don't know how it will all turn out but i am rather proud at how well we have generally behaved during this challenging time of transition peace be unto you will Southeast Asia Nationalism Black (people) South Africa Democracy Bosniaks Indonesia Javanese language Nation of Islam British National Party Jews in the Middle Ages Franz Boas Hispanic Racism in the United States Japanese war crimes Freedom of speech Singapore Propaganda Java (island) Holocaust denial White nationalism Refugee Theory of conduct Islam Chinese character Ethnic issues in Japan Mein Kampf American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Asian Ethnic cleansing Anti-Zionism Population transfer Creationism Family name Nigger Asian American White (people) Joke Anti-communism White supremacy Indigenous peoples of the Americas Max Weber History of Europe Left-wing politics God Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chinese language White separatism Israeli Arab Religious pluralism Noam Chomsky New anti-Semitism Conservatism Transactional analysis Polygamy Race (U.S. Census) Western world History of South Africa in the apartheid era Aryan race Free trade Confucianism Racial segregation Epeli Ganilau Mahatma Gandhi Arabs and anti-Semitism Atheism Who is a Jew?
