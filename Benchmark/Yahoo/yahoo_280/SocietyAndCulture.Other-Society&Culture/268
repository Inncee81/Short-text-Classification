why is poverty and crime associated with blacks when the poorest state in the nation is west virginia and it's a very white state i live in ohio and thought about living in huntington wv because i like rural country areas and thought there would be less crime down there than in oh but huntington is so old and run down the crime rate is higher than you'd think for a smalltown area and it's over white btw charleston the capital is the most diverse area in the state and it's still over white i've heard the drug problem there is very bad the whole state is pretty shoddy it makes ohio look like a nice place to live i just want to know why people associate crime and poverty with minorities so much when look at places like wv i associate crime w a low socioeconomic status too i lived in a large city and i ended up getting robbed i was in a pretty nice area but it was close to some declining ones actually all of that city was bad because even the nice suburban areas were close to poorer areas everything was so packed in and congested i'm from a small town the people that robbed me were a group of kids comprised of both black and whites the city was almost black white and the crime breakdown pretty much falls that way too look at what is on the news all the time i'm in columbus ohio you rarely see the news broadcast the white guy that got shot by his buddy but you do see the black guy who gunned down his ex girlfriend because of an argument just examples so i'd blame the press the newspaper i do have to say tho i lived in the hood for a while a year back i was the only white girl in the neighborhood i constantly saw drug deals gun shots hookers walking around but dont get me wrong every neighborhood has it's problems the black people do it and the white people do it blue people do it too it's all about how society profiles people just keep an open mind and just say no to drugs had to throw that in there Urban sprawl Urban planning Harlem Washington, D.C.
