why are so many people in favor of abortions while browsing some questions online i came across a few about young girls wanting to have an abortions those who pleded with her not to have one and who said it was wrong to kill an innocent life which i agree with had many thumbs down why are so many ppl in favor now a days of killing an unborn child the only way i see having an abortion acceptable is in a rape incest case i know ima get alot of smart sses answering this but it really bothers me why is it ok so easy for people to kill now days just for your delightful information first off i'm not worried about if a women gets an abortion or not what i wanted to know is why is it so acceptable now days for ppl to make such a decision so easily i myself and pro choice meaning if a women wants to get one she can after all she is the one who will have to live with it the rest of her life and answer to her creator whom ever she may believe that to be i would never get one because i am more responsible to prevent it and if there was a instance where i was to become pregnant then i knew the risk before having sex i have a cousin who has had abortions she uses them like birth control and have an aunt who had one when she was in her s now in her late s and nearly every night after drinking she sits and cries wishing she had never had an abortion when she was younger i was only trying to understand the mentally of some of the ppl who think it is alright to do such a thing got it got it because they are completely oblivious to what actually happens to the the baby they are young and stupid and think that a quick roll in the hay is completely safe girls are easily tricked by a cute guy as the guy just wants to get his rocks off and add another notch to the headboard most if not all the cases the girl hardly ever talks to the guy anymore and when it is all said and done the guy is usually out of the picture girls need to be taught what happens and the consequences of having an unborn child ripped piece by piece from inside her but guys are not without fault either they need to realize that having sex is not all that important to life scoring a with a different girl every other weekend or seeing how many you can lay before the end of highschool is ludacris and rediculous guys going around saying they slept with this girl and that girl does not make you more of a man cuz if all those girls get pregnant and you going to be the man to take care of the kid or the mother times that lil boy doesnt even have a job to support himself and still lives at home if you really need to get off boys you were given two hands incase gets tired and girls grow up he doesnt love you if he wants to get in you pants on the st date and if you let him do that then by all means you deserve all the guilt ridicule shame and consequences it brings with it teaching safe sex will not teach you about abortion girls and boys need to be shown exactly what happens when a baby is torn from inside a woman they need to know what they are doing and what they will have to live with for the rest of their lives they need to know that they have other options besides abortion Abortion debate EastEnders Jon Secada Abortion Abortion in the United States Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Sin City Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Days of our Lives Married... with Children Rape Birth control Roe v.
