were you a goody two shoes as a teenager because presently i am a teenager and a goody two shoes i do nothing bad and i'm fine with that it's a very unstressful life but everybody seems to act like they had a wild adolescence so i'm thinking there's gotta be other folks out there who had a mundane high school experience right i was very much a goody two shoes there is nothing wrong with that and i applaud you for your attitude if you are going to have a wild side trust me when i say that it is far better to have that wild side when you are out of high school and much older than while you are in your teens and 's people who go through their wild side while they are younger often make poor judgments that have very negative repercussions on their lives due to their lack of maturity as we get older and we become more mature then when we feel like letting loose and being wild we have more maturity usually not always to handle things better and will be more daring or uninhibited in certain areas but will exercise more common sense and judgment as we are doing these things i used to be such a goody two shoes and never gave my parents anything to worry about as a teenager i'm in my 's now and love to do things i never did when i was younger nothing bad i assure you but definately not the goody two shoes type of behavior i once had all moral stuff i promise you i am too old to be stupid about my behavior and yet i have more fun now than i did years ago all without the negative repercussions i could have had if i had been more wild while i was younger Child sexuality Infantilism Evil Ethics Human sexual behavior Goodness and value theory Sexual orientation Adolescence Sexual abstinence Pedophilia Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Stuttering Alignment (role-playing games) Theory of conduct Laura Schlessinger Statutory rape Sex education Buffy the Vampire Slayer Happiness Patriotism Rocko's Modern Life Ten Commandments Religion Bon Jovi Summa Theologiae Borderline personality disorder The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Nicomachean Ethics The Catcher in the Rye Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Human Theodicy Anorexia nervosa Age of consent David Hume The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Peter Singer Garfield Procrastination Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Narcissism Immanuel Kant Scientology beliefs and practices Justification (theology) Avenue Q Homosexuality Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Wolfrider Video game controversy Arthur Schopenhauer Cultural relativism Philip J.
