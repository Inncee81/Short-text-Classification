i am a crossdresser and i get a desire to crossdress each day what can i do about it i am a male and have a habbit of wearing my mother's and sister's clothes i try to avoid it but then when i am alone at home i cannot resist the desire to see my self as a female but u know that it is not possible to publicaly crossdress my family memebers also don't know about it but the desire to freely roam about as a girl keeps me thinking about it what can be done its natural to be curious you can live your whole life dressed as a guy and when you get home you can change into your women's clothes if this makes you happy then do it my best advice is to find a partner male or female who understands and will help you find exactly what your looking for there are many people who will never understand you but there are others that will except you for who you are and some will even help and promote your desires if you change or alter your desires to comply with society than you will never experience true happiness tc Cross-dressing Transgender Gender role Infantilism The Marriage of Figaro Goodness and value theory Sex Okashina Okashi Sexual orientation David Hume Clothing Characters of The Sandman Fushigi Yugi Human sexual behavior Happiness French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Women in Islam K' Gender gap Gay slang Corset Transvestism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Transsexuality Avenue Q Shotacon Dead Like Me Attachment theory The Catcher in the Rye My Life as a Teenage Robot Fashion Mary Wollstonecraft Milton H.
