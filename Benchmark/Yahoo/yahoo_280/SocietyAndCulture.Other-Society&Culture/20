role models not for me thanks the world of celebrities seems to have gone mad with drug's car crashes sex so on and so forth if these people are those being promoted in magazines on our t v screens etc do they not have an obligation to be role models i understand that a lot of people do drugs and have crashes but just because they are not famous we don't know about it but with the wages they get a little bit of self control is not to much to ask well that is how i feel anyway what about you i am not saying that i try to emulate these people in fact i make a point of not doing it i am just saying that in the media these people are pushed into our face's and we are told that if we are not like them we are not very important i personally have had enough of being told that in order to be of worth or importance you have to be like them why i agree in the main with your point it does irritate me slightly when a celeb says i just want to live my life i wanted to be an actor singer whatever they use the public to become these idols by persuading us to buy their perfume jeans dolls records dvds etc etc go out drinking falling out of nightclubs getting dui's drug taking and then blame the media for causing them stress but its the media that's put them there you cant pick and choose i am a nurse i work as a nurse when at the hospital i am still a nurse at the supermarket pub parties at home and as a nurse i have undertaken the oath to act appropriately always i am always a nurse and people know that i respect my profession enough to never act inapproriately as if i get caught doing something my job is in jepardy i hope im making my point as intended i know what im trying to say its hard to put it into words and what i take home each month is needless to say no comparable to a celeb there are very few 'celebs' whom i respect such as reece witherspoon kate winslet emma thompson these people are actresses they act with respect they look after their children they dont fall out of clubs half cut but we dont hear about them they're too boring but as long as there are people willing to pity these 'poor people' and make excuses there will be irresponsible celebs i hope when i have kids they will idolise people worthy of respect EastEnders Advertising Knots Landing Theory of conduct Sharon Tate Little Britain Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Celebrity Lauren Bacall Florence Nightingale Britney Spears Avenue Q History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Polyamory Adolescence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Actor Neighbours Breastfeeding James T.
