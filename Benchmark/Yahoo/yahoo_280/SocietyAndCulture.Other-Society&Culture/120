does it ever make you wonder what's real when god only seems to answer about one prayer in a thousand does it make you feel better when someone says god didn't want you to have the other things because they weren't good for you or when they say god knows best or when they say god works in mysterious ways yes makes a person wonder what makes people think they will be answered by god as it is really they who are saying it not god also the buisness of god working in mysterious ways is contradictory as god created the earth and did nothing after that nothing mysterious just nothing was done by god after that the worshippers of god did the rest bred various animals killed said god wanted them to strange thing is there is a question not asked enough times it is this ''so you believe in god well how do you know god believes in you'' god could say ''i do not believe that anyone worships me there is no such thing as humans so i cannot answer their prayers'' could god be an athiest there is a book title by the name why god is an athiest i cannot get out of my mind i know i have read it somewhere but cannot recall one of the reasons god could be an athiest could be that god is disgusted with humanity so chose to not believe in god as it belief in god is just an excuse to do what people want speaking of one of the things a person could get from god there is the marriage something always seemed odd about it it seems like asking your parent if you can have sex with your wife as well as another man if that is okay as well then to ask the partner if this is what is desired is even more bizzare because obviously the partner does but is permission is not given by the creator who would not have created people without that in mind and another man or person gives their permission any child can be deemed illegitimit as if people can pretend it was not their own child aperson has to ask what do these people think they are doing treating a person with scorn because they do not ask another person if they can have sex is she accepts money she is bad but if she goes into a building and asks another man if she can have sex with the man she is with for the rest of her life then she is good then a person could ask if the woman goes into a church asks the priest for temporary marriege a separation to follow after the man she is with has made use of her services course things changed now but a person has to wonder if god is laughing up in heaven no it does not but seems down on earth some very bizzare things occur Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eastern Orthodox Church Justification (theology) Ten Commandments God Origin belief Sexual orientation Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The nature of God in Western theology Roman Catholic Church Evolutionary creationism Human sexual behavior Marriage Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Reincarnation Infantilism Idolatry Theory of conduct Socrates Scientology beliefs and practices A Course In Miracles Creationism Religion Predestination Prayer Supernatural Mojave people Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Judaism Free will Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Theodicy Discworld gods Simone Weil Immanuel Kant Church of Christ, Scientist God Emperor of Dune Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Mary, the mother of Jesus Catechism Separation of church and state God and gender Rich Mullins Christian eschatology Genesis Trinity Meaning of life Abortion debate Qiyamah Phaedo Human Summa Theologiae Merit Sant Thakar Singh Spiritism Jews as a chosen people Korban Existence of God One Tree Hill (TV series) Adam-God theory Goodness and value theory Apostles' Creed Eucharist Nation of Islam Community of Christ The Catcher in the Rye Christian view of marriage Pharisees Voodoo Infant baptism Smartism Amidah Baptism Exorcism Sabbath Christianity Alan Campbell (pastor) John Wycliffe Angel Same-sex marriage Soul Shakers Creation according to Genesis Separation of church and state in the United States Prophet Salvation Muhammad Duties of the Heart Women in Islam Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Satan Evil Homosexuality and Christianity
