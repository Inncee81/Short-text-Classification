should i feel guilty for not being attracted to larger women it seems if i were to say that i am only attracted to thin fit women that people suddenly would think call me a jerk i think that a person's body type can tell you a lot about them and their personality what are everyone elses thoughts and i'm not saying that larger women can't be fun wonderful and interesting people or that we should shun them or anything like that most of the women in my family are bigger and i love them all i just find it admirable and attractive when a woman cares about the way she looks and puts time and effort into staying fit and besides being over weight is unhealthy for anyone why should we encourage people to be content with something that is bad for them would you encourage one of your close friends relatives to keep smoking just a thought not at all i am a larger woman not a whale but not petite and it doesn't bother me one bit everyone has a preference i prefer guys with darker hair eyes and skin that doesn't mean i hate pale people i just like what i like Social rule Physical attractiveness Sexual attraction Undergrads Avenue Q Mojave people Fruits Basket About a Boy EastEnders Pitaten Kodocha Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human sexual behavior Human skin color Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Transactional analysis Kender W.I.T.C.H.
