what is the ultimate revenge if you had just one chance to get revenge on that person you despise what would it be can you think of the perfect revenge plot and why do you feel that this is the ultimate revenge to let them think you are going to get even and when they have completely forgotten they did anything then get them but sometimes the thinking that your going to get them and keeping them guessing is payment enough case and point my mom had this friend that made a special cupcake for my mom where she took the top off of it and filled it with green beans and covered it back up and frosted it this friend waited knowing my mom was going to get even for a good months or so when my mom decided to make a batch of cupcakes and filled them with frosting and topped it with more frosting this friend knowing what she did to the previous cupcake tore that cupcake up thinking that there was something grose in it and when she only found frosting she proclaimed that she ruined a perfectly good cupcake so sometimes the best revenge is nothing at all Knots Landing Kodocha Shaggy dog story Pitaten Satchel Paige Castlevania: Lament of Innocence Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
