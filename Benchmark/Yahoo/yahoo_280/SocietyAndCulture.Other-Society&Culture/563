how far should you let rascism affect you life my husband i want a large family we want to have kids biologicly adopt i was raised to not see the color of someones skin my husband was raised to actually believe that black people are generaly alright but shouldn't be allowed to mix with white i'm glad to say he doesn't believe in this although thats how his parents are now when i look online at adoptable children the majority of them are black one girl in particular i just fell in love with right away considered adopting her then i realized how his parents would react how where we live theres maybe a black population how other's backwards attitudes might affect not only us but the child now i can handle rascist remarks would be ready to stand up for my child but i worry about the child if it would be a negative affect on her i would love her make a good mother for her but is that enough in todays society everyone says racism's a thing of the past but is it really tell me what your opinion is her and i are such a perfect match she is five and sooo pretty she has some emotional problems and i've studied psychology for several years and believe i can help her she's also very close to her brother who she's lived with all her life but recently was taken out of his home because although he did his best he wasn't able to fully provide for her and he gave her up which was hard on both of them and if i adopt her i plan to make sure they stay in touch she also has found a love in swimming which is my favorite hobby as well she loves visiting the beach and my family goes to the beach at least twice a year it just seems so right thank you all for your answers rascism is still very much alive but i dont think it should effect you when it comes to a child take this as an opportunity to cultivate that little girl and help her to understand the beauty of every skin color its unfortunate that your husband's family think the way they do but you cant change there minds all you can do is show them by your actions that they are wrong use your actions and not just your words if they still choose to not be apart of their grandchild's life it will be their loss not hers and definitely not yours Theory of conduct Infantilism EastEnders Transactional analysis Jon Secada Microeconomics Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends W.I.T.C.H.
