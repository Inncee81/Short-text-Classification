why are some adults boring wheres there innerchild like i hear people say to others grow up when really all the person is doing is being funny and some adults find it funny and laugh i say adults out there find your innerchild and laugh the word grow up is boring i agree so many grown ups think that if they were to think that something is funny they don't laugh because they think that they are not suppose to laugh but that is not true you never grow up maby you become more mature but it is ok to let out the inner child every once in a while if we didn't then this world would really suck it is so unhealthy to not laugh at least times a day as well as hugs and kisses Social rule Bart chalkboard gags Autism rights movement Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Joke I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue SpongeBob SquarePants I Am Furious Yellow Squidward Tentacles Time Out of Mind Highway 61 Revisited Alma Cogan The Ashlee Simpson Show Birthday Double entendre Comedy Avenue Q Good Morning, Vietnam Humour Milton H.
