please give opinion i am training a girl to take my place work she has only been there day but my boss is already pointing out her faults to me not her i think she will do a good job but it will just take time how can someone expect someone else to learn what it has taken me years to learn in day considering she has no prior experience should i tell her to run or let her try and tough it out hoping he will tolerate her it might help if i knew what the job is or something about it but its the first day anything is too soon to tell on the first day if your boss tells you next time ask him is there anything you can do different or if your boss even wants you to pass the information on to the new person or is he just telling you that shes doing bad for your fyi i also don't know if hes questioning your judgment and training for the new person or if hes just saying shes not cut out for the job like yourself again please don't worry too much its only the first day nothing in management or business and training is able to show on the very first day if he wants you to do the dirty work and tell the the new person that shes not that good then you need to tell her in a nice way i've usually done this by giving lots of praise and encouragement no matter what anyone thinks i'd tell her things that she can improve on and tell her not to give up it takes time if you don't know anything she can improve on since its your boss that is judging negatively then id ask him what he suggests to tell her to improve since he is after all the know it all boss if he can't give any good suggestions then that proves hes just wanting something to complain about which is toxic in the management field Humphrey Bogart Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transactional analysis Alex Ferguson Socrates Plame affair Little Britain Friends The Devil Wears Prada Ty Cobb Extreme Programming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Current teachings of Prem Rawat Goodness and value theory Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Outsourcing Ethics Ruth Bader Ginsburg 1957 World Series Great Teacher Onizuka Scientology beliefs and practices Knots Landing Syphon Filter Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Infantilism Shit Ocean's Twelve Dog agility The Contender (television series) Bruce Johnson Big Boss Internet troll Cleveland Browns Dead Like Me Slander and libel George Costanza Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Theory X and theory Y K' Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Dilbert Appeal New York Giants Christian eschatology Milton H.
