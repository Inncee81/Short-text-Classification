why is it that whenever a kid kills other children that they blame video games and comics i don't get it why blame comics or games they have nothing to do with the fact that johnny the little homicidal maniac decided to go shoot up his school why not just say that little johnny has problems i don't wanna go on a curse ridden tirade again but my point is why do parents just have to point to video games and comics when they obviously aren't the problem if his parents had just saw the game itself instead of trusting their kids to be the cute little angels they think they are they should've seen the game or read the comic which had thousands of warning labels on just the cover why not just read the comic and play the game and at least take a peek in the child's room and just reveal hey you've got an entire knife collection firearms vault and a connection to the atomic bomb something is wrong with you and what's with those jesus camps owned by pastor becky fischer they're creeping me right the hell out why should kids care if the world's going wrong why are kids supposed to be the legion of the lord they're kids they're just kids god gave us a freedom to learn and a freedom to choice the fundamentalist movement of becky fischer is really harming the psyches of out children indoctrination is wrong you can make a kid into a radical with an ak kids believe anything how do we ignore that we're making children soldiers harry potter's a fictional character it shouldn't matter if he's using an ouiji board can you say brainwashing we're only making soldiers for the gop how does that fit into what jesus wanted for us god watches and has a place for those messing with our kids what sets us apart from other countries is that we separate chuch from state don't let fundamentalism bleed into schools i believe that you're wrong insinuating they hold a bomb paving the way for the oil brigade paving the way for the oil brigade exactly read the book and check the rating don't pretend you're blind i'll give you the problem its a parenting problem parents have the right no the obligation to look at the esrb rating that's what it's there for and to look through comics before either buying it or letting the kid play read it parents don't get it and it's pissing me off edit also i read that this high ranking general in the u s army is trying to make the war in the middle east a neo crusade or something and trying to indoctrinate his soliders into the army of god also with kids fundies are doing what sadam did in the first gulf war making kids soliders for their nation or beliefs that's why let the kids make their own damn choices when they're old enough to make them but nooo most christians don't get that part of it god it's annoying Poker jargon Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Theodicy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Columbine High School massacre Jack Thompson Separation of church and state The Catcher in the Rye Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Punisher Humphrey Bogart Canon (fiction) Baptist The Marshall Mathers LP Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Bowling for Columbine Church of Christ Opposition to cults and new religious movements Free will Ex-gay Motion picture rating system Church of Christ, Scientist Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Opus Dei The Amber Spyglass Nation of Islam Suicide bombing Time travel Fundamentalism Mystique (comics) The Death Gate Cycle Death (personification) Miss Saigon Recurring South Park characters Fischer Random Chess Philosophical skepticism Gun politics Religious conversion Abortion debate Transactional analysis True Crime: Streets of LA Children of God StarCraft: Uprising Daredevil Shaggy dog story Abington School District v.
