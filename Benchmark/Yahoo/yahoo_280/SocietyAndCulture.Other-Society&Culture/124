do you agree w asking an employee of yours to wear long sleeves because she has several scars on her arms the scars are mine and they are from a period in my life when i had no better ways to solve my problems then to cut myself it was years ago when i did most of them the scars will most likely stay the way they are unless i get surgery i work at cvs and my employer has asked me to wear long sleeves because he doesn't like how they look at my last job it was the same way only i worked with kids and i understand is it okay for my boss to ask me to do this it's very hot in the store sometimes and i do alot of lifting wear i tend to get very hot what do you think when you see a person with scars on there arms note i am different then someone who is trying to flaunt it the scares are simply something i've come to terms with and try neither to hide it or flaunt it they are just there i am years old when i get an education i wont have to worry bout this anymore but i was just wondering what other's opionions are the reason i am asking is because i don't think it is lawfully correct of him to ask me it is very hot in ny and it makes me uncomfortable i have ms and don't like getting very hot i feel like i'm going to faint i also feel that people should accept me the way i am i am very nice to people at one point i wasn't very nice to myself obviously but why is it there business does it scare people cutting is becoming more of a serious issue the general public should become aware of it anyway it is illegal for your boss to request that you wear long sleeves unless all employees are required to wear long sleeves it is discriminatory for him to talk to you about the scars on your arms these although self inflicted are the same as a scar from surgery or an assualt first i would let your boss know that you are uncomfortable wearing long sleeves due to the weather second i would contact the cvs employee help line you can do this anonymously and report the incident to them i have scars as well not on my face or arms and would be very offended if someone told me to cover the Sin City Surveillance Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Social rule Theory of conduct Avenue Q Plame affair The Shining (film) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Traumatic incident reduction Prostate cancer Self-harm The Ashlee Simpson Show Combine (Half-Life 2) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scar StarCraft: Uprising Milton H.
