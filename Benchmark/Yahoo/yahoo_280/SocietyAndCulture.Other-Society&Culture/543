are black people racist in usa i am a european i lived in usa for one year ten years ago i got the impression that black people were somewhat racist i would like especially to receive black people answers please take no offence from this question i just want to get some of the points of view i have some black friends here in europe who are black inmigrant from africa and they are not racist at all in fact they are really nice towards us europeans well thanks for your answers you can not judge your own friends if they were not nice would you call them friends to generalize the possibility of black people being racist is very naive without going into a long drawn out and very tedious typing frenzy of having to explain the oppression that my black ancestors endured from your white ancestors of course there are some out there who still harbor those ill feelings just like there are several white folks still living in the frame of mind that any race other than white is lower class it doesn't matter how much black people overcome there will still be that embedded memory of pain and suffering we can't let it go if it's still happening nowadays it's more subtle and less frequent but it still happens if you find yourself in a situation where you are alone with several angry black people my suggestion would be that you disappear Racism Black (people) Nigger Capital punishment Theory of conduct Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Validity of human races Avenue Q White (people) Nation of Islam Reparations for slavery African American American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Race and intelligence Sant Thakar Singh Internet troll Guns, Germs, and Steel The Amber Spyglass Prisoner's dilemma Dualism (philosophy of mind) House of M YuYu Hakusho Expert system Lie Racial segregation Transactional analysis Nicomachean Ethics Philosophy of space and time Socrates Russian Revolution of 1917 Big Brother (USA TV series) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Anti-racism Jumpstart 3rd Grade Afrocentrism Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Basque people Minstrel show Shaggy dog story God The Wack Pack White nationalism Nadir of American race relations Theodicy The Subtle Knife Falsifiability Speciesism Ku Klux Klan Negro Martial art Aryan race Race Equal Protection Clause Court system of Canada EastEnders Afrophobia Paranoia Agent Friends Joke H.P.
