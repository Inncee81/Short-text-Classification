deeply insecure and in need of help i dunno how to say this without sounding silly but you know when you like someone and u want get to know them better how do you get over yourself and stop thinking that they will think you're ugly i keep thinking that this guy i like will just dismiss me because of the way i look even though i know he's not like that i know i just need to talk to him and show him who i am as a person but i get so scared i am deeply insecure and i just need some advice thankyou for your time and help i was very shy and managed to get to know a variety of guys in a way being shot down the first time helped me get over my fear and ask out other guys i was turned down in a very rude and hurtful way but i learned that i could get over that rejection and understood that if someone doesn't like me for who i am they are not worth pursuing i don't want you to go through that hurt but i can transfer the message you have a lot to offer as a person and don't let anyone convince you otherwise i've been providing a link to an article about shyness recently and one of the key ideas i remember was the idea of a shy person maintaining a mirror in front of them for all their perceptions and decisions we think the world looks at us the same way we do but that's not true we have to risk putting away the mirror or we'd only ever see our self imposed reflection and never learn how others in the world truly see us i am no great shakes in the looks department as far as the popular media portrayal goes but i do know that i deserve respect remember that if he isn't the person you thought he was you will be sad hurt embarrassed but at least you won't waste future energies on him you'd be free to find a person who truly appreciates you if he is the person you admire great Theory of conduct Charmed A Course In Miracles Plame affair Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Social rule Simone Weil Transactional analysis Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pretty Good Privacy Objectivist philosophy Friends Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Piccolo Junior Saga Theodicy Current teachings of Prem Rawat One Tree Hill (TV series) Undergrads Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) George F.
