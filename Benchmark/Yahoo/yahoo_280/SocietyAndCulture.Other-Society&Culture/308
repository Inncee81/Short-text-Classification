i stepped on a snail on accident earlier and i noticed it must have been traveling with it's partner there were not any others around then a couple hours laters i noticed that the other snail was still there but this time there was another one real close to it like it was examining it and they were just chilling there now my conclusion is that because they were travelling together and because another snail showed up that somewhere underneathe the exterior of a snail was some sort of altruistic values between this group of snails and possibly more then that possibly there was a soul there in these snails it was like they knew who the snail was and because of that it must of had a unique soul of it's own what do you think they were going somewhere together like to eat or back home giggles that sounds so ridiculous but actually something i would say myself i'm giving you a star i love people that actually think these things up and notice when they step on little creatures i think it's very possible for a snail to have a unique soul it's alive it's just little i wonder if the snail was sad when it's friend got squished i'm glad another one showed up that makes things better Happy Tree Friends Squidward Tentacles Phaedo Animal Rei Ayanami Meaning of life Boom Town (Doctor Who) Socrates Roswell UFO incident Micronauts Dead Like Me Mollusk Snail Doctor Dolittle (film) Child sexuality Mojave people Teen Girl Squad John Lee Hooker Franklin (television series) John the Baptist Friends Scenes from a Memory Altruism Ferengi The Amber Spyglass The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Abduction Phenomenon The Isley Brothers The Emancipation of Mimi The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Salad Fingers One Tree Hill (TV series) Glossary of partner dance terms Columbine High School massacre Sant Thakar Singh Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Angel Sanctuary Sesotho language About Schmidt Samurai Deeper Kyo Augustus De Morgan Summa Theologiae Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Jon Secada Hey Jude Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Out-of-body experience Soul Blazer Supernatural Care Bears Jennifer Lopez Strap-on dildo The X-Files (season 1) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Philip J.
