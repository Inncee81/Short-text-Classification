what is your view on this ok when you think of hispanic latino chicano or whatever names they are using now adays how would you discribe a person of that ethnicity culture or whatever would they be short dark skinned black hair brown eyes i am just wondering cause my mom was from cuba and my dad is american of english and cherokee indian decent my dad has brown hair green eyes fair skin my mother had brown hair blue eyes and also fair skinned and of course me i am fair green eyes and brown hair but i am fluent in spanish and when i go somewhere and speak to someone in spanish they look all surprised or like when i go to a mexican restaurant with my husband who is mexican if the waiter waitress is mexican they will immediatly ask my husband in spanish for his order and then turn to me and ask me in english also one time we both ordered tacos they brought his with cilatro and onion and brought mine with lettuce cheese and tomato yuk i think it sucks how some people just generalize you i am also hispanic in my case however i do not speak much of spanish but i can understand somewhat if it comes from a puerto rican more you know how words are so different in latino cultures so if someone reads my last name they automatically think i know spanish however on seperate occassions i have told someone my heritage and they tell me but your white lol i could not believe how many hispanic and non hispanic people said but you do not look hispanic most puerto ricans are dark skinned yeah they said that one to me too i always thought something was wrong with me until i finally went to puerto rico a few years ago and saw that a majority of people there were fair skinned but there were dark skinned puerto ricans are decendents of native americans spainards and african americans that is why one skin color can not be specfied with us people have a stereo type of what a mexican p rican cuban etc should look like talk and act we may not like it and even though we say you should never judge a book by its cover people still do and a lot of times i don't think they realize it it sucks i know how you feel my sister has pale skin and light browned hair everybody thinks she lies when she says she is p rican we get judged also by our hair she has curls i have straight hair people say i look mexican because of my hair Hispanic Puerto Rican Afro-Latin American Music of Puerto Rico Mestizo Puerto Rico Black (people) Human skin color Spanish language Black History in Puerto Rico Melanin Music history of the United States Salsa music Spanish-American War Race of Jesus Ta__no Hair color Pop culture in Puerto Rico Spanglish Latin American music Mulatto New Mexico Languages in the United States Chicano Hair Dragon Booster Dominican Republic Cheetah Joke Jon Secada Mexican American Physical attractiveness Politics of Puerto Rico Mexico Creole Sports in Puerto Rico Florida Color Satchel Paige Taco Bell History of Puerto Rico Telenovela W.I.T.C.H.
