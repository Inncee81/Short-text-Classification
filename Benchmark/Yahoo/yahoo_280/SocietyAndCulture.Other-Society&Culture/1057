masculine or feminine features on a man personally i've always liked boys to be a touch on the feminine side as far as appearances go long hair slightly more delicate features i've never liked the rugged square jawed hairy overly muscled men apparently i'm not alone http news yahoo com s nm sc nm masculinity face dc my question is what's your opinion iyertcs i don't think its disgusting when men look like women at all i'm bisexual how ever so that is probably why men who look like women do not bother me girly girl i love a little bit of hair on the chest but too much grosses me out salknows we would most certainly not get along my friend at least not in a relationship i am rough and tumble i played football i worked out in the gym with the other players i open my own doors and push in my own seat i even open my own jars change my own lightbulbs and even fix my own car how ever almost every one is usefull and that should not be decided on by gender men are just as usefull as women and women are just as useful as men but to each there own i am sure there are plenty of women out there who would lov ea guy like you belladonna i personally do not prefer the largely muscular men or men who seem to exhibit over the top levels of testosterone its is not necessarily needed to produce children protect or provide for a family when was the last time you saw a body builder working in a high rise office making usd a year personally i never have but that's just me while men cannot get pregnant they can breast feed i watched a documentary about it they have all the equipment necessary to produce milk i am into both men and women and i do prefer feminine men it is not nonsense it is just my preference i like them to be a bit muscled but sleek muscle muscle you know is there but isn't protruding in all directions i have every strength a man has and the men i work with would tell you so i am a female and i work in construction of course men on the more feminine side is not for every one but neither are highly masculine men i did not try to tell you all women prefer feminine men so please do not try to tell me that all women like masculine men i thought this study interesting because i am not the only person i know who likes masculine men many of my bisexual friends male and female all of my straight female friends and about half of my gay male friends appreciate a man on the softer side only two woman in my life like masculine men in my experience the more feminine men tend to be better nurturers to children they spend more time with them show more affection and are over all better at being a dad rather than just a father and there is a difference at least to me i am not letting a study con me as my original post i've always enjoyed my men to be a touch on the feminine side longer hair slightly more delicate features lean muscle rather than bulk i asked what your opinion was your personal opinion not your own preference that you would try to force on women as a whole feminine does not mean subservient it is a matter only of appearance not of their behavior women were shown pictures of men that were altered to look more or less feminine masculine they were told nothing of their health or behavior but simply tell us the traits you think a person with this face would have from what i have witnessed macho men have been less faithful and much more likely to leave a spouse within years of children being bore while the 'feminine' men are more likely to stay with a wife and help raise the children strong also does not define masculinity in this test considering that they were shown only pictures of faces which do not tell you what physical strength the body could have please do not lump all women together simply because you like something every one has different tastes i didn't say women always like the more feminine man i said i like more feminine men i did label others with my views please do not label others with yours belladonna after following the link i see that you did not even bother to write me up a new answer how nice of you to take the time to answer each question individually the
