what do you think of a african american as goldie locks in children's books does anyone one else feel that this is a little much i am not prejudice by any means but come on goldielocks these books are part of the caucasian culture and written as such but when i saw goldie locks and cinderella portrayed as such at walmart i was very offened i feel they have their own stories to tell why change this classic to make a point jaztastic thank youi i really am not predjudice your people are rich with so much more to offer classics are that classic baby girl you need to grow up you have no idea what it is i was even saying because you can't see past the nose on your face without spewing predjudice yourself i really am not but goldie locks was written about a little white girl with blonde curls period noname did you read what i said they have their own stories to tell why try to change something that was written specifically one way yoli i love you to death but i disagree with you on this one all cultures have their own stories tell them why do they have to push the bar on childrens books this isn't a barbie doll this is a classic book about a white girl with golden hair not a little black girl with cornrows why would they even do this if not just to make a point i agree and i'm black they shouldn't redo books and movies and things with black people just to make up for things instead we should be writing new children's stories that feature african americans leave the classics alone it's reflective of that period of time now we can create art that reflects this period of time American girl dolls Barbie Black (people) Characters of The Sandman White (people) Hair Sin City Afro Blond Theory of conduct Afrocentrism Girl Joke Afro textured hair Kodocha Dreadlocks Pedophilia Blacks and Mormonism Rastafari movement Miss Saigon The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age) Whitney Houston Aerial (dance move) Physical attractiveness Pitaten Modesty Blaise Transsexuality The Amber Spyglass African American literature Evil Gwen Stefani Marilyn Monroe Supergirl Goldie Colonial mentality Scenes from a Memory Hilary Duff Reparations for slavery Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Baldness African American Multiracial Yoshi Cinderella Sharon Tate Lenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl Discworld Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Economic inequality AFI 100 Years series Hermione Granger Uncle Tom's Cabin Aesthetic Realism Manga Comanche Veruca Salt The Apprentice 2 Ethnic issues in Japan Toni Morrison G.I.
