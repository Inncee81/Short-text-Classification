why do so many americans own guns a survey i saw said of all americans have guns this makes me wonder why do we have all these guns in a modern and industrialized country we have to right to bear arms wither for the militia or for some service but i think what the founding fathers had in mind at the time was that back then america was sparsely populated not including indians most people were farmers and it was a wild place for over years america's history the country was considered a frontier farms all throughout the land wild animals wild people the need to hunt to survive prompted people to buy guns gangs do it for buisness so they need guns but now we have supermarkets and the land isnt wild anymore its not like someone will come into your house and rape and steal so why do so many people have guns its useless only gangsters use guns for their intended purpose at least once since canada is big but not as populated do a lot of canadians own guns if there not as many people owned guns there wouldnt be so many gun related accidents where little kids go around pretending to be tough when sum who thinks they are for real shoots and neutralizes the threat to society or they shoot sum else or themselves on accident lousy id driven parents woah do you live in the real world or in some fantasy its not like someone will come into your house and rape and steal i beg your pardon do you have any clue how many home invasions we do have in the usa yeah i have a gun i have more than one i want to be able to defend myself and fyi where i live the land is sort of wild not every one lives in a city or a suburb Sin City American Old West Murder War of 1812 Anti-aircraft warfare Pulp Fiction Gun politics New France Biff Tannen EastEnders Billy the Kid Escape from New York Jam (TV series) Miss Saigon Bonnie and Clyde Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Trailer Park Boys Firearm Military history of Canada Sioux Uprising Beavis and Butt-head Saratoga Campaign Kodocha History of Canada American Revolutionary War Theory of conduct Video game controversy The Invisibles Goldfinger Knots Landing Gun politics in the United States Red River Rebellion Bowling for Columbine Tenshinhan Poker jargon Inuit It's Walky!
