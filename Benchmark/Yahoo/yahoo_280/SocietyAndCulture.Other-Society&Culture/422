is anyone else worried that adolescent females on here only ask questions about being too fat how to lose weight what is popular to wear i have yet to see a site for a target shirt or wanting someone to do their math homework for them what does this say about the focus our american youth has in life and if i see one more year old girl asking question about different types of condoms i'm gettin my tubes tied well i admit i am guilty of some of those things im btw but you just helped me to see how pathetic that actually is it's a shame that youth waste valuable mental power on ridiciulous things regarding appearances and what to wear to josh's party i feel that the psychological need to be accepted socially may play a role in this but many have the choice to focus they're goals not on pleasing the crowd but helping the crowd there is so much potential in youth to accomplish more in their lives if people would only stop being so lazy and directing their energy to more positive things sure asking a question is fine but it becomes a serious matter when it is priority Sexual orientation Suicide Ethics Social psychology Adolescence Infantilism Transsexuality Anorexia nervosa Sexual abstinence Goodness and value theory Jon Secada Sex education Psychoanalysis Boy Scouts of America Grunge music Transactional analysis Dieting Cultural Revolution Procrastination A Course In Miracles Alcoholics Anonymous Child sexuality Hikikomori Sin City Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Scientology beliefs and practices Rape Scouting Education in the People's Republic of China Gender role Weight training EastEnders Narcissism Sigmund Freud Swami Vivekananda Shaggy dog story Incarnations of Immortality Calvin and Hobbes Clinical depression Reparative therapy Magical thinking Cult Characters in the Smurfs Abortion debate Aikido Theory of conduct Social rule Undergarment Neuro-linguistic programming Pedophilia Sexual differentiation Cultural relativism Megan Griffin Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Asperger syndrome Internet troll Breastfeeding Fahrenheit 9/11 U.S. Electoral College Fashion Sinfest Marilyn Monroe Sydney Riot of 1879 Puberty Nutrition Female genital cutting Evil Domestic rabbit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Opus Dei BDSM Obi-Wan Kenobi Growth hormone treatment Survivor: Palau Football (soccer) The Beach Boys RuneScape Meaning of life Mathematics Philip J.
