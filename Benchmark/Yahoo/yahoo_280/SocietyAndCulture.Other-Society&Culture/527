what do you think last year i was really bored with my life all i did was go to school and nothing else it wasnt depressing but it seemed meaningless since then i have found a whole load of new friends outside of school and we meet up every friday and saturday or even a weekday and get pissed on vodka and alcopops in town or up the hills it has been every week of so far and we all talk and sing and take the piss out of stuff go into town and ask for mints from the take away owners and then run around the beach in the middle of the night screaming it is the most fun i have ever had and ive never been happier but i know that underage drinking is illegal and it must be completely screwed up my insides but i dont think i could stop and i really dont want to ive grown so close to my friends now i never want it to end take a step back for a moment and observe yourself you now have already acknowleged that the booze is probably not good for you so why are you doing it self medicating to relieve having to deal with the reality we all must face in our lives during all this how are your grades doing you sound like you are lonesome and have some relationship needs this group of people may temporarily be taking you mind off the empty feelings in your life but after awhile they will grow old either in your eyes or theirs then what why not talk to someone you really respect and trust including possible alcohol addiction issues which you may realize is an issue now you can start to turn life around now or sink deeper into your situation it all starts with you wanting to make changes that serve your future and not the moment have you ever thought about feelig gratitude for your life your good physical health etc feeling gratitude is a prayer unto itself wen you get out of yourself and reach out to help others you give meaning to your life why not give it a shot namaste jasper The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story About a Boy Social rule Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sin City Pitaten Scenes from a Memory One Tree Hill (TV series) Alcoholics Anonymous The Beach Boys Humphrey Bogart Friends Blood on the Tracks Current teachings of Prem Rawat Milton H.
