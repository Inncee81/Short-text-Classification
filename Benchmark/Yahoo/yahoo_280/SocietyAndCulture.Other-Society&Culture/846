why do some people think that its impossible to have a neutral opinion on the topic of abortion my grandmother asked me what i though about it which was weird but anyway i told her what i tell everyone abortion really isnt any of my bussiness i personally could only think of maybe cirumstances where i would consider getting one but i dont knock those who do for more then my reasons and she told me that was b s i have gotten this response from people on this website as well why because people are pretty passionate about the subject on both sides of it but i can see where you are coming from i am pro choice but would not choose to have one myself i had my son when i was but i didn't judge the girls in my school even after i had my son who chose abortion i think it is a personal choice for each woman and i think you are entitled to your view don't worry about what the radicals say on either side of the subject Pro-choice Abortion Abortion debate Sexual orientation Abortion in Canada Partial-birth abortion Roe v.
