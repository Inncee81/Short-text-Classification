why do people do porn i understand that we all have a sex drive but why do some people make a career living out of it isn't it dangerous at the very least it's sleazy but you're also getting your name out there in all the wrong ways glamourizing sex and making a living off of other people masturbating to you which only further brings morals down lower than they have been i mean sex is good but these people do it to the extreme i guess there's a huge market for it and its all about money but isn't this industry basically evil right down to its core people being shallow glamourizing beauty bodies looks cock sizes breast sizes and objectifying everyone in them it's all about fantasy and i can understand that but sometimes fantasies should stay fantasies a normal person gets sexually aroused from time to time takes care of his needs and moves on to his job or life these people's lives are this doesn't this take horniness and human perversion to another level tho porn industry is an industry of nearly billion dollar per year income that certainly explains the tension of the age we are living as far as i know it isn't a particularly dangerous industry as everything is handled in typical ways model negotiations shooting of scenes payment and must be in no way be thought of as equal to prostitution certain fantasies should always remain fantasies you say well we live in a free world and for the better or for the worse freedom of speech and thought is encouraged my opinion on this is that freedom is a wonderful thing as long as it's not abused but that i guess stands for everything if even the purest thing in the world is abused the concequences will be severe Human sexual behavior Pornography Theory of conduct Zoophilia Infantilism Child pornography Sexual orientation Pornographic movie Hentai Prostate cancer Simone Weil Avenue Q Capital accumulation Inflation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Paraphilia Child sexuality Prostitution Abortion debate Bondage (BDSM) Economics Scientology beliefs and practices Pornography in Japan Theodicy Sex-positive feminism Microeconomics Pedophilia Prostitution in Germany Religion and sexuality Polyamory Rape Alignment (role-playing games) Anorexia nervosa Oral sex Brave New World Masturbation BDSM John Holmes (actor) Phone sex Motion picture rating system Evil Insurance Sex and the City Socrates Sexual addiction Sexual attraction Economic inequality Law of value Pitaten John Howard Yoder Video game controversy MMORPG Gender role Arguments for and against drug prohibition Nicomachean Ethics Free trade Software engineering Galactic Civilizations Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Kodocha Childlove movement Goodness and value theory Gross domestic product Brian Griffin The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Libertarianism Jam (TV series) Strap-on dildo Sex toy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Homophobia Sexual arousal Breast Taxi Driver Dead Like Me W.
