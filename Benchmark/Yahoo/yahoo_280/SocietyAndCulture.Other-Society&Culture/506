what do you think continued i asked a question about getting mashed every weekend and that with my mates a few minutes ago and to clarify i do meet up with them during the day and i love them when we are sober i know they like me for me getting drunk in the evening is just a bonus they dont encourage me to do it i could stay sober if i wanted to but i think being the only sober one would be boring i have a girlfriend and she is great i am predicted the top grades in all of my chosen subjects at school even though it is going on months of constand partying im pretty sure i dont have an addiction i dont crave alcohol at all barely like the taste i just like the socialising and i havnt noticed any decline in my mental or physical state if anything its got better with all the exercise of running and dancing haha i know this has to end eventually and im predicted to get into a really good university but for the moment i would like to be for much longer to come you are doing all this at you may not feel the affects now but you will and you do have a problem it will be a lot harder to quit than you think right now your friends and the places you go must be pretty lame if you have to get smashed to have any fun that doesn't say much about them does it if you can't have fun someplace without the drugs or booze why go if i had a party and someone had to smoke weed or get totally smashed to have a good time i would not invite them back Humphrey Bogart Red Hot Chili Peppers About a Boy Knots Landing Pitaten 2000 Australian Grand Prix The O.C.
