what's the most embarrassing moment of your life this goes back to when i worked for a defense contractor in berlin at an air force post each morning when i arrived for work at marienfelde station i had to wait in line to go through a pair of turnstiles on one particular morning i was rather anxious to get to my turn because the bratwurst beer and assorted bar foods from the night before had left me feeling a bit inflated a crowded line and common courtesy made me wait until i was outside the security gate finally i was let through the first turnstile i dropped my back pack in the 'teller box' and waited for them to search it while i tried not to dance they returned my pack and buzzed me through the second turnstile as soon as i got outside i let go it wasn't gaseous in my haste i had skipped safety protocol and let go at too great a speed to abort i now had a problem i'm standing at the foot of a small hill with about steps to the top and there's no way i can turn back go through security again and take the bus back to my apartment i started forward i took extra care at each step so as not to lift a leg to high and tip the balance judging by the weight of my trousers i was in imminent danger of spillage if i didn't take extreme care on i went moving slowly and woodenly i was being passed by people who had just been far behind me in line they must have suspected me of carrying one mean hangover i prayed that the wind was carrying away the majority of the smell when i finally reached the main facility of course the first floor bathroom was being cleaned the other bathroom is on the second floor more steps these a steep staircase i had to be more cautious the liquid load in my briefs felt like it was perched to run down my leg with each step i got to the top and finally my luck turned for the better the bathroom was open and no one was in the stall i shut the stall behind me and quickly assessed the damage the briefs were unrecoverable i had to remove my pants to take them off and dispose of them i had to remove my shoes to take off my pants using all the balance and coordination i could muster i untied and slipped out of my shoes then stepped very gingerly out of my pants finally with utmost care i lowered and stepped out of the briefs now what there's a built in trashcan out there but i am naked from the waist down and the briefs are very ripe i looked at the toilet good german make the bore at the bottom looked to be big enough to pass a large fist i dropped my briefs in and flushed the water immediately rose to the top of the bowl and began spilling over i snatched my pants off the floor and out of the way of the coming flood and stood on my shoes to keep my socks dry the water kept coming i snatched the briefs out of the bottom of the bowl the water receded now i am standing on my shoes in my stocking feet in the middle of a growing puddle naked from the waist down holding my pants in one hand and some very soiled and now soaked and dripping underwear in my other hand i had run out of options i elbowed open the latch shouldered the stall door open and peeked out i was still alone i stepped over the puddle as best i could and out of the stall i took two of the four steps to the trash can in walked the captain of the station Aerial (dance move) Toilet humour Professional wrestling holds Swingout Undergarment
