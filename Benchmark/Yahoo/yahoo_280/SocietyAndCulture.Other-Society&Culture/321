whats the difference between racism and bullying i experienced some racial things since moving to a place where whites are minority basically comments and one person got a little out of control i am not a racist so it was a surprise to me to experience that backlash of anger esp since i dont think i deserve it anyway this caused me to read about hate crimes in general i was wondering what the difference is between racism and plain bullying if there was no one of a different race i wonder if haters would find something else or someone else to pick on i was also wondering do you think the problem of racism will ever be solved i think its quite frightening thanks racisim is a prejudice about someone based upon their race and nothing else it does not have to be physical in any way and may be quite subtle actually but it is there it all comes down to race though bullying happens for any reason or no reason at all this includes race it can also be subtle and not physical if race didn't exist people would find other reasons to pick on people like the colour of their hair eyes etc as hateful people will always find hate when they look for it i hope that racism is solved but i think we are a long way off that maybe it will happen when even numbers of races live in all areas so no one is a majority or minority and people have personal experience with all races Racism Black (people) Hate group Ethnic issues in Japan Social rule White (people) Homophobia Supernatural Human Scientific racism Theory of conduct Hate speech Race of Jesus Hate Kender Transactional analysis Anger management Hate crime Nadir of American race relations Street fighting Affirmative action Boston Public Anti-Zionism Christian Identity Racism in the United States Color Afrocentrism Southern Poverty Law Center Pioneer Fund Rei Ayanami Avenue Q British National Party Anti-Defamation League Alexander Technique American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Melanin Racialism Zionism and racism Asperger syndrome Media and ethnicity Dilbert Sant Thakar Singh Franz Boas Domestic violence Schizophrenia Racial segregation Race Arab-Israeli conflict White supremacy Islamophobia White separatism Albert Einstein Equal Protection Clause Race and intelligence (Public controversy) Out-of-body experience Race and intelligence Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Nation of Islam Human sexual behavior Red hair DNA Economic inequality Pitaten Prejudice Nigger Slobodan Milo__evi__ Anti-Semitism Theodicy String theory Southern United States Richard Littlejohn Vernon Schillinger History of South Africa in the apartheid era W.I.T.C.H.
