may i get an answer to this question i asked this question in the medical category and not one soul responded i am i big participant in the r s category so i feel safe receiving some reasonable responses and accurate information here as well since this category is very close to r s please bear with me hi everyone it's me john i am here to complain about my vision problem and i need to know if they're any help available for me i am physically challenged and my vision is becoming worse due to excessive floaters my vision is fine as far as i am concerned just the floaters that are causing complication and annoyance i was told by my eye specialist that the floaters would gradually disapear on their own like fall below my vision i asked how long this will take and they told me approximately one year or two when i first suspected a floater it looked like a tread it was not a problem at first but gradually over time the tiny little tread has become a massive cobweb covering up my beautiful vision my eyes are corrected to with glasses but when the cobweb comes across my vision my vision would be less than very poor this causes problem for me to drive at nights and even to see road signs correctly like the small road signs i have been having floaters in both eyes now for years and they only get worse i have my eyes checked on twice a year and the doctors told there is nothing they can do to remove floaters unless they blast them which will make things worse than it is the floaters were the reason i had a hard time passing my vision test at the dmv department to obtain my driver license at that time i had to wait a few seconds for the floaters to completely move out of my vision in order to read the little letters at dmv which i successfully and luckily passed however the floaters has become worse now and i might be unfortunate this year to pass my dmw vision test to renew my driver license the floaters make driving at nights risky and difficult so that s why i do not drive at nights under no circumstances tell me what help you think i can get thanks john also the doctors said i only have floaters problem so i am not going to be blind at least i am not at risk don't worry about me driving on goverment road i have been driving now for more than years and have never gotten a ticket or met in an accident and i didn't say i can't see and i am sure kids are not that small like those letter letters it scares me that you think kids are that small i meant little letters food theneedofthewea i state the facts about me to better people's understanding of who i am also you did not respond to my question you seem pretty upset i am sorry acknowledge that john i had a similar problem some years ago it appears that it is caused by bleeding from the retina into the eye fluid and if it continues damage to the retina is almost a certainty get yourself to a competent eye specialist mate don't just go to a gp i am horrified that they have said it's just floaters that's blood in there and even though most of it will be re absorbed where did it come from and why that's the question you should ask Diabetic retinopathy Eye Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scientology beliefs and practices Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Plame affair Color Retinal detachment God Emperor of Dune Driver's license M16 (rifle) Big Brother (USA TV series) Chronic fatigue syndrome Abortion The Shining (film) Love and Theft Light pollution Floppy disk Hypoglycemia U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Resurrection of Jesus Combine (Half-Life 2) Myopia Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Stroke Urinary incontinence Retina Sin City Diabetes mellitus Tenshinhan Drunk driving (United States) Social rule Multiple sclerosis Color blindness Piccolo Junior Saga 2005 United States Grand Prix Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.
