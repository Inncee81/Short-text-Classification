what would you do there is neither a right nor wrong answer to this question this is a situation i was in the other day and i made my own quick choice but i think it's a good question you are at a relative's nd birthday party and there are relatives there etc it has just started you are sitting in a chair with a can of pop sitting on the table beside you which is yours that you've been drinking a relative you are neither close to nor distant from meaning your relationship is good just not someone you tell very personal things to that you haven't seen in about months comes in he comes to give you a hug so you stand up and accidentally knock your can of pop over in the process it spills onto the table there is plastic covering the table which is what the pop spills on to none drips onto the floor do you hug him first or do you quickly grab a napkin to soak up a little of the pop first why personally i would clean the mess first as a respect to the house owner and mean while apologize about my clumsiness then turn to him and greet him her in a very welcoming manner apologizing again Social rule Haven (TNG episode) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Customs and etiquette of Japan Menstrual cup Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Royal Assent Dog training Humphrey Bogart Poker jargon Physical intimacy Friends Goodness and value theory Japanese tea ceremony Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eastern Orthodox Church Have I Got News For You Theory of conduct Canadian Senate Extreme Championship Wrestling Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Current teachings of Prem Rawat Shaggy dog story Rain Man Nicomachean Ethics Dairy Bowing (social) Professional wrestling holds Past teachings of Prem Rawat Mark Calaway Muslim ibn Aqeel Escape from New York Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling match types Care Bears Conspiracy (TNG episode) Columbine High School massacre Autism Sento Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Beer Pong The Ashlee Simpson Show President (game) Coming of Age (TNG episode) Professional wrestling throws Trish Stratus Birthday Kitchen Eddie Guerrero Expert system Theodicy Blood Simple Happy Tree Friends Brian Close United States House of Representatives Chinese tea culture 2000 Australian Grand Prix Roman eating and drinking Little Britain Boom Town (Doctor Who) Glen Jacobs Palace of Westminster General relativity Snooker The Smoking Room Appeal Care-a-lot's Birthday Transformation problem The Long Game Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Meaning Jennifer Lopez Salah Milton H.
