true ghost story anyone please share i love true ghost stories and i want to hear one from you i have several but i'll share a short one i was at a friend's house warming food in the microwave out of the corner of my eye i saw a little old man standing inside the doorway i turned to get a better look and he was small man wearing a brown bathrobe over his night clothes and as i looked at him he slowly faded away i didn't say anything but a few days later i called and asked my friend about who had previously owned the house and she said the real estate agency i told her that i was talking about before that and she said an elderly couple that died i told her about the little old man and she was not surprised because she said that some nights she can feel someone sit on the side of her bed but she can never see anyone once i was homeless in winter and i had no money i went to the house of a friend to see if he'd let me spend the night as it was too cold to be outdoors no one was home so i rolled up in a carpet on his porch and fell asleep about in the morning i was awakened by the voice of a different friend calling my name i was so close to freezing to death that it took a few minutes before i could start moving i staggered away to an all night laundromat to warm up later that day i saw my friend and told him that i had slept on his porch he mentioned that he had noticed the carpet was moved and then he asked me if i knew about our other friend the one whose voice had awakened me i said no what and he told me that she had died about a month earlier The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Knots Landing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Paul Is Dead The Amber Spyglass Out-of-body experience Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
