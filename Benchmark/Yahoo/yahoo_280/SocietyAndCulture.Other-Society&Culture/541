racism is a setback for those races who have suffered descrimination in the past and have fought for equality why do some of you still hold bitter feelings toward caucasions doesn't racism and bias do nothing but perpetuate racism and bias i'm not trying to offend i am truly curious moonjogger your point is well made but why would you assume that i would think of you as a highschool drop out and unwed mother that is exactly what i'm talking about every comment or assumption like that that is made set us all back you are very correct racism and bias do nothing but add to the racism and biases that are already present in our society as an african american woman i have seen more than my fair share of racism i recently graduated from a very prestigious college in the country only months ago predominately white even at this institution of higher learning the n word was used there was an affirmative action bake sale that sold brownies for to caucasian and for to african americans this bake sale was to illustrate that african americans are given hand outs when the fact of the matter is if this group had done proper research they would know that low socioeconomic caucasian women benefit the most from affirmative action not only that but i served as an ra for years and my first year the n word was carved on the back of a bathroom stall on my hall i was the only african american out of females living there i said all that to say while racism is a thing of the past it is still a thing of the present and will be a thing of the future it is terrible that any race should discriminate against another this includes african americans against caucasians it is a shame that bitter feelings are still held by some african american towards caucasians as it is a shame that some caucasians still engage in both overt and covert racism i think that in situations like these both parties are to blame not just the african americans that do this not just the caucasians that do this but both groups while there are some african americans that feel this way there are some that do not just like some caucasians may do things like the aforementioned while some do not while i understand you are not trying to offend and most certainly have not offended me i think it is important not to generalize on either the caucasian or the african american experience when it comes to these matters hope this helped a lil take care Affirmative action White (people) African American Black (people) African American contemporary issues Model minority Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Divorce Ethnic issues in Japan Domestic violence Liberalism Plame affair Breastfeeding Commonwealth of Nations Multiculturalism Media and ethnicity Intelligence quotient Laisenia Qarase African American Vernacular English Validity of human races Media bias Racial segregation Equal Protection Clause Rape Whose Line Is It Anyway?
