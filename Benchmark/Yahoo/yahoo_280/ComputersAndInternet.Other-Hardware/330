do you understand this mac os x error message i have a powerbook g running mac os x and it's been having problems so i ran repair disk and it said the disk could not be repaired see below for the detailed message question if i use apple's migration assistant to move my files to another mac will i carry this error with me in other words will moving my files to a new mac fix this problem details i booted with my install disc and went to disk utility first aid repair disk and i got this error message overlapped extent allocation file overlapped extent allocation file volume bit map needs minor repair checking volume information invalid volume free block count it should be instead of repairing volume the volume macintosh hd could not be repaired error the underlying task reported failure on exit hfs volume checked volume could not be repaired because of an error repair attempted on volume volume could not be repaired the overlapping extent allocation error means that there are some lower level problems the first step would be to run repair disk from the install disc which you did after that you might have better luck trying to repair it from what's called single user mode to do that reboot the machine while holding cmd s wait until text stops showing up type sbin fsck fy without the quotes and hit return when it lets you type again type reboot without the quotes and hit return admittedly that is doing more or less the same thing as repairing the drive from disk utility but i've had luck getting work when disk utility wouldn't if that doesn't work boot off you're install disk but hold d instead of c this should let you run an apple hardware test which'll tell you if your hard drive is physically screwed up or if it's a problem with your data if the hardware test is clean you need to run something like alsoft's diskwarrior or later as to the original problem odds are that the migration assistant will not carry over the problem to a new mac but whatever files are causing the problem might not work correctly the error you're getting mostly means that there are two files trying to be in the same spot this might mean that those two files will be unreadable when they move to the new machine it shouldn't cause any problems though aside from those two files being unusable Windows 2000 Redundant array of independent disks File Allocation Table Embedded system Apple Macintosh Floppy disk Computer virus System 7 (Macintosh) Mach kernel File system Hierarchical File System Virtual memory HFS Plus C programming language Apple II family Digital circuit IBM PC compatible System/36 Windows XP Blue screen of death AmigaOS Mac OS Disk image Debugging Data recovery Commodore 64 System/34 Booting USB flash drive IPod Macintosh Finder Atari 8-bit family Apple Computer Linux kernel Mac OS X Copy protection Linux Page table CPU cache NTFS Forth programming language Universal Serial Bus PDP-11 DragonFly BSD IBook Perl Data General Nova Ethernet Compact disc PowerBook G4 Files-11 Apollo Guidance Computer Mac OS 8 Windows Vista MS-DOS Apple IIGS VMware Objective-C File format LiveCD PlayStation 2 Master Control Program MP3 Windows 3.x Computer forensics Pretty Good Privacy BASIC programming language AppleTalk History of Microsoft Windows Spring operating system Original Amiga chipset DOS Unicode DVD Amiga Logo programming language Mac OS history Error correction and detection Motorola 68000 Fsck Xerox Star Partition (computing) Digital rights management NeXT Computer multitasking Mouse (computing) Macromedia Flash Disk cloning Buffer overflow Expert system Exception handling ZX Spectrum Computer Atari ST Opera (web browser) Apple typography
