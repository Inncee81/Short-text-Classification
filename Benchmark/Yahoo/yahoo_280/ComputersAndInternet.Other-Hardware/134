i have just got a second hand cpu that runs windows profesional but it has really poor resolution it only has colours any ideas on how to fix it have you tried to adjust the display settings for your computer right click on the desktop and go to settings where you see color quality select colors or bit or bit if you see these options if you can't see colors option then the problem is probably that your computer is missing the video driver that's the software for your video card usually this program can be downloaded from the internet for free i would say it takes no more than about minutes to find this software and install it i suggest you take your computer to a repair shop and ask them to fix it for you if they can't find the software on the internet then they should just replace the video card with another one you can get a second hand video card for about and replacing it takes about minutes it shouldn't cost a lot Windows XP IPod Mac OS X Windows Vista Linux Computer and video games Object Desktop Microsoft Windows AmigaOS TRS-80 Color Computer Atari ST Amstrad CPC Screenshot History of Microsoft Windows Nintendo Entertainment System Apple Computer Commodore 64 Digital photography Personal computer Bluetooth GIF Macromedia Flash Apple IIGS Spyware Computer TRS-80 Commodore 128 Apple Macintosh OpenGL System 7 (Macintosh) IBM PC CPU design Laptop PlayStation 2 Color Graphics Adapter Blue screen of death Redundant array of independent disks Nintendo DS Virtual memory OpenBSD ZX Spectrum Video Graphics Array Palm OS Mouse (computing) 64-bit Microprocessor Google Desktop Steam (content delivery) Embedded system MP3 Common Unix Printing System Knoppix X86 Modem TeX Windows 3.x MDAC IBook Sinclair ZX81 Television Amiga MSN Messenger PC Engine Mozilla Firefox ATI Technologies Central processing unit N-Gage AMD64 Graphical Environment Manager Digital audio workstation Patch (computing) Windows Server 2003 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Radeon History of operating systems Portable Document Format MAME Skype Computer terminal Booting 2D computer graphics High-definition television PostScript Mandriva Linux Unicode
