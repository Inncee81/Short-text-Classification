reasons for hardware maintenance new drivers and driver updates must be programmed and distributed to handle new innovations in software for example when mp first came out a driver had to be made to govern how your sound card interpreted the data into a playable music file cleaning the physical inside of a computer removes dust and other particles which can cause shorts in freak circumstances and much more likely cause your computer to overheat dust is a pretty good insulator of heat new innovations in software like mp can for the most part be backwards compatible but as newer parts come out from these competing companies software developers come up with new ways to take advantage of the improvements for example being able to play full length movies on a disc required upgrading to dvd standard the number one cause for advancement though is processing search engines like google get exponentially more efficient as their hardware improves to seek and process websites maintaining your computer files is a key area of maintenance as well you will always first encounter this as a first time user when your desktop becomes cluttered with shortcuts and your start bar explodes to ridiculous sizes at some point you have to see reason and re organise your files folders and shortcuts simply for user egronomics ease of use in lamens terms an issue known as disk fragmentation causes the s and s on your hard disk to be thrown about like a teenager's used clothing when it is written every once in a while you need to run the disk defragmenter so the system can move all the seperate chunks of any one file into a single solid chunk per file and then from there keep the files of the same folders in the same physical space on your drive all of this can dramatically increase how quickly your hard drive can seek data your drive will always fragment itself to a degree each time it writes new data so defragmentation should be done frequently especially after large installations or bulk file additions replacing very old parts will eventually become necessary the reason you dont see many year old computers isnt just because of modern upgrades sometimes it can be attributed to wear and tear dust as i said and heat can over time seriously affect to well being of your computers integrated circuitry and at a point it will eventually break down if left to operate under poor conditions such as being very dusty however if treated well its possible to run a pc for many years my record is years and my replacement pc has been running for nearly now with only one performance upgrade graphics eventually certain upgrades are simply required for a machine to be of any more use to us for example you would not run a machine with windows anymore because it is simply too old to support current versions of software such as windows explorer firefox video games office etc another good reason to upgrade is newer software like windows prove to then be more secure to use less prone to viruses especially when microsoft stopped offering security updates for maintenance isnt always about corprorate conspiracy most of the time there are big advantages to upgrading in years time for example almost all computers will support hd dvd or blu ray by default much in the same way as dvd PlayStation 2 Knoppix Macintosh Finder X Window System Copy protection Amiga Visual Basic Personal computer Apple II family MS-DOS Windows 3.x Linux kernel MDAC Internet Explorer RISC DragonFly BSD Windows Server 2003 64-bit History of computing hardware (1960s-present) ITunes Windows Me Btrieve MAME Laptop Central processing unit Architecture of Windows 2000 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Amstrad CPC Macromedia Flash Opera (web browser) ATI Technologies Perl Musical Instrument Digital Interface Novell NetWare Java programming language Spyware ZX Spectrum Library (computer science) CPU cache PNG Screenshot Gmail PlayStation 3 Radeon IPod Software engineering Universal Serial Bus History of the graphical user interface OpenOffice.org X86 Apple Computer Gramophone record Digital rights management IMac Mac OS Modchip Mac OS X v10.4 Enterprise content management XML Emacs Cheating in Counter-Strike TRS-80 Color Computer
