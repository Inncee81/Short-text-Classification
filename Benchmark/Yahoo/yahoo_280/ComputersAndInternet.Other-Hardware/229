how can cpu power affect the performance of database system i guess it might have an affect on how many hard drive operations could be handled at one time on the digital end of things a faster processor could handle more data queries and be able to interpret the raw hard drive data quicker i wouldnt wager the difference would be terribly significant unless you were speaking about a fairly sizeable database Central processing unit CPU cache Redundant array of independent disks Computer Embedded system Thread (computer science) CPU design CDC 6600 Apple Macintosh Overclocking 64-bit IBM PC compatible Microprocessor NeXT Mach kernel PDP-11 MUMPS Atari ST PlayStation 3 Control Data Corporation Tandem Computers Vector processor Modem Virtual memory ILLIAC IV Sega Saturn Database XML Computer bus CP/M SIMD Global Positioning System PowerPC Intel i860 INMOS Transputer Hard disk History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Mainframe computer Optimization (computer science) MIPS architecture Supercomputer Amstrad CPC IA-32 File Allocation Table Computer numbering formats Microprogram Assembly language Cray-2 Opteron Btrieve Digital Equipment Corporation Cell (microprocessor) Speech synthesis NX bit Multiprocessing PaX IA-64 Advanced Technology Attachment Computer multitasking Superscalar Windows XP Windows 2000 System/34 Commodore 128 Coleco Adam Quantum computer Burroughs B5000 Digital Motorola 68000 Compiler optimization Password cracking Assembler Emulator Web crawler File system USB flash drive Context switch FireWire VAX Benchmark (computing) Personal computer Data General Cache Endianness Phase-locked loop ZX Spectrum MS-DOS UNIVAC Reconfigurable computing Atari 8-bit family MDAC Symbolics Movie projector X86 assembly language Intel iAPX 432 AS/400 Binary numeral system
