what is this shiny disc thing pic included http farm static flickr com a f f m jpg i see pics of these things all the time in articles that talk about computer processors they're shiny gold and holographic looking about inches in diameter they're always being help by people in a clean room i guess the rectangles have something to do with chips i think they have something to do with the development process those are silicon wafers if you look at bit closer you'll see that they actually contain chips a laser cut them into smaller pieces then a packager robot pick up a small piece and put it on a chip base with all the feet under it then using micro movements it puts in the tiny connections that connects the chip to the individual pins as you can see a wafer is really fixed size not going to get much larger than that they tried larger size but it became too delicate and imperfections started messing it up they grow a silicon crystal and then use a laser to cut a tiny perfect round slice and etch the chips on the entire process is a bit big to go into detail read more about it here http www elume com semiconductor manufacturing htm Integrated circuit Solar cell Semiconductor fabrication CPU design Drill bit Semiconductor device AMD MEMS RISC Application-specific integrated circuit Semiconductor Microprocessor Central processing unit Field-programmable gate array Holography Transistor MOS Technology 6502 Floppy disk USB flash drive Diamond CPU cache NVIDIA Programmable logic device Gramophone record Light-emitting diode Random access memory MOSFET Silicon Acorn Computers Dynamic random access memory Nintendo GameCube Nanotechnology Carbon nanotube Laser diode Machine vision Opportunity rover Commodore 64 CMOS Photolithography Metalworking Atari ST Radiation hardening Screw Xbox 360 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Compact disc Atari 2600 Nintendo Revolution Mouse (computing) PlayStation 2 Ion implantation Diode PIC microcontroller Liquid crystal display Laser engraving Moore's law Nintendo 64 Cray-2 Glass Laser Sinclair ZX81 Silicon Valley PlayStation 3 Laptop Internal ballistics Sound Blaster Operational amplifier Knife Atari 8-bit family Stepper Very long instruction word Solar panel Betting (poker) Diamond cut Movie projector Texas Instruments Cartridge (firearms) Printed circuit board Motorola 68000 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sapphire Silicon carbide CDC 6600 Embedded system Virtual memory TRS-80 Memory (computers) PowerPC Laserdisc Depth of field Digital photography Sega Saturn Nintendo Entertainment System Modem
