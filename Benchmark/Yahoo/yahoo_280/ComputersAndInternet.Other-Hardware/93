dual core vs core duo which is faster better which do u guys recomend me to get doesnt the clock speed matter one is and the other one is only doesnt the clock speed matter one is and the other one is only do u have any referances what about athlonx chips i'm looking for somthing around core duo is much faster its built on a all new platform the dual core is just two pentium chips clock speed isnt really that important anymore look at some benchmark tests between pentium chips that are ghz and core chips that are ghz the will win look at this the e is is core duo and the p is a dual core http i neoseeker com a core duo e winrar png and http image donanimhaber com resimler conroedoom speed png Pentium 4 Pentium M Pentium III Celeron Xeon Clock rate VIA C3 AMD PR rating Pentium D Pentium Pro Overclocking NVIDIA CPU cache Itanium 2 Athlon 64 Cell (microprocessor) Northbridge (computing) GeForce 6 Series PowerPC G4 Radeon Microprocessor Apple Intel transition Moore's law RISC ATI Technologies Xbox 360 Pentium Cyrix 3dfx Front side bus Transmeta Pentium II Opteron Magnetic core memory Apple Macintosh Super Nintendo Entertainment System PearPC MIPS architecture PC motherboard 64-bit CPU design Power Mac G5 Montecito Timeline of computing 1990-forward NetBurst Duron PlayStation 3 FLOPS Central processing unit PowerBook Dynamic random access memory Speed of light Random access memory Conroe Bluetooth Read-only memory AMD 5x86 MAME Benchmark (computing) Computer architecture Supercomputer AMD K5 PlayStation 2 VIA Technologies IBM PC compatible Apache HTTP Server ThinkPad Field-programmable gate array IEEE 802.11 Centrino AltiVec Novell NetWare GeForce 4 DDR SDRAM Xbox Atari 2600 Transistor Computer Zilog Z80 Intel i860 INMOS Transputer X86 IBM POWER Commodore 128 PlayStation Portable Nintendo Revolution Application-specific integrated circuit TCP Offload Engine Ripping NForce2 Dual-core Neutrino Special relativity ZigBee Atari 8-bit family Commodore 64 Drill bit
