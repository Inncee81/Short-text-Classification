how important is fast ram speed i have gb of ram on my pc right now clocked at mhz i want quality over quantity here but mhz pc ram is more expensive is it worth it to get the faster one note i cannot get any faster ram than pc or standard ddr you will definitely benefit running the fastest ram you can get if it has a low latency since you are using ddr something good to look for would be pc with a cas latency of if the latency is high like it takes twice as many cycles for the memory to retrieve the data so the extra frequency speed wouldn't do you much good now as far as size most people think they need a ton an average user won't even utilize over kb of memory look at your processes list when using your computer and add up the amount of memory used xp will also alert you if you are out of memory and starting to rely too much on hard disk for memory also called virtual memory make sure your motherboard supports faster memory though another note most computers are choked by the speed of the hard drive cpu's and memory are way faster than a hard drive and have to wait for it to load data into the memory fast hard drives will allow your system to boot in seconds and programs to load extremely quick however if the program is cpu dependent such as recoding video then cpu speed is more important i know i kind of rambled on but i hope this helps you CPU design Dynamic random access memory Atari 8-bit family Central processing unit RISC Computer architecture Pentium 4 Hard disk Redundant array of independent disks Nintendo GameCube Apple Macintosh Virtual memory Computer Microprogram Apple II family TRS-80 Color Computer Atari ST Windows 2000 Commodore 128 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Commodore 64 Windows XP Athlon MIPS architecture Random access memory Sinclair ZX81 Acorn Electron ZX Spectrum Advanced Technology Attachment Booting CDC 6600 Opteron IBM PC compatible INMOS Transputer PowerPC Front side bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DDR2 SDRAM PlayStation 3 Celeron Embedded system IBM PC Personal computer DDR SDRAM BBC Micro MOS Technology 6502 Amstrad CPC IMac PlayStation 2 Clock rate Compiler optimization Cray-1 Data General Nova GeForce 6 Series AMD AmigaOS Motorola 68000 NVIDIA Web crawler Super Nintendo Entertainment System SAM Coup__ Power Macintosh G3 Memory (computers) USB flash drive Xbox 360 MSX Computer bus Timeline of computing 1990-forward Radeon Computer multitasking Apollo Guidance Computer System/36 Universal Serial Bus Nintendo Entertainment System Linux Stream processing 64-bit Rambus File system NX bit Forth programming language Supercomputer DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Original Amiga chipset BBC Master HyperTransport Sega Dreamcast Nintendo 64 Windows 3.x Mach kernel Vector processor Computer virus
