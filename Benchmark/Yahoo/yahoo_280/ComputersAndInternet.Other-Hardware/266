video card okay i have a windows xp computer that is pretty new i purchased within the last three years i was wondering why i don't have a video card inside of it i have tried installing which worked and playing the sims body shop but i can't make it work becasue i don't have this video card help me out please and tell me if i should have this thing pre installed in the computer i don't quite understand what you're asking but let me see if i can guess you don't see a video card in your computer i take it it's probably a on board video card which means that your motherboard the big board that all of your computer parts are typically connected to has one built in or another way of putting it the video processor is part of the board that may be why you don't see a video card if you are plugging your monitor to a port that's next to your sound card and your keyboard ports that's usually an indication that you have an on board video processor either that or you're trying to get your game working and it says that you don't have the right kind of video card that can be fixed by getting a new one that will fit on your board if your computer is about years old you'll need one that has a agp slot connection not pci e although regular pci without the e will work as well but they are usually not powerful enough for majority of d video games such as sims Personal computer PC motherboard Computer bus IBM PC Accelerated Graphics Port Sound Blaster Computer and video games Amiga GeForce 6 Series Computer hardware Universal Serial Bus Graphics processing unit Atari ST Creative Technology Power Macintosh G3 The Sims 2 MicroATX Laptop Sound card 3dfx Expansion card Atari 8-bit family IMac Motherboard Apple II family Modem ZX Spectrum PCI Express Cyrix TRS-80 Color Computer PowerPC Xserve History of Microsoft Windows Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Apple Macintosh Northbridge (computing) PlayStation 3 AmigaOS PlayStation 2 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Industry Standard Architecture IBM PC compatible HyperTransport Overclocking Apple IIGS Acorn Electron Slot machine ATX Computer and video game genres Wheel of Fortune Windows Vista Front side bus Sega Dreamcast Xbox NVIDIA SGI Octane USB flash drive HP 9000 Amstrad CPC IPod Graphics card RISC Windows 2000 Poker jargon History of computer and video games Computer Nintendo GameCube NForce4 Cisco PIX Automatic teller machine Power Mac G4 Cube Intellivision Wi-Fi Computer case Microsoft Windows Nintendo Revolution Intel BBC Micro Timeline of computing 1990-forward PC card Game Boy Advance Apple Computer Computer and video game industry Sinclair ZX81 Commodore Plus/4
