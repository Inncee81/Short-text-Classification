my computer speakers were working fine and now they play to quietly and it has bursts of loud is it a short it seems as though there is a loose connection somewhere but i have replugged all the cables in i uninstalled the sound card and reinstalled it so i have no idea why it is doing this i do not think i blew the speakers because they sound fine in music quality its not a short or you would be having hardware issues you probably have one of two problems the volume knob can go bad and cause an issue like this sometimes you can trouble shoot this by wiggling the volume knob and seeing if the volume level changes if it does change then you need to buy new speakers if the first trick doesn't work then look for broken or loose connections in the wiring for the set Musical Instrument Digital Interface Ethernet Synthesizer Electric guitar RS-232 Computer hardware Harp IBM PC compatible Spyware Amstrad CPC IPod Effects unit Modem Atari 8-bit family Sound Blaster Acorn Electron Television Audiophile Sound card Loudspeaker Windows XP Shader Password GSM services Poker jargon Electronic organ Computer Digital photography Fender Telecaster Sound recording Multitrack recording Electrophysiology NTSC Internet fraud Modular synthesizer Shit MOS Technology SID Universal Serial Bus Advanced Technology Attachment Audio level compression Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Nintendo Entertainment System Musical terminology ZX Spectrum Non-native pronunciations of English Oscilloscope Laserdisc Cable television Trusted computing Embedded system Computer and video games Timpani Stage lighting Bubble Bobble Digital circuit Bluetooth Overhead lines Dyslexia TurboGrafx 16 ITunes Music Store Yu-Gi-Oh!
