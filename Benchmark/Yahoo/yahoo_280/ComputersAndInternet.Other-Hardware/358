ram clock speeds mhz vs mhz i bought an alienware pc about two years ago the motherboard that shipped with it was defective and it was replaced by compusa not recommended with a motherboard who's memory standard was mhz i was able to keep my memory mhz but at an increasing rate i realize that is far too little memory so i am determined to buy more ram which brings me to my question is ram clocked at mhz effective for gaming or would it be wiser to buy a motherboard that is capable of holding ram clocked at i would be buying at least gigs of ddr ram low cas and timings hopefully please note my budget is rather low i can buy a new motherboard but would prefer not to don't worry whether it's mhz or you do want at least a gb of ram though if you plan on using your pc for games gb would be even better and probably cheaper than you think get it at newegg com ddr is very cheap right now since ddr came out you can get gb at newegg for less than DDR SDRAM Dynamic random access memory AMD DDR2 SDRAM NVIDIA Overclocking Radeon Commodore 64 PowerPC Opteron Celeron Athlon Atari ST IMac GeForce 6 Series Timeline of computing 1990-forward Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME TRS-80 Color Computer Rambus Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple Macintosh VIA Technologies IBM PC Acorn Electron BBC Micro MSX PlayStation 3 Sound Blaster Atari 8-bit family Athlon 64 Xbox 360 Amiga Personal computer Front side bus MOS Technology 6502 Xeon Power Macintosh G3 Pentium M Apple IIGS Nintendo GameCube PC motherboard Commodore 128 Atari 2600 Clock rate Peripheral Component Interconnect Power Mac G4 A600 Hard disk Cyrix Oscilloscope Northbridge (computing) Sharp Zaurus Redundant array of independent disks Central processing unit PowerBook EMac Amstrad CPC DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Global Positioning System GeForce 256 DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX PlayStation 2 Radeon X Series TI-83 series 3dfx Pentium D ABIT CPU design Accelerated Graphics Port PR rating Voodoo 5 PlayStation Portable Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Sinclair ZX81 PC Engine Dance Dance Revolution VIA C3 ZigBee Xbox MOS Technology VIC-II MOS Technology Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Magnetic core memory Acorn Archimedes Sega Dreamcast MIPS architecture Static Random Access Memory Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) NTSC Nintendo DS Computer architecture Cisco PIX History of computer and video games Nintendo 64
