is hard disk a serial access memory device we have address for each sector of the drive so time require for accessing data is independent of address hard disk is a random access memory device we do have address for each sector on the drive but the disk provides random access to the data its a series of disks stacked together with a read write head each in other words u cud perceive it as a series of cds too the read write heads provide random access to the data stored on the disk and the time required for accessing the data is totally independent of its location on the disk hope your doubt is cleared now Hard disk Floppy disk Redundant array of independent disks Computer storage Flash memory Early IBM disk storage Data remanence Cache Booting Memory (computers) USB flash drive Disk storage Compact disc Atari 8-bit family Advanced Technology Attachment File Allocation Table Random access memory Computer bus Copy protection Forth programming language Windows 2000 File system Virtual memory Windows XP PDP-11 Partition (computing) Dynamic random access memory Binary prefix Computer CPU design AmigaOS Computer hardware Pointer Amstrad CPC Linked list PDP-8 Apple II family Commodore 64 Computer forensics Commodore DOS Motorola 68000 Surveillance ZX Spectrum MiniDisc Secure Digital card Static Random Access Memory Password Computer virus Enterprise content management Master Control Program Personal computer Disk image USB mass storage device class Magnetic core memory Linux DVD-RAM PlayStation 2 Turing machine Apple IIGS Disk cloning BIOS Commodore 128 Burroughs B5000 TRS-80 CPU cache MBASIC Library (computer science) Digital photography System/34 PaX Files-11 Dd (Unix) IBM 1620 System 7 (Macintosh) Universal Serial Bus X86 Apollo Guidance Computer Emulator System/36 CP/M Spring operating system RAM disk CDC 6600 Assembly language Backup Cray-1 Solid state disk Quicksort Federal Standard 1037C IBM 1130 Logical block addressing Disk formatting FireWire C programming language NTFS
