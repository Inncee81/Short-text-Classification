why arent my speakers working they were fine this morning and now you cant hear one thing and not even my headphones work did you turn windows media player down all the way before you shut it off this can cause the rest of the system sound to be too low to hear sometimes if that's not it the first thing that i would do is to check to make sure that it is not something pertaining to the software in winxp go to start control panel in the control panel go to performance and maintenance then open system in the systems property window click on the hardware tab at the top click on the button that says device manager look for your sound card in the list everything is listed in categories so you may have to click the next to audio devices to actually see it if it has a red or yellow mark by it it has a system problem possibly driver or something if it has no marks it is not the pc doing it on it's own it is something you have changed somewhere if it does have a mark double click right on the name of your sound card the property window will open click on the drivers tab in the next window click on roll back driver if this does not work go back to the device manager and highlight the sound card at the top is the actions menu click it tell it to uninstall agree to the warning once it has been removed restart your pc windows should put the drivers back when it restarts this may take a little time so let everything load completely when it restarts i hope all this helps Windows XP Mouse (computing) IPod Windows 2000 Screenshot Blue screen of death Virtual memory Object Desktop X Window System Embedded system Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows Macromedia Flash IBM PC compatible Booting Nintendo GameCube Control Panel (Windows) Windows Vista Architecture of Windows 2000 Palm OS Windows 3.x AmigaOS MAC address System 7 (Macintosh) Computer and video games Apple IIGS Taskbar Macintosh Finder Poker jargon Nintendo Entertainment System Headphones Kernel (computer science) Universal Serial Bus Modem Musical Instrument Digital Interface Device driver MSN Messenger Hello world program OpenGL Windows API Mozilla Firefox Guitar Creative Zen Audiophile Rootkit Stardock Common Unix Printing System ZX Spectrum Ethernet Bluetooth Sega Dreamcast CPU design Knoppix Gramophone record International Phonetic Alphabet Double-click (computing) Sony Prank flash Computer hardware History of the graphical user interface Computer software Bass guitar Fischer Random Chess File Allocation Table SonicStage Cheating in Counter-Strike CPU cache Xbox Digital rights management Dice Computer and video game genres Amstrad CPC Emacs Mac OS X v10.4 Spyware Danger Hiptop Game Boy Indianapolis 500 Linux kernel Mac OS X Computer bus NeXT Nintendo DS PlayStation Portable Digital audio workstation Windows Mobile Sound Blaster NX bit Redundant array of independent disks Windows 95
