i think my powersupply blew could it have taken other parts okay so my powersupply cconked and i know it was my power supply because it had started making a whining noise and today it failed to start and i got a burning smell from my comp now i have an antec p where the psu is separated from the rest of the system i obviously found a burning smell at the bottom of the case but i also found a burnign smell on my hds and inside the general system could it have taken all my system parts it does have that potential i've seen it happen where it was just the supply and when i installed the new one the system powered up fine however i also have seen it where when the power supply surged it shorted out different parts in that case it cooked the cpu video card and a capacitor on the motherboard i got a new board and supply cpu and put it back together but then it poofed again apparently it actually melted a few contacts on the memory if you are good with pc's get a power supply and start there but look at each component to make sure it doesn't smell burned or have any evidence where something looks burned or melted if not take it to a professional Capacitor plague Personal computer Overclocking PC motherboard Motherboard Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Central processing unit Computer bus RISC Circuit design ATI Technologies Soldering Atari ST TRS-80 Color Computer Fuse (electrical) Printed circuit board Graphics processing unit Nintendo Entertainment System Windows XP IBM PC CPU design Cray-1 Computer case Universal Serial Bus Switched-mode power supply Atari 8-bit family Internal ballistics PlayStation 2 NX bit Commodore 128 Amstrad CPC Computer hardware CPU cache Microprocessor Amiga Electrophysiology Computer Commodore 64 Acorn Electron Jet engine Apple IIGS Dynamic random access memory GeForce 6 Series Power Mac G4 Windows 2000 Sega Saturn Transistor ABIT Thermal power station SGI Indy Acorn Computers IBM PC compatible PlayStation 3 Glacier Radiation hardening Booting Altair 8800 Virtual memory Power supply Wind turbine Transformer Spacecraft propulsion Integrated circuit Zilog Z80 Cyrix Modchip Redundant array of independent disks MOS Technology Desktop computer ZX Spectrum Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Slot machine Nuclear meltdown MRAM Operational amplifier Ethernet Power Macintosh G3 Texas Instruments TI-99/4A AmigaOS Solar power NVIDIA Bubble Bobble STS-61 SIMD Xbox Orders of magnitude (numbers) Fritz-chip Electronic amplifier Opteron PowerPC Commodore PET High-voltage direct current Electric motor Nintendo Revolution Welding Circuit breaker Sound card BBC Micro
