how do i boot windows from an external usb hard drive i have a hp pavilion dv i cloned my internal hard drive on to my external hard drive my bios allows me to try to boot from the external usb hard drive but the bios checks to see if the hardware is working because the text on the screen says its searching for the ethernet port on my computer and when it doesn't find it it tries again it keeps doing this until i turn it off what do i do thanks i used acronis true image to copy the hard drive windows cannot boot from an external hard drive this has been researched countless times and nobody has been able to boot windows from an external without a crash on startup the most you can do is boot into dos command prompt from a floppy or flash drive and then u can enter certain commands but sorry try cloning the external to a new hard drive using a program like norton ghost regular copying the files over will not work only a program like ghost will do it Booting Apple II family DOS BIOS Hard disk File Allocation Table AmigaOS Floppy disk MS-DOS Disk cloning Computer virus Apple Macintosh FreeDOS IPod Windows XP LiveCD Universal Serial Bus Blue screen of death Atari 8-bit family Partition (computing) ZX Spectrum Ghost (software) Windows 3.x Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows IMac IBM PC CP/M PlayStation 2 File system Screenshot Personal computer Apple IIGS History of the graphical user interface History of operating systems SAM Coup__ Commodore International MAME COMMAND.COM Redundant array of independent disks History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Commodore 128 Computer hardware Microsoft Amstrad CPC Xbox NTFS Forth programming language Flash memory Puppy Linux Atari ST Desktop computer WordStar Computer forensics NTLDR Xerox Star Timeline of computing 1990-forward System 7 (Macintosh) Digital audio player USB mass storage device class TRS-80 DR-DOS NeXT Macintosh Finder Embedded system Nintendo Entertainment System Laptop Drive letter assignment Disk formatting PlayStation 3 Graphical Environment Manager MSX Bootable business card IBook Acorn Electron Atari 2600 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore DOS Power-On Self Test PlayStation Portable Creative Zen IBM Windows Me Digital photography Bluetooth X86 DOS Comparison Dongle Mozilla Firefox IA-64 Dual boot
