whats the difference between ram and video card ram i just started playing world of warcraft and when i installed the game it showed a message that said the minimum requirement for ram wasn't met but the game runs fine usually i have every setting on the lowest possible and the game usually runs between fps and fps just depending on what area i'm in ex a city full of people compared to an empty room i was just curious if increasing the amount of ram in my computer would improve performance or if i would have to buy a video card with more ram on it my current one is a geforce fx with mb of ram i think also would i have to switch from my current video card back to the motherboard one if i just increase the computer's ram sorry if this doesn't make much sense but thanks in advance for any help you can give the message you received means that you do not have sufficient system memory your video card should work fine as it meets the minimum requirements for wow you need to check your system specifications sheet for your motherboard to determine what type speed and maximum capacity of memory it supports it wouldn't hurt to know how much you currently have installed and what speed it is then add more memory to reach a minimum total of gig but gig would be better provided your motherboard supports that much what you are looking for on the spec sheet is does your motherboard use sdram ddr ddr speeds like pc pc pc pc etc it might list speeds like mhz mhz or mhz also these are represented by the first three listings i showed of pc above respectively video cards with dedicated memory do not increase the normal system resource memory which you are failing to meet that is entirely different memory for a specific purpose Radeon DDR2 SDRAM Overclocking Dynamic random access memory NVIDIA Redundant array of independent disks Opteron Pentium 4 PlayStation 3 Apple IIGS Windows 2000 IBM PC ZX Spectrum World of Warcraft Ethernet PowerPC GeForce 6 Series TRS-80 Color Computer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Random access memory Sound Blaster IMac Atari 8-bit family DDR SDRAM Apple II family Commodore 128 Poker jargon Nintendo GameCube Rambus Windows XP Power Macintosh G3 Counter-Strike Super Nintendo Entertainment System Xbox Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IBM PC compatible INMOS Transputer Universal Serial Bus MSX Dance Dance Revolution Musical Instrument Digital Interface AMD Betting (poker) Central processing unit Neo-Geo PlayStation 2 Amstrad CPC AmigaOS GeForce 4 VIA Technologies RISC Computer bus Mac OS X Slot machine PlayStation Portable Acorn Electron Celeron PC motherboard History of computer and video games Embedded system System/36 Amiga Commodore 64 Computer CPU design Atari ST Mouse (computing) Cyrix Computer and video games GeForce FX Computer and video game genres Athlon Front side bus In The Groove (game) PC Engine Windows Vista BBC Micro Nintendo Revolution Modchip Graphics processing unit Digital photography Microprocessor Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Cray-1 Blackjack GeForce 256 Magnetic core memory DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Global Positioning System
