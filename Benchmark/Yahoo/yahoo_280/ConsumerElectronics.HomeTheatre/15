can the t mobile aerial tower which has been erected near my home cause interference with my free view the problem is either with channel e etc or the itv channels ok the person above is right in part the frequencies are miles apart however there are two factors which mean the answer is yes it can interfere as well as the main frequency being broadcast any radio frequency also delivers 'shadow' transmissions which arise in diminishing strength at multiples of the main frequency these could well interfere as they exist far beyond the main radio frequency being put out by the mast tv ariels are capable of receiving a broad spectrum of frequencies not just your tv signal this is why tetra frequencies used by the emergency services can sometimes cause tv interference if you are close to the tetra ariel when tv ariels are installed some have a junction box which limits the frequencies to only those within the tv spectrum but this is rarely the case as housebuilders don't bother with the additional expense however be careful about directing your accusations at t mobile as the interference could be from a huge number of other sources e g bad ariel connections unshielded applicances in your home etc a solution is to call a tv ariel engineer and get shielded ariel cable and a junction box or make a complaint to ofcom who will come out and investigate they will test the signals at all frequencies being intercepted by your tv ariel Cellular network Antenna (radio) Terrestrial Trunked Radio Radio Wi-Fi Coaxial cable Amateur radio Federal Standard 1037C Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Broadband Internet access Cable television Citizens' band radio Code division multiple access Ultra high frequency Federal Communications Commission Satellite television Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing SETI Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Very high frequency Transformer Radar ITV Global System for Mobile Communications Telephone Color Bluetooth Digital audio broadcasting FM broadcasting IEEE 802.11 Frequency modulation Spread spectrum Ethernet Television Electromagnetic spectrum Global Positioning System Freeview Loudspeaker Modem Mediumwave Frequency-hopping spread spectrum Transistor Electrophysiology Digital Subscriber Line Fermi paradox Voice over IP Amplitude modulation Repeater Mobile phone radiation and health AM broadcasting Communications satellite Alternating current Nuclear magnetic resonance TV-FM DX Wardenclyffe Tower WiMAX Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus High-voltage direct current IS-95 High fidelity Mobile phone Impedance LORAN Morse Code Five (TV) Shortwave Pirate decryption Global Maritime Distress Safety System Oscilloscope Electricity pylon TGV British Sky Broadcasting Huygens probe High-definition television Teletext Microwave ALOHAnet Software-defined radio Media in Canada Time division multiple access Audiophile Radiotelephone Atari 8-bit family RS-232 Radio propagation Ultra wideband Ariel Sharon Ofcom Electric motor Speed of light American Forces Network
