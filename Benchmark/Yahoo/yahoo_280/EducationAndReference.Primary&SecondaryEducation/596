what should i do about teachers who behave unprofessionally the school year is beginning i'm new to this school district and new to teaching we've had orientation workshops and meetings this past week i've been thrown into group meetings with some very unprofessional behaving teachers administration does not seem to care about their comments what should i do how should i behave thank you negative behavior at the expense of others what is the unprofessonal behavior are they being goofy instead of serious or are they talking negatively about others my answer would vary depending on the situation addendum if the comments were directed at those not in the group and were meant to disparage them i would stay out of it no matter what workplace you will ever be a part of some people will be like this we are all human and some are better at keeping things to themselves than others don't associate with the negative people as you may inadvertantly gain a reputation for being one of them believe me everyone knows who they are and what they're doing talk to your mentor privately about this and how to handle it if you do not have a mentor approach the principal privately mentioning no names up front and tell him this made you uncomfortable and ask for his advice on the situation odds are he is aware of it and perhaps chose to deal with it by bringing these people in to his office privately that would be the professional thing to do it may also be that he is not aware of the comments and attitudes and would welcome hearing about them from an unbiased party the best way to deal with this is to just let the behaviors go it's not professional and not condusive to a good working environment but you need to find people who you feel comfortable with in your job don't let these nasty folks bring you down or keep you from focusing on what's important doing the best job you can and providing quality education for your students you will come out of this with a good reputation if you politley distance yourself from the negative ones with a no thanks i don't feel comfortable discussing this when they try to draw you into the conversations you will not be rude thus getting their wrath on you but you are letting them know you will not be a party to their negativity or simply smile and ignore the conversation if you are in a situation where you cannot exit gracefully good luck to you Social rule Ethics Theory of conduct Sexual orientation Traumatic incident reduction Dog training Alexander Technique Milton H.
