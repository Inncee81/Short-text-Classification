i need to get all a's in my first quarter of middle school august to some where near thanksgiving i need to get all a's because my dad lives in california and im visiting and we got a wii at first he said it was a graduation present but now its this so in order for me to bring the wii home to where i live i need to get straight a's my classes that i know since this is my first year in middle school are japanese reading math science and writing so could you give me study tips set up two hours or more each day for your studying and homework do it at the same time everyday also do your studying at the same place every day chose a room without any distractions in it pick someplace that people are not walking through it a lot also chose someplace with no tv if your parents have an office you could tell them what you are trying to do and you would like to reserve a seat at their desk for two hours or how much time you need just make it constant i am sure your parents will do whatever they can to help you make as if you stay with parents at different homes have a set place at each home and keep the time the same always take notes during class after each class take time to jot down what you learned from that day on a separate sheet and save i did this the first five minutes of the next class when everyone else was chatting i was writing at the end of each week take the daily sheets for each class and add items from your notes or other items pertaining to what you wrote was the main point from each class do this in an outline form then when it is time for tests you already have an outline to study from you just take the outlines from the weeks that you already have in outline form this way you can spend more time on studying because you do not have to take the time to make an outline good luck p s if your parents let you use your desk leave it clean Education in Romania GED Traditional animation Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Education in Germany Bristol Grammar School The Adventures of Pete & Pete Hangul Columbine High School massacre Education in the United States Homeschooling Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Murdock-Portal Elementary School Lynbrook High School Animal Crossing Social rule Education in Taiwan Japanese tea ceremony Walt Disney World College Program Education in the People's Republic of China Pittsburgh Steelers Harrow School Hunter College High School Julian day Winning Streak Education in France Moe Berg Grade (education) Saved by the Bell Pitaten Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Knife Massachusetts Institute of Technology Hopkins School Presentation University of Massachusetts Amherst Great Teacher Onizuka Boy Scouts of America College Musical notation USS Walke (DD-723) The Sims 2: University Sundial Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban For Better or For Worse Canonical hours Cascading Style Sheets Crossword Education Gaia Online No Child Left Behind Act Kindergarten About a Boy United States Naval Academy USS Tang (SS-306) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Secondary education in France Hikikomori Secondary education in Japan Bernard Williams Mid-levels Inheritance (computer science) USS Wallace L.
