how to be a good high school drum major i'm the drum major of my high school marching band i know that i was good enough to make it but i fear that i'm not good enough to be the drum major full time i back down from my band and let them roll all over me how do i take charge and make my band listen to me first you should talk to your band director for advice s he is on your side with things maybe s he needs to address the band and tell them that when the director isn't there you are in charge period and the director should explain what the consequences are if they don't listen try talking with the section leaders either together or separately maybe they can reign in their section a bit on the other hand it's marching band it's supposed to be fun disciplined but fun it can't be all drudgery all the time or people will quit you will be miserable too feel free to have fun and laugh every now and then think of good effective teachers you've had they know how to take charge when needed but they also know when to cut loose a bit when you are in the role of drum major be the drum major you shouldn't be drum major only when you're in front of the band when you're not leading the band don't lead the band just be yourself still be the teenager you are be sure to be nice to everyone though don't gossip and don't put people down Marching band Time Out of Mind Highway 61 Revisited Avenue Q The Wall Shaggy dog story Weezer Big band Plame affair Extreme Programming Craps Sly & the Family Stone Guns N' Roses Cliff Richard Real Love (song) Journey (band) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Timpani Blonde on Blonde Tears for Fears The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Oasis (band) Have I Got News For You Green Day 2000 Australian Grand Prix Drum March (music) Sinfest The Ashlee Simpson Show Textile manufacturing Human sexual behavior The Doors Communication skill English grammar Traumatic incident reduction The Monkees The Beatles discography Killing Joke Tommy Atkins Noel Gallagher Iron Maiden The Beach Boys Zhao Yun Drum and bass Virtual memory Jazz Self Portrait Milton H.
