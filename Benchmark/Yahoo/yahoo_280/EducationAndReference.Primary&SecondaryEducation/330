what do i do if my dad is teaching me at my school this year and i feel a little embarrassed i taught both of my children in high school it can be done here are a few things we did to keep it smooth i was clear that i would be just a hair rougher on them than on their classmates so that there would never be backlash on them from other students we were clear that they should avoid using our relationship because they would pay for it with their peers came up with something for them to call me other than dad as it turned out one of their classes dveloped a nickname for me so they could use that as easily as anyone what happens at home stays at home no okay you remember what we talked about at supper last night the basic is that your parent shouldn't give you special treatment and you shouldn't try to get it and if he's a little extra hard on you after class your classmates will be patting you on the back and saying dude i'm so sorry which is not so bad and you and your dad can work your stuff out at home The Adventures of Pete & Pete Social rule Great Teacher Onizuka The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Azumanga Daioh Education in the United States One Tree Hill (TV series) Danish Folkeskole Education Hey Jude Pitaten Hikikomori Dog training Boston Public Dad's Army Graduate school Saved by the Bell Stomach cancer For Better or For Worse Homeschooling Kim Possible Theory of conduct The Magic School Bus Marty McFly Calvin and Hobbes Beavis and Butt-head Grandview, U.S.A.
