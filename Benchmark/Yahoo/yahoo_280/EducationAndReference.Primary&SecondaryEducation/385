boarding school prep school private school i'll be attending mercersburg academy mercersburg is supposed to be an excellent boarding school with a large endowment i was just curious to hear about other boarding schools ps have you heard anything about mercersburg what do you think of people who attend private boarding school zach i am a mercersburg alumnus i graduated in the s you are correct it is an excellent boarding school and they continue to improve the school campus and the programs offered the campus still maintains its natural old school beauty while staying up to date with all the latest technology it also has a vibrant arts community if you're into that also the athletics are top tier i might also mention that the small town environment makes for an idyllic setting what i like best about mercersburg is its rich history every time i go back there i learn something new about the campus its alumni or its past visitors also no matter where you go in life you will always be a part of the mercersburg community i went back for alumni weekend last year and it was as though i had never left as for what i think about people who attend private boarding school i think they are pretty much like public schoolers except that they are mostly self motivated students who typically have another talent besides academics or they seek to develop one i found that unlike my experience at public school i didn't stand out as an academic elite in private school this was good for me because it motivated me to do better and surrounded me with kids who were as smart or smarter many of whom were willing to work with me to understand some of the more difficult concepts it was truly an academic community one other difference between public and private school is that you are instructed in private school but not baby sat they will not take your hand and make sure you are in class on time you are simply expected to do so all the time public schools spend baby sitting you is time spent on academics in private school that was refreshing to me one more thing that prep school does for you it leaves you with a sense that you will do something great with your life that you are equipped to take on the world and or that you are going to change it for the better of course there are no guarantees but it's a great start i hope this helps good luck at mercersburg and email me if you have any specific questions go blue Education in the United States The Hill School Caulfield Grammar School Johns Hopkins University Independent school (UK) University of Virginia University of Connecticut American University University of Southern California University-preparatory school SAT Homeschooling College Georgetown University Education in Japan University of Alabama Ivy League High school University of Central Florida Graduate school Phillips Exeter Academy University of Michigan Shreveport, Louisiana Duke University Virginia Military Institute University of California, Irvine Purdue University St. Ignatius College Prep Vanderbilt University Columbia University Affirmative action Education in Germany Carnegie Mellon University Tulane University Education in the People's Republic of China University of California, Los Angeles Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of Houston Pennsylvania State University Cornell University Florida State University Anglo-Chinese School United States Naval Academy University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill The Citadel (Military College) University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Emerson College Education in Malaysia College and university rankings Franklin W.
