does she really need that many my daughter is going into th grade so she got supply list off the internet she's anxious and it said composition note books i really don't think she needs that many what do you think she need'll need all those notebooks one per subject to begin with i actually needed more but i had extra subjects another option is to get a thick notebook with dividers a notebook with dividers is slightly cheaper to begin with depending on the brand it can actually be more costly but soon turns into a mess as some sections are filled and others aren't new books are needed sooner and in the long run this is both more expensive and a huge disorganised mess i've found having four notebooks was great to begin with and then just buying more when needed as they filled up was both cheaper and easier to work with and being organised like that means it's easier to revise and learn too if you're still worried most schools have an individualised preset list available for those who aren't sure that suits that school these usually take into consideration other things as well for example mathematics might require a normal book plus a grid book you could always try enquiring with the school Incandescent light bulb Laptop Social rule GED Solar cell IBM PC compatible Pump It Up Scuba set Beatmania IIDX Education in the People's Republic of China Mouse (computing) SAT Mattress Energy development Redundant array of independent disks Computer Hybrid vehicle Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Education in Romania CPU design Propaedeutic value of Esperanto MAME Contract bridge Education in Singapore 1957 World Series Education in Australia Strap-on dildo Apple Macintosh Economics Prostate cancer CPU cache Sweatshop Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Illegal drug trade Stars!
