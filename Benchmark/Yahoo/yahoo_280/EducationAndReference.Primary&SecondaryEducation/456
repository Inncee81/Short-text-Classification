should a year old student be kicked out of school or extra curricular activities just because of a tattoo school policy dictates no illegal activity gang activity or cult tattoo allowed she has a triquetra representing balance of mind body and spirit she has been on honor roll very involved in school academics and athletics and they want to kick her out of everything i am her mother if i am not throwing a fit they should not it is not visible unless they are watching her undress it is between her shoulder blades and is only about inches diameter what does ink have to do with obtaining an education i agree school is for learning education and discipline and if tattoos set a bad example then the staff should not have them either it is on her back and not able to be seen unless people are watching her dress undress she did not set out to disobey any rule we were not even aware it was in the policy until today and it specifies what is not allowed she is not a gang member nor a wannabe she did not get it as a cult it was researched and indicates balance of mind body and spirit and the circle of life as for parental consent in this day and time i am sure we are all aware things can be done without actual consent i would rather partake in the choices and artist than her go underground and get some disease since a triquetra can be a symbol of anything from the trinity to paganism to a cultic symbol i would advise being careful on how you approach this with the school administration i understand that to her it symbolizes balance but it has been used in a huge number of ways and can easily be misinterpreted there could be any number of reasons they have a problem with it just plain ignorance it could be that it's a symbol they don't understand and they are hesitant to allow her to have it in school if this is the case i would have research available to show exactly what it is to her and why she chose to get that particular tattoo since she is very involved and on honor roll it's likely that she is able to communicate well in writing and or face to face if they will allow her to present her case and she can do so objectively and without getting upset this may do a lot to sway them they may have had problems with students with tatts in the past if so see if something can be worked out is she willing to keep it covered while on school grounds and school events sports they're afraid of backlash and just trying to cover their butts but they're being overzealous about it document her past involvement and the fact that she is not a trouble maker the tatt was a symbolic thing that is important to her symbolizing her priority of staying balanced in life as neither she nor you knew about the rule and she hasn't made a point of flaunting it hopefully her record will speak for itself ink can have something to do with obtaining an education depending on the school they may have adapted a zero tolerance policy in an effort to keep it from becoming a fad a contest between the kids or an area that accepts gang activity unfortunately because they have a responsibility to provide a safe and disciplined environment for all the students it may be a measure they felt they had to take in your daughter's case as long as she is respectful in taking on any requirements they may have in keeping it covered and keeping her grades and involvement where they have been it's likely that they may be willing to make an exception Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Scientology beliefs and practices Alexander Technique Tai Chi Chuan Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses GED Mixed martial arts French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Social rule Graduate school Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe A Course In Miracles Contract Infantilism Sigmund Freud Economics Mahjong Children of God Social psychology Reiki Cult Volleyball Separation of church and state Password Education in the People's Republic of China Equine conformation Martial art Polyamory Electrophysiology Philosophy of mathematics Sento Abortion in the United States Education in Portugal University of Bristol Abortion debate Philosophy of language Fathers' rights Football (soccer) Surveillance Marching band Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Aerial (dance move) Asperger syndrome Milton H.
