why don't schools teach anything worthwhile most of everything i know i have taught myself through voluntary research into various subjects school if anything only held me back sure school teaches reading writing and basic math but why go on after th grade is the only purpose of schools to keep the population in a dumb vegitative and obedient state why don't schools teach nietzsche or theoretical physics instead of this is how to be a good slave or teaching youths how to abandon their nature and sellout their humanity and become nothing but mindless machines for capitalism school is anti intelligence i wonder how old you are by the way you ask im pretty sure you learned a lot from school there will always be good teachers and bad teachers but you learn from them just the same your question must have sprung from the idealism and skepticism of youth and about nietzsche and physics yes they are taught in school arent they remember this little knowledge is very dangerous as you acquire more knowledge the more you realize that you only know too little you are an intellectual i can see that just give you present school a chance if you decide to go to higher studies pick a nice school and im pretty sure youll get what you want there and maybe even more Education Education in Romania Rudolf Steiner Meaning of life Graduate school Waldorf Education Education in the United States SAT Leo Strauss No Child Left Behind Act Mathematics Objectivist philosophy Plato Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Education in Germany Grade (education) Intelligent design movement Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Portugal Philosophical skepticism Literacy A Course In Miracles William A.
