on sept i'm going to high school and i'm nervous does anyone have tips to surviving in high school i'm going to be a freashman on sept long but helpful i promise the one most important thing is that everyone is nervous remember that because it helps to know you're not alone in these situations just look at all the other soon to be freshmen posting this same exact question they're all nervous too don't feel like you're the only one who's scared do your summer reading because it really does count towards your grade go to orientation if your school has it jot down a few notes or just try to remember the teachers are not out to get you they don't hate you and they want you to do your best work if you're falling behind just talk to them privately and ask them if you can get after school help not doing that was the worst mistake i ever made i had to retake freshman english last year when i was a sophomore it brought my self esteem down for a while if your school gives you an agenda use it you may think you'll remember all your homework but truth is there's a lot more homework than you think although some of it is easy so don't think you're going to have billion algebra problems if your school doesn't give you an agenda buy one or even buy a mini diary to write your homework and stuff in making friends is easy if you speak up and be yourself if you pretend to be something you're not chances are everyone will notice if you're sitting alone find someone else who's sitting alone start up a conversation if you don't want to talk to someone else who is sitting alone go up to a nice looking group of people try to find a person you've noticed in one of your classes to talk to you don't need to have a boyfriend or girlfriend on the first week don't have sex no matter how much someone may pressure you ditto with drugs just don't do it there's no freshman beat down day so don't stay home because you think you're going to be beaten i know so many people who actually stayed home on that day when we were freshman and i still get a good laugh about it because i told them all along it wasn't real you're not going to be stuffed in your locker best of luck to you Social rule Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) FoxTrot Great Teacher Onizuka Kodocha Education in Romania EastEnders Piccolo Junior Saga Jon Secada The Catcher in the Rye Saved by the Bell Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Student Grade (education) Singlish Test (student assessment) Dawson's Creek Plame affair I Want to Hold Your Hand Teen Girl Squad Neighbours Undergrads Knots Landing Code: Lyoko Can't Hardly Wait Richard Feynman YuYu Hakusho Full Metal Panic?
