will i pass ok so this is what happen i had to take a advanced class and failed the first semester but they sent me off to the second part of it and i don't know i will be held back for it but i passed the second part and all my other classes why they sent you to the second part if you didn't pass the first is beyond me but perhaps they think you just had a bad day and that you would do better in the future they put you in the advanced class in the first place they clearly think you're smart enough anyway if you passed the second part of every other class what's to say you won't pass this the best way is to revise thoroughly and make sure you understant the topics ask your teacher if you have to they won't mind going over it again browse on the internet and make sure you remember the basic facts hope you do well Theory of conduct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Social rule Samuel Goldwyn Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Time Out of Mind Kasparov versus The World Jaime Escalante Graduate school Philosophical skepticism Craps 1957 World Series Contract bridge GED Hopkins School Spanish verbs Professor The Catcher in the Rye Education in Romania Elizabeth Smart kidnapping Judicial review Jeb Bush The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Pittsburgh Steelers Poker jargon The Times They Are A-Changin' Blonde on Blonde Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics The Fairly OddParents Gwinnett University Center Sydney Riot of 1879 Cyprus dispute The Star Wars Holiday Special The nature of God in Western theology The Apprentice 3 Super Bowl X Sheepshead StarCraft: Uprising The Citadel (Military College) Cleveland Browns Education in Germany Montreal Screwjob Solarquest Tabbed document interface Super Bowl XI Education in the People's Republic of China Martial art German student movement Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Tripartite System Battle of Chancellorsville The Contender (television series) Super Bowl IX Jon Secada ISO 9000 Hunter College High School Empire Burlesque Modem One Tree Hill (TV series) Super Bowl XXVII No Child Left Behind Act Plagiarism Gemini 9A Japanese tea ceremony Indian Round Table Conferences 1931-1933 Shaggy dog story Battle of Bassorah Chess terminology Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler The Shining (film) Grade (education) Jeopardy!
