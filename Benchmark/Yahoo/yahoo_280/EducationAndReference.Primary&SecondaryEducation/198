will this hurt me i'm a sophomore and i'm concerned about things this year was my first year in a public floridian high school i passed the english part of the fcat a test you need to past in order to receive your high school diploma but failed the math section by points what kind of happened was that i was so nervous that when i opened the math section i had a nervous breakdown my hands trembled i couldn't do anything i am terrible in math i got a b in the class this year but still it wasn't enough i'm a honors student who is taking pre ap english next year and a lot of other challenging classes i really want to go to college i'm thinking of university of miami but i don't want my math to hold me down do you think this will hurt my chances of getting in um should i not worry about it first you need to calm down a bit many students suffer anxiety before taking such important tests especially if they feel they are not particularly good in the topic with a b you certainly should have the skill i believe you will have another opportunity to take this test before you go have a discussion with the school counselor maybe he she has some ideas that will help your test taking ability good luck and don't worry about um quite yet Theory of conduct Education in the United States GED Quizbowl Grade (education) Miami-Dade County Public Schools Anxiety Advanced Placement Program Homeschooling Milton H.
