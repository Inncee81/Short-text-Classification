whats high school like high school for me so far it's confusing in middle school they prepared us for life to be so much harder and way more hectic but i was overprepared and way stressed out and laughed about it later i'm not saying academically it will be a piece of cake it is harder than middle school but if you study and do your homework you should be okay socially for me there wasn't much drama we got most of it out in middle school it's still there but it's mostly among the people that have yet to realize petty rivalries and he said she said doesn't matter i kinda felt like i was distanced from my best friend because we didn't have any classes together but we're still friends now because we call each other and stuff peer pressure it's there but you shouldn't have to listen to it stuff like you should only shop at aeropostale or you need to have the latest cell phone doesn't matter because it's all material and about what you want not what you need to fit in with a certain group of people there kind of is pressure to start a relationship with someone but you really don't need to listen to it unless you want to start a relationship i seriously doubt that you will be looked down upon for not being in a romantic relationship i wasn't if there are people that do tease you for it well they don't have their priorities in order there are some of those in every high school they need a zillion relationships for a reason the best thing to remember is just to be yourself your true friends will love you for it others will admire you for it and you'll be the better person for it it will keep you sane and down to earth in a time that may seem hectic and confusing ps if you're wondering why i seem to answer all your questions well yahoo answers sends me an e mail when you ask one so i answer it i'm not stalking you or anything lol Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Time Out of Mind Social rule Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Friends Plame affair Saved by the Bell God Emperor of Dune Piccolo Junior Saga Blood on the Tracks Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Transactional analysis One Tree Hill (TV series) Singlish Kim Possible The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Philosophical skepticism Anne Boleyn She Loves You Sexual orientation Philosophy of language Douglas Adams Avenue Q Little Britain 2000 Australian Grand Prix Empire Burlesque Calvin and Hobbes Education in the People's Republic of China The Apprentice 2 Culture of Lithuania Current teachings of Prem Rawat Surveillance The Emancipation of Mimi Rei Ayanami Radio Yerevan Taxi Driver Ex-gay Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Deconstruction StarCraft Episode VI Cliff Richard The Amber Spyglass W.I.T.C.H.
