how do i deconstruct a music video i need to deconstruct the film clip of a popular song and discuss the elements of teen sub culture that exist within the video and lyrics i have chosen to deconstruct linkin park's what i've done however i have not been shown and cannot find material on the internet that tells the steps to take to deconstruct a music video can you help look at it in pieces your assignment says elements of teen subculture what are they the way teens dress the way teens interact the things teens eat the way teens fix their hair tatoos body piercings use electronic media etc so once you have defined teen subculture all you have to do is look at the lyrics and look at the video and point out the examples from those two things that provide illustrations of those things sounds like a fun project good luck Linkin Park Deconstruction Music genre Hip hop music Goth Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) Subculture Music Kylie Minogue Death rock The Chemical Brothers Grunge music "Weird Al" Yankovic Bj__rk The Ashlee Simpson Show Remix ABBA Superhero Computer and video games Columbine High School massacre Karaoke Teen Girl Squad Hilary Duff Nu metal Bondage (BDSM) Disc jockey MTV Video Music Award Punk rock Postmodernism High school subcultures Emo Rave party Bastard pop Gender role Drum and bass Rock (music) Avril Lavigne MTV Fort Minor Video game music Pornography American Pie (song) Najwa Karam Tonality Weezer Arcade game Lindy Hop Nihilism Nirvana (band) Boy band Nine Inch Nails Music video Quarashi Mosh Folk music Heavy metal music Comedy film Prank flash Heavy metal fashion First-person shooter Public domain Homestar Runner Gothic rock Neologism Adolescence Jeopardy!
