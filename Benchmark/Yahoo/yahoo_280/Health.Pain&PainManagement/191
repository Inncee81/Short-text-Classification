i am very sore how do i get rid of the pain to start off i jog usually every other day and do torso workouts on the odd days on the days i jog i go for about minutes so i sweat a lot but i'm not necessarily really tired well yesterday i felt like pushing it a bit i decided to jog for hours because i had woken up early i had my jog and i was so tired after that i almost felt like laying down at work when i usually have tons of energy i got through the day and only felt tired no soreness yet so i woke up this morning and my quads glutes and calves are very very sore they feel tight and painful when i stretch today is a odd day so i wont be jogging but i am worried that by tomorrow i will be so sore that i cant even run my normal minutes are there any tricks or things that i can do to relieve the soreness by tomorrow morning but if not should i wait till the soreness is completly gone to go running again any help is greatly appreciated i would suggest ice ibuprofen and stretching out your muscles i would also take it easy until you begin to feel better because you need to give your body time to heal and recuperate before you begin running again Weight training Massage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Equine conformation Milton H.
