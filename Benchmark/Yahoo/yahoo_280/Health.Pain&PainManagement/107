does this happen u ever wake up in the middle of the night and ur hand feels extremely numb kinda like pins and needles why does this happen and can i stop it yeah it actually happens quite often lol yes this is due to lack of bloodflow in your hands sometimes when u sleep on them for a long time the pressure of ur body blocks the blood circulation you can say that ur hand is dead when waking up the movements created by ur body re activate the blood flow the pins and needled are created by blood being pumped afresh in ur veins you cannot stop this but can make ur hand come alive faster by putting ur hand in an upright position and by pumping movements of ur hand palm and fingers Carpal tunnel syndrome Dialysis Circulatory system Intravenous therapy Insulin Naruto jutsu Siphon Heart Drowning Mattress Cirrhosis Blood pressure Shock Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Naruto kekkei genkai Stroke Equine conformation Out-of-body experience Reflexology Backstroke Professional wrestling holds Double bass Prostate cancer Bleeding Blood vessel Casualty lifting Air embolism First aid Traumatic brain injury Paresthesia Vampire Fast bowling Diving Atrial septal defect Volleyball The Cure Kidney Professional wrestling match types Sleep Reptile Knife Shaggy dog story Infusion pump Anatomical terms of location Cardiac arrhythmia Subdural hematoma The Suffering (game) Glossary of American football Butterfly stroke Violin Blushing Niddah Textile manufacturing Bondage (BDSM) Fetus Lethal injection Acupuncture Methamphetamine Characters of Naruto Aneurysm Chlorpromazine Swingout Eye Hand Kill Bill Naval mine Caffeine Blood (computer game) Fist of the North Star Earring Skittles (sport) Myocardial infarction Repetitive strain injury Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus Cavitation Upholstery Suicide methods Sin City The Amber Spyglass Liquid breathing Wound Ventricular fibrillation Sleep apnea Uncanny Valley Milton H.
