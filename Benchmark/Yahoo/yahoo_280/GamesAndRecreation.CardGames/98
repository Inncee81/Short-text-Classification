how do you play uno i also need to know some rules as well each player is dealt cards with the remaining ones placed face down to form a draw pile the top card of the draw pile is turned over to begin a discard pile the first player has to match the card in the discard pile either by number color or word for example if the card is a red player must throw down a red card or any color or the player can throw down a wild card if the player doesn't have anything to match he must pick a card from the draw pile if he can play what is drawn great otherwise play moves to the next person when you have one card left you must yell uno meaning one failure to do this results in you having to pick two cards from the draw pile that is of course if you get caught by the other players once a player has no cards left the hand is over points are scored see scoring section and you start over again that's uno in a nutshell choosing a dealer each player picks a card the player who picks the highest number deals if you picked a word card too bad they don't count player to the left of the dealer starts play starting a discard pile well if a word card is the first one turned up from the draw pile this is what happens wild draw four it's put back in the deck and another one is chosen wild card the player to the left of the dealer calls out a color then plays draw two card the player to the left of dealer must pick two cards and then the next player goes sad but true reverse card the dealer plays first but then goes to the right instead of the left skip card the player to the left of dealer doesn't start get it he's skipped the player to the left of him starts what word cards mean draw two cards when this card is played the next person to play must draw cards and forfeit his turn reverse card simply reverse direction of play play left becomes play right and vice versa skip card the next player to play loses his turn and is skipped mighty clever wild card this card can be played on any card the person playing the card calls any color to continue play including the one presently being played if desired a wild card can be played even if the player has another playable card in his hand wild draw four card this is the best meanest most sneaky card to have not only does the player get to call the next color played but the next player has to pick cards and forfeit his turn there is a hitch however of course you can only play this card when you don't have a card in your hand that matches the color of the card previously played note a player may have a matching number or word card of a different color in his hand and plays his wild draw four card what are these extra cards for blank card this is a special card that you may use in one of two ways if a card from your uno deck is lost or damaged you may use the blank card as a replacement example if you find that your deck is missing one of the yellow 's you would simply replace it by taking the yellow blank card marking a on it and adding it back into the deck if you family has a special uno rule you prefer to play with you may write that rule on the blank cards and add them straight to the deck going out a player who forgets to say uno before his card touches the discard pile but catches himself before any other player catches him is safe and is not subject to the penalty you may not catch a player for failure to say uno until his second to last card touches the discard pile also you may not catch a player for failure to say uno after the next player begins his turn beginning a turn is defines as either drawing a card from the draw pile or drawing a card from your hand to play if the last card played in a hand is a draw two or wild draw four card the next player must draw the two or four cards these cards are counted when points are totaled if no one is out of cards by the time the draw pile is depleted reshuffle and continue play scoring when a player is out of cards he gets points for cards left in the opponent's hands as follows all cards through face value draw points reverse points skip points wild points wild draw points the winner is the first player to reach points however the game may be scored by keeping a running total of points of each player is caught with at the end of each hand when one player reaches points the player with the lowest points is the winner Crazy Eights Stud poker Tag Cheating in poker Hearts (game) Big Two Euchre Yu-Gi-Oh!
