naruto cards hi i was wondering if anybody could tell me the rules for both players when conducting a mental power battle and how this is conducted please a mental power is only conducted by the effect of another card ie cheating shikamaru's effect the only difference between a regular battle and a mental power battle is that instead of using the combat support values of the ninja you use the mental power of the ninjas which is found in the information line which includes things like gender village and rank mental power battles are fought at the sime time as regular battles and one team cannot have both a regular battle and a mental battle at the same time Nara Shikamaru Naruto (manga) Hatake Kakashi Characters of Naruto Uzumaki Naruto Pok__mon Trading Card Game Uchiha Sasuke Rock Lee Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 Naruto ninja ranks Naruto geography Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 4 Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 2 Hyuga Neji Martial art Contract bridge Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Blackjack Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen Naruto jutsu Canasta Playoff Mao (game) StarCraft Secret Missions Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
