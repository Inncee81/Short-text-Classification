pokemon and magic cards while cleaning up my room i found the great remnants of an old past time of mine pokemon and magic the gathering the pokemon cards i have are from the very early era pokemon st edition and some fossil the magic cards i have are mainly tempest th and th along with many others some as old as arabian nights are these cards worth anything would you reccomend selling them or keep on waiting well if you have no intention of ever playing those games again selling them should be a good idea every tcg has a limited life span in the case of magic they do not allow players to use the older cards on current tournaments so every year you hold on to the cards they lose value Pok__mon Trading Card Game Yu-Gi-Oh!
