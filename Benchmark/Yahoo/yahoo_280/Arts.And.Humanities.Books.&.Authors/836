horcruxes does anyone think voldemort could have placed his horcruxes in objects that were harder to find instead of putting them in valuable objects i thought it would be smarter to put them in random objects like empty potion bottles so even if someone knew about horcruxes they wouldn't know what it was since he feared death and wanted to remain immortal it would have been better but then again it is just a book i know he liked to collect things of importance and that is why he made his horcruxes into the objects of the four founders of hogwarts i know he wouldn't put them into random objects of no importance because he thought he was the greatest wizard ever i just thought it would be better smarter to put them in objects harder to find well he was so should i say vain that he would have never let something hold a piece of his soul that was practically trash i think even he might have thought that the places he hid them were impossible to find proof of that is in the chapter when there looking for the horcrux at hogwarts and voldemort doesn't think they'll find it but they did that was his personal decision but as my choice of a hiding place i'm with u too Horcrux Harry Potter (character) Horace Slughorn Magic (Harry Potter) Magical objects in Harry Potter Dark Art Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter: Book Seven Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Tom Riddle R.A.B.
