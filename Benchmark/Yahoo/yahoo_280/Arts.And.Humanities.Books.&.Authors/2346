i've just finished reading a book called ishmael by daniel quinn and the book led me to wondering about a few stuff in your opinion is man the climax of the whole cosmic drama of creation because this is what the takers seem to believe knowledge about how to live is unattainable in any of the ways we derive certain knowledge well for obvious reasons mankind would like to believe so this is possible but in no way certain a very humano centric point of view this is pretty vague i could say that we have determined that not smoking is a solid how to live recommendation based on certain knowledge finally likewise exercise and don't overeat and several other things like don't play in traffic brush your teeth put on clean underwear look ahead while driving etc etc etc these are all things based on solid knowledge of how to live most if not all scientifically based in other words attained through application of scientific method certainly we do not know everything about how to live let's face it we don't know everything about anything even if you make something say a macaroni picture with glue like we used to do in art class you don't know how long the macaroni will last if the glue will hold the macaroni on the paper indefinitely how long the paper will last what color everything will turn after sitting in the sunlight etc etc even the things we make with our own hands we do not know everything about so i guess the short answers are maybe but there is no convincing reason to think so false jim www life after harry potter com Ishmael (novel) Theory of conduct Epistemology Friedrich Schleiermacher Scientific method Alfred Korzybski Water Theodicy Creationism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Intelligent design Bertrand Russell GED Evil Determinism Mythology Time Out of Mind Logic Free will End times Strategic management Philosophical skepticism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Philosophy of science Science Publication of Darwin's theory Philosophy of language Annuity Pottery God Karl Popper Nihilism The writing of Principia Mathematica Textile manufacturing Human nature Philosophy Cultural relativism Victor Cousin Roe v.
