anyone else disappointed in eclipse spoilers okay i'm pretty mad at stephenie right now what was up with the whole jacob bella thing and then edward wasn't mad about it and all the sex junk i mean honestly if we wanted that we would read a trashy romance novel oh wait this was one and the whole jacob narration and bella didn't get transformed i feel like burning the book and the volturi were like oh hey that's cool bella's still human we'll just go chat with aro and leave you all alone lame i wasn't pissed per say but i definitely expected more like now i have to wait to see if bella was gonna be turned the whole bella jacob thing was annoying ecspecially their long alk at the end when she was all i love you than she returns to edward and wishes she was in anotehr set of arms if she chooses jacob over edward i'd be mad and it isnt fair how she portrayed bella loving jacob but less and what was all the sex stuff without actually saying sex but i do think the main idea of the novels are that they are vampire love sagas it said that on the barnes and nnoble sign the whole jacob narration was unesseceary i can't wait til the nxt one comes out and i hope its alot better and ya i definitely thought the volturi hated edward alice bella but she did try her power on bella even if it didnt work so i guess they were portrayed as rule enforcers with just a touch of hatred personally i wouldnt be able to handle another anti cullen attack in that book but it was good i love vampires Blood on the Tracks Sex Pistols EastEnders Obi-Wan Kenobi Bat Lash Jon Secada Fight Club Kodocha Douglas Adams Shaggy dog story Little Britain Garfield Academy Award for Original Music Score Hey Jude AVN Awards Dawson's Creek Edward II of England Fantastic Four Fruits Basket Milton H.
