harry potter what harry potter character is your favorite mine is dobby and proffessor lockhart i think lockhart is funny when he loses his memory severus snape has always been my favorite character and i have always trusted him even before the definite proof we got in this book spent quite a bit of time defending him explaining his actions after the last book and i am proud to say i was correct in almost everything only his motives i didn't know i just felt we didn't have enough information to know what caused him to be loyal to albus so i just held my judgment on that part and i'm very very sad severus had to die he out of all people should've had a chance at a normal life and his death was so senseless since he wasn't even the master of the elder wand was that really necessary for the story does a bad guy turning out good really always have to die a heroic death at the last moment can't help but think jkr may've killed him off because she wasn't really comfortable with how many fans among the readers he had read an interview where she said she really couldn't understand how many people liked even loved him while he was so obviously nasty so maybe she wanted him dead to stop half the female readers daydreaming about him or it may have been a more general way of tying up loose ends like the epilogue in which she shows the trio all married neville at hogwarts etc if he'd survived she would've had to show a few more reactions from the main characters apart from the name of harry ginny's kid whatever it was i'd have liked it better if he had at least gotten one of the horcruxes in the process although neville getting nagini was really cool too thus it was neville who was so afraid of severus the boggart even took his shape ended up being the one to avenge him i've really liked neville too at first i didn't think much of him either way but from book on he was much more interesting Harry Potter (character) Severus Snape Lord Voldemort Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Albus Dumbledore Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter: Book Seven Magic (Harry Potter) Hermione Granger Remus Lupin Battle of Hogwarts James and Lily Potter Blood purity (Harry Potter) Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Neville Longbottom Hogwarts Death Eater Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Fan fiction Sybill Trelawney Horace Slughorn Hogwarts Houses Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Dumbledore's Army Minor Ravenclaws Sirius Black Horcrux Diagon Alley Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Luna Lovegood Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Gilderoy Lockhart Order of the Phoenix Days of our Lives Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Draco Malfoy Harry Potter Hogwarts Floor Directory Rubeus Hagrid Fawkes Tom Riddle's diary Professor Quirrell Minerva McGonagall Minor Hogwarts teachers Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Minor Hufflepuffs Piccolo Junior Saga Aberforth Dumbledore Dobby Potions in Harry Potter Boggart (Harry Potter) Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Charmed Poppy Pomfrey Dark Art Bat Lash R.A.B.
