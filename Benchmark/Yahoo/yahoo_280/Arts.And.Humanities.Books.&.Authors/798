i'm starting to write a novel and have a problem with the title i'm attempting to start a novel series i plan on calling it the chosen and having a subtitle on each novel i e the chosen the assassin's blade yet there is a s book called the chosen would i be infringing on copyright issues to call my series the chosen or is it legally fine titles are not copyrighted however in this case the chosen by chiam potok is a highly successful book and i would avoid that exact title it is ok if the book isn't a huge best seller but i wouldn't use the title of a best seller change it slightly the chosen ones the chosen idea has kind of been used a lot starting with the bible secondly don't dwell on titles do your homework work on your character studies and a strong outline i will be honest with you of the four novels i wrote and two children's books i ghostwrote none of them had a title until i was done the truth is if you sell it the publisher has the right to change the title without your consent and most publishers would change the chosen just because the potok is a well known classic the book i am working on now is the first book i ever named up front i won't give you the title but it comes from a line of an emily dickenson poem the problem with novice writers is they focus on cute character names and book titles that isn't what is important i also changed the name of a lead character in a book after it was totally done once a publisher can do that too a very famous ny times bestselling author once told me he had a huge fight with his editor over the title of one of his books all his books were two word titles which his publisher preferred the publisher felt two word titles fit better when the book gets to paperback this author always used two word titles then he wrote a book he gave a five word title to the publisher wanted it changed the author dug in his heels and he is a big enough literary superstar to get his way the five word title stuck if it was a lesser author it would have been changed my late uncle was a well known author in a particular non fiction genre he once wrote a book with a two word title and a word subtitle his publisher let it stand but when it was released in paperback the subtitle disappeared man was he ticked off it changed the whole meaning of the title he lost the battle the title is different on his hardcover and paperback editions personally while i am working on a book i usually use wip for work in progress when the book is ready to it names itself same for the characters wait and see just work for now focus on your homework do your research your outlines your character studies let names and titles fall into place when they are ready pax c Doctor Who spin-offs Theory of conduct Miracleman The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Copyright Chuck Palahniuk DC Comics Crime fiction Harlan Ellison Science fiction Fan fiction Publishing EastEnders C.
