the bible the gospels in which order do the four official gospels appear in the bible is this the same order that they were written in chronologically first realize that no one knows for certain that being said there are theories based on linguistics and also on what is included in each of the gospels themselves realize that these are just theories based on little more than supposition here is a theory a very brief overview i am taking from the new jerusalem bible matthew composed the first gospel called proto matthew in aramaic soon afterwards some other author composed a text of jesus' sayings called s in aramaic next proto mark derived from proto matthew also another source of luke and john passion and resurrection called p middle matthew borrows from proto mark and s proto luke uses proto mark middle matthew s and p final matthew uses middle mark final mark uses middle matthew and proto luke final luke uses middle matthew plus at least one additional source not available to any other gospel writer supposed dates first proto gospel and s just before c e mark between and c e matthew and luke no later than c e john written separately but with knowledge of at least some sources before c e i know this is really confusing this also shows that we really don't know how the gospels developed although it seems likely that the original proto gospels were added to from other sources in an attempt to collect all the knowledge about jesus' life into one book thus it is unlikely that any of them had only one author at one time luke alone suggests this although if it was added to it is unlikely that anyone would have tried to take credit in the gospel itself for making additions we know for a fact because we have older versions that matthew mark and john have additions this does not mean that they are not valid additions it merely means that these additions were not in the original works i hope this helps jim http www jimpettis com wheel Gospel New Testament Gospel of Luke Jesus Gospel of Mark Saint Peter Apocrypha Acts of the Apostles Historical Jesus Aramaic of Jesus Bible Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Q document Historicity of Jesus New Testament view on Jesus' life Names and titles of Jesus Gospel of Peter Resurrection of Jesus Chronology of Jesus New Testament apocrypha Apostle Gospel of John Dating the Bible Thomas (Apostle) Aramaic language Barabbas History of the English Bible Nazarene Mary, the mother of Jesus Christian eschatology Book of Daniel Biblical inerrancy Sabbath Baptism Christian views of Jesus End times Saint James the Just Mary Magdalene Paul of Tarsus Christianity Authorship of the Johannine works Cultural and historical background of Jesus Book of Kells The Passion of the Christ Secret Gospel of Mark Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Judas Iscariot Book of Revelation Joseph of Arimathea Biblical studies Biblical Magi Gospel of the Hebrews John Wenham Gospel of Barnabas Abrahamic religion Markan priority Tetragrammaton Christmas Vulgate Dispensationalism Augustinian hypothesis Prophet Pontius Pilate King James Version of the Bible Timeline of Christianity Apocalyptic literature Passion Mark 16 Hebrew language Jerome The Bible and history Moses Matthew 4 Septuagint Salvation Barnabas Apostolic Fathers John the Baptist Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Saint Jude Soul Authorship of the Pauline epistles David Didache Lord's Prayer Ebionites Aramaic primacy Tribulation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible Bible and reincarnation Angel
