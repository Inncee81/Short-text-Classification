what are the steps involved and what people will be there editors correcting my writing or just one person will read it and give it to the publisher has anyone who has written a book can please tell me what is process from rough draft to finish product how many people do you have to talk to my art is very beautiful i got quote from publisher but is there anything else that i have to pay can you get a loan from bank to pay for the printing of the book i am a freelance writer and editor who has helped many clients get published both mainstream and self publishing the following is a basic timeline for the process from beginning to end write the book edit the book i would always suggest self editing first then i would consider giving it to two or three acquantances do not give it to anyone who might try to spare your feelings seek out people whose opinions you respect who you can trust will give it an honest appraisal some people hire a professional editor as well if you have the funding an editor can create a more polished look for your manuscript and is well worth the cost agents if you are trying to publish your book in the mainstream market i e the big publishers like random house you will need to have an agent most major publishers will not read your manuscript without one a good tool to use is the writer's market which you can find in most libraries and bookstores it is indespensible you can search for both agents and smaller publishers who might read your manuscript without an agent it will also help you learn how to write a query letter an essential tool in the publishing world when searching for an agent make certain you find one in your niche market i e children's fiction non fiction biographies etc a good agent will review your manuscript suggest changes and market your book to publishers they will have inside contacts that will give your book a much better chance to get published publishers agented or not when a manuscript reaches a publisher it usually goes to an assistant who reads skims it if they like it they move it from a big pile to a smaller pile that the acquisitions editor goes through if the acquisitions editor likes it they will contact you and will offer to purchase the rights to the book an agent is useful in negotiations if unagented look at writersdigest com and writer's market to know your rights and negotiating power your publisher will handle page layout and printing including costs in general you should not have to pay anything if you have a publisher they get their money by selling your book self publishing it sounds as though you may be self publishing if that is the case you should do the following get a copyright for your book through the u s copyright office it is cheap and essential do not believe people who tell you it is not necessary while it is true that you already have a copyright in your work as soon as you wrote it it is also true that if someone steals it you cannot sue them for damages get quotes from multiple printers i have used whitehall printing with some success and have heard good things about the more expensive www lulu com my current client ordered books and payed approximately per page book through whitehall if you only plan on making a few books under consider a reputable printer like lulu com get someone to do page layout for you art work additions can be complex so you will need to make certain you give the printer the best possible image to work from you will need to get a library of congress number and bar code if you are planning on selling the book since you would not be working with an agent or publisher you should consider hiring an editor to check for mistakes and make suggestions a good editor makes a tremendous amount of difference and is well worth the investment if you are planning on selling the book you should consider an inexpensive website with shopping cart ability a free my space page and a distribution agreement with a company that can get your book in stores distribution companies are crucial for books heading to the mass market if you only want to sell it yourself i would still recommend putting it on amazon which includes barnes and noble com it is free and can direct people who don't want to buy right away also if you are planning on selling your book i would try to complete an overall marketing plan will you do book signings and interviews if so you may want to hire a marketing company or at least an assistant to help you stay organized and effective funding it is unlikely you will be able to obtain a bank loan for book expenses but you can try you will need to approach it like a business and create a solid business plan this would include business summary projected expenses how much you are putting in how you expect to make money target audience for product etc you may be able to get a private or signature loan with a bit higher interest rate without going the business loan route you can also look for investors if you are going the self publishing route mainstream publishing is so difficult you would be unlikely to find anyone to invest you should also look at grants fellowships and contests that might help writer's market has some of these but your local library should have books on local and state funding if you need any additional assistance
