help plot help i need help with plot idea's know all about characters i know that authors are supposed to write about what they know but to be honest i have tried to write about a character similar to my life and i get about six pages and i am finished i just need something to escape to when i have had a bad day sorry i'm rambling but please help so ramble away sit down with a pen pencil paper laptop computer whatever you feel comfortable with and simply write i'm working on my th book and four of them are epics but i started by needing something to relax and picked up a yellow legal tablet with a pack of bic pens bought for my daughter to use at school looking back on my first ramblings i'm rather appalled at how funny i think them now but at the time i wrote of what a country and western song made me feel while driving home after a pittsy eight hours of at work one evening the sun glaring off the windscreen as it lowered and made safe navigation an impossibility what season was it what was the problem at work tell your reader no tell yourself and take your reader with you i read something that emile loring wrote many years ago about plots and for some reason it has always stuck in my mind if you picture your plot as a stairwell that you're running up and you find yourself stuck turn around and go back down a few steps or words to that effect since i'm not quoting her exactly i'm sorry to say that i only remember the character in the story she was speaking of was a budding author i was great at character development so good that i completely forgot to let the reader know where the characters were i managed to work in a few things like the grit of sand and the smell of the ocean a night bird crying and the surf rolling in as the character went for a midnight run on the damp firmly packed sand her long honey blonde braid bouncing from hip to hip but i wrote a murder mystery trying to be a romantic fiction with a great deal of science fiction tossed in killed off several characters modeled after irritants in my real life though that was some fun getting away with what i could and would never do in reality ah stress relief almost as good as going for a swim see rambling now forget all of what you know that you should write toss out all the perfect punctuation spelling and grammar and write who said that you had to write what you know if you want the story to read as if you know what you're talking about go back later and put in the real details that's what reference sources are for my dear oh and use spell check check for punctuation and grammar before trying to submit anything or it hits the bottomless bounce file for some reason i've yet to understand those people are sticklers about disliking passive voices but those are action verbs and why can't you remember any more than six pages i was born breach in a boat coming too slow to shore with a fishing crazy pops at the tiller or i was early and the closest doctor was a vet so guess what or my mom had me with no problems took me home and took wonderful care of me spoiling me rotten i broke my leg at two i was still in diapers and remember my cousin blowing out her birthday candles as that diaper was getting changed and i was crying from the pain of having a big mother's hand gripping that leg right where it was broken but none of the parents saw her push me over after i stepped in a hole from a broken board on the porch and when i kept crying i was spanked or i tripped over those klutzy shoes the parents put on me and wore plaster during the summer while they bronzed the guilty shoes i liked the sandbox at kindergarten now you know how the feel and sound of gritting sand can stay with a kid for fifty years i knew better than to do things my mother and father said not to or i'd be punished but had too much fun forgetting that and did things anyway but what did i do i went to high school and straight to the university or attended the ninth and tenth grade in five different states and eight schools but took my ged without study when i was through goofing off as a young adult and then went to college working my way through since i'd tossed away all the scholarships i married young twice was never married and live in a large house with a number of pets and my significant spouse who warned me that i had to mention that or else i took a job to pay the insurance premiums for my kid's braces she inherited my perfectly straight teeth i retired after raising her my niece and nephew and now i live alone and speak to them on the phone sometimes my significant other doesn t like that reference there is a life was it yours mine or the character that needs developed rambling as long as the significant other doesn t mind that is is there a significant other in my life how did they get there or why didn t they get there six pages is not a life start with being your first hero or heroine and you're writing or that boy girl that you didn't let know you had a crush on s he in high school this time your pen lets you have them instead of telling a reader how it feels to ski down a crisp mountain trail put a serial killer around the bend and tell how s he feels waiting for that cross country skier how will you stop the unwary or the wary i need help a wire across the trail shoot them trip them by sticking out your ski pole no it's you that are the serial killer only you're covered in fur with sharp claws ramble ramble ouch or the victim of a mega bucks lottery win how do they feel after the new wears off new is exciting familiar is comfortable your life is full of imaginary things to write about how did i know how it felt to have a braid a long golden blonde braid bouncing from hip to hip as i ran on a beach put a long wet towel on your head twist it tie it and go for a run i always thought i'd like to be a leopard frog out in the pond until i saw one being eaten by a snake one day kicking and struggling to get free then i wanted to be a leopard frog with the power to stay on the lily pads andre norton shaped my reading habits so anything was possible and i became the characters she so realistically painted with so few words but i'm still trying to master the western epic and failed to live up to my ideal as a science fiction fantasy writer now edgar rice burrows and tarzan i'd like to write as either of those two very talented people were able to i'm rambling and i'm just brainstorming try that what else have you to lose it s a great stress reliever and practice doesn t mean that you have to publish just enjoy hey try a country and western song on the radio and picture what the artist is singing about worked for me just remember to leave a few years in between readings so you can laugh like i did at how much you've improved Jon Secada The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Drawn Together Futurama (TV series - season 2) Professional wrestling throws Jackass: The Movie Professional wrestling holds The
