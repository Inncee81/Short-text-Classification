how did dumbledore get the wand of death describe in detail around thousand words you want thousand words i'll give you more the deathly hallows are three fictional magical objects that appear in the book harry potter and the deathly hallows by j k rowling and which are referred to by the title the three objects are the elder wand the resurrection stone and the cloak of invisibility according to j k rowling the legend presented surrounding these objects is perhaps based upon chaucer's the pardoner's tale the symbol for these items appears as an equilateral triangle with an inscribed circle inside it and a vertical line inside the triangle going from the upper angle down through the circle the triangle represents the cloak of invisibility the circle represents the stone of resurrection and the line represents the elder wand the symbol is worn by wizards as so to reveal themselves to other believers of the legend of the deathly hallows because it was a symbol often used by grindelwald many believe it to be a symbol of dark magic this says xenophilius lovegood father of luna lovegood and editor of the the quibbler is arrogance it is also said that every letter in voldemort's name fits into the symbol for the deathly hallows noted wizards to have worn the symbol the dark wizard gellert grindelwald displayed the symbol during his reign of power albus dumbledore used the symbol in his signatures the symbol replaced the a in albus he refused to use this after he decided he was not meant to seek the hallows xenophilius lovegood wore the symbol as a means to declare himself a believer noted locations and items to display the symbol the tales of beedle the bard contains the symbol inscribed by albus dumbledore on the top page of the tale of the three brothers which is the tale of how the hallows came to be a wall in durmstrang institute another wizarding school was carved the symbol by gellert grindelwald the grave of ignotus peverell in godric's hollow bears the symbol in his will albus dumbledore left hermione granger an ancient book entitled the tales of beedle the bard the trio first encounters the symbol at the wedding of bill weasley and fleur delacour viktor krum tells harry that it is the sign of grindelwald when he sees xenophilius lovegood wearing it around his neck a misunderstanding based on the fact that grindelwald like lovegood was a seeker of the hallows when hermione looks into the book she finds an odd symbol inscribed on a certain page wanting to discover its meaning harry potter ron weasly and hermione granger visit xenophilius lovegood he tells them that it is the symbol of the deathly hallows he asks them if they are familiar with the tale of the three brothers hermione responds that the tale is in the tales of beedle the bard and turns to the page that has the inscribed symbol the elder wand known throughout history as the deathstick and the wand of destiny is an extremely powerful magic wand made of elder wood supposedly it is the most powerful wand in existence and when used by its true master he or she cannot be defeated in a duel it also appears as the wand is somewhat sentient as are all wands that it will not allow itself to cause real harm to its true master the wand's ownership however is a tricky matter as stated by master wandmaker mr ollivander ownership can only be transferred properly that is the wand will only fully work for the new user if they disarm the previous user this can occur during a duel although because the wand is very powerful this scenario would be rare or in non magical ways killing in muggle fashion etc thus did antioch peverell meet his end murdered in his sleep by a rival wanting to claim the wand ever since the wand has been sought by power hungry wizards until it subsequently fell to dark wizard gellert grindelwald who stole it from famed wandmaker gregorovitch gregorovitch boasted about how he possessed the elder wand as it would boost his popularity as he tried to reverse engineer its secrets as he faced competition from ollivander albus dumbledore later defeated grindelwald and became the wand's master with dumbledore's agreement with snape for his death as revealed in the king's cross chapter of deathly hallows he meant severus to end up with the elder wand as rowling wrote it is not known the real intention of dumbledore however as harry tells voldemort afterwards that dumbledore's plans with snape were supposed to bury the wand's power with dumbledore's death however as draco malfoy disarmed him the plan failed and draco became the wand's new master after dumbledore's death the wand was placed inside his white tomb voldemort opened it and claimed the wand as his own only later did he learn that he never mastered the wand because he did not gain ownership from its previous owner whom he mistakenly believed was snape since he had been the one to kill dumbledore when in fact draco malfoy became the wand's master after he disarmed dumbledore by then the wand's allegiance had been won by harry when he disarmed draco even though draco never had the elder wand itself in his possession voldemort casts three curses on harry two were the killing curse but each lacked the desired effect the first killing curse's failure according to dumbledore is due to lily potter's self sacrifice to protect harry at which point harry became the unintentional horcrux the elder wand did destroy voldemort's soul fragment inside harry with the second killing curse voldemort could not kill harry but he could certainly destroy that part of himself the killing curse knocked harry into a death like state for a few moments in which in his mind he was given a choice to move on to the afterlife or return to the living world and he chose the latter voldemort's cruciatus curse used on harry when voldemort thought he was dead caused no pain to harry in the final battle the elder wand recognizes its true master and when confronted with harry's expelliarmus charm the wand causes voldemort's avada kedavra curse to rebound and kill him harry uses the elder wand to repair his damaged holly and phoenix feather wand an act that the great wandmaker mr ollivander believed improbable according to what he knew he mentions that wandlore is very ancient and complicated and then intended to secretly return it to dumbledore's tomb keeping it hidden from power seeking enemies harry hopes he will die of natural causes without being defeated so the wand's power will die with him j k rowling revealed in an interview that one
