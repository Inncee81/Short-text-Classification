i have what i think is a great story line for a novel but i really don't want to write the novel now but i can't just leave it because i think that would be a waste and it would kill me because all my life i would be thinking what if what if help this is going to sound really strange but i want to write the novel because i feel i've got the story in me but i don't want to write it because i feel i can't get to it inside me if you get what i mean first of all you have to believe to yourself writing a story is a very difficult task not only in writing it but after you have finished it get it published you have to show the synopsis of the story to some people and ask them for advices and opinions when you have started writing it you should be ready for many hours of writing and erasing and then rewriting i don't want to scare you you also have to know that some days you wont have even a drop of inspiration and other days you would write ten pages one last thing it may be hard to write and publish a book but the reward will be a hundred times bigger good luck and good writing i would be very happy to hear a synopsis of your novel and help you whenever you have a problem Social rule Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infidels Extreme Programming Wonderland (McFly album) Pitaten Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Ashlee Simpson Show The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Blonde on Blonde 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pet Sounds Arianne Waylon Jennings The Time Machine Screenwriting The Catcher in the Rye Care Bears The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe RuneScape quests Laura Schlessinger Scooby-Doo Year of the Spider Theory of conduct Jon Secada Scrooge McDuck The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Scenes from a Memory The Dalek Invasion of Earth Goodness and value theory Groo the Wanderer Minor characters in Morrowind The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Avenue Q Operation Market Garden Procrastination Bernard Williams The Amber Spyglass Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Love and Theft Shit The Parting of the Ways Kodocha Oh My Goddess!
