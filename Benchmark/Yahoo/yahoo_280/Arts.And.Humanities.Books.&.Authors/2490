does this sound good here is the rest of my book so far idk if i like it so tell me what you think mom i don t want to move cried amber i m sorry honey but you ll have to talk to your dad about that said her mom i just can t believe that were actually moving and its all because of a stupid job said amber well your lucky that i m coming too you know if it was just you guys and your dad well you would almost never see me said ambers mom amber replied yeah yeah i m gonna go upstairs and finish packing up my stuff amber was a year old girl with light brown hair and big brown eyes she wore glasses and is about average height for her age amber climbed the steep stairs and was thinking to herself i hope that they like me at my new school i wonder what the kids are like what s it going to be like with boys in my classes so many thought filled her brain and when she got to her room she was getting really anxious to move is it good so far yup but i think you may want to set it up a little differently look at the dialogue when people are talking to each other in one of your favorite books see the difference the dialogue isn't all jammed up in one paragraph you don't have to say she said all the time either it's hard to figure out how to do it so it's easy to read but if you study that good book of yours you may get it you seem like you're off to a good start you'll also have to figure out what tense you want to write in and keep it in that one present tense she is they are past tense she was they were are you writing on a computer does it have the wavy green lines for grammar and the red ones for spelling pay attention to them they help us all otherwise i think you are just bursting to tell a good story have fun ps did you know there's a pretty well known historical romance called forever amber can't remember who wrote it i don't even read romances but somehow i read that one amber is a popular name Kodocha The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Shaggy dog story Timmy Turner Mnemonic The Amber Spyglass Can't Hardly Wait Little Britain The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Shining (film) Eric Cartman Joke The Adventures of Pete & Pete RuneScape quests Paul Is Dead Invader Zim Treehouse of Horror V The Catcher in the Rye She Loves You Great Teacher Onizuka Time Out of Mind KaBlam!
