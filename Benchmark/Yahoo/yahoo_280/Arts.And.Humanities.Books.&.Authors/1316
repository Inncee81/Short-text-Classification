jk rowling messed up in book she said rupert instead of ron dunno the page but i'm sure i read it gosh it bothers me a lot i don't think that was a mistake i have heard this before it refers to prof slughorn and is showing evidence to his lack of interest in the less famous students of hogwarts so by him not remembering ron's name it furthers the character development of slughorn and his seemingly biased system of classification of his students i think this is more of a coincidence rather than a mistake i am sure that rowling was not thinking of rupert grint while writing that passage she as said herself that she doesn't picture daniel emma or rupert while writing but rather her own images of the trio Ron Weasley Hermione Granger Severus Snape Horace Slughorn Minor Slytherins Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Ginny Weasley Hogwarts subjects Luna Lovegood Hogwarts Houses Minor Harry Potter Beasts Sybill Trelawney Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Neville Longbottom Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Minor Ravenclaws Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter Rupert Grint Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Minor characters associated with Quidditch Half-Blood Prince (character) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Minerva McGonagall Lord Voldemort J.
