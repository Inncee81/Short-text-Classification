in the story house of the scorpion how does matts character change throughout the book yes i read it it i read it and i cant figure this out i need it for a school assignment please help me the house of the scorpion is a sci fi coming of age tale an underlying plot in this novel is matt's growing from a boy to a man towards the beginning of the story when matt is young and living with celia he is very curious outspoken but lonely later he goes to live in the big house but is oppressed by rosa and the doctor during this time his creativity and ingenuity are displayed when he observes bugs and stores miscellaneous objects such as feathers and rotten fruit for further examination to keep as his treasures he befriends maria and although his people skills could use some developing he shows strong leadership potential and a thirst for revenge when tom repeatedly harasses him celia and maria eventually rescue him and when el patron takes him under his wing matt is educated takes music lessons and becomes bit arrogant despite being looked down upon as an animal by other members of the family he grows to love maria but when younger and less mature he doesn't always respect her or her property an example of this would be when matt demands a kiss at el patron's birthday party or when he kidnaps her dog he has an ongoing rivalry with tom which amuses el patron but infuriates matt as he is desperate to prove especially to maria what a terrible person tom is matt is also very perhaps too trusting in that he automatically trusts el patron because they share the same dna which is not the wisest choice he trusts celia and maria and tam lin when matt's life is in danger and he must flee matt learns that sometimes he has to be self sufficient and not depend on others to always help him out once he joins the lost boys he becomes a bit more humbled and sees how little they have as compared to el patron's vast wealth and growing up in the big house he becomes even more of a leader and even inspires chacho and fidelito by the time he escapes and makes his way to the convent and later to el patron's dragon horde at the end of the story matt has matured and changed but yet the character is easily identifiable as the same character he is still goal oriented persistent intelligent a people person and the hero of the story side note this has always been one of my favorite stories so i hope this little summary has been helpful hopefully i didn't go overboard but i think you get the gist of it Daredevil W.I.T.C.H.
