i have a question th book spoilers warning i just finished and i really am confused about the whole hallows thing and how harry died but came back i just dont understand because i thought harry had to die all the way to kill voldemort since he was a horcrux can someone kind of go over these confusing parts harry didn't die and come back the portion of voldemort's soul within him died most likely the curse hit him directly on the scar which is the source of his and voldemort's connection the horcrux harry couldn't die while voldemort still lived bcause voldemort recreated himself using harry's blood when harry was cursed he and the portion of voldemort's soul then went to a place within him when he was struck where he was able to clarify things for himself which included talking to dumbledore the hallows were objects created by the peverell brothers if you take dumbledores's theory which were perceived to make the holder of the items the master of death the invisibility cloak the resurrection stone and the elder wand Harry Potter (character) Lord Voldemort Albus Dumbledore Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Death Eater Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Magic (Harry Potter) Battle of Hogwarts Dark Art Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone R.A.B.
