which trilogy should i start first the dark elf trilogy by r a salvatore or the icewind dale trilogy well it really depends on what you're interested in if you are interested in learning about drizzt's background and about dark elf society read the the dark elf trilogy first however if you want to go straight to the action start with the icewind dale trilogy personally i read the crystal shard first book in idt first and didn't read the det until after the legacy of the drow det answered a lot of my questions about drizzt it really doesn't matter which book you start out with because salvatore introduces you to the characters in each story anyway enjoy reading Drizzt Do'Urden R.
