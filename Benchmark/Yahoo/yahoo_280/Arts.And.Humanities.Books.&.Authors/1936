the book what scene do you feel most compelled to in this book it has been a while since i read it but a scene that still sticks with me is the one where winston smith and his girlfriend are in their secret hideaway and the thought police discover them and break in breaking up the furniture and so forth as he lies on the floor in cuffs or tied up or whatever winston sees smashed on the floor in front of him the paperweight with the pink coral inside call me overly analytical but i think the paperweight and the pink coral represent his insulation from the thought police the paperweight represents freedom to him but it's illusory it's easily smashed and broken and when the bubble is gone all that's left is that pink and fragile coral call me crazy but this scene has affected me so much that i actually searched and searched until i found a glass paperweight that looks more or less like the one described in the book mine is a little more orange than pink but still i like to look at it Lord of the Flies Reservoir Dogs EastEnders Plastic Naval mine The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Goldstein's book Knots Landing Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha The Shining (film) TARDIS Max Payne About a Boy Kill Bill Happy Tree Friends Escape from New York Paul Is Dead The Catcher in the Rye Scenes from a Memory Super Mario 64 Shodo Squidward Tentacles Nineteen Eighty-Four RuneScape quests Palace of Westminster Quantum chromodynamics Turquoise Super Smash Bros.
