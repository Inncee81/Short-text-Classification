why would anyone in his or her right mind post a question asking anything remotely involving publishing common sense at least for the semi intelligent would dictate that you at least have a readable finished manuscript after that it's all about the obn old boy network who do you know vs how good are you i have read many books that make me sure that on talent alone i should be able to release my fantasy trilogy and never work a again pardon my ego but as an artist if you don't have some kind of ego you're dead already but i don't know anybody in the what have you done for me lately world of modern publishing so then we get on this brilliant forum where all unpublished authors are basically told what to do and how to do it but nobody can give us an in do you know anybody yeah this one lady on yahoo said blah blah blah not gonna work ladies and gents get out of yahoo and get out of it now everyone here is going to make it sound so difficult and heartbreaking that you will want to quit writing it's called protecting your territory people do not read half as much as they should be and the numbers drop daily with fewer people reading fewer books are being sold why in the world would an established author do anything to help a person get in if that person could potentially be the one to squeeze them out the door do you really think these people are here to help you they would be e mailing you what do you write oh i know an agent who handles that type of writing let me give him or her a call and see if they want to read a sample but no you get rejection stories which are most likely true by the way and told that it more than likely won't happen so finally stop asking these in yahoo answers nobody will tell you what you want to hear there's a difference between rudeness and frustration and it's hard to find that line at a m my apologies it hurts to know that the one thing i love to do more than any other is probably a waste of time ph i've been to b n and whenever i see what's being published in my particular field s it makes me ill i understand your frustration it's not easy to be a writer and it's difficult to hear writers say that they got published because their neighbor happened to have a best friend who was an editor my neighbor's a retired construction worker and i doubt he has those kinds of connections it's also frustrating to look through writer's market and see all these agents who take on new clients exclusively through recommendations from others and it's even more frustrating when you can't even get your family to read your manuscript and i think that the publishing questions posted in here are best answered with a simple list of books to read people should go to the library for that kind of help but i also think there is hope for people without connections or i want to think that i have an agent who requested my full manuscript right now i've never met her and wasn't referred to her so i have to think that have a good night A Course In Miracles CPU cache Plame affair Time Out of Mind Publishing Jon Secada Social rule Religious Society of Friends Ludwig Wittgenstein Transactional analysis Theory of conduct E-mail spam The Lovely Bones Unemployment Pitaten XML J.
