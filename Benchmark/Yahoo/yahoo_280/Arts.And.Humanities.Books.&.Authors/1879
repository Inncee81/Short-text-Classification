motivation when i sit at work i come up with these really good ideas for stories but i can never seem to be able to sit down and write them i've written some things down in a notebook but its mostly just notes about what i was thinking about any suggestions on how i can get myself motivated into actually putting together a story keep writing out your ideas you are already keeping a notebook and this is an essential tool for writers every time you get an idea write it down whether the idea is for a conflict or plot or for a character write it down next get in the habit of writing read the artist's way and or writing down the bones both of these books can easily be found in your local library and bookstore every writer i know not only has read these books but owns them they will teach you how to get into the habit of writing of breaking past your censor and really enjoying the process of writing it is very easy for writers to get into the habit of reading books about writing but you don't want to spend more time reading about how to write then you do actually writing i listen to a lot of people who ask about how to get published find an agent etc and when i ask them how far they are in their manuscript they tell me they haven't actually written anything yet but they have this great idea a great idea is nothing more than a great idea until it is written and let me tell you a secret only you can write your great idea so write i would encourage you to check out nanowrimo in november a lot of people take up the challenge to write a certain number of words in thirty days the month of november everyone knows that what they will write is probably going to be pretty bad but rough drafts are usually pretty dreadful so don't expect to write a finished and polished manuscript of your story but know that if you give this challenge a try if you sit down every day and write you will not only discover how you block yourself but you will also see how many excuses you have for not writing that really are only excuses in the meantime keep jotting notes in your notebook read writing down the bones and have fun Social rule Milton H.
