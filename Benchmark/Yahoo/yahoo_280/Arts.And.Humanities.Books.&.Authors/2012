what do you think j k rowling will do next and could it be as good as harry potter i really don t know she mentioned a few months ago that she was working on some book aimed at children younger then the harry potter age bracket the fact is i think harry potter will always be what she is known for no matter how many books she writes also jo is not writing the encyclopedia to explain book she has said for some years that she might do an encyclopedia book this is designed for avid fans who want to know nearly anything she will share about the hp world and its characters from all the various notes she has this encyclopedia will have more information about characters whom jo had a back story for but did not make it into the book like dean thomas jo has often said he had a very rich back story but most of it did not make into the series perhaps scenes that did not make it into the books etc information on harry s grandparents some about hermione parents as we learn very little about them other then they are dentists and thus likely muggle rich this book is going to be designed for hardcore fans not your average book reader who just reads and that s it and could care less if they know the names of mr and mrs evans lily and petunia s parents the year they died know what james and lily did for a job after school even sirius remus and peter etc Harry Potter (character) Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Dates in Harry Potter Severus Snape Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter Sirius Black Relatives of Harry Potter James and Lily Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Ginny Weasley Hogwarts subjects Magical objects in Harry Potter Dursley family Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) R.A.B.
