sometimes when i buy second hand books online i receive a book that belonged to a library is this normal i'm just wondering if somebody sends me a book that belonged to a library before does it mean that libraries sometimes sell or give their books away or does it mean that somebody stole the book because i've never heard of any library that sell their books thank you in advance yes libraries do sometimes sell books often you'll find a library book that has discarded stamped in it many libraries do this so people won't think it's still a circulating book books can be discarded for a number of reasons worn old lack of circulation or sometimes just to make room on the shelves for more new books when a popular author comes out with a new book often a library will buy multiple copies of that title so more people will have a chance to read it then some of the extra copies will be discarded that said a lot of stuff is also stolen from libraries i've seen dvds and cds as well as books for sale at yard sales flea markets and other shops where they have been left by thieves a man was arrested not long ago for sellin stolen library materials on ebay if you're worried about a book you've gotten by all means contact the library and ask if the book is stolen or discarded most libraries have websites where you can contact the librarian this will either put your mind at rest or give you the chance to do a very good deed and return a book Book Library Internet fraud Poker jargon Publishing Gramophone record Legal research Amazon.com Ocean's Twelve Library of Congress Social rule Compact disc Book collecting Spice Girls Warez Comic book collecting Laserdisc British Library Digital rights management Surveillance Neopets Philatelic investment UK Singles Chart Time Out of Mind Library reference desk Monopoly (game) Draw poker Vanity press We Belong Together Betting (poker) MapleStory Library catalog National Library for the Blind Dennis Rader Auction Doctor Who missing episodes Xbox The Emancipation of Mimi Copy protection Fence (criminal) Jonathan Wild Textbook Electronic commerce Roxette Public library Censorship in Australia Magic: The Gathering TurboGrafx 16 The Apprentice 2 Nintendo GameCube Open access Captain Thunderbolt Gospel of Thomas The Smashing Pumpkins Condom First-sale doctrine The Star Wars Holiday Special Slide rule Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Doomtown Whitney Houston Public domain Fawcett Publications Ra (board game) Money Crime fiction National Library of Australia Weezer Flea market 1957 World Series Copyright RKO Pictures Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Book of Mormon John Frusciante Wheel of Fortune Three Investigators Backstreet Boys PlayStation 2 MAME Snooker Hard disk Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Quarashi Green Day Johnny 5 Monetary policy Enigma machine Retailer Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Jon Secada Copyleft Pawnbroker C.G.
