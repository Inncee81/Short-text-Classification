harry potter and parsel tongue from the seventh book we know that harry is also an heir of slytherin so how can we be sure that harry's parsel tongue is a result of voldemort's curse rebounding or his birth right of course he's an heir of slytherin harry is desended from ignotus peverell the gaunts were related to one of the other peverell brothers and from the th book we all know they and eventually voldemort was heirs of slytherin since harry's great great great grandpa was a peverell it's only logical to come to the conclusion that he to is an heir of slytherin actually he is not the heir of slytherin even if harry and voldemort were both perhaps related to the peverell family being in the family is not enough to make one the heir also salazar slytherin lived probably after the time that the peverell brothers lived given that the brothers are a part of ancient legend slytherin probably inherited the gift of parseltongue from another wizard who wasn't part of the peverell family so harry doesn't have to be a parseltongue also if harry were to inherit parseltongue from the peverell family you would wonder why either james or lily wasn't a parseltongue to illustrate my analogy about heirs look at the british royal family only one person is set to become the next king charles assuming nothing happens to him or that queen elizabeth cannot train william before she dies he is the only heir to the throne the rest of the people in the royal family are not heirs to the throne they are merely part of the royal family because they are not set to become king queen next so harry can be related to voldemort without being the heir of slytherin we also know from the th book that harry was a horcrux containing part of voldemort's soul and that's how he got the ability to speak parseltongue he loses this ability once the bit of soul is blasted out of him by voldemort when voldemort attempts to kill him this is confirmed by rowling in an interview or maybe it was a web chat after the book was released Magic (Harry Potter) Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter (character) Severus Snape Horcrux R.A.B.
