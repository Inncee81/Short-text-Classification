in the book harry potter and the philosopher's stone published in and he continued to appear in all the books of the series as well as all currently released film adaptations over the course of the series snape has evolved from a snide and unfair teacher who issues detentions or insults to pupils he least likes into a pivotal character of considerable moral ambiguity rowling in an interview described him as a gift of a character rowling stated in an interview that she drew inspiration for snape's character from a disliked teacher in her own childhood as with many of the characters and terms in harry potter snape's first name is derived from latin his name severus is the latin term for strict or severe rowling has also implied that snape's first name was derived from emperor lucius septimus severus an emperor of the imperial roman empire for snape's surname rowling has stated that she borrowed the name from the village of snape in the english county of suffolk in the real world the surname is drawn from the suffolk village from another place named snape in north yorkshire or from the old english word sn pp meaning pasture early life snape was born on january to tobias snape a muggle and eileen prince a witch making him a half blood wizard snape was neglected during his childhood by his parents who fought constantly and did not have a loving relationship with his father being a half blood wizard snape lived in spinner's end with his parents in harry potter and the deathly hallows it is also implied that spinner's end was close to a muggle family the evans' snape befriended petunia and lily evans later known as lily potter in childhood after informing lily that she was a witch snape and lily attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry from to it was on the train to hogwarts that snape met his rivals james potter and sirius black upon arriving at hogwarts snape was sorted into slytherin and lily was sorted into gryffindor he remained a close friend of lily's for the next few years until his remarks about muggle borns drove them apart snape experienced bullying by james potter and sirius black at hogwarts one night sirius black tricked snape into going to the shrieking shack where lupin was confined during his transformations into a werewolf snape could have been killed had james not intervened although snape believed that james only warned him to avoid expulsion from hogwarts nevertheless albus dumbledore suggests that snape is still influenced by this debt to james sirius tries to explain james's behaviour by claiming that snape's interest in the dark arts naturally offended james and although james acted cruelly at age he grew out of his bullying ways remus concedes that although james may have stopped bullying others he continued to fight with snape during his final year at hogwarts while dating lily even though she disapproved however he does justify this by saying that snape would antagonise james as well he never lost an opportunity to curse james so you couldn't expect james to take that lying down could you op ch severus snape in harry potter and the prisoner of azkabansnape invented a number of spells one or more of which james learns and uses against him in public during their fifth year on one occasion snape was hung upside down in mid air from a levicorpus spell and humiliated while students watched lily defended snape from james' torment professing her distaste of james whom she would later marry despite lily's help an angry and humiliated snape insulted her calling her a filthy little mudblood lily flatly refused to forgive snape for this despite his subsequent apologies rowling revealed in an interview that lily might have grown to love severus romantically had he not been affiliated with death eaters and been drawn to the dark arts given his time over again he would not have become a death eater but like many insecure vulnerable people like wormtail he craved membership of something big and powerful something impressive he wanted lily and he wanted mulciber too he never really understood lily s aversion he was so blinded by his attraction to the dark side he thought she would find him impressive if he became a real death eater sirius tells harry that during his hogwarts years snape belonged to a gang of slytherins including bellatrix lestrange rodolphus lestrange avery wilkes and evan rosier who involved themselves in the dark arts and later became death eaters including snape himself gf ch near the end of voldemort's first reign of terror snape overheard part of professor trelawney's recitation of the prophecy concerning harry potter's role in his master's downfall he later informed voldemort of what he had heard however he was shocked to discover that his revelation had led voldemort to believe the prophecy pointed to the potters he pleaded with dumbledore to protect lily offering anything asked of him in return upon the potters' deaths dumbledore convinced snape to protect harry out of his love for lily and even though he hated harry for what bits of james he saw in the child snape stayed true to his promise becoming a member of the order of the phoenix barty crouch sr wanted to imprison snape in azkaban for being a death eater but dumbledore's testimony on snape switching sides protected snape from the authorities snape took a position as an instructor at hogwarts having applied for the position of defence against the dark arts teacher in but was appointed potions master instead becoming head of slytherin house sometime before the events of the first novel in the series set in there is mutual enmity between snape and harry almost from their first meeting in the first novel harry potter and the philosopher's stone however despite this and unbeknownst to harry snape has diligently kept his promise to dumbledore to protect harry due to his love for lily potter and his remorse for his part in her death in one instance during a quidditch game snape appears to be muttering a jinx which makes harry's broom shake wildly when in actuality professor quirrell in league with voldemort is the one working the curse on harry while snape is muttering a counter jinx although harry mistakenly suspected that snape was trying to steal the philosopher's stone he retains lingering feelings of suspicion even after quirrell is revealed as the real culprit and their relationship remains tense snape relentlessly antagonises harry at one point calling him a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him hp he taunts harry during lessons ridiculing his work and giving him frequent and from harry's perspective often unjustified detentions and other penalties snape's harsh treatment is often extended to harry's friends while slytherin students are treated more favourably even though snape has repeatedly tried to have harry expelled he has also saved harry's life on several occasions snape's expert skills are used in the third novel harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban to brew wolfsbane potion for remus lupin snape attempts to apprehend sirius black whom he believed responsible for betraying james and lily's hiding place to voldemort and acts to defend harry from the dangerous fugitive when black escapes snape rightly accuses harry of aiding him still believing that black is a mass murderer at the end of the fourth novel harry potter and the goblet of fire dumbledore attempts to convince a disbelieving minister of magic cornelius fudge that voldemort has returned as proof snape willingly shows fudge the renewed dark mark on his arm dumbledore subsequently sends snape on a secret mission this mission as implied in harry potter and the order of the phoenix and revealed in harry potter and the half blood prince was to rejoin the death eaters and spy on voldemort as a triple agent severus snape giving occlumency lessons to harry in harry potter and the order of the phoenixin the fifth novel harry potter and the order of the phoenix with voldemort having returned to a fully corporeal body snape continues working as a triple agent for dumbledore hbp ch dumbledore has snape teach harry occlumency the protection of one's mind from outside intrusion or influence snape is extremely skilled in both occlumency and its companion art of legilimency the discerning of thoughts and feelings from another's mind both proficiencies undoubtedly useful in his work as a spy the sessions are made difficult by their mutual hostility and end permanently when an outraged snape discovers harry watching snape's memories in the pensieve the half blood prince in the sixth novel harry potter and the half blood prince bellatrix lestrange and narcissa malfoy visit snape at his terraced house on spinner's end located near the ruins of a wool or cotton mill snape swears an unbreakable vow to narcissa that he will protect draco help him complete voldemort's task and finish the task himself if draco fails snape is also finally appointed professor of defence against the dark arts replacing snape as potions instructor is horace slughorn a retired hogwarts teacher who previously taught the subject slughorn lends harry an old potions textbook that is filled with the scribbled notes of a highly talented former student the notes include a variety of hexes and jinxes seemingly invented by the student as well as substantial improvements to the book's standard potion making instructions it is signed property of the half blood prince the notes greatly bolster harry's performance and impresses slughorn who declares he has inherited lily's outstanding potions ability whoever the prince might be harry believes he is a better teacher than either snape or slughorn outraged by harry's easy but fraudulent success in the subject hermione investigates the possible identity of the half blood prince and suspects it may be former hogwarts student eileen prince harry is ambivalent about the prince's identity although he is convinced that the student is male albeit whilst accepting that he or she has a somewhat dark sense of humour in a fight with draco malfoy he uses the prince's spell marked for enemies and is horrified that it causes vicious slashing wounds snape arrives and heals draco's wounds and then interrogates harry about the source of the sectumsempra spell from latin meaning literally always cut harry knows that at least two of the spells were used by snape and his father during their fifth year which is confirmed by remus lupin because the handwritten spells have numerous corrections harry is convinced the writer invented them dumbledore is inflicted with a curse after he puts on peverell ring although his hand is the only part of his body injured the curse will eventually spread and he will be dead within a year or less dumbledore decides that snape will kill dumbledore both an act of euthanasia also as a testament of his apparent loyalty to voldemort and as a way to fulfill the unbreakable vow although snape is reluctant this act will prevent a more unfortunate demise for the wizard at the hands of others and will save draco malfoy from tearing his own soul apart as voldemort wishes draco to kill the headmaster dumbledore points out to snape that the act will not harm snape's own soul because it will not be murder at all since he will just be helping an old man die snape objects to the fact that according to dumbledore's plan harry as the last horcrux would have to die at voldemort's hands when asked by dumbledore if he cared for harry snape replied for him and conjured his patronus showing dumbledore that all his years of service had been for his undying love for lily potter his patronus having changed into the same form as lily's had been a doe returning to hogwarts after a search for one of voldemort's horcruxes harry and dumbledore see the dark mark in the sky over the astronomy tower dumbledore asks harry to fetch snape when draco malfoy suddenly arrives harry is already concealed under his invisibility cloak but dumbledore immediately acts to prevent him taking any action by paralysing him with a spell draco intends to carry out voldemort's orders to kill dumbledore but dumbledore manages to persuade him not to they are interrupted again by the arrival of some death eaters and snape when it is clear that malfoy will not kill dumbledore snape uses the avada kedavra curse killing dumbledore and causing his body to fall from the tower snape malfoy and the death eaters rush from the castle pursued by harry released from his magical paralysis after dumbledore's death harry's attempts to attack snape are ineffective snape easily blocks every spell and even taunts harry by pointing out the mistakes he makes when fighting with magic however he becomes enraged after harry calls him a coward and attacks with spells snape had created just as harry's father once did during this confrontation snape reveals to harry that he is the half blood prince snape is injured by buckbeak before disappearing into the forbidden forest with draco and the death eaters as hermione later surmises the nickname half blood prince was derived from snape's mother's maiden name of prince and from his father having been a muggle making snape a half blood some in the wizarding world especially those among voldemort's followers and in snape's own slytherin house consider this to be a defect or inferiority harry suggests snape chose this title to play up the pure blood side when questioned by harry remus lupin snape's classmate says he knows nothing about the name and it seems that it like tom riddle's diary was to voldemort was snape's own private joke immediately following dumbledore's death and before mad eye moody puts in place a series of jinxes on it snape returns to grimmauld place where he finds lily potter's old letter and photograph the final year just before what would have been harry's final year at hogwarts snape set off the events that led to a surprise death eater attack upon harry's final journey from the safe haven of his aunt and uncle's house to tonks's although harry makes it safety george weasley's ear is sliced off by a curse from snape it is later revealed that this is the result of a misfire that had been aimed at a death eater's wand hand after the ministry of magic falls to the death eaters just prior to the school year snape is appointed headmaster of hogwarts snape uses his position to protect the students within from death eaters amycus and alecto carrow who are assigned to patrol the school the leak of information to voldemort was directed by dumbledore from his headmaster's portrait dumbledore also ordered snape to ensure that harry would attain godric gryffindor's sword snape devised a plan to lead harry to the sword without revealing his own involvement a feat he managed by controlled use of his patronus charm towards the end of the school year snape flees the school when he is confronted by the teachers led by professor mcgonagall he is then summoned by voldemort believing that the powerful elder wand that he coveted from dumbledore had been won by snape and would only work well for one who won it similarly from an enemy voldemort kills snape by having his pet snake nagini attack the hogwarts headmaster after voldemort leaves the scene snape in his last moments causes his memories to exude from his mouth ears and eyes in the form of the silvery blue material used in pensieves and has harry collect them and experience them harry collects them in a flask and uses them to discover snape's true allegiance and the plan that he had been executing with dumbledore all along although not mentioned in the novel j k rowling mentioned in a web chat that because he abandoned his post before dying a portrait of his does not immediately appear in the headmaster's office following his death but that she imagines that harry made snape's true loyalty and heroism known in the wizarding world and that he lobbied to ensure that a portrait be installed in the office legacy years later after harry defeated voldemort harry's second born son receives the name albus severus potter nineteen years after the end of deathly hallows albus severus is about to enter his first year at hogwarts and is worried that he will be sorted into slytherin harry reassures him and tells him that he was named for two headmasters of hogwarts one of them was a slytherin and he was probably the bravest man i ever knew character description snape's physical appearance resembles that of the classic villain of western literature hook nosed pale skin and black eyes he is also known for his greasy shoulder length black hair snape is described as small and thin adorning black robes appearing like an overgrown bat hp in the chapter illustrations by mary grandpr in the american translation of harry potter and the order of the phoenix snape is also depicted as balding with a goatee but in the next novel half blood prince he is depicted as clean shaven with long black hair the youthful snape is described as having a stringy pallid look being round shouldered yet angular having a twitchy walk like a spider and long oily hair that jumped about his face snape is generally depicted as thoroughly cruel unpleasant sarcastic and bitter his temper is sometimes short but he is usually calm and collected snape displays a particularly strong dislike of harry potter and often taunts harry by insulting harry's father james potter it is suggested that his treatment of harry stems from snape's bitter rivalry with james when they were in school together powers and abilities snape is shown to be a very powerful wizard and to have been talented even while a student he specialises in potion making and has a talent and passion for the dark arts as head of slytherin house he is an icon for his own students most of the others however strongly dislike him skilful in the arts of occlumency and legilimency snape is able to both access the minds of others and protect his own thoughts indeed though he does not care for the term himself harry forms the uncomfortable impression quite early on in the series that snape is able to read minds he is also gifted in non verbal spell casting and spell invention in harry potter and the deathly hallows snape is shown to have the ability to fly without support snape's true loyalty was one of the most significant issues in the series up until the end of the final installment of the series harry potter and the deathly hallows because snape left harry his dying thoughts to be viewed on the pensieve snape ultimately revealed to harry that he was always loyal to albus dumbledore even though he had appeared to murder dumbledore in the sixth installment of the series this depiction is later confirmed by the dumbledore harry meets in a limbo like kings cross station after being nearly killed by voldemort it was also revealed that snape's loyalty to dumbledore stemmed from his fierce devotion to his childhood friend lily evans whom he had always secretly loved snape left voldemort when he realised that it was her that lord voldemort was going to kill after overhearing a prophecy that predicted voldemort's defeat as a result snape vowed to assist dumbledore in protecting lily's surviving son harry voldemort was informed of snape's true allegiance by harry potter but only after voldemort had had nagini kill snape
