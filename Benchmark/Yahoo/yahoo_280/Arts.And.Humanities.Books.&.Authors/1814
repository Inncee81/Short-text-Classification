slaughterhouse five by kurt vonnegut what is the main conflict in this book man vs what i've read it but i am doing an important project and i need to make sure you could pose the conflict in different ways man vs man man vs machine the war making technology but i think vonnegut would favor something like individuals vs the system many of his books are about this how most people are basically decent one on one but inject politics into the mix or involve too many people and we forget our humanity the year old nazis who tortured jews probably had cordial relations with the jewish shopkeeper on the corner in their hometown and the american and british pilots who obliterated the men women and children of dresden were no different then the gis who handed out candy to german children at the end of the war Kurt Vonnegut Slaughterhouse-Five World War II Black comedy Crime against humanity Dresden British Mandate of Palestine Israel Judaism Bombing of Dresden in World War II The Holocaust Royal Air Force The Sirens of Titan Who is a Jew?
