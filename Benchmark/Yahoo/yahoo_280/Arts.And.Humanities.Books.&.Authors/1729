in which harry potter film do you feel they follow the book the most and why i feel they followed prisoner of azkaban the best because it was such an important plot and you need to know a lot of some things for future movies they also did a pretty good job on sorcerer's stone and chamber of secrets as well i love all and i love the books too but they don't always follow the book as i want them to please don't say none i hate hary potter stick to the books or anything else related to that because i'm not a harry potter basher and nor do i want to listen to any i think i agree with you entirely they followed the text fairly well in all of the thin books but poa was the most crucial of these and where they followed best gof was a bad joke in terms of following the books not in that they made things up but in that they left out almost everything that happened ootp was very different from the book i thought it was a nice interpretation for film but it deviates massively from the text Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter Ron Weasley Emma Watson J.
