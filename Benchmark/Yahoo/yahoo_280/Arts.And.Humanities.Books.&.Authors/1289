why are people so many people inconsiderate of others who may not yet have read the latest harry potter book i have already had a major aspect of the latest harry potter book ruined because some idiot posted a question here in a manner that revealed a plot point can someone please tell me why isn't there a law that punishes idiocy like this not everyone can afford to buy the book and are instead waitng to borrow it from the library maybe someone is not buying the book because they suspect someone will buy it for them as a present maybe some people don't want to further line j k rowling's pockets and prefer to wait for the movie to come out whatever the reason who agrees that people who ruin books and films for others are low life imbeciles i totally agree with you there is no reason why people should be such idiots as to put in the question didn't you hate it when so and so died etc to me it's just a sad person trying to ruin it for everyone else it reminds me of when the half blood prince came out and a bunch a juvenile jerks went into a bookstore where people were waiting on line to buy the book and shouted so and so dies now tell me all you folks who bought the book the night it was released how would you have liked that so you didn't read the book within the hours of being released some people have lives ya know they can't always sit down and read a word book in one sitting to blame a person for not reading the book immediately is ridiculous that said if you see a question with the word spoiler in it then you have no one to blame but yourself Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince J.
