is there a difference between the harry potter books in uk and usa i have been reading harry potter books in the united states ever since they came out being that i live there my aunt came for a visit from uk she brought me the seventh harry potter book i want to know if there is a difference between the uk and the usa i want to read the usa version but since she has already bought one from uk where i think it was published i will read the uk one but is there a differnce in the actual text of the book like they both have the exact same text is there a difference between the hardcover and paper back copies of the books between both the uk and usa versions well the us version comes with a different cover larger font and more pages because of the larger font and chapter pictures also i would assume spelling is different example being colour for uk and color for us but other than that there wouldn't be much differences they are gone over by different editors but the same content is in each books there just might be a differently worded sentence here or there but the same things happen Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter Oxford English Dictionary Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter in translation Killian documents House of Leaves Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Creation according to Genesis Screenplay Typeface Ebook Atari 8-bit family Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Newspaper Finnish language Douglas Adams Magic (Harry Potter) Cascading Style Sheets Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Steganography Scholastic Press Lord Voldemort HTML editor Book of Mormon J.
