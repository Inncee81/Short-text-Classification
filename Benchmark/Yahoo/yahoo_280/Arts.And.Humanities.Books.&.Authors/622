my magic dream for the past two nights i've had these warped reality dreams where i'm harry potter and i spend my time with ron and hermione but there are constant references to my real life the first night i dreamed that i was with ron and hermione and we were going to see moaning myrtle we're going to the bathroom when i remember that i forgot my invisibility cloak i run back to the dorms and get it on the way back i push colin creevey when he tries to take a photo of me on the way back i also break my wand i try expelliarmus with no luck and realize it's wrecked then as i'm about to go into the bathroom i'm yelled at by the headmaster who in real life is my high school principal the second night i'm walking along a boardwalk talking with ron we're talking as we see a crowd coming toward us with gilderoy lockhart at the center fred and george come up to us and ask if we had gotten rid of him before we say yes and pull him out of the crowd cont we take gilderoy to my house where he disapirrates to my roof me and ron talk about how to get him down we decide not to use the confringo spell in fear that he'll die we try to use a memory charm to make him forget the basilisk thing again but can't remember the words in the end decide upon confunding him i do it using george's wand as mine is still broken from the night before then ron runs to get his mum i look at lockhart and one of his irises goes purple while the other disappears he looks like a scary cartoon character he begins to rant but it was indescernible i begin to get paranoid and i wake up with my heart racing happy yet fearful tell me what you think sounds like a cool dream Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Gilderoy Lockhart Dates in Harry Potter Hogwarts subjects Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Hermione Granger Diagon Alley Ginny Weasley Minor Hufflepuffs Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Rubeus Hagrid Hogwarts Floor Directory Albus Dumbledore Tom Riddle's diary Avenue Q Minor Harry Potter Beasts Dumbledore's Army Dobby Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Magic (Harry Potter) Ron and Fez Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sybill Trelawney Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone House-elf Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) Neville Longbottom Luck Wand Shaggy dog story Blood purity (Harry Potter) Oh My Goddess!
