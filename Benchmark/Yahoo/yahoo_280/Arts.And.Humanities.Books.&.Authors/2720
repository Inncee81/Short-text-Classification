book or nothing like that if you cant help me then don't answer at all thanks very much plot synopsis the play centers on willy loman a salesman over sixty years old who is beginning to lose his grip on reality willy places great emphasis on his supposed native charm and ability to make friends according to him he was once well known and liked throughout new england as a traveling salesman whose skills were unparalleled his sons biff and happy a nickname for harold were the pride and joy of the neighborhood and his wife linda was picturesque smiling throughout the day unfortunately time has passed and now his life seems to be slipping out of control willy has worked hard his entire life and ought to be retiring by now living a life of luxury and closing deals with contractors on the phone especially since increasing episodes of depersonalization and flashback are impairing his ability to drive instead all of willy's aspirations seem to have failed he is fired from his job which barely paid enough anyway by a man young enough to be his son willy is now forced to rely on loans from his next door neighbor charley to make ends meet charley is the closest thing willy has to a friend but willy still harbors jealousy and contempt toward him for being more successful charley even offers willy a job after he is fired and yet willy is too proud to take it none of willy's old friends or previous customers remember him biff his year old son has been unable to 'find himself' as a result of his inability to settle down caused by willy constantly insisting that he needed to 'make it big within two weeks' and happy the younger son lies shamelessly to make it seem as if he is the perfect loman son in contrast charley who willy tells his boys conspiratorially is not 'well liked' is now a successful businessman and his son bernard a formerly bespectacled bookworm is now a brilliant lawyer we are told how willy had at least one affair while out on business trips one that biff walked in on and discovered this terrible ordeal broke biff's faith in his father and sent him on a downward spiral finally willy is haunted by memories of his now dead older brother ben who at an early age left for alaska and later moved to africa and when he walked out he was rich ben has constantly overshadowed willy and he is in many ways the man that willy wanted to be ben's approach is heralded by idyllic music showing willy's idolization of him and in flashbacks we see willy asking for ben's advice on parenting the play's structure resembles a stream of consciousness account willy drifts between his living room downstage to the apron and flashbacks of an idyllic past and also to fantasized conversations with ben the use of these different 'states' allows miller to contrast willy's dreams and the reality of his life in extraordinary detail and also allows him to contrast the characters themselves showing them in both sympathetic and villainous lights gradually unfolding the story and refusing to allow the audience a permanent judgment about anyone when we are in the present the characters abide by the rules of the set entering only through the stage door to the left however when we visit willy's 'past' these rules are removed with characters openly moving through walls whereas the term 'flashback' as a form of cinematography for these scenes is often heard miller himself rather speaks of 'mobile concurrences' in fact flashbacks would show an objective image of the past miller's mobile concurrences however rather show highly subjective memories furthermore as willy's mental state deteriorates the boundaries between past and present are destroyed and the two start to exist in parallel the depths of the problem are gradually revealed willy's emphasis on being well liked stems from a belief that it will bring him to perfect success not a harmful dream in itself except that he clings to this idea as if it is a life preserver refusing to give it up in high school his boys were not only well liked but quite handsome and as far as willy is concerned that's all anyone needs he pitches this idea to his sons so effectively that they believe opportunity will fall into their laps in this way biff and happy can be considered forerunners to the culture of entitlement of course real life is not so generous and neither are able to hold much in the way of respectable employment willy witnesses his and his sons' failures and clings ever more tightly to his master plan now placing his hopes vicariously on them he may not succeed but they might his tragic flaw is in failing to question whether the dream is valid happy never does either he has embraced his father's attitude and at the end of the first act he convinces biff to seek financial backing in a get rich quick scheme but when biff tries to do so he realizes his father's mistakes and finally decides not to let willy fall prey to the unrealistic dream again they attack each other at the play's climax biff confronting willy's neurosis head on while willy accuses biff of throwing his life away simply to hurt willy's feelings despite a raggedly emotional battle of words neither is able to make much headway but before biff gives up he breaks down in tears will you take that phony dream and burn it before something happens willy is touched that biff still cares for him after all but fails to understand the deeper meaning of his words and resolves to do everything possible to leave him with the right opportunities to strike it rich as the rest of the family goes upstairs to bed ben reappears over willy's shoulder willy proclaims that in taking his own life the attendance at his funeral would make a show to his doubting son of how popular he was in life and that if handled to look accidental the payout from his life insurance policy will allow biff to start his own business this final action can be viewed as his attempt to leave a tangible legacy for his family willy acknowledges that nothing grows here anymore and his vain attempts to plant seeds during the darkness express his desperate desire to leave something behind the neighborhood is drawn out of bed by the roar and smash of willy's car despite ben's warnings that the insurance policy won't be honored in the event of suicide thus willy's grand gesture and indeed his earlier assertion that one is often worth more dead than alive leaves his family and especially his wife linda in even worse a position than before click here for it all http en wikipedia org wiki death of a salesman this one may be
