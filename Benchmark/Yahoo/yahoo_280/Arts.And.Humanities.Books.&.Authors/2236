edward or jacob who do you prefer for bella edward or jacob why i personally prefer edward this is because they were meant to be together from the beginning obviously the first book was mostly all about them i think jake just messed up their relationship and manipulated bella to think about him in a way she thinks about edward edward also is bella's everything her reason for living her true soulmate he can protect her and sacrifices so much for her he even would be willing to let bella go if that was what made her happy at first jacob kept fighting for her and would not let her go but in the end decides to give her up so he would seem like the good guy but i don't think so edward loves her so much more now it's not that i really hate jacob but i just don't like him at all for bella i hope he finds that special girl who isn't bella and will imprint on her and realize that there are other girls out there he still has not met One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Kodocha Knots Landing True Crime: Streets of LA Friends Jacob Charmed EastEnders Social rule Scrooge McDuck AVN Awards Taken Soulmate Jean Grey Heretics of Dune Pitaten W.I.T.C.H.
