any advice for a new th and th grade teacher literature science and social studies i did my student teaching in first grade and that's where i feel most comfortable however jobs are scarce here and the community at this school is too amazing to pass up my principals are very supportive however i could use some advice in regards to working with this age group just getting in there is the best thing to do you will learn fast don't worry i would take a week or two before school starts to call your principal and ask when you can get in your room and take a look at your curriculum so you have time to familiarize yourself with it that will also let your principal know you are dedicated to your job i also started in a grade i never imagined i would it happens to people all the time you should be given a mentor don't be afraid to ask him her questions also be firm and consistent on the first day of school with your rules procedures and discipline don't try and befriend the kids they will like you in time but you are setting yourself up for problems if they see you are easy to manipulate from day one good luck Graduate school Education Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Japan Education in the United States Education in Germany Boston Public Secondary education in France Education in Portugal Secondary education in Japan Education in Hong Kong Homeschooling A-level Waldorf Education Teacher Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Romania GED Logic Social rule Milton H.
