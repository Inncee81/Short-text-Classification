how can i get along with teachers what would be considered appropriate and inappropriate personally and professionally as teachers are simply a variety of human beings there is no essential difference in how to get along with them compared with how to get along with others mutual respect and consideration top the list along with behavior that enhances rather than diminishes the teacher's leadership and authority in the class your question is framed very well because in asking how can i get along with teachers you are assuming the responsibility for positive outcomes a good thing though if anything it is even more important for a teacher to assume responsibility in achieving the same goal one good approach good for your own progress as a students and your own peace of mind is not to take negative input from a teacher too personally negative input doesn't just include the way papers are graded and it doesn't just include constructive criticism sometimes it is just plain negative mistaken wrong if your teacher is a human being not an angel in disguise or a teaching robot so in getting negative input whether constructive or not remember that your teacher is human and strive to be tolerant and forgiving the teacher after all must put the day's rudeness and misbehavior of students behind him at the end of the day and try to wipe the slate clean by roll call time tomorrow the way to control damage from even extremely inappropriately negative input that might come in the course of a school day is to focus the mind forcibly on the positive it works with bad test grades too not i just got per cent on the test i'm stupid i might as well give up but i got the majority per cent of the answers right so i'm not too dumb how can i turn the other per cent around not the teacher is a b with an itch for being sharp tongued and rude but what positives can i extract from this negative situation how can i turn it around how by changing my behavior can i change the teacher's responses toward me appropriate and inappropriate is also an intelligent concern as teacher and student are merely roles and appropriate is whatever positively enhances the role and inappropriate is whatever destroys the positive interaction that the role is designed to supply it is inappropriate to disobey or try to get around classroom rules and to behave in a way that undermines respect for the teacher as an instructor or a mentor it is inappropriate to show antagonism or disrespect by openly defying the teacher wearing a hat in class against the rules slumping in the chair having food and drink in the class smirking and continuing in misbehavior when it is pointed out it is appropriate to be friendly and to joke and laugh a little when it doesn't disrupt a lesson classroom routine and the teaching learning process but contrariwise one teacher and student wrote the book on inappropriateness when she wore his baseball cap in class in disregard of the rule that no one was to wear a cap in class and when she not only allowed him to break the rule against drinking soda in class but even took a swig from the bottle these actions created a bad impression excessive buddy buddy closeness between student and teacher does not enhance the class's respect for her in her role as a teacher either extreme open enmity or excessive intimacy with students cripples a teacher's effectiveness it is the teacher's responsibility to set the tone but this doesn't excuse a student's misbehavior appropriate is whatever works best for everybody concerned and inappropriate is the opposite breaking the rules and upsetting classroom routine is always inappropriate the above are just examples common sense is the best guide Social rule Social psychology Theory of conduct Microeconomics Alexander Technique Second language acquisition Asperger syndrome Motivation Martial art Japanese tea ceremony Welding Internet troll Psychology Theodicy Transactional analysis Intelligent design movement Past teachings of Prem Rawat Scientology beliefs and practices Extreme Programming Philosophy of language Drama Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Economics Tai Chi Chuan Teach the Controversy Beavis and Butt-head Standardized testing Great Teacher Onizuka Aikido Goodness and value theory Homeschooling Pitaten Infantilism Dog training Ethics Aesthetic Realism Education in the United States Philosophy of education Consensus decision-making Columbine High School massacre Allergy Education in Japan Operational amplifier Education The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Graduate school Classroom Supply and demand No Child Left Behind Act Expert system Breastfeeding Evil Autism Hogwarts Singlish Capitalism Utilitarianism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Social justice Cognitive science Atheism Alignment (role-playing games) Separation of church and state Milton H.
