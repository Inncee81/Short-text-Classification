is the possession of teacher's edition workbooks pohibited by the ministry of education i happen to ordered a set of teacher's edition wb so that it can aid me while i do my h w is that illegal the local publishers refused to sell them to me so i had to order it off the net what should i do many publishers or teacher manuals and keys simply will not sell to private addresses some will since there is a growing home school market those who purchase these to self correct cause the market to shrink somewhat ebay stopped selling these materials for the same reason and it is a shame that some teachers must work harder to supply their small private schools with materials due to this common occurance with students may i encourage you please consider what your goals are in obtaining these tes learning should be the optimum goal and joy of your education and not perfect grades checking and correcting your work with the same book your teacher uses will give you excellent grades albeit under questionable moral ethics but will it give you the goal of learning i truly doubt it if i may use the analogy of a door you are knocking down the door to obtain good marks from your teacher you will soon forget what it took to knock down that door you may even get into trouble for the damage done should you be caught your actions cause tougher locks to be installed which hurt some teachers' attempts to truly teach their students when you learn how to find answers on your own you will have the key that will unlock many of the doors you can't knock down learn to love to learn and seek that with all your heart learn to research and think and you will find that the answers on the other side of the door often come with only a slight push instead of a hard kick some answers will be harder but you will have the key that is the better key and that will unlock doors you never thought would budge i hope you consider this sharon who took over nineteen years to learn to love to learn for the mere sake of learning and is now teaching that to other children A Course In Miracles Education in the People's Republic of China Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Intelligent design movement Martial art Education Jumpstart 3rd Grade Scientology beliefs and practices Education in the United States Current teachings of Prem Rawat Homeschooling Education in Japan Socrates SAT Tai Chi Chuan Education in Romania GED Philosophy of education Boston Public Church of Christ, Scientist Microeconomics Tenshinhan Confucianism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Coercion Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Standardized testing Theory of conduct Textbook McGuffey Readers Columbine High School massacre Alexander Technique Liberalism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Education in Germany Copy protection Economics Nicomachean Ethics Academia Strategic management Water polo Teacher Graduate school Ludwig Wittgenstein Gifted Public-key cryptography Confucius Teach the Controversy One Tree Hill (TV series) Aikido Japanese tea ceremony Blood (computer game) Code: Lyoko Capital accumulation Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Muslim ibn Aqeel Plame affair Education in Portugal Charter school Floppy disk Francis Crick Free will Gramophone record Middle school Windows XP Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pitaten No Child Left Behind Act Sin City The Hobbit Human Education in India Experiential education National Certificate of Educational Achievement Philosophy Lawrence v.
