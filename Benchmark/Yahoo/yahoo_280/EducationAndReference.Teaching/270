is it better to begin a teaching career with your bachelor's degree or with your master's degree i know that schools look for experienced teachers therefore those with higher degrees will look more promising when applying to better school districts but i also know that teachers with master's degrees are paid more upon entry schools might be more apt to hire those with a bachelor's degree so that they do not have to pay a new teacher as much if they had a master's degree i'm on the fence i don't know whether or not to start teaching with my bachelor's degree one in history and one in psychology and then going to get my master's degree later or to get my master's degree now and then start looking for teaching jobs help those trying to give the best advice will recommend that you get your masters before job hunting in most states you will need that master's degree or its equivalent very soon after you start teaching in most states you can only get temporary teaching certification without a master's degree or equivalent that means working and taking course work at night if available and or going to summer school with all the year round schools now working on a master's degree during the summer is not always an option the new no child left behind law that require districts to have highly qualified teachers is another reason that you may find it easier to get a job with your master's degree in hand if you are financially able go ahead and get your master's degree after you do your student teaching or internship additional hours beyond your bachelors will not adversely impact your ability to find a job as reality checks i am a recently retired teacher i taught for years i have a master's degree and additional graduate hours getting a job teaching history in high school or junior high will be easier if you are qualified to coach a sport since you have a background in psychology you might want to consider a master's degree in counseling Education in Germany Education in the United States Teacher Lawyer Education in Australia Professor Master's degree No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Medical school Education in Japan Chinese University of Hong Kong College Education in the Republic of Ireland Law school School counselor Academic degree Academia Education in Portugal Physician College admissions Barrister Apprenticeship Paralegal University of Houston Community college Memorial University of Newfoundland Education in Hong Kong Doctorate Tai Chi Chuan Education in Romania High school Postgraduate Certificate in Education Associate's degree Athabasca University Unemployment Alexander Technique Education in Sweden Nurse The College of New Jersey Scientology beliefs and practices Rabbi Librarian Degrees of Oxford University Architect General practitioner Kwantlen University College Ball State University Social work Bologna process Christian Brothers University City and Guilds of London Institute Oregon State University Education in France Fencing Software engineering Education in Canada SAT Georgetown University Education in Finland Columbia University Reiki Far Eastern University Education in Malaysia Martial art Pennsylvania State University Hogwarts subjects GED University of Chicago Bachelor of Arts Intelligence quotient Trinity College, Dublin Education Doctor of Philosophy Bachelor of Laws Sam Houston State University Public education A-level Indiana State University Education in Singapore Education in Taiwan American University Diving Pharmacist Secondary education in Japan Master of Laws Education in Scotland Franklin W.
