do you need a bachelor degree to teach basic accounting i have associate of science degree in accounting and have been working years in the accounting clerk level i am wondering if further studies beside certification are needed to teach basic accounting possibly in high school check with your state education department they may have a program for professionals to switch careers however regardless of the state i am certain you at least have to have a bachelor's degree preferably in your field of interest you will also most likely be required to take some education classes to hone your skills if you are good at math you might want to consider that all schools are in desperate need of math teachers see if there is a tapp program in your area you have to have a bachelor's degree for this though you can start teaching right away get paid and take education classes in the summer but the subject field has to be critical like math science english etc Education in the United States Teacher Graduate school No Child Left Behind Act Master's degree Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany Education in Portugal Education in Australia Community college Paralegal Lawyer Juris Doctor Law school Medical school City and Guilds of London Institute College Academic degree Education in Taiwan Chinese University of Hong Kong Physician Education in the People's Republic of China Nurse Education Librarian Education in Sweden Education in Japan Junior Certificate Bachelor of Arts Florida Institute of Technology Electrical engineering Education in France Doctorate Australian Qualifications Framework Georgetown University SAT Education in Austria Education in Finland Architect The College of New Jersey Far Eastern University Oregon State University High school Education in India Secondary education in France Gymnasium (Denmark) Stuyvesant High School Software engineering Master of Laws University of Phoenix Professor General Certificate of Secondary Education College admissions Associate's degree Emerson College Athabasca University Academia Doctor of Philosophy University of Houston Ball State University Education in Malaysia Education in Canada University of Maryland Baltimore County Propaedeutic value of Esperanto A-level Education in South Korea Caulfield Grammar School Advanced Placement Program Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Cornell University Jaime Escalante Open University (Netherlands) Kwantlen University College IB Diploma Programme Secondary education in the United States Secondary education in Japan Education in Singapore Accountancy Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Clements High School Memorial University of Newfoundland Civil engineering Northeastern University, Boston Cooper Union Trinity College, Dublin Colegio de San Juan de Letran Physical therapy GED Apprenticeship Mathematics Public education United States Air Force Academy
