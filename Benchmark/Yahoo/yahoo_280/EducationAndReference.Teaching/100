how can i be certified teacher in texas i have a degree in business education is there a way to take a short cut where i can just take a test and be approved to teach in texas without having to take alternative courses my interest is mostly on special education where did you obtain your degree i mean in what state if you obtained it outside of texas i don't think you have much choice but to either go through alternative certification or through a graduate degree if you did get it at a university in texas then contact your university i'm not really sure about your degree but it seems that if education is part of the degree then you took education courses just call your university and see if they will give you the barcode to register for the certification exams by the way here's the link to the website to register for certification exams but like i said you won't be able to get very far into the registration process without either a barcode from either your university or an alternative certification program or by already being certified and having an id through sbec http www texes ets org do you have certification in another state it may just be a matter of getting your credentials reviewed by the state board of educator certification here's the website for sbec http www sbec state tx us sbeconline default asp sadly there is no short cut you can't just take a test texas as well as the rest of the country is very strict about this thanks to no child left behind i would however recommend you look into either an alternative certification program that can put you on a faster track the one i went through had three different cohort programs i chose the one that would allow me to begin my teaching at the beginning of a school year but there are faster programs the good thing is that they require you to have a teaching job to complete the program you have to teach and yes you'll be paid for a year under their supervision i don't know what area you live in but the education service center that serves your area will likely have the best alternative certification program here's the link to find out which center serves your area http www tea state tx us esc nav nodeid Education in Portugal Teacher Nurse Physician Education in Germany Graduate school Education in Australia Juris Doctor High school Education in Hong Kong Education in the United States School counselor City and Guilds of London Institute Architect IB Diploma Programme College admissions Paralegal SAT A-level Medical Assistant Education in Romania Education in the Republic of Ireland No Child Left Behind Act Community college Certification Advanced Placement Program Education in Malaysia Education in the People's Republic of China American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Software engineering New York State Department of Education GED General practitioner Associate's degree Master's degree Education in Sweden Librarian College The Princeton Review Professional Engineer Law school Junior Certificate Accountancy Medical school Lawyer Attorney at Law University of Texas at San Antonio Podiatrist Domain Name System Victorian Certificate of Education Master of Laws Uniform Resource Locator National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in Taiwan Education in Japan Education in Scotland Education in Austria Patent attorney Leaving Certificate Notary public Affirmative action UCAS Higher School Certificate Doctor of Philosophy Texas A&M University-Texarkana University of the State of New York Air Education and Training Command Physical therapy Bologna process Academia University of Houston Public education Education in India Education in France Homeschooling Public domain Bachelor of Arts Kaplan Higher education in Japan Postgraduate Certificate in Education Jaime Escalante Motion picture rating system ZIP Code Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Finland Gwinnett University Center Certified Financial Planner Australian Qualifications Framework AMA Computer University Secondary education in France South Australian Certificate of Education Organic certification Distance education Driver's license Trinity College, Dublin Pennsylvania State University Far Eastern University Education in Singapore
