teacher fashion shoes i am student teaching this year and am trying hard to look professional i have never been good at fashion but i want to look like i belong in a high school setting as a teacher so today i would like to know about shoes should i be wearing heals or can i get away with flats i am ' what colors or styles work well i have a pair of black high healed boots from payless thanks for any shoe advice or even pictures you can give i am trying to build up a decent wardrobe before school starts so i can walk in feeling professional p s i am in my late 's so the trendy thing isn't an issue i am just not good at knowing what to wear i am also in my late twenties and i have been teaching for years plus i am ' '' i know exactly what you are talking about here i always choose something with a lower heel usually inches i do have the occasional inch heel but i only wear those with longer pants and if the heel is a wider heel personally i do not like to wear flats i have to look up at the kids when i do and my feet feel better at the end of the day if i have on some sort of heel check out dsw for shoes they have a great selection and you can usually get different colors of the same shoe stick with a black and a brown for now if you find that you need more then get a different style and some different colors find a friend to go with you to look at shoes it is nice to have another opinion when you go shopping sometimes if that isn't possible ask one of the associates at the store for their opinion i know it is summer and all but wear a pair of black pants that you will be wearing to school so that you can see how the shoes will look but the most important thing is to break in the shoes before school starts trust me you do not want to wear a brand new pair of shoes to school and end up with a blister at the end of the day High-heeled shoe Shoe Punk fashion Irish dance Sock Social aspects of clothing Japanese tea ceremony About a Boy Undergarment Marching band French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Napoleon Dynamite Dragon Booster Skinhead Boston Public Suit (clothes) Kilt Social rule Equine conformation Professional wrestling slang Footwear Stocking Horse Columbine High School massacre Satchel Paige Kodocha Culture of the United States Mattress Theory of conduct Doug Infantilism Gramophone record Pointe shoes RuneScape economy Great Teacher Onizuka Glen Jacobs Kurt Angle Boot 1957 World Series Breakdancing Stereoscopy Violin Pitaten Black tie Badminton Extreme Programming Past teachings of Prem Rawat Foot Humphrey Bogart Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Reiki Jesuit College Preparatory School Horseshoe Softball Poker jargon Phoebe Buffay's songs Sally Brown Jeans Digital photography Cowboy Characters in the Smurfs Wood Roller skating Kender Tai Chi Chuan Shaggy dog story Teach the Controversy Teacher Hip hop fashion Negima Shoe size Diving Witches (Discworld) Kimi Finster The Devil Wears Prada Fashion Snowboard Aes Sedai Aikido Figure skating Reebok Platform shoe Holes (book) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Raffles Institution Empire Burlesque Cliff Richard Gothic Lolita Dog training CPU cache Earring Full Metal Panic?
