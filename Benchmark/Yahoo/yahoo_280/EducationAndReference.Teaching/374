can i become an elementary or middle school teacher with a b s in biology i have been married to my husband for about years and we're thinking about having children but the public school system our kids would have to attend does not have a very good record i've taught semesters of college level biology courses during graduate school with outstanding results and have organized many presentations about biology to elementary schools with great feedback also but it might have been because i brought animals with me please tell me what you know thanks this would be easier to accomplish in a state with a teacher shortage i teach in the state of florida and to combat a severe teacher shortage anyone with a four year degree can apply for a temporary educator's certificate if they are willing to take and pass a general knowledge education test this is called alternative certification the individuals then have three years to complete a beginning teacher program often paid for by the school district you are teaching in and take several additional tests and pass them many successful teachers have began their careers this way however it does require a commitment to starting a new career earning less salary and learning about the teaching profession through hard work and trainings i have taught for years and i did not begin my career this way but you are bringing an attribute to the profession that many others won't it would be wise of you to connect with principals and share some evidence of your work in biology especially helpful would be the elem presentations on biology hopefully you have some pictures or other documentation of your previous work with children the best thing about your particular timing is that nclb is moving toward including standardized science scores when deciding if individual schools have made ayp adequate yearly progress making somebody with your skills and background more desireable i hope this helps you consider teaching find your state's departement of education website to find information on transition to teaching or new teacher certification requirements No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Teacher Graduate school Education in Germany Education in Portugal Education in Romania Education in Hong Kong High school Juris Doctor Education in the Republic of Ireland Medical school GED Education in Australia Education in Taiwan City and Guilds of London Institute Medicine Education in Sweden Education in Singapore Education in Japan Software engineering Grade (education) Education New York State Department of Education College admissions College Experiential education Professor Education in Scotland Public education University of Maryland Baltimore County Community college Far Eastern University Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Master's degree Stuyvesant High School Education in Austria General practitioner Charter school Homeschooling Propaedeutic value of Esperanto IB Diploma Programme American University Miami-Dade County Public Schools Alexander Technique Chinese University of Hong Kong A-level Law school Intelligent design movement Danish Folkeskole Education University of Central Florida Air Education and Training Command Lawyer Creation and evolution in public education Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education reform Gymnasium (Denmark) Tripartite System Tai Chi Chuan Doctor of Philosophy Teach the Controversy Education in Albania Reiki National Certificate of Educational Achievement The College of New Jersey University of Connecticut Cornell University UCAS Certification Education in India Biology Secondary education in Japan Rabbi Academia Apprenticeship Reliability engineering Florida State University Hunter College High School Texas A&M University-Texarkana Caulfield Grammar School Dr. Michael M.
