zidane to play in australia for sydney fc i just heard that sydney fc will be asking zidane to make a guest appearence in the friendly game against la galaxy featuring david beckham what do you think about that juniniho should be playing in the same game too but should sydney just use the players they have give them the chance to play or should they go ahead and get zidane to play also where does zidane play now i thought he retired so he might not be match fit or am i wrong sufianolilano why would i want to lie about it check out the links below http www news com au heraldsun story html news ninemsn com au article aspx id www news com au dailytelegraph story html haoren l what the f k are you on about piss off well bela that is a little offencive and you guys sometimes forget that small teams have fans too in countries that are trying to promote the game and would love the chance to see their hero's play live i wonder whether you have watched much of our a league or asian cl matches so its not big for you but it sure as heck is for me and many other zizou and or sydney fans in australia anyway he is a good friend of becks and if it comes off it will really help highlight and promote the sport even more in australia and the usa he would likely make a cameo appearance for maybe the second half i'm sure he can handle that it's one match not a comeback he has done it for charity games and the poverty games it will be awesome if this can be pulled off i don't think that the boys would be devastated to give up their position for a half of football to play alongside the maestro i have my tickets so darn i hope he comes i'm stoked babyboy you are just too sweet xxx David Beckham Football (soccer) Zin__dine Zidane Peter Shilton Rugby union Australian rules football Steve McManaman Gordon Banks The Ashes Major League Soccer Rugby league Real Madrid Bryan Robson Football culture National Football League Baseball Super League (Australia) Satchel Paige Sydney Swans Final Fantasy IX Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles English cricket team Michael Owen American football Sydney Riot of 1879 New York Giants Water polo Football chant West Bromwich Albion F.C.
