why does american football not get more recognition worldwide im tired of little kids in england saying it doesnt take any talent real sports fans know thats not true but their has be a reason i know it will never be as big as soccer worldwide but i think it should be more popular well i love soccer and i dont like football but i dont hate it i watch the superbowl and the playoffs and some games in the regular season but i dont really enjoy it because it takes too much hours and only hour of play and really u dont need that much talent if your a linemen u just need to be strong and big but wide receivers and some other positions do require talent and i think the reason why is not popular around the world is to much timeouts and comercials to much pads in the player and it gets boring alot of times Football (soccer) American football National Football League Super Bowl Cincinnati Bengals Major League Soccer Pittsburgh Steelers Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl I Playoff New York Giants Baseball Super Bowl III Glossary of American football National Football League Lore Jacksonville Jaguars New England Patriots Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXV 2005 NFL season FA Premier League Miami Dolphins David Beckham Super Bowl XXVIII Women's football (soccer) Comparison of Canadian and American football FIFA Series EA Sports Kansas City Chiefs San Francisco 49ers Cleveland Browns Football (soccer) positions Super Bowl XXVII Donovan McNabb Minnesota Vikings Football Super Bowl XXXIV The Football League Offensive team Monday Night Football Ultimate (sport) American football strategy Super Bowl XXXIX Bobby Charlton Cleveland Indians American Football League World Football League Super Bowl XXVI Salary cap Sudden death Canadian Football League Toronto Maple Leafs Super Bowl X Primera Divisi__n Argentina Arena football Football World Cup Playoff format National Basketball Association Toronto Argonauts Formation (football) Super Bowl IV Atlantic Coast Conference Indoor football Stanley Cup Atomic Kitten Syracuse University Orange Super Bowl XXXI Major professional sports league Michael Jordan New York Knicks Major League Baseball Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.
