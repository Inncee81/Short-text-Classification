manchester united v reading what did you think of the game i thought manchester united dominated the whole game and it's sad that rooney got hurt on the opening day we dominated the whole match and had many chances to win the game but we missed them it was a shame that wayne rooney got injured so early in the season hopefully he will be fit again very soon if he was on the pitch today then maybe he would have won us the game but i don't believe that we have something to worry about carlos tevez louis saha and ole gunnar solskjear will be available to play again very soon but reading weren't exactly going for the win were they for starters they started with one man up front but that's what most teams do play for a draw when they come to old trafford arsenal chelsea and liverpool may have won but one game doesn't make a season hopefully we will improve our finishing and get the title challenge back on track i am in a bad mood at the moment but hopefully reading can draw or beat chelsea in midweek chelsea arsenal and liverpool will all drop points at some stage manchester united didn't cheat but the referee had a bad game glory glory manchester united Alex Ferguson FA Cup FA Premier League 2004-05 Manchester United F.C.
