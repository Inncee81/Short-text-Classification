what do you think of beckham's performance tonight he came on in around the th minute in a heavy rain with galaxy playing one goal down and one man down he played center mid and even though galaxy didn't equalize he did create some chances personally under the circumstances i though he played well the best thing is probably that the ankle didn't seem to be causing any trouble anybody else have any thoughts i liked his performance and demeanor during the match before he entered he looked pissed off as the galaxy played poorly the club couldn't get the ball forward and ended up with few shots in the first half it shows he does care about playing well in mls as for his performance on the pitch it was good for a guy who hasn't really trained with the club he showed some rust his free kick was good though it would have been an awesome header if pavon converted he should have converted a much easier header earlier in the match i did hear he was sick his long through pass to donovan was great imagine if the grass was not slick from the rain it would have been great if donovan converted if we learned anything beckham is serious about playing in mls his galaxy teammates have to learn to run at the defense especially near the yard box no defender in their right mind will go for an aggressive tackle with beckham handing free kicks i doubt he starts against new england it's on dreaded fieldturf Football (soccer) American football Bryan Robson Peter Shilton Norway national football team Glossary of American football Rugby union Water polo David Beckham Canadian football National Football League Lore Football (soccer) positions Rugby league Carolina Panthers Major League Soccer Australian rules football American football strategy Cricket Gordon Banks Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXXVIII New York Giants Field hockey Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XIII Satchel Paige Geoff Hurst Fast bowling Comparison of Canadian and American football Rugby union positions Super Bowl XXXVI Pittsburgh Steelers Alex Ferguson Cleveland Browns 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup Volleyball Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXVII Harrow Football NFL playoffs, 2001-02 1957 World Series 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Baseball Super Bowl IX Rugby football Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bobby Charlton Gaelic football Yao Ming The Contender (television series) Softball Super Bowl XXVI Football culture Basketball Donovan McNabb Poker jargon Super Bowl V Tris Speaker Sol Campbell Manchester United 1986-1999 Super Bowl XXXIV Golf England national football team History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Donovan USS Tunny (SS-282) Buddy Guy Penalty kick (football) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XV October 2005 in sports New England Patriots Super Bowl XII Touch football (rugby league) Troms__ I.L.
