ok people stop the hijinks what is the point there are fellow americans that put down soccer and there are people of all nations that will put down football i will jump on any of my fellow countrymen who put down other nations over a game and i ask that everyone try to do the same it is ridiculous to have to keep answering the same old and tired questions i am tired of seeing the same old arguement about which came first which one is aptly named and which one is more boring i love and respect both sports no matter what they are called i often say that i have the best of both worlds but if you are unable to at least respect the other sport then don't resort to dissing or name calling let's keep it in check and believe me as an american i soak up every drop of information i can get on television in regard to soccer from around the world we need sponsors who want to put it on tv we need to differentiate the sports here we can't have two sports with one common name guess which one gets called soccer yes i do have a sense of humor but that sort of activity only feeds the anti soccer faction it's hard to sell the game here and i need all the help i can get i am part of a group that is trying to get mls to place a team here in philadelphia and i am amazed at the level of disdain toward soccer much less the apathy especially when there were kids in a tournament around a month ago i do not agree with what certain users did as a matter of fact i'm somewhat dissapointed but there have been certain fans from other sports who started bad mouthing soccer football and the users are just trying to get back when they should have just ignored it now i too am an american but the users are acting like children over this hopefully we can put this incident behind us and get back to why we are all on here seahawks rule Football (soccer) Rugby union American football New York Giants Playoff Baseball Rugby league Ultimate (sport) Theory of conduct Martial art Ayrton Senna North American Soccer League Football Norway national football team Football World Cup Playoff format The Jim Rome Show Hip hop rivalries Sport Volleyball Rugby football Indoor football United States men's national soccer team Table tennis Tennis Whose Line Is It Anyway?
