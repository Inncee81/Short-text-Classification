what is the fascination with david beckham i see the media are cooling off a bit since david beckham moved to la galaxy i never could quite understand the media frenzy anyway i mean he's good but isn't what i would describe as a truly great player anyway who would you say is the greatest footballer currently playing secret keeper you've changed your name haven't you ryan giggs is still playing for them sorry can't bring myself to use foul language redknapp and shearer are both retired and are currently pundits redknapp for sky sports and shearer for the bbc i wouldn't say they were 'greats' either not in the same way as pele cruyff maradonna or zidane anyway so who in todays game is going to go down in history like them adam h he always was a bit lame in my opinion dolia i think you have a point but i think he's got famous off the back of his wife's fame if he hadn't married a spice girl then i think he'd have just remained an ordinary player for an ordinary club love him or hate me well i love him as a due of respect that is he is the most iconic footballer in the world those ronaldinhos kakas and ronaldos are well known in the football world i repeat football world but trying asking people who dont know anything about football chances that people wil know about beckham is more than they will know about kaka ronaldinho ronaldo well in my opinion he is truely a great footballer not the greatest thou he is not someone who will rely on pace so age is definitely not something that will stop him and look at his freekicks can anyone match up to his i can only think of nakamura and juninho those are the only that are close to beckham in terms of free kicks ability if i am to say the greatest footballer i would say it is steven gerrard just look at his contribution to liverpool he is no kaka nor ronaldo but he keep it simple and produce always wif his trademark runs Steve McManaman David Beckham Alan Shearer Ronaldo FIFA World Player of the Year Norway national football team FIFA Series FIFA 100 Football (soccer) Manchester United F.C.
