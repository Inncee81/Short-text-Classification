what to look for in a new digital slr i want to get deep into photography and plan on going to college for it we have a casio elixim ev mp point and shoot at the moment it takes good pictures but i want to purchase a digital slr with at least mp i want more control and i want to learn how to use more manual settings and learn more about the different aspects of photography so what should i look for when searching the sites for a camera also is there a good site to get good free classes or information on how to use the manual settings and the overall use of a camera with a digital slr or digital point and shoot congratulations on considering a dslr above all when considering a digital slr you must consider that you will be the person using it day in and day out therefore you must feel comfortable using the camera regardless of megapixels after all if a camera is so uncomfortable to use that it sits in it's case all the time it doesn't matter how nice of a camera it is my first piece of advice to you is to go to your local best buy circuit city etc and actually touch the cameras hold them in your hands and take a few pictures with it adjusting the zoom and focus once you find something you like then start looking at the details if you intend on doing a lot of cropping look for a camera with megapixels or more nikon d x canon digital rebel if that's not a consideration you can save hundreds of dollars by purchasing a camera such as a nikon d which is a six megapixel camera also remember that dslr images are significantly larger files than standard point and shoot camera images upwards of mb each therefore look for a high speed you'll thank yourself later memory card that is either or gb as far as websites for everything digital visit http www kenrockwell com hope this helps Konica Minolta Digital camera Nikon Corporation Leica Canon EOS Single-lens reflex camera Nikon D70 View camera Canon T90 Secure Digital card Photography Digital cinema Digital camera back Rangefinder camera Camera Stereoscopy Nikon FA Cinematography Nikon FE2 Camcorder Panoramic photography Nikon FM2 Advanced Photo System Photographic lens Canon EOS-300D Point and shoot camera Street photography Contax Macro photography Nikon FE Computer Closed-circuit television Zoom lens Movie projector Anamorphic widescreen World Wide Web Mouse (computing) Panavision Nikon FM Binoculars Pentax Supply and demand Depth of field Road-rule enforcement camera Oscilloscope Raw image format Digital circuit Medium format Floppy disk Image file formats Digital image editing Canon EF lens mount Digital Yearbook IBM PC compatible Image Windows Vista Game controller Full frame digital SLR Extreme Programming PlayStation 3 135 film High-definition television Amateur astronomy Starfleet ranks and insignia MAME Television Motion capture Film Spyware Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Charge-coupled device The Inside ITunes Circle of confusion Screenplay Photojournalism Screenshot EXpanded MultiPlayer Computer vision 35 mm film Opportunity rover Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Warez Theory of conduct Uniform Resource Locator Analog-to-digital converter Aperture PlayStation Portable Traditional animation
