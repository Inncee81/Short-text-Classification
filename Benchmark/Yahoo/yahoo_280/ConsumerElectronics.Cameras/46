can someone please tell me which digital slr i should buy the canon eos d or the nikon d there is no better when it comes to those two camera makers both have similar quality both get you outstanding pictures both have a huge array of gadgets that will help to solve some of your photography issues so from a quality point of view you can flip a coin there is however a difference each tends to design their cameras differently so one brand might feel better in your hand than the other for me that's the nikon it's a bit bigger than the canons and i find the key controls slip comfortably under each finger making the camera a joy to use however there are people who say the same about canon too it depends on your hands and what kind of work you do so in the end you have to physically hold each model to determine which you prefer the other difference is historical nikon tends to be more conservative and slower to innovate but in return when a new model of something does come out it's incredible both in quality and functionality canon innovates faster so in any given moment they seem to have more solutions than nikon but by rushing things to market they end up selling things that aren't really fully debugged and working their new stuff works well to be sure but if you wait a few months or a year nikon's version ends up a hell of a lot better nikon also tends to stay away from wizbang stuff canon often builds in features which seem just wonderful to the novice photographer but in fact they are features that you'll never use since there are better ways to achieve the same end still though it sells a lot of cameras since people are taken in by features even when the features have no value nikon doesn't build in stuff that you don't need they put their resources into making sure that what you do need is functional and effective in the end better still depends on what you want to do if you're just into snapshots either brand will give you outstanding quality flip a coin and have fun if you're into more specialized stuff it's not the camera that is the issue it's the lenses and other accessories that are important will they help you achieve the goals you set for yourself better is meeting your specific needs so understand your needs and then come to a decision finally better is whatever feels right for you people who believe a camera should be a solid piece of work and is designed to be easy to operate often prefer nikon people who believe a camera has to be small and light and are willing to accept more cumbersome controls will pick canon and both will tell you that theirs is the best oh yes and what do i use i use a nikon d i started with a d s now replaced by the d and eventually migrated to the d both bodies placed the critical controls under my fingers and both bodies fit comfortably in my hands with the d i never have to go to a menu to turn something on and my eye never has to leave the viewfinder either to me those kinds of things are critical because often seconds count when you re taking a picture i hope this helps a little good luck Leica Konica Minolta Canon T90 View camera Single-lens reflex camera Nikon Corporation Mouse (computing) Nikon FM2 Nikon FA Nikon FE2 Rangefinder camera Stereoscopy Macro photography Nikon D70 Binoculars Cinematography Camera Nikon FE Social rule Photographic lens Floppy disk Computer W.
