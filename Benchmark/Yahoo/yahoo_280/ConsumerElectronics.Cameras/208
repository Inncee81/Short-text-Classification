showing pictures and video so i just got back from a trip to texas and i want to show people all the pictures i took there about what is the best way that i could show these preferably i would like them to be displayed on my tv but i don't have any cables to connect my computer to the tv i've tried burning cd's and putting them into my dvd player but it won't show the video's that i have thanks a lot oh yes and ive tried picasa and for some reason it always fails on the nd disk the reason why no one has answered is probably because you're asking for a lot i know it doesn't sound like it but it is if you want the simplest solution with the least amount of work go buy an mp mp player that is able to display both videos and pictures one that has a cable that goes to the tv of course there are quite a few that can do this trick but none that are all that cheap for example i have a creative zen vision w which i can show pictures and videos on it's large widescreen but i also have the cables to play it on my tv i would not recommend video ipods however since they are very limited in what format the videos have to be in so you'll be back to square one where you're gonna have to figure out how to convert your videos over to the correct ipod format pain in the behind just do a search on how many times this question is asked in yahoo answers going back to my creative zen vision w it'll practically play every format out there so i have no problems going straight from memory card to the player in fact this particular model has a compact flash memory card slot on the device that allows you to load pics and videos directly to the device no computer needed if your camera doesn't use cf cards you can buy cf adapters on ebay for really cheap but like i said that's an expensive solution unfortunately if you don't want to spend a lot of time with software and converting that's what you're stuck with IPod Floppy disk Computer ITunes PlayStation 2 Atari 8-bit family Laserdisc IMac Computer and video games USB flash drive Nintendo GameCube Walkman Secure Digital card Digital audio player PlayStation 3 Gramophone record Digital rights management Xbox Sega Dreamcast High-definition television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Apple Computer DVD Redundant array of independent disks CompactFlash ZX Spectrum Stereoscopy Personal computer Computer hardware Sound card Oscilloscope Apple Macintosh Embedded system FireWire Hard disk IBM PC Game Boy Advance Modem AmigaOS Atari ST Copy protection Ethernet Screenshot Surveillance Slot machine Anamorphic widescreen Wheel of Fortune Mouse (computing) Nintendo DS Apple II family Creative Nomad Amstrad CPC Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows Vista Flash memory Compact disc Photography Enterprise content management MiniDisc Sound Blaster System/36 IBM PC compatible Digital video recorder ITunes Music Store Theory of conduct Karaoke Camcorder RGB color model Podcasting NTSC Acorn Electron Universal Serial Bus Microdrive Sega Saturn Sony Audiophile Extreme Programming Digital cinematography Compact audio cassette IPod nano Apple IIGS IPod shuffle Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Computer bus Vorbis
