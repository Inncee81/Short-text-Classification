can i use other software besides easyshare with my kodak digital camera the camera is a z my os is windows me i use firefox most of the time but also ie in case there's something i could use on line without downloading a program i can use photobucket to get them on line but how can i get them from my camera to my pc to begin with my biggest problems which the two responder's didn't catch was that i have a dinosaur computer me with not enough memory for most free programs and i need freeware because i spent all i have to spare on the camera buying a printer dock or a card reader isn't an option at this time dino has extra usb ports on the front but not a card slot a lot of times when i've downloaded something there was an older version available i could use i just haven't found one for working with photographs the camera is a z if that helps thanks for any suggestions if you get a card reader no additional software is necessary this is not only faster but it saves your camera batteries your computer or printer may even have a card reader built into it i have enough usb ports that i just leave it plugged in all the time first of all be sure there are some pictures on the card plug the card reader into an open usb port plug the card into the appropriate slot on your card reader i use photoshop elements and as soon as i plug my card into the reader it starts its own card reader and displays a thumbnail of every picture on the card if this does not happen automatically open your photo editing software do whatever you usually do to open a file but click on the selector where you can change drives your card reader will be assigned a new drive name that will be one letter higher than you ever saw before such as drive g or such then just double click on the name of the file you want to open and it will appear in your photo editor you can buy various kinds of card readers to accomodate many different memory cards pretty much anywhere that they sell digital cameras even walmart has decent card readers by the major manufacturers IPod USB flash drive Secure Digital card Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family Windows XP AmigaOS Apple Macintosh Bluetooth Apple II family Commodore 64 Mouse (computing) Digital camera Floppy disk Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows Vista PlayStation 3 Computer Apple Computer Sharp Zaurus Xbox IMac FireWire Musical Instrument Digital Interface Digital audio player ZX Spectrum IPAQ CompactFlash Mozilla Firefox Screenshot PlayStation 2 Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Laptop Nintendo DS DVD IBM PC Xbox 360 N-Gage Memory Stick PlayStation Portable PNG Telephone exchange Embedded system XD-Picture Card Computer hardware AlphaSmart TRS-80 Color Computer Sound Blaster Sound card TeX TRS-80 Warez PowerBook Photography Game Boy Nintendo GameCube Copy protection Spyware Flash memory Digital rights management Nintendo Revolution NeXT ITunes Hard disk Computer forensics Timeline of computing 1990-forward File Allocation Table Computer bus Tungsten Handheld Danger Hiptop System/36 Sega Saturn Macromedia Flash Read-only memory Gmail Modem Microsoft Windows Konica Minolta MAME Sega Dreamcast Amiga Nintendo Entertainment System Adobe Photoshop USB mass storage device class IBook Opera (web browser) Multifunction printer Mach kernel Redundant array of independent disks Apple IIGS
