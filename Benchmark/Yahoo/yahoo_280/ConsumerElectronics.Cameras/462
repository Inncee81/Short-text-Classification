zoom problem my camera has digital zoom but when i try to zoom in even a little bit it is so completely out of focus theres no sense in even taking the picture i dont remember if it has always been like that or not so im not sure if its just because its digital or if theres some setting i messed up its a samsung a thanks unfortunately your camera does not have optical zoom it only has digital zoom and that's why your photos look terrible if you use the zoom to get in closer to your subject the only real way to make sure your photos are ok is if you do not use the zoom at all in future when you wish to upgrade to a better camera please make sure it has optical zoom and be sure to never use or activate the digital zoom function good luck Digital camera Leica Zoom lens Konica Minolta Photography Nikon Corporation Modem Anamorphic widescreen View camera Photographic lens Cinematography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Camcorder Macro photography Contax Canon EOS Image Aperture Panoramic photography Mouse (computing) Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Point and shoot camera Camera Motion picture terminology Dolly zoom Single-lens reflex camera Binoculars Canon EF lens mount Tracking shot Digital circuit MIM-23 Hawk Lens (optics) Film Blu-ray Disc Schneider Kreuznach Street photography Photograph Panavision Raw image format Movie camera Rangefinder camera Amateur astronomy Samsung Secure Digital card Late Night with Conan O'Brien Fantasia (film) Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Windows Vista Rendering (computer graphics) Oscilloscope Nintendo 64 Sensor Digital Video Flash memory Enterprise content management Depth of field Digital camera back Electronic journalism Ken Burns Organic light-emitting diode Computer vision Widescreen Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Cable television Motion capture Aliasing Hey Jude Dither High-definition television Autofocus Closed-circuit television File sharing Computer animation CPU design Autostereogram Digital video Super Mario Sunshine Hubble Space Telescope Digital television Personal digital assistant ATI Technologies Circle of confusion Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Copy protection Road-rule enforcement camera Digital cinema Hardware random number generator Universal Serial Bus Camera phone Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Google Maps 16 mm film Federal Standard 1037C The Bill Zeiss Space Mountain Max Headroom
