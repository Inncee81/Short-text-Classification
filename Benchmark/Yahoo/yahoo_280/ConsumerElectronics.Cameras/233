nikon d auto focusing troubles i know that there are problems with the nikon d af but are there any good strategies to get around them the camera is borrowed from school with a sigma mm lens i have tried manual focus but it is very difficult without being able to use the focusing rings etc because the viewfinder does not have them i've had several d 's over the last few years and all hunted for focus points the way i overcame most problems was to try to focus on a strong contrast subject with well defined vertical lines and lock focus exposure by lightly holding the shutter release button down then recompose and shoot that should work i have since gotten rid of all of my d 's and shoot with a d x with the buffer and firmware upgrades the older d x with upgrades blows away most any other nikon body up to a d or d i also use a coolpix for back up with great results but it also suffers somewhat from focus hunting not to the extent of the d though what lens are you using a ed dx this is a soft lens unless it is the very newest production run of about or so Digital photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon T90 Canon EOS Konica Minolta Nikon FE Nikon FM2 Nikon FM Point and shoot camera Leica Nikon FE2 Single-lens reflex camera Photographic lens Movie projector Rangefinder camera Nikon FA Camera Panavision Canon EF lens mount Contax Digital camera Depth of field Nikon D70 Aperture Eye Archery Stereoscopy Canon T70 PlayStation 2 Panoramic photography Twin-lens reflex camera Strategic management Shutter speed Pentax Cinematography Canon FD IMAX Anamorphic widescreen Telescope Canon EOS-300D Street photography Parallax PlayStation Portable Canon Inc.
