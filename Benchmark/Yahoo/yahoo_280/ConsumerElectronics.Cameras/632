is the nikon sb speedlight unit worth buying or should i upgrade to the next step it's an excellent flash that might meet your needs it certainly integrates well with the nikon slr electronics but before you rush out to buy it pause a moment and ask yourself what you need the flash for what is the typical distance you have to cover with the flash when you need to use it what is the typical angle you're trying to cover answering those two questions is crucial the sb is a lovely flash but the distance it can cover is fixed and may not meet your needs have a look at the specs for all three the sb the sb and the sb while the higher models also give you more features as you go up you can also illuminate greater distances your choice of a flash should be determined by the distances you need to cover personally i use an sb on my nikon d slr my attitude is that no matter how powerful the flash is it's never enough i've been in many situations where that turned out to be true however that doesn't mean you have to go for that model today especially if you can't afford it the sb can also be a good slave flash in later years when you do buy a model or two higher it will never go to waste and in the meantime at least you'll have a better range than the one built into the camera i hope this helps a little Digital photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Single-lens reflex camera Konica Minolta View camera Nikon Corporation Nikon FE Leica Canon EOS Nikon FE2 Nikon FM2 Canon T90 Binoculars Secure Digital card Nikon FA Digital camera Contax Nikon FM Supply and demand Bicycle lighting Rangefinder camera Nikon D70 Poker jargon Photography Floppy disk Diamond cut Stereoscopy Full frame digital SLR Items in the Metroid series Central processing unit Light-emitting diode Transformer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Digital camera back Point and shoot camera Zerg Automatic number plate recognition Flash (photography) Pentax Traffic light Escape from New York Species Theodicy Mouse (computing) MS-06 Zaku II GunZ The Duel Embedded system Radar Canon EOS-300D Camera Slide rule Goodness and value theory Tank Oscilloscope Helicopter Determinism FN FAL Serial Life insurance Mars Exploration Rover Artificial neural network USB flash drive Public transport Fluorescent lamp Equine conformation Road-rule enforcement camera Gamma ray burst Flash memory Zeno's paradoxes Electronic amplifier MIM-23 Hawk Explosive material Sound Blaster Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Solar cell Single Transferable Vote Hearing impairment Laptop Wheel of Fortune Galactic Civilizations Galileo spacecraft Open cluster Parallax DVD Homosexuality and Christianity AIM-9 Sidewinder Diesel engine Airport Amiga Stairway Alcoholics Anonymous Surveillance General Dynamics F-111 Panoramic photography Keynesian economics Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Wealth Motorcycle
