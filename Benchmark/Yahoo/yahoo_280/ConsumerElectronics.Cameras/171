rearrange my question on focal length i did not explain myself correctly last night each and every shot i take in properties it shows digital focal length among shutter speed aperture etc want to know in each and every shot i take what would be the equivelent mm focal length with the sony it seemed about right times each digital focal length by to get equivelent mm focal length sensor x optical megapixels what would i times fuji with each shot x optical megapixels and sensor maybe take my old mm nikon fe and compare focal lengths and then times by a certain number antoni and dr sam sorry i did not explain my question correctly last night i posted this in your original question just a few minutes ago but here it is again for convenience your e has a sensor measuring about mm x mm the sensor to compare with measures mm x mm divide the larger length by the smaller length then do the same for width and the discrepancy is due to differing aspect ratios the smaller sensor being while the larger one is for differing aspect ratios the length multiplier is normally used to calculate the mm equivalent and in the case of a sensor that's it's actually but what's a few decimals Digital photography Photography Pixel Photographic lens Aperture Eyepiece Aberration in optical systems Panoramic photography Decibel Sensor View camera Cinematography Leica Digital camera back Konica Minolta Movie projector Pi Antenna (radio) Aspect ratio (image) Floppy disk Depth of field Clementine mission Radar Numeral system Advanced Photo System Binoculars Telescope Film speed Canon T90 Reflecting telescope Lens (optics) Shutter speed Fuel injection Nikon FM2 Macro photography Digital camera Optical fiber Magnification Continued fraction Napier's bones Camcorder Golden ratio Optical telescope Zoom lens Angular resolution Normal distribution Hipparchus (astronomer) Trigonometric function Camera Digital circuit Motion capture Metric system Special relativity Units of measurement Exposure (photography) Gravity Nikon Corporation Single-lens reflex camera Four Thirds System Huygens probe Binary numeral system Anamorphic widescreen Hard disk Circuit design Digital cinema Resistor Widescreen Pinhole camera Angle Vedic mathematics Shutter (photography) Canon EOS Gear ratio Specific impulse Nikon FA GED DV Piezoelectricity Nikon FE2 Vector (spatial) Diffraction Nintendo GameCube Solar variation Speed of light Synthetic aperture radar Elementary arithmetic Panavision Pentax Computer numbering formats Scientific notation Planetary orbit Nikon D70 Point and shoot camera Eye Charge-coupled device
