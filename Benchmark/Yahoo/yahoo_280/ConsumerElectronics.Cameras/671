why use the same answer for everything i will be the first to admit that i use a series of standard answers but why do some people insist on giving the same freaking answer to every question they respond to whether it makes any sense to use that answer or not i'm not talking about tomtom's my suggestion answer either he uses that when someone asks the ubiquitous best camera answer and frankly it's usually the most appropriate answer i'm talking about people who name their camera and all of its features when someone asks how to take a picture without shaking or if they can have fries with that order why not use boilerplate answers when it makes sense and skip the question if you are going to just repeat the same drek whether it actually contributes anything or not i really ought to get some sleep good answer jt antoni i do that in my real profession also i will answer many many questions for my patients after all it's their body and they deserve information to help them make a choice about their treatment some people ask so many what if questions though when they get to what i call the rd generation 'what if' scenario i finally say if you want every possible answer about what might happen with every possible outcome of this treatment you will just have to go to dental school for yourself teef roll over my icon and you'll see that i am no longer a top contributor in cameras answers a day with half then being best isn't enough so i don't worry about it you picked up on my main concern it's not the laziness but the thought that someone thinks they got a real answer and might buy the wrong camera gunn r we get that here all the time if i recommend a canon s is over a digital concepts x digital zoom only something or other for someone who wants an ultrazoom camera i might be chosen as the best answer by the asker but they comment that they decided to buy the dc camera because it fits in their pocket they were just hoping to get at least one answer to support the bad decision that they already made george i hope you are saving your answers in a test file instead of searching out old answers on line in case you had not thought of that i'm trying to cut down on my addiction this place by moving on to only certain questions and leaving the routine to so many others who answer them so well sometimes i can't help myself though haha saranghamnida you are right i don't get angry with the people who ask the same question and i don't even get angry with the people who ask us to answer exam questions for them as far as they are concerned they have gone to the internet for an answer maybe they don't even know how to search for the information they want so they just come here it is presented as a resource so that's what we are tomtom nice move trying to improve the place i'm sure yahoo sent you a canned answer in return for your suggestion like i said i have no problem with canned answers as long as they make sense for the question you are right that people need to look at a camera selector if they have no clue what they are even looking for especially if they can't even give us general idea about their interests ability and budget i love the ones who say they want the best camera in the world and money is no object as long as it is less than how can we ferret out an answer with nothing to go on i think an earlier answer said it best to many this is just a game to accumulate points so they answer for only that reason and in this case it doesn't matter what they say they still get their two points now as to the rest of us it's not fair to assume that everyone actually understands the questions sometimes a question is rather subtle and unless you read between the lines it's not always clear what is really being asked some can be forgiven i think for not aswering those kinds of questions fully perhaps some too are a bit sore about the nature of some of the questions and retaliate by sending the same stock answer all the time one of my peeves in terms of answers is the nature of the answers i've seen many questions that will ask for a choice and finish with a plea for a reason or rationale it irritates me to see answers like i prefer the canon and that's it this doesn't help anyone after all that writer is just expressing his personal opinion and without the rationale behind that opinion the reader cannot judge the legitimacy of the answer sometimes perhaps a writer misses the why part but i suspect instead they don't have an answer or they're too lazy to provide one and of course when the why part isn't included it rarely occurs to anyone to provide a rationale that said though i also agree with an earlier answer that people do what they've already decided to do rather than what's best and that they often use this forum simply to find someone who agrees for a while i was top contributor to family relationships where you can find some really heart rending issues i usually offer an opinion and always a rationale most of the time that reply was ignored completely while they agreed with a two or three word answer that happened to fit with their view of the world and what it was they wanted to do so in a sense those who provide the one word answers also perform a useful service they bless what some people want to do who simply want a blessing from someone after all how can we respond to a question like should i go for the pink one or the blue one hello what does the colour of the camera have to do with its ability to take pictures if you try to answer that though they'll still go for the one word answer pink or blue and completely ignore the lengthy diatribe you've provided to help them avoid a mistake at the same time i see a lot of my camera is broken questions and the typical responses to those is get it fixed even when the individual is asking for an explanation of what might be wrong with it this too is totally useless obviously it may have to be fixed the question was what might be wrong with it this too is irritating it doesn't help the person asking and it doesn't help anyone else who happens to read that question in hope of a reply that might educate them too however i'll admit using the one line get it fixed earns points again for those who aren't too concerned about actually assisting and it takes minimal effort and time then there are questions where the writer genuinely is trying to understand a concept there too come the one line answers i recall a recent question asking what slow sync was the intent was to understand the concept and when to use it one answer simply said it's for low light situations that doesn't address the issue it teaches nothing but again it does earn the writer two points at least that particular question had a few additional queries too that this answer totally ignored on the whole there are genuine people out there with a genuine need for some comprehensive information and many have already tried other sources for the answer it's a given that there will always be people replying to earn points or to push whatever their personal agenda happens to be but then that's life anyway it doesn't just happen here so we can take solice that at least some of us recognize the needs expressed and try our best to fulfill the need even when it costs a half hour or an hour to be comprehensive those of us who do that may not earn the big points and we are often ignored in the end too but it's not only the asker who reads the responses those responses will help others in addition to the asker so it's time well spent i think even if there is no other reward in the process however isn't helping others as best we can all the reward that's needed i think so alas there's just not enough people in this forum who happen to think like that so most of the answers will be stock answers or one liners until there is Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Consensus decision-making
