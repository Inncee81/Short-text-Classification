is it better to have a uv filter or a polarizer filter on a digital slr polarizers cause too much light loss to be left on the lens all the time they have their use but not as an all purpose protective filter if you're as ham fisted as i am a uv filter is invaluable as a means of keeping nasty fingerprints off the front elements of lenses also since i use prime lenses and am constantly changing lenses a uv filter allows me to just shove a lens back into the bag without having to fumble around with the front cap with that said though uv filters have absolutely no effect on the image when used with a digital camera as dr sam's example photo so nicely illustrates there are two reasons for this unlike film which is very uv sensitive digital sensors both ccd and cmos have virtually no uv sensitivity thus if there is any uv reaching the sensor it's not likely to be recorded glass is generally virtually opaque to uv even without any special treatment so lenses themselves generally won't let through very much light in particular most lenses will block any light with a wavelength shorter than nm since nm is the aproximate cutoff for visible light only uv radiation in the nm nm near uv range could reach the ccd or film in any case if you're shooting film and at high altitudes where there is more uv please see the below link for information regarding the effectiveness of various uv filters on the market to make a long story short though the tiffen haze filter is the most effective filter at blocking light in the nm nm range Digital photography Digital camera Charge-coupled device Ultraviolet Clementine mission Digital single-lens reflex cameras View camera Filter (optics) Galileo spacecraft Polarization Contax Telescope Stereoscopy Macro photography Observational astronomy Cassini-Huygens Cinematography Photography Digital camera back Canon EOS Pixel Glasses Microscopy Infrared Loudspeaker Federal Standard 1037C Leica Movie projector Foveon X3 sensor Camcorder Light-emitting diode Anamorphic widescreen Optical coherence tomography Sensor Single-lens reflex camera Holography Photographic film Antenna (radio) Optical coating Filter (photography) Eyepiece Radar Photographic lens Aperture Full frame digital SLR Color Nuclear explosion Zoom lens Astronomy Color blindness Konica Minolta Traffic light Eye F-number Electromagnetic spectrum Sunglasses Photograph Depth of field Incandescent light bulb Analog-to-digital converter X-ray Film speed Vignetting Sun Digital cinematography Technicolor Advanced Photo System Gamma ray burst Barcode reader Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Reflecting telescope Sewage treatment Pinhole camera Exposure (photography) Computer vision Enlarger Diode Liquid crystal display Stage lighting Panoramic photography Laser Light Low-pass filter Microphone Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 Digital cinema Gamut Raman spectroscopy Aberration in optical systems Electromagnetic radiation Radiation hardening Polymethyl methacrylate Monochromator
