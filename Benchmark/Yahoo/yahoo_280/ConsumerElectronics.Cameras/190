i need help finding a digital slr camera with good zoom i am looking to buy a digital slr camera the problem is i want to keep the costs fairly low prefer under but want a good brand and a good zoom i want to use it primarily for sports photography including baseball games where i will be sitting in the stands probably about ft from the dugout maybe feet from home plate and i would like to get good pictures of batters and baserunners it will also be used a lot at hockey games so i would like a zoom that could cover a pretty good distance and get me close to the action is this possible with that kind of budget i am willing ot spend more only if that budget won't get my anything worthwhile thanks for your help look into a nikon d bundled with the lens this range should be good for the vantage point you have described you can get them for at b h photo and add a or gb card and come in well under your budget the d will give you a burst speed of frames per second this is not really a blazing rate but for the money you are not going to get fps that really serious sports cameras provide the good news is that nikon claims you can take an unlimited number of frames as the buffer will be able to dump to the card faster than you can load it up with images be sure to get a decent speed card though i'd get a sandisk extreme iii or lexar professional x and i'd get at least gb if you plan on doing a lot of burst mode shooting edit fhotoace has suggested a longer lens since he makes his living doing this please give his answer all due consideration i just thought you were within reasonably close range as if you were not in a major league ball park and the equiv would be adequate your budget is actually my main consideration and you'll have to do the best you can with what you can afford i have a lens that would be great but there are two problems one it seems that you can only buy the d with a lens and not the body alone so you have to choose the best for your needs two if you wanted to add the lens to the basic kit even if you went for the mid level non vr lens it would add to your cost combine this with the cheaper kit and you'd spend closer to by the time you bought a decent card if you can do this it's worth considering i think you might try the for one season and save your money for an additional lens so you can get the vr lens a real help with those longer focal lengths for more like end of edit here's my stock recommendation for the d there is some duplication here with the material above that i wrote specifically for you so just skip any parts that sound familiar nikon d the nikon d is a great little camera very easy to use and quite reasonably priced it has a few consumer friendly totally automatic modes that make it very easy to use including a child photo mode but still offers total photographic control when you are ready to take charge it will get you in the nikon family which is a great place to be if you buy accessories and lenses you will be able to use everything on any nikon that you might upgrade to later on check out nikon's picturetown promotion where they handed out d 's in georgetown sc http www stunningnikon com picturetown here are a few reviews in case you have not read them yet be sure to note that they are several pages long and some of the reviews also have some sample images that you can look at http www dpreview com reviews nikond http www steves digicams com reviews nikon d html http www popphoto com cameras camera test nikon d html http www kenrockwell com nikon d d recommendations htm i hate to see people slam the camera because it can't autofocus with older nikon lenses it is true that there is a slight problem with older nikon lenses not autofocusing on the d but if you do not own a bag full of older lenses it is not going to be a problem it is barely a problem anyhow if you check www nikonusa com for af s lenses which are all compatible with the d you will find lenses including vr vibration reduction lenses and one true macro lens with vr there are another plus lenses in the current catalog that provide all functions except autofocus as well as many possibly dozens out of print lenses that will work just as well in addition although these lens will not autofocus most of them will still give focus confirmation from the d manual if the lens has a maximum aperture of f of faster the viewfinder focus indicator can be used to confirm whether the portion of the subject in the selected focus area is in focus after positioning the subject in the active focus area press the shutter release button halfway and rotate the lens focusing ring until the in focus indicator is displayed see http www members aol com swf nikonafs txt for a list of af s lenses or see http www nikonians org cgi bin dcforum dcboard cgi az read count om forum dcforumid for even more the d only has autofocus zones arranged horizontally at the center o'clock and o'clock positions this might be considered a limitation but realistically most people will find this perfectly adequate especially if you are moving up from a point and shoot with only a center zone there is no status lcd on top of the camera but nikon chose to use the rear lcd for this information this is actually a nice move as the display is bigger than the top display and you aren't using the read lcd for anything before you take the picture anyway this is not a step backwards and it actually makes sense to me you can get the d with the kit lens at b h photo available through yahoo shopping or at for june add a lexar platinum x speed card for or gb for or get the d with lens and gb lexar card for this is a decent lens and it is very versatile you will find it suitable for pretty much anything you want to do other than really long telephoto shots it will let you explore the range of focal lengths to decide where to start filling in your lens collection if you don't want to buy any more lenses this one will carry you through pretty much everything b h also have used d 's with the lens from Film Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation Portable Laserdisc Camera
