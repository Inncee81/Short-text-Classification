i need to buy a digital camera which is better canon powershot a or kodak easyshare c any info helps i want to take nice pictures but im not into it hardcore i have come down to choosing between the kodak easyshare c and the canon powershot a any information that can help me choose either one of these would be great or if someone has any advice on me getting another digital camera in the price range of would be helpful as well thanks you have done your homework because you have found two very comparable and excellent cameras to me the tiebreaker would be the lack of an optical viewfinder on the kodak i would buy the canon here's my speech on that topic i lament the passing of the optical viewfinder and i would choose almost any camera with an optical viewfinder over one that only has an lcd viewfinder why you never have the option of turning off the lcd and these things eat batteries for lunch and spit them out why do away with the option of a viewfinder that has zero electrical drain it can be difficult to see the image on an lcd in bright sunlight even if they are new and improved you have to hold an lcd viewer out at some distance in front of your face this is more conspicuous than i prefer to be all the time the need to hold a camera at arms length will introduce some shake i like the idea of stabilizing a camera against my face when i am taking a picture this is especially important with a longer zoom lens no wonder image stablization or vibration reduction is necessary with these cameras not that there's anything wrong with is or vr but it is really a requirement with lcd viewfinders and telephoto lenses using the lcd to view photos after you've taken them slows down the camera quite a bit you can't shut of the lcd monitor and still take pictures if you don't have an optical viewfinder Leica Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photography Contax View camera Konica Minolta Liquid crystal display Binoculars Canon EOS Photographic lens Canon T90 Single-lens reflex camera Stereoscopy Canon EF lens mount Movie projector Cinematography Digital camera Zoom lens Canon PowerShot G Panavision Camcorder Panoramic photography Closed-circuit television Macro photography Nikon Corporation Oscilloscope Camera Parallax IMAX Hubble Space Telescope Widescreen Light-emitting diode Bluetooth Amateur astronomy Canon FD Road-rule enforcement camera Mouse (computing) Digital camera back Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Eye Canon Inc.
