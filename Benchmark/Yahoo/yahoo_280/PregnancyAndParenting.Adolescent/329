umm i'm pregnant well i'm and i kinda fell pregnant after my boyfriend got me drunk i don't know what to do and i don't want to tell my mum until i have decided i could never abort a baby simply because i just wouldn't be able to cope if i did i cry if i kill a fly or accidentally squash a bug you're going to have to tell her at some point if you are truly pregnant you need to have medical attention in the next few weeks it is very vital to the baby and for yourself because you are so young if you are able to carry the baby full term i would suggest looking into adoption there are many couples out there who are unable to have children and would love to raise a little baby Knots Landing Pregnancy EastEnders Friends Abortion debate Miscarriage Abortion Abortion in the United States Charmed Neighbours Days of our Lives About a Boy Kodocha Adoption Sami Brady Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infant Tracy Barlow Breastfeeding Drawn Together History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Journey (band) One Life to Live Prisoner (TV series) Everwood Characters of Lost Past characters (Neighbours) Prenatal diagnosis Premature birth Sex and the City Pro-choice Sharon Tate Roe v.
