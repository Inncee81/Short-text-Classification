is this normal for a yr old im and will be in months but my question is is it normal for a yr old girl to wanna be a playboy girl lately ive been seriously putting soem thought in to it and i really wanna do it so is it normal and also for the teenagers have any of yall heard of a website by the name of bebo just wonderign i have one and just wanted to see if any oen else did just wondering ive been thinkig about it alot lately and even though im young still im mature for my age this is just a carreer ive been seriously thinking about and i dotn know why but i really wanna do it and also for the teenagers out there have any of you heard of a web site by the name of bebo just wondering i have one and just wanted to see how may others have one also well umm a palyboy model is something i really wanna do and my dad left so he doesnt even know me anymore so he cuold care a less and also i know some people may find it degradign but i love posing for the camera and btw i most sertainly want to go to college theres no doubt about it i will get my degree wether i go on magazine covers later on in life i realize its sluty but for me strange reason i think thats why i like it maybe because no one would ever think shy me would pose nude even though deep down in side theres another person that no one can see once you are eighteen years of age it will be entirely your choice of whether or not you would like to be a playboy playmate this is of course assuming playboy magazine has invited you to be a playmate just understand you will be a playmate for one month only yes you will be paid yes your photographs will be in the magazine for one month but that's it unless you become a famous playmate like anna nicole smith or jenny mccarthy or become playmate of the year your career pretty much ends after your month in the magazine also understand any photos videos recordings public appearances etc associated with playboy will be the sole property of playboy they will be able to use your photos etc in any way they see fit for the rest of your life and beyond and they will not need your permission nor will they necessarily pay you in short if you get the chance to be a playmate you will have all the fun of being a playmate for a short time but most likely will not have a career the only way you will have a career with playboy as a playmate is if hugh hefner and playboy magazine think you should and if you do get to have that career they can decide to end your career at any time Playboy (magazine) Karen McDougal Pamela Anderson Jenny McCarthy Victoria Zdrok Spice Girls Marilyn Monroe Bettie Page Anna Nicole Smith Paris Hilton Playboy Special Edition Patricia Ford Nicole Marie Lenz Summer Altice Avenue Q Jon Secada Suzi Simpson Linn Thomas Lindsey Vuolo Britney Spears Shannon Tweed Jayne Mansfield LaToya Jackson Petra Verkaik Barbi Benton Nudity Teri Weigel Cliff Richard Kelly Monaco Lisa Marie Scott Dawson's Creek Hugh Hefner The Playboy Mansion James Bond uncollected short stories Corinna Harney Gia Carangi I Want to Hold Your Hand Sharon Tate One Tree Hill (TV series) FHM Stewie Griffin Carmella DeCesare Drew Barrymore Gwen Stefani Social rule Kimberly Page Rebekka Armstrong Kylie Minogue Weezer Neko Case Pornography Paulina Porizkova Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Madonna (entertainer) Carrie Westcott The Emancipation of Mimi Incarnations of Immortality Stephanie Adams About a Boy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Scenes from a Memory The Jackson 5 Lewis Carroll Photography Earth Girl Arjuna Duran Duran Hilary Duff Shae Marks Naomi Campbell Bob Guccione Kodocha Nude celebrities on the Internet Sharon Stone Abortion debate My Life as a Teenage Robot Robbie Williams Mandy Moore Past teachings of Prem Rawat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles W.I.T.C.H.
