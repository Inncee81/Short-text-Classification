i'm so frustrated why do i feel this way there are a lot of times when i feel like i want to have a baby in order to stop my period for months my periods are horrible i have cramping headaches dizziness and a flow that causes me to have to change a tampon and a super maxi pad every two hours or so and on top of that it lasts for a week i've thought about birth control but my mom just blows off that there is a problem and tells me it will get better so there's no other way that i can get it i'm any suggestions i take advil and other pain killers for the pain even though they don't help much sweetie i have had horrible periods since i was and i think you should probably ask your mom to make you a doctor's appointment talk it over with a doctor and you may find some answers i know how you feel and i've been through it certainly the answer is not to have a baby babies are a huge responsibility and not one to be taken lightly i'm sure your doctor will be able to help try talking to your mom calmly and asking her if you can go to the doctor and ask him about it my parents took me more seriously when i asked to go to the doctor because i hated doctors and they knew if i felt bad enough to see a doctor then something needed to be done good luck and keep us updated on what happens i'll be thinking of you Menstrual cycle Sanitary towel Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Humphrey Bogart Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story EastEnders Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
