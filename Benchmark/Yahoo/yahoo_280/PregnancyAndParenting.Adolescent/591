this is just something i'm wondering about not something i'm going to do i know that teenagers who get pregnant on purpose are stupid and need reality checks but what if a teen got pregnant on accident like if their birth control didn't work or something would you still think they were bad people do you think it's fair that some teenagers get treated badly for making a mistake i dont think that any teenager who gets pregnant is a bad person really i jus think if it's planned it may be a bad idea or not the best situation for the baby every child on this earth is a blessing from god whether that child belongs to a married couple or to a young teenage girl i wish more people saw it the way i do Pregnancy Situation comedy EastEnders Teenage pregnancy One Tree Hill (TV series) Days of our Lives Marriage Phoebe Halliwell Lucille Ball Hollyoaks Runaways (comics) Incarnations of Immortality Friends Jennifer Lopez Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Infantilism Abortion debate Horus Adolescence Neighbours Mr. T Birth control Married... with Children Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rocko's Modern Life Diana Ross Alois Hitler Mama's Family Street-Legal Joseph Jackson Teen drama Full House Anne Boleyn Lex Luthor Knots Landing Rais massacre One Life to Live The Golden Girls Charmed Randy Jackson (musician) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sharon Tate Donna Summer Goodness and value theory Prenatal diagnosis Series finale Ayyavazhi mythology Little Britain Father's Day (Doctor Who) Kim Possible Statutory rape History of sex Roe v.
