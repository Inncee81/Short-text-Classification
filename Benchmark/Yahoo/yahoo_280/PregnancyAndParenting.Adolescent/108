why does everyone believe that teen dads are not responsible i mean i'm sixteen and i have a four month old son everyone i've told is always like you're too young or the first thing that they ask is if i ever spend time with him i don't live with him but i spend as much time as i can with him but i have a job and send money to the mother i read through the other answers before i started this just to remind some of them just because a condom is used does not mean that you still can't get pregnant no birth control is effective i admire you for making the decision to help take care of your baby it is true that most teen dads are not responsible enough for that i've known some that couldn't properly take care of a tank of fish just keep in mind that you will always get some smart mouth saying something stupid by staying in your babies life and being a caring parent shows that you are older then your years age is just a number good luck One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Abortion debate Social rule Humphrey Bogart Kyle Broflovski Sharon Tate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Care Bears Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Condom Kate Vaiden Kurt Cobain Rocko's Modern Life Alois Hitler Childbirth Radio Yerevan About a Boy I Am Sam Joke Kodocha Hollyoaks Laura Schlessinger Knots Landing Birth control Phoebe Halliwell The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pregnancy Breastfeeding The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Married... with Children Days of our Lives Charmed Teenage pregnancy Infantilism Peter Griffin Saved by the Bell Jon Secada Wonderland (McFly album) Identity Crisis (comics) Pitaten Everwood The Catcher in the Rye Sex education Shaggy dog story Simone Weil Great Depression Father's Day (Doctor Who) Trouble (comic) Emperor Xuan of Han Good Times Earth Girl Arjuna History of As the World Turns (2000-present) The Fairly OddParents The Amber Spyglass Paradox Fertility awareness Kender Wolfrider Game show Suspicion (film) Lorelai Gilmore Adoption American Dad!
