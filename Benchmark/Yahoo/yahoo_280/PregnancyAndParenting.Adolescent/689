what do you think there's this gal that i like and have told her how i felt last year but she said she just wanna be friends however now i feel that some things have changed recently she showed more interests and there were more conversations between us there's this guy who asked her for bowling tomorrow but when his pal asked her about it i think it s about that if not what else she was just like acting stupid and said 'don't know' and they ve been asking this for a few days and every time she seemed rather clueless during break his pal was like bugging her and saying pity him lah later he'll cry and peered thru the window trying to communicate with her and when he mentioned the boy's name who liked her she just ignored him and gave a 'you're crazy' look seemed irritated and used her hand to signal that he s crazy then there's this classmate of mine who took her thing and gave it to this boy who passed by the room and she seemed so angry about it they rarely talk now never or at least much much much less than they used to a few months ago and this bowling plan i don't know how it's going what do you think of her behavior to this guy who likes her well it sounds to me like she doesnt really like him she ignores him and his friends and that is a bad sign it seems like she is getting aggravated with his friends if they are the ones who are asking her out for him then a girl gets really turned off about that because he should be a man and ask her himself maybe she is waiting for you to say something since there is more chemistry between you guys now i think you should just sit her down and have a heart to heart talk on if she likes him or what Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Friends The Shining (film) The Ashlee Simpson Show Phoebe Buffay's songs Cliff Richard Blonde on Blonde Teen Girl Squad Social rule Great Teacher Onizuka Kodocha Salad Fingers She Loves You The Catcher in the Rye Knots Landing The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Singlish Kim Possible Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ren and Stimpy Rod Stewart Conspiracy (TNG episode) Eric Cartman Humphrey Bogart Beavis and Butt-head Full Metal Panic?
