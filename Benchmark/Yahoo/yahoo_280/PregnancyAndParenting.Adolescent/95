i am and he is we slept together but did nothing is this wrong my mom is yelling we slept one night together at his home his mom is also yelling why do they think soo bad he is a very responsible guy should i really get my mom's as well his mom's permission to stay together i know they will not allow did you ask permission to have a sleepover i would not be in a rush because if you two stay together there will be time later on to get your own place i can see why she's upset if she didn't know it was a sleepover next time i suggest getting sleeping bags and sleeping next to each other on the floor that way you can still talk or whatever and the adults won't think you are having sex explain to them that this was a mistake you know you will not have sex or get pregnant but they do not know that no amount of persuading will completely convince them so try to compromise you should be able to stay together though the relationship is not harmful mentally or physically so there is no reason to end it 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Child sexuality Stewie Griffin EastEnders Abortion debate Boston Public Recurring South Park characters Pok__mon Live!
