i'm and have chronic pain i have complex regional pain syndrome relfex sympathetic dystrophy in my right leg i'm super frustrated because i feel so different from any other teens what can i do to help feel more comfortable and to help explain to my friends other teens when i'm in severe pain i've had my rsd crps for almost years and i've had many many treatments done which all have failed i have also been in phsysical theraphy which made my pain get worse and begin to spread i think you and i both know how difficult it is to live with rsd especially at our ages i'm pretty sure that i don't have any great advice on feeling comfortable in high school with this disease as i never achieved that particular victory however i did survive and graduate from high school and college as well with rsd over the years my approach has changed somewhat in high school i really didn't know how to let people know when i was in pain now i sometimes don't say anything and i sometimes just say something like my leg hurts when i feel it's necessary i guess i've decided that i'd rather not make a big deal out of it if i can avoid doing so like you i feel that it separates me and not so much in a good way sometimes it's unavoidable like if i need to ask if a certain activity is doable for me or if i need to explain why i have trouble walking then i generally tell people that i have a neurological problem with my leg if they want to know more i explain a little bit and tell them what it's called in nine cases out of ten people are fine with the first explanation my really close friends know more of course and i can tell them when i'm having a bad day ususally they can tell just by how i'm acting or how i'm walking i've explained it all to them pretty thoroughly and although they can't fully understand what it's like they accept that i know what i'm capable of and what i need part of this acceptance is simply maturity because i'm a few years older than you so are my friends and they've learned to accept what is different high schoolers are a little more judgmental which is a difficulty i encountered when i was your age and younger right now i'm in the position of having to decide how much about rsd to divulge to my new coworkers and the kids i will soon be responsible for as a part of my work a few know a bit and i think that they have all started to realize that there's something wrong with my leg i'm not sure if or when i'll go into detail about what rsd is right now i'm just careful about guarding my leg and my responses to pain when that fails i hope this helped a little bit remember you can talk to me about this stuff anytime you want you have my email address right b Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.
