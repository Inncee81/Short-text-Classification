i'm wondering what to do to about so many young pregnant girls adolescents and parents what can we all do do to avoid this to keep happening don't you think is preocupant to see the amount of questions like can i be pregnant am i pregnant what to do i'm adolescent and i am pregnant can we all talk about it i am a mother of a twelve year old boy and i don't want him to have to deal with this kind of situation and any of his friends either but i don't know how to talk about it with him i don't know what to say adolescents what can i do help me and let's help other young people please it is good that you bring this subject up yes young people will have sex and obviously nothing is going to stop them from expressing their feelings i feel that there should be a talk from either the parents or sex education in schools about different forms of birth control my mom as akward as it was talked to me about sex and told me how it was done and such when i was young around when i asked it was very simple and she stressed to me that it was ok to want to know i was shocked to find out what it was but i appreciated my mom being honest with me later when i was around i had a serious boyfriend she came in my room and told me about the whole urges thing that they are natural and that having them is not bad after that she told me that when i was ready to act on these urges to protect myself she told me about condoms and how they worked and the pill she also told me that whenever i felt ready to have sex i could come to her and she would take me to get put on the pill well around a year later i felt ready and had yet another uncomfortable talk with my mom she wasn't mad or anything she actually gave me a hug and told me she was proud of me for being responsible we went and around a year after being on them i became sexually active i never became pregnant but if my mom had never told me i proably would be or would have been by now there is no way to get past the uncomfortable stage in this it's odd becuase it's your kid and it's odd for them because you are mom and such words as penis condoms and sex are never to be said by mom right wrong as gross as it is kids will appreciate that they can come to you with this stuff most learn it from their friends one of my friends said two condoms were better than one so you can see that the information gained at school is not right let them know you wont be angry with them if they so choose to ask questions or want to become sexually active and don't by being open with them it may gross them out a bit but be sure to talk to your kids about it i love my mom even more for being there for me and letting me know it was ok that i wasn't dirty and giving me information in fact all my friends were jealouse because their parents simply told them you have sex you get aids std's death kicked out of the house pregnant which can be true or go to hell this doesn't make them stop it just makes them not come to you until it's too late just let him know that it will be odd and you know it's not something you want to hear from mom but it's better that it is you before he has sex than you after he has a girl pregnant good luck Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha EastEnders Avenue Q Birth control Sex education Kyle Broflovski Theory of conduct Sexual abstinence Oral sex Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Milton H.
