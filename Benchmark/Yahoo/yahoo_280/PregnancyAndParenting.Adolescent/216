how do i make my parents allow me to have long hair i'm years old boy i live in the philippines but i study in an international school i know my parents will want me to have a haircut soon even if my hair isn't even considered long i need some kind of argument that would tell them to allow me i'm an honor student and i've not done anything wrong at all i believe they are becoming unreasonable i need things to say you know you're right you should be able to represent yourself in any way you want it's your body however you aren't and parents seem to think that they own you until you are therefore it would be advisable to simply ask them for a legitimate reason why you can't keep it long my guess is that they won't be able to come up with a good reason because there really isn't one maybe once you cause them to realize this they'll be more reasonable good luck Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Ranma __ characters Kender Ontological argument Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Childlove movement Pitaten Abortion debate Drug test Intelligent design movement Economics One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Friends Friedrich Schleiermacher Kodocha Value system The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Teach the Controversy Normal distribution Great Teacher Onizuka Hair Goodness and value theory Badly Drawn Kitties Negima Singlish About a Boy Bernard Williams Soul Lincoln-Douglas Debate The Price Is Right School choice Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sampling (music) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Class (computer science) Speed limit Utilitarianism Marriage Fathers' rights Circumcision Pubic hair Autism rights movement Spanking Password Warez Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Haven (TNG episode) Separation of church and state Quicksort The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Theodicy Haircut Judicial review Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Baroque chess Franz Boas Ex-gay Milton H.
