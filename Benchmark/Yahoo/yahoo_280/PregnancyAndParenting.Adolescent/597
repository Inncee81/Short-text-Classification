new school this year i'm going to be a freshman and i'm a bit nervous because a i'm starting high school and b i only know like people in my grade when i'm around new people or really just nervous i sort of lose my ability to talk and when i do say things they end up being really stupid things to say i know that you're supposed to be outgoing when you meet new people but i'm worried that that might give a bad first impression would it just be better if i was just quiet until i knew people was comfortable with them any advice all answers are really appreciated thanks aha youd be surprised to see how many friends you make if you talk just dont sound abnoxious and dont interrupt others and try not to talk about yourself too much sorry if that sounded rude im gonna be a freshman too im sooo excited good luck Social rule Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Piccolo Junior Saga 1957 World Series The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Avenue Q Pitaten Shit Haven (TNG episode) The nature of God in Western theology AFI 100 Years series EastEnders Nico Robin The Emancipation of Mimi 2000 Australian Grand Prix Can't Hardly Wait The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Richard Feynman Milton H.
