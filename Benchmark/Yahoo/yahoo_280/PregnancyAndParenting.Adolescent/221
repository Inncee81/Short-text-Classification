what would make me feel better about my improvished childhood not really improvished i just didn t get w wanted i wanted to play soccer for community center and karate i never told my dad where i could make friends in my stupid state i m know intelligent and hardly make friends all my parents did was either take my traveling all the time my dad isolating me from my peers or making me reject all the classes my mom plans for me my dad or force me to study with a harsh tongue my mom i felt like i wasted all those time i also think in my intelligent state i can t do anything useful or what i want to do and learn etc don t need anyone to tell me about that my mom also heard me complain too much already actually my life isn't improvished i just feel bad for myself and feel like everyone's parents are better than mine even though i know thats not true my parents are the exact oppossite to each other but each are stubborn isolated too demanding just like how some parents should be they are divcorced i forgot what i was about to say but anyways give me feed back i had the same problem when i was little except instead of traveling it was because my mom would voice all her questions you don't want to do this do you so i would say no so i grew up without a lot of friends and without doing anything once you start a new school like high school or college you can be more free to join things you otherwise wouldn't have also if your family is religious you can try joining a youth group or something to meet other people and do fun stuff find things you are interested in and try to get involved in them so you will meet other people who are interested volunteer to help others and you might meet other cool people doing the same Social rule Friends Kodocha Pitaten Shaggy dog story Kender Recurring South Park characters Mr. and Mrs. Turner The Fairly OddParents Garfield The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Kurt Cobain Transsexuality One Tree Hill (TV series) Cindy Sheehan The Ashlee Simpson Show The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Grandview, U.S.A.
