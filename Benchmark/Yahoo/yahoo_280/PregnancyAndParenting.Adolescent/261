any adults please help me so i'm a highschool student and i'm going pretty good in school but theres alot of creative stuff i love doing like i love writing fiction and poetry and i really like music and singing my teachers have pulled me after class several times and told me i should pursue writing or music or whatnot when i was older so i've been thinking about collage and i feel like theres only two choices to go to a university when i'm done highschool become a journalist or something fuhgetabout writing and music when i'm done highschool to give being a novelist a shot or try to get a demo cd for my band and if i don't succeed after about ten years or so then go to collage and get a real job i would love to do both but i can't since collage and a to job are both so time consuming i'm really confused right now can you please give me advice you can do both attend the university of your choice definitely you will be surrounded by plenty of creative influences use those influences to develop your interest writing or music in your 'spare' time if neither pan out you will have an educational background and hopefully a degree to use as a safety net Education in Romania Time Out of Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show Paul McCartney Secondary education in France Thomas M.
