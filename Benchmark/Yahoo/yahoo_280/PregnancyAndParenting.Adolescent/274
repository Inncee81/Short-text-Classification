could she get pregnant im scared well i was getting a handjob from my lady an then i came into a napkin but a little got on my hands an part of my fin gers then i wiped the cum off with a napkin like minutes later i began finger her with that same hand later i started to wonder whether i had completely cleaned off the sprem iunno wut can i do im scared cud she have gotten pregnant should i wait an see if she gets her period or tell her to take a morning after pill although it is slightly possible it's highly unlikely chances of getting pregnant in general are rather slim to begin with also you couldn't have had more than a few hundred sperm on your finger before you wiped it off and there are millions of sperm in an ejaculation so the likelihood that they would end up swimming far enough up there to do anything or that they were even still alive is very little in the future wash your hands first that keeps any germs out of there too don't sweat it Menstrual cup Birth control Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Abortion debate Semen Oral sex Fertilisation Niddah Jon Secada Infertility Fertility awareness Sperm Whale EastEnders Futurama (TV series - season 5) Psoriasis Prostate cancer Backstroke Oral contraceptive Knots Landing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Orgasm Salad Fingers Elephant Masturbation Milton H.
