teen mom are we doing the right thing i am ill be next month and my boyfriend will be in oct we have been dating for years and moved in with each other about months ago i am mnths pregand found out in june we are both working multiple jobs to save our money for our baby and were both going to college in the fall he is in the military got medically dropped in jan but going back nxt june both of our families know and a lot of our friends i am amazed by the support they have given us i was on bc and we used condoms i play sports and model so we wanted to be extra safe its kind of like god wanted us to have a kid i know it s a sin to have sex befor marriage but my bf and i have talked about marriage before and we do still plan to get married we didnt plan to have children for about more years after i got my teaching degree which i am still going to do and he was back from serving our country are we doing the right thing by keeping our baby instead of giving it up for adoption i will be blunt babies change things they really do and babies turn into children and children are around for two more decades until they are ready to go out on their own in the meantime they need to be fed sheltered trained educated and loved and you don't get a break from it you are very fortunate to have such a supportive family and a committed man in this situation it makes the ramifications of your final decision easier to deal with to know there's help out there if when you need it either keeping your baby or giving it up for adoption are the right things to do both however will give you different futures since both have different consequences keeping your baby will radically change your life and plans for the next few years your time for yourself will be cut and compromised drastically and you will be exhausted beyond what you ever can imagine now as you juggle school study work house and motherhood money you wanted for school will be eaten by pampers formula the extra room you'll need when the baby gets older and day care you will be responsible for organizing and maintaining a cadre of babysitters and day care people in your circle of family and friends mind you this will not last forever but for the first two or three years of your child's life you can expect this and plan accordingly kids babies take up less time as they get older but especially in the first few years they will devour every moment you've got and the moments you need for yourself for your careers educations and relationships not to mention sleep you will need to leave them with someone safe and responsible and loving every single time no breaks otoh you will have a child and there is nothing like it the love and joy of a child is incomparable to anything most people experience you will grow as a person and your life before your little one will fade into shadows as you fall in love your child and this bond lasts for the rest of your life if you give your child up for adoption you are able to have your life back as you planned it and your timetable for your school and plans with your boyfriend will not be changed for more than a few months if when the two of you decide to marry and start a planned family you will love those future children just as much you will have the mental and emotional burden however of wondering what could have been if you decide upon a closed adoption you will spend the rest of your life wondering when a stranger will show up at your door to ask if you are his mother if you decide on an open adoption where you participate in the child's life you will watch someone else raise your child and not be the mother can you handle this Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Polyamory Infantilism Charmed Everwood The Amber Spyglass Abortion debate Days of our Lives Laura Schlessinger Social rule Marriage Sin City Sex and the City Divorce Neighbours Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Adoption Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Ashlee Simpson Show Pitaten Kodocha Avenue Q Series finale Gender role Cliff Richard Abortion in the United States Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hillary Rodham Clinton Humphrey Bogart Spice Girls History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Breastfeeding John the Baptist Love Married... with Children Boston Public The Brady Bunch Philip J.
