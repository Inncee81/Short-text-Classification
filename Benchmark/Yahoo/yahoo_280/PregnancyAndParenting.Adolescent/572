more advice need about seventeen year old my seventeen year old neice has asked to live with us you can find info on my previous questions asked my husband is leaning towards telling her no i am very torn i just can not see leaving her in the situation she is in and the thought of calling social services on the family really bothers me i really do understand that is a possiblity in helping her what other ways can i help her do i pull her dad aside and start a conversation with him about what is going on do i do it with both parents even though that risks a verbal and emotional attack on my neice how do i handle this i feel like time is running out and i am really torn it would be a lot to take on to have her move in with us as i have three children eleven and under and the oldest has asperger's a type of autism she would need counseling support rules and curfews and all sorts of stuff not to mention the basics like love and understanding and trust what should i do when you're standing before god do you want that on your conscience that you could have helped another human being in there time of need but you chose to say no because it would be a nuisance she's family she's reaching out and wants help that she's clearly not getting from home and you're thinking about shutting her down again a person can only be shut out and have a helping hand snatched from their reach before they give up i know that you have to consider your own family's happiness and health as well but think of the lesson this will teach them what it means to truly help someone out in their time of need they will adjust if i was in your situation and i knew the girl wasn't violent towards my family already living at home i would take her in this girl needs you the fact that your torn means you're considering it and a good person at heart don't let your husband talk you out of a doing something that could save this girl good luck edit just read your other question i would confront mom and dad together and tell them what their daughter told you tell them that cutting and depression are not to be taken lightly tell them that with their help you'd be willing to take their daughter in and get her the help she so desperately needs it sounds like they ignore and dislike her for whatever personal twisted reasons they may have she's better off with you but if you need their assistance for insurance etcetera confront them in a non emotional non confrontational way and say hey you can't help thats fine i will but i'm going to need some legal matters settled first good luck and god bless you for trying Social rule Asperger syndrome Autism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story EastEnders Kodocha Babe Ruth Controversies in autism God Emperor of Dune Plame affair Scientology beliefs and practices The Death Gate Cycle About a Boy She Loves You Pitaten Blood on the Tracks Hey Jude Autism rights movement Dead Like Me One Tree Hill (TV series) Fathers' rights Past teachings of Prem Rawat Little Britain The Ashlee Simpson Show The Marshall Mathers LP Extreme Programming Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Good Times Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Time Out of Mind Charmed Narcissism Knots Landing Scenes from a Memory Obi-Wan Kenobi Predestination Microeconomics Infantilism Big Brother (USA TV series) Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Anorexia nervosa The Amber Spyglass The Subtle Knife Great Teacher Onizuka Ethics Meaning of life Theodicy Current teachings of Prem Rawat Humphrey Bogart Goodness and value theory Grandview, U.S.A.
