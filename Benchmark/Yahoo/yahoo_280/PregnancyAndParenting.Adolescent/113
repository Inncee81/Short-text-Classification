what's your opinion about this issue do you dislike gays i don't mean to sounds offensive but i do not like people who don't like them i believe people can love who they love yes it does say in the bible man and woman but would god like us hating each other for our sexuality how would you like it if you were gay and people hated you for who you liked i don't understand how someone could hate someone for that reason it confuses me i have an older brother who is gay it makes no difference between our realationship in fact in probably makes it stronger knowing that there are no secrets between us what is your opinion hating someone for the sexuality is like hating someone for the color of there skin or the gender or for heaven sake the color of there hair i think gays are just people just people who have sex just people who love their significant others just people who talk eat live breathe just people when it comes down to it they are no different than straight people really i wouldnt even mind if one of my kids turned out to be gay sure less grandkids but id be happier knowing they werent afraid to come out to me i utterly despise people who hate gays ill be friends with them but i think their views are stupid especially if they oppose racism what is the difference between someone who hates a certain race and someone who hates those of a certain sexuality absolutely nothing and the people who think its a sin and are really religious are huge hypocrites everyone has committed sins what gives them the right to condemn someone else for 'committing a sin' put yourself in someone elses shoes what if everyone hated straight people pretty sure you would be mad about discrimination based on sexuality something that makes me really sad is that homosexuality used to be classified as a mental illness in the dsm and the only mental illnesses that go in there are ones that are potentially harmful to the sufferer themself or others yea thats my two cents on the whole thing dont really care if i get thumbs down Sexual orientation Gay Homophobia Religion and sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Gay rights Human sexual behavior Paraphilia Laura Schlessinger Religion and sexuality Homosexuality and Judaism Homosexuality Reparative therapy Human Anglican views of homosexuality Transsexuality Political correctness Ex-gay Recurring South Park characters Ten Commandments Capital punishment Same-sex marriage Zoophilia Original sin Infantilism Homosexuality and transgender Homosexuality in China Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Michael Savage (commentator) 613 mitzvot Orson Scott Card History of sex Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Church of Christ Pedophilia Bisexuality Domestic violence LaVeyan Satanism South Park Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Outing Homosexuality and Islam Summa Theologiae The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Anti-gay slogan Arthur Schopenhauer Polyamory Jon Secada Evil Masturbation Fred Phelps Criticisms of Christianity Abortion debate History of Christianity and homosexuality Sin Sodom and Gomorrah John Howard Yoder Racism Book of Isaiah Eastern Orthodox Church Merit North American Man/Boy Love Association Equal Protection Clause Seventh-day Adventist Church Married... with Children The Smoking Room Sexism Discrimination Little Britain Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Blacks and Mormonism Roman Catholic Church Infidels Human sexuality Feminism Charles Grandison Finney Shaggy dog story Sexuality in Christian demonology Bondage (BDSM) Skinhead Sola fide Sexual abstinence Love Anorexia nervosa Sin City Cult God and gender Rick Santorum Humphrey Bogart
