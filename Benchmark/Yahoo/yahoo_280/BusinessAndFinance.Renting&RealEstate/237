should i give a receipt to tenants when they pay their rent im a new landlord and i'm tryin to learn whats common and whats not please give any other tips you may have in helping me be successful yes an honest landlord will give receipts and keep a record of receipts it will save you trouble down the line the biggest piece of advice i can give you from being a landlord myself is that i require the tenant to be present during the final inspection before move in and be present for the final inspection at move out that way there is no argument as to what condition the place was left in i do the move out inspection when everything is moved out and they are reading to turn over the keys i have it in my lease that if they move out leave the keys and opt not to have a face to face move out inspection then they agree to take my sole estimate on clean up repairs etc i actually have a complete separate form for this and they also sign where they got a copy of it i got sick and tired of getting drug to court and taking pictures every time someone trashed my place and didn't get their deposit back and claimed they didn't know how it got that way they always lost those cases b c i always came with pictures but since i had that in my lease the petty small claims suits stopped completely Leasehold estate Leasing Eviction Babylonian law Rental agreement Concurrent estate Plame affair Blackburn Rovers F.C.
