foreclosure question lock on the door question for you if there is a house that is currently listed in the county website as a foreclosure within the last month and there is about a foot long lock around the door knob at the house is that house still able to be sold there is currently a realty sign outside the house but i am not sure if this large lock is put on by the realtor or by the mortgage company my husbands ex owns the home and we are just trying to get information on it for the kids sake btw they moved out of the house about or months ago and put everything in storage help anyone know for sure what kind of lock they use on a foreclosure vs realtor thanks and when i say on the county website i mean in the court pages where documents have been served the long lock you are trying to describe is considered a lockbox in real estate terms if there is a real estate sign outside the house then it is available to buy just because it is in foreclosure does not mean that the bank is wanting to take it into their inventory the lender has enough homes i'm sure and they really don't want the house just the money owed to them the lender is asking the real estate company to sell the house and get the best offer they can the person who is going through the foreclosure will still owe the difference between the loan and what the house actually sells for the persons credit will be affected as well Real estate broker Bond Foreclosure Insurance Predatory lending Government National Mortgage Association Finance Concurrent estate Debt Donald Trump Bank Great Depression Joseph P.
