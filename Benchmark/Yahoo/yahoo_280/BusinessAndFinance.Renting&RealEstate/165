landlord didnt clean house previouse to us moving in really dirty me and of my friends are moving into a house we a renting from a private landlord he owns the house we rent the whole thing previously it was a boarding house but he just bought it and we are his first tenants in this house he has another he rents out there was garbage left in trash cans and nothing was cleaned previous to us taking possession of the house what should we do some of the girls have already spent hours just cleaning their own rooms is it ok to ask for a months rent in compensation for cleaning the entire house what should we do legally isn't he required to clean it we haven't actually moved in yet we picked up the keys this past friday this is the first time renting for all of us the landlord said it was ready none of us live very close to this house right now and neither does the landlord so getting him there is hard he also hasnt removed a car from our driveway that he said he was going to well that falls into a gray area this will be a lesson for you and the girls always do a walk through with a camera prior to taking possession this way you can document any damages and issues with him beforehand since it appears you didn't do that any damages that are in the home you can be blamed for and held to pay for it's not fair and it's not right but it's the responsibilty of the tenants to exercise their rights since you took possession he can assume you had no issue with the dirtiness of it you can certainly try to ask him to refund you some money for cleaning it and maybe he will but he's under no legal obligation to do so at this point Leasehold estate Rental agreement Housing cooperative Estoppel Renting Leasing Public housing Monopoly (game) Eviction Concurrent estate Mortgage Property (ownership right) Babylonian law American individualist anarchism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Inside Easement Abigail Folger Francis Bacon (painter) Knots Landing Insurance Corporation Rent control Land reform Anarchism and capitalism Capitalism 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Poker jargon EastEnders Squatting Scottish clan Prostitution Apartment Annuity Stuyvesant Town The New School at West Heath GunBound Property law Microeconomics The Amazing Race Viva La Bam Absentee landlord Motion picture rating system Haibane Renmei National Kidney Foundation Singapore Contract Karl Rove Waste (law) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Pitaten Humphrey Bogart Taxation in the United States London Congestion Charge Sin City L.
