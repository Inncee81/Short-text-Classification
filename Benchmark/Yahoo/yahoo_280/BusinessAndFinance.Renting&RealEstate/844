my father made a financial gift to me to assist with buying a home k can he ask for this back legally a contract requires for consideration to be provided on both sides only things passed under a contract can be enforced to be given back a contract does not have to be in writing so the question is does a contract exist a contract only exists if their is consideration from both persons ie a job contract one provides the work the other money sale of a car one provides the car one provides the money consideration must be a commercial deal equal and fair ie along the lines that a bank would do otherwise its seen as a gift it helps to have something in writing though as your dad could say it was a loan we agreed she would pay it back one day it would be difficult for both of you to argue in a court of law without something in writing another consideration on this is tax your father will have to pay capital gains tax on this gift capital gains are only exempt if the gain is less than k although your father did not sell anything so he didnt a gain it is seen that his capital assets have fallen so there may be some tax implications get some proper advise as if this gift was made recently you may be able to do something so he can reduce the tax maybe make the gift over a few years so he uses his k allowance each year this would also mean something is documented just to give you peace of mind the person above talking about the it income tax coming after you for gitfs of more than k is talking about inheritance tax though this is only a worry if your dad is likely to die in the next years is he if so again get some tax advise as he is liable for this tax but if he is dead they look to the persons benefited from his estate which could well be you if he has no other assets all this inheritance stuff is only valid if he has assets worth more than about k Tax Life insurance Microeconomics Contract Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the United States Inheritance tax FairTax Article One of the United States Constitution Leasing Islamic banking Mortgage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mutual fund Surplus value Insurance Bond Capital accumulation Annuity Trust (Law) USA Deflation (economics) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Divorce Security (finance) Tax haven Free trade Flat tax Estoppel Derivative (finance) 401(k) Labor-power Warren Buffett Productive and unproductive labour Economy of India Capital gains tax Copyright infringement of software SCO-Linux controversies Wealth Property (ownership right) Tax protester Progressive tax Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Donald Trump Enron Corporation Privatization Personal finance GNU General Public License Property tax Government debt Bretton Woods system Copyright Money Income tax Hyperinflation Credit card Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Trust (Law) non-USA Anarchism and capitalism Value added tax Money supply Inflation Wal-Mart Monetary policy Variable universal life insurance Investment bank Health insurance Citigroup Intellectual property Keynesian economics Publicly funded medicine Income trust Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Parliament of the United Kingdom Allodial title Trade union American individualist anarchism Civil union Gold standard Apprenticeship Babylonian law Social Security (United States) Hedge fund Conflict of interest Real estate broker Law of value Finance Mediation Political corruption
