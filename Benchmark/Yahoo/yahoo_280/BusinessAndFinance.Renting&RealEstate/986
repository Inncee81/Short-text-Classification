mortgage interest rate should i lock now i applied for a mortgage today and got a rate of if i lock today i still did not this is a year fixed downpayment and i have to pay down points to get this rate there is no additional fee for it if i lock days out however i'm still days out for days out i have to pay of a point and for days out of a point my question is should i lock now since the rate is good or should i wait and risk an increase in interest rates any ideas will be greatly appreciated thank you i'd hold off for another week or two right now anything that isn't a paper meaning fannie mae freddie mac or even fha va since those are guaranteed by the government is getting wiped out there is still a ton of money being invested in bonds but they are only buying the lowest risk highest quality issues so us treasury bonds and the above mortgage bonds have a high level of demand high demand pushes rates down since you can offer a lower rate to someone who really wants to buy it and if no one wants to buy your bond increasing the rate it pays will help get buyers interested within a few weeks this should settle itself out to some degree meanwhile first mortgage rates have been dropping incrementally for the past week or so and we're probably not done yet even if it stays the same for weeks it'll save you for what it's worth those offers you are getting are very fair based on today's rates but i gotta ask how long are you planning to be in this home or even this loan most loans only last years before being paid off through a refinance or sale it generally takes years before you break even on paying points has your loan officer shown you the breakeven period are you sure you'll end up actually benefitting from paying these points upfront if your loan officer is having trouble figuring out your breakeven period i'd consider that a good sign to maybe find a new one Government National Mortgage Association Bond Mortgage-backed security Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Life insurance Deflation (economics) FairTax Mutual fund Insurance Annuity Subsidy Debt Student loan Treasury security Monetary policy Interest Municipal bond Collateralized mortgage obligation Security (finance) Hyperinflation Money Predatory lending Inflation U.S. public debt Keynesian economics Taxation in the United States Islamic banking 401(k) Microeconomics Gold standard Investment bank Short selling Economy of Russia Social Security debate (United States) Real estate bubble Capitalism Primerica Financial Services Privatization Interest rate Debt consolidation Capital accumulation Government debt Financial markets History of the United States (1918-1945) Rational pricing Floating rate note Arbitrage Federal Reserve Flat tax Yield curve Savings and loan association Money supply Stock Bretton Woods system Personal finance Social Security (United States) Futures contract Unemployment benefit Derivative (finance) MMORPG Collateralized debt obligation Anarchism and capitalism Credit card Variable universal life insurance Supply and demand Call centre Central bank High-yield debt Money creation Citigroup Mortgage GSE controversy Usury Ra (board game) Labor theory of value United Kingdom corporation tax PE ratio Education in the People's Republic of China Surplus value Publicly funded medicine Economy of the United States Charles Ponzi Modern portfolio theory Finance Minimum wage Deficit spending Tuition Economy of Chile Credit derivative Tax Graduate school Temasek Holdings
