does anyone know of a loan company that will make home loans based on income not totally credit history were paying off our bills and ones where our identity was stolen not fair i know we have plenty income just cant get financing we own our own property and want to put a doublewide on it or get one of the owner builder programs anyone know of any place we cant even get a credit card due to no credit anymore but our income is almost grand a month and we dont pay on credit cards or car payments please serious answers only and no smart remarks about paying our bills please cause we do most of the places did have the stuff removed from credit report and even after filing reports some places still refuse and we did work with a counseling place those places are one big joke they charge you to do what you can do on your own if your identity was stolen and these bills are not yours do not pay on them file a police report report it to the credit bureaus and report it to the lenders that you identity was stolen i am not sure i understand what would compel you to pay bills that were not yours and were made fraudulently what other bills do you have if you have no credit cards and no car payments there are very few companies anywhere that are going to lend only on income and not credit if they are not lending on credit then they are most likely going to require some collateral try beneficial and or household bank if those do not work you can look into filing for chapter or chapter bankruptcy if you are having a hard time paying these debts off you can also try a credit counseling service to consolidate everything and help you to create a payment plan to help you pay everything off sooner be cautious of working with a counseling program as many of these are scams if you have anything or a few items of some serious value you could also consider going to a pawn shop and selling your stuff to them you can make an agreement that you will buy the stuff back from them within a certain amount of time and they will simply hold your collateral lend you the money and you will pay it back with interest Credit card Bond Bank Deflation (economics) Debt Student loan Donald Trump Money Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bank fraud Credit score Gold standard Primerica Financial Services Monetary policy Internet fraud Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Islamic banking Security (finance) Government debt Schabir Shaik Trial Bankruptcy Finance Government National Mortgage Association Citigroup ACORN Economy of Russia Interest Confidence trick United Kingdom corporation tax Financial markets Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Derivative (finance) Credit repair Bankruptcy in the United States Taxation in the United States Corporation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Money supply Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Identity theft Credit history Leasing Mortgage-backed security Bretton Woods system Short selling Phishing Universal Studios Credit derivative Advance fee fraud Marshall Plan Babylonian law Cheque EFTPOS Fiat money American individualist anarchism Temasek Holdings Privatization SCO-Linux controversies Social Security (United States) Collateralized debt obligation Mail fraud Usury Dividend Islamic economics Free trade SCO v.
