i have two houses one about to go foreclosure i have two houses and im about to lose one because i cant pay it will the bank add the balance to the one im currently paying or what will happen i know i need to get in touch with the bank but wanted to get some input here please help if the two mortgages are somehow tied together i guess they could add one to the other but i have never heard of that in texas the norm is they file a lien on you for the shortfall after foreclosure that shortfall includes huge fees for legal issues and late charges it will save you thousands of dollars if you contact them and ask them to help you sell on a compromise sale or as some people call it a short sale if you can't do that for some reason then explore signing the house back to them directly so that you at least avoid the expense of a foreclosure other states may have far different laws and you should talk to a lawyer to find out what would be best for you Foreclosure Predatory lending Allodial title ACORN Life insurance Taxation in the United States Deflation (economics) Credit card Citigroup Plame affair FairTax Mutual fund Bank Insurance Personal finance Euro Enron Corporation Mergers and acquisitions Government National Mortgage Association Great Depression SCO-Linux controversies Value added tax Wheel of Fortune Concurrent estate Leasing Lawyer Copyright Monsanto Title insurance 401(k) Social Security debate (United States) Social Security (United States) Bretton Woods system Software patent debate Intellectual property Islamic banking Copyleft Israeli settlement Trust (Law) USA History of the United States Constitution Tom DeLay Internet fraud Read my lips: no new taxes Dave Ramsey Wal-Mart Karl Rove Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Bond Legal tender United Kingdom corporation tax Real estate broker ROC presidential election, 2004 Supreme Court of the United States Microcredit Child support Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Short selling Supply and demand TLC Barrister PNG Student loan 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Password Personal property Ponzi scheme Security (finance) Gold standard Microeconomics CPU cache Automatic teller machine London Congestion Charge Tax Housing cooperative MMORPG Democratic Party (United States) Capital accumulation Donald Trump Pretty Good Privacy Law of costs John F.
