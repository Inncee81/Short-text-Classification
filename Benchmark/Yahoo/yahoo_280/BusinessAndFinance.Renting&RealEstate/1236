legal question re ownership of house hi guys i have a question for all the expert legal minds out there my parents are separated and want to figure out an amicable arrangement for division of assets as part of the the agreement my dad has suggested we split the ownership of the house between him and me he has agreed to continue paying the mortgage on it until it is sold is this type of agreement legally enforceable and is there a way i can legally enforce it would i be entitled to of the value upon sale of the house or of income generated from the house because he is still the holder of the mortgage on the house i'm not sure how valid my claim would be any help would be appreciated greatly thank you o k well you have to take a look at the facts and circumstances the first thing you mentioned is that your parents are seperated but not yet divorced you went on to mention that your parents would like to file for a non contested divorce by noting that they wish to negotiate and talk out an amicable arrangement for division of assets first of all let's talk about the divorce it looks like your parents are going to talk it out if your mother is willing to leave the house uncontestedly there must either exist a well written pre nupt or other assets to which your father will not fight over when the divorce is finalized your father will have full ownership of the said house and your mother will have whatever else your father doesn't that being said you take no part in the split during the divorce process therefore this begs the question as of when will such an agreement be effective to answer that we must look beyond when such an agreement was made but to when it was properly put into motion this is what i mean suppose your father tells you that the house is yours you sign a contract seal it in blood on an official letterhead house gets sold check gets made out to your father and he gambles it all away the same day not saying that he will i'm sorry if your father has a gambling problem i didn't know i was just trying to make an example the point is what can you do well you can sue him for everything he's gambled away but how will that work out what will he pay your with now before we even go that far let's be realistic you father is a good guy his days or reckless gambling are long past him when the house gets sold he gets the check and refuses to give you anything you wind up in court in an effort to enforce his promise to pay you your well unfortunately for you you can't enforce this promise because a valid legally binding contract has not been formed it lacks the one basic element needed to form a contract consideration this promise sounds more like a gift and a gift is a promise that can be dishonored at any time by the giver with no legal consequenses so we get it this promise means nothing i can't take him to court it's not enforcable your dad's a liar well don't just call it a day yet if he made you this offer then he will still be willing to follow it through when you can do is place both names on the deed or title of the property and record it on public record with the county clerk's office this way when the house gets sold the title company notifies the buyer that you are an owner and your father is a owner therefore the buyer will now have to make out two checks one to you for of the selling price and one to your father for of the selling price however don't run up to the county clerk so fast there are huge ginormous consequenses for adding someone else to the deed or title of the property the bank can demand payment in full of the outstanding principle balance of the home loan in short almost nobody can afford to pay that amount within days so a default will occur this can be avoided if you first ask your bank the bank will probably say no because they are taking on additional risk by allowing an other name to appear on the deed and not recieving any additional interest revenue to compensate that in short you will have to find a bank which will be willing to help you refinance the home and allow you and your father to appear on the deed under the terms you have both agreed on split secret splits agreements are non binding on third parties when you record the deed include the split in the event someone takes out a loan the creditor has no way on knowing how much equity that person has and is lead to believe that either you or your father are simply owning the house jointly there is no part five i think i've said all there is to say talk it over with your father it's not a bad idea to sit down with a real estate attorney or general lawyer and get some advice on this issue state laws may vary and sometimes county laws can be restrictive on this issue i hope this entry was helpful
