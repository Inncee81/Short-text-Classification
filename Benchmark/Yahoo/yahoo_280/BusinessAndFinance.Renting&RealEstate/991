why would an apartment or condo allow dogs but not cats usually its no pets or cats allowed i've only seen it listed where dogs are allowed but not cats what is the reason behind this because traditionally landlords have had problems with cats spraying and destroying the carpets it is hard to get that smell out you have to even replace the base boards etc good luck Cat Red Dwarf characters Fancy rat Skunk Luck Tooth enamel Manx (cat) Black Condominium Pet skunk Taboo food and drink Pekingese Care Bears Flea Pet Ferret Domestication Pep__ Le Pew Monopoly (game) Jack London Three Gays of the Condo Atari 8-bit family Leasehold estate Toilet humour Cloning Felis sapiens Pedigree pet food Spotted Skunk Neopets Rabies Animal communication German Shepherd Dog "Weird Al" Yankovic Livestock Dog The Fairly OddParents Socialization Carpet Baldrick Domestic rabbit Maka dai dai shogi Carnivore Get Fuzzy Apartment Cats (musical) Maison Ikkoku Dennis the Menace (UK) Keeshond Veterinarian Spider-Man Hamster West Highland White Terrier Dog training Beagle Black cat Tobacco smoking College Roomies from Hell!!!
