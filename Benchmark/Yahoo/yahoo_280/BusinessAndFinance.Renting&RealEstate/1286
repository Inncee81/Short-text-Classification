how can i buy a house can i buy a house on a disability check im a year old man who is also a single dad and im disabled from working so i get one check a month to live on plus to make things worse my credit is bad so is it even possible for me to buy my frist house the american dream is it possible for me if not how can i fix this can i fix this without it taking time wouldn't it be awesome if the first answerer was right the sad part is that without decent credit you are likely out of luck the disability check is not an issue and is seen as steady income which is a good thing there are government programs designed to help cover down payment and closings costs and special interest rates for middle to lower income buyers but they all require you qualify for something equal to an fha loan the good news is that an fha loan isn't as credit score sensitive as other programs are and you can qualify for one simply by having no late pays in the previous months and have a limited amount of debts in collections some things may not have to be paid off most people think their credit is a lot worse than is actually the case so i suggest you speak to a mortgage broker before you conclude anything yourself Mortgage Student loan Government National Mortgage Association Bond FairTax Life insurance Debt Credit card Mutual fund Microeconomics History of the United States (1918-1945) Deflation (economics) Islamic banking Monetary policy Capital accumulation Annuity 401(k) Real estate broker Economy of Russia Interest Taxation in the United States Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economy of the United States Futures contract Poker jargon Unemployment Social Security (United States) Security (finance) Personal finance Betting (poker) Municipal bond Tax Mortgage-backed security Gold standard Inflation Money Surplus value Derivative (finance) Privatization Arbitrage Bretton Woods system Gross domestic product Supply and demand Capitalism Education in the United States Credit score Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Health insurance Economics Primerica Financial Services Anarchism and capitalism Stock Money supply Microcredit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annual percentage rate Internet fraud American individualist anarchism Social Security debate (United States) Plame affair Euro Property tax Corporation Savings and loan association Money creation Debt consolidation Title insurance Contract Day trading Hyperinflation Copyright Mergers and acquisitions Social Credit School of Salamanca Collateralized mortgage obligation Debt levels and flows Divorce Collision detection CPU cache Debugging Subsidy Estoppel Nuclear option (filibuster)
