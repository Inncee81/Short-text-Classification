tax siezed homes i called my local county accessor today they told me that after someone wins an auction the person who won has to wait two years for the deed why does it take so long and is there a shorter process you are not winning the house when you get a tax lien you are only winning a lien against the proerty which is a legal debt that must be paid to you if during the next two years the property owner pays off the tax lien you will get the money plus the interest mandated by law or the auction this can be anywhere from to over depending on the state if it has not been paid within two years you will then have the option to foreclose on the property to enforce your lien if you are able to go through the foreclosure after paying the foreclosure costs then you will own the property then it becomes a tax siezed property although in some jurisdictions it doesn't end there in many states there is a further redemption perios where the original property owner can redemm the property back from you generally a month period by paying the tax lien and foreclosure costs plus interest many people go into tax liens as thinking that they will buy a property for while it does happen actually over of all tax lien properties are redeemed before foreclosure although in most places the interest rate often you get for these makes them a good investment you do need to do your homework though on the laws and redemptive rights of the original property owner before you become involved in investing in tax liens in a different county Foreclosure Bond Allodial title Personal property Concurrent estate Insurance Tax Life insurance Leasing Capitalism Property tax Property (ownership right) Deflation (economics) Corporation Mechanics lien 401(k) Taxation in the United States Trust (Law) USA Microeconomics Estoppel Social Security (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Money Annuity Title insurance Sheriff Gold standard Surplus value Capital accumulation Economy of Russia Gross domestic product Intellectual property FairTax Warren Buffett Fiat money Trademark Political subdivisions of New York State Keynesian economics Easement Eminent domain American individualist anarchism Tennessee State Constitution Monopoly (game) Government debt Flat tax Auction Real property Government of Maryland Personal finance Dividend Municipal bond Free trade Microcredit Government National Mortgage Association Interest Public domain Education in the United States Variable universal life insurance Anarchism and capitalism Donald Trump California Proposition 13 (1978) Divorce Great Depression United Kingdom corporation tax Politics of the United States Bankruptcy in the United States Credit card Treasury security Inflation Gambling Predatory lending Property law Short selling U.S. public debt Corporate governance Hyperinflation Fractional-reserve banking Islamic banking Health insurance Express trust Paul Martin Progressive tax Ponzi scheme Assignment (law) Public good Externality Capital gains tax Contract Food Stamp Program
