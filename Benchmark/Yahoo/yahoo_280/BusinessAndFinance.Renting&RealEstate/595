if i own a shopping plaza and im about to start renting spaces out do the tenants take care of there own utilities they handle whatever you agree to in the lease however you need to contact your utilities company it may be that your property is master metered which means that all the service is billed to one master account depending on the utility company's policies you may have to submeter the property and then bill your tenants or the propety may already be submetered in which case the tenant would request service from the utility company in their own business name regardless of which it is i'd recommend you getting an answer from your utility company asap prior to any tenants moving in most utility companies require you to pay all charges incurred by the due date regardless if there is a dispute most will investigate and then credit the account if necessary i'm sure you'd rather not have to pay for your tenants wait for a credit and or to try to get the money from your tenants after the fact which may be impossible if utilities aren't specifically mentioned in the lease agreement good luck to you Leasehold estate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Leasing First-sale doctrine Microeconomics Insurance Rental agreement Eviction Housing cooperative Estoppel Intermediate consumption Taxation in the United States Privatization Islamic banking Property (ownership right) Credit card Money Divorce Babylonian law CPU cache Intellectual property Life insurance Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Credit card fraud Monopoly (game) Business improvement district Concurrent estate Renting Internet fraud Electricity meter Natural monopoly Schabir Shaik Trial Legal system of Hong Kong Trademark Xerox Student loan Apartment Patent Bank Public-key cryptography Health insurance Advance fee fraud E-mail spam Tax Wal-Mart Timeline of the Enron scandal 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Irish Land Act Rest area Trade union Emergency Medical Services President of Ireland Enron Corporation Trust (Law) USA Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Cyprus dispute American individualist anarchism Maison Ikkoku Octopus card GSM services Citigroup Gold standard Phone sex Economics SCO-Linux controversies Operating surplus Secretar__a de Inteligencia Annuity Business ethics Identity theft Corporate finance Service Title insurance American International Group FairTax Capital accumulation Telephone exchange Bond NX bit Capitalism Waste (law) Barrister Domain Name System Wall Street Medicare (Canada) Cable television IP Multimedia Subsystem Public good Cheque Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Manorialism Surplus value Unreformed House of Commons The Standard Income trust Public housing
