i can't help feeling bitter about this my advice to anyone leaving school and considering going to university is this do not attend university become a drug addict instead i went to uni got an hons degree couldn't find a job in my chosen subject so now work in a low paid job my wages are a month my rent is and monthly bills are around council tax phone electricity etc this leaves me approx a month to live on which isn't much i'm not eligible for any benefits apparently and i went to see about getting a council flat without any joy as i'm not a priority case there are new flats being built near where i live and when i enquired about those i was told they are for drug addicts and foreign people does anyone else feel that they would be much better off if they were drug addicts given a flat rent paid council tax paid bills paid plus given benefits what is the incentive for people like me to get up in the morning and go to work where is the justice in this is anyone else in the same situation if so what did you do thanks x just to add i'm now with a degree in music which opens absolutely no doors for me whatsoever it's a useless degree to me same situation nothing can be done me my husband were living in a private one bedroom flat which we could barley afford then came along our little one we were going to struggle with a bigger place the council would not help us out at all was told any available housing would be given to homeless people people on benefits it's just not fair we both work we don't do drugs so why can't we be treated fairly FairTax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Flat tax Economic inequality Unemployment Homelessness Health insurance Wal-Mart U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Procrastination Harlem Medicare (Canada) Plame affair Principal-agent problem Microeconomics Social Security (United States) Publicly funded medicine Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Taxation in the United States Gross domestic product Rent (musical) Arguments for and against drug prohibition Free trade Bruce Johnson Karl Rove Health care in the United States Drug test Parliament of the United Kingdom Barbara Boxer Capitalism Depeche Mode Illegal drug trade Goodness and value theory British monarchy History of post-Soviet Russia Boston Public Public policy George W.
