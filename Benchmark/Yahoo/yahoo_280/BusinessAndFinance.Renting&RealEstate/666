i just want to know everyone's opinion on buying a mobile home i already know the bad thing is the value drops low very fast any other good or bad things about them go ahead and tell me i might want to buy one during my life i lived in mobile homes twice the experience was not bad but i would not want to live in one forever regardless of size they are still limited in the amount of room available particularly storage area yes the value does drop fast like buying a car it loses a lot of value the minute you take it off the lot but if it enables you to be a home owner and lets you live in a better situation i think it is worth doing if your choice is an apartment or a mobile home i would choose the mobile home every time one thing that is both good and bad is that usually unless you own your own land you will have lots of neighbors nearby if that is good or bad depends on both you and them at times our neighbors were very nice and helpful but at other times we wished for a little more privacy sort of like family you may love them but you don't want them around to see if you might enjoy it maybe you could visit a friend or relative who lives in one for about a week that would help a little i hope you make the right decision for yourself good luck Poker jargon Microeconomics Theory of conduct Avenue Q 2000 Australian Grand Prix GunBound One Tree Hill (TV series) The Contender (television series) Urban sprawl Goodness and value theory Maison Ikkoku Social rule Ra (board game) Health insurance Pitaten Infantilism Shen Gong Wu Hiberno-English Nicomachean Ethics Capitalism The Amazing Race Supply and demand Password Monopoly (game) Baseball CPU cache Gmail Gross domestic product Shit Draw poker Humphrey Bogart MapleStory Billboard Hot 100 Rocko's Modern Life Animal Crossing Friends Luck Bon Jovi Toyota Prius The Apprentice 2 Speed limit Arianne I, the Jury Fast bowling Betting (poker) The Suffering (game) America Online Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Quicksort Equine conformation Procrastination Automatic number plate recognition Windows Vista Phoebe Halliwell Mojave people Ocean's Twelve Predestination Cruising (maritime) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Steven Wright Blonde on Blonde RuneScape Boston and Lowell Railroad Redundant array of independent disks Electrophysiology The Fairly OddParents Make money fast The Joker's Wild Mobile home Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Love Hina main characters New York Jets The Catcher in the Rye Deflation (economics) Chess terminology Final Fantasy XI Wheel of Fortune The Ashlee Simpson Show Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Prisoner's dilemma New York Giants Property tax Customer relationship management Philatelic investment Cheating in Counter-Strike Karma Sharon Tate Incarnations of Immortality Guild Wars RuneScape skills Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Ethics Fable (video game) Great Teacher Onizuka Chess strategy and tactics About a Boy American individualist anarchism Big Brother (USA TV series) Alignment (role-playing games)
