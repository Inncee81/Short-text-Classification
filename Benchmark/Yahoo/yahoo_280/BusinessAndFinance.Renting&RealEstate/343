how long does it take to complete falling out of escrow in ca can the realtor list it before it's done i made an offer on a property that was advertised as fell out of escrow that was five days ago my understanding was that once the buyer makes an offer the seller has hours to reply or counter offer i was told today that it is still coming out of escrow but its been listed for two and a half weeks the real estate guy i'm working with is not the listing agent for the property does that make any difference i am guessing that the seller is not going to accept your offer formally until he she is assured that the first offer is dead with certainty to do so would be a serious legal tangle as far as time frames for response are concerned the seller is not required to respond within a certain time frame nor is the seller bound in any way to counter your offer the only time criteria may be in that you indicated that your offer was good for hours from submission if that time frame is passed the seller can still accept your offer but you are no longer bound to take his acceptance unless you want to and yes the seller can relist the home immediately in an attempt to quickly procure another buyer for the property Real estate broker Contract Microeconomics Supply and demand Conveyancing Advance fee fraud Plame affair Gresham's law Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economics Capitalism Oil-for-Food Programme Internet fraud Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Public-key cryptography Consideration Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Property (ownership right) Insurance Inventory Mortgage Time Out of Mind Labor theory of value Real estate Babylonian law Trust (Law) USA ITunes Music Store Paralegal Ten Commandments Real property Auction Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Standard form contract Intelligent design Sales Islamic banking Salary cap MMORPG B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Tax Warranty The Wealth of Nations Same-sex marriage in Canada Sharon Tate Money T'Pol Ontological argument Debate Civil rights Land reform Israeli West Bank barrier Agency (law) Title insurance Presuppositional apologetics Attorney at Law Price discrimination Digital rights management Stock market Security (finance) Dred Scott v.
