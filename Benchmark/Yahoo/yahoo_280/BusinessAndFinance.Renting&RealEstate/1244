can i fight my landlord for wanting my family to move out of the apartment we've lived in for years i live in queens ny and want to know what my rights as a tenant are we have lived in the apartment for over years and do not have a lease we pay month to month we have never had any problems and have always been great tenants we are being asked to leave so the landlords grandson can move in to the apartment she mailed us a note giving us until november to move out that is too short a notice in my opinion after having lived there for so long sorry but if the lease is month by month the landlord can have you move out in any month november is months away but the landlord doesn't even have to be that generous with the time to leave Leasing Rental agreement Eviction Apartment Serfdom Irish Land Act Housing cooperative Apartment building Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Waste (law) Public housing Maison Ikkoku History of Ireland (1801-1922) Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Concurrent estate Section 8 (housing) Rent control Rent (musical) Estoppel Stuyvesant Town Le p__re Goriot Land tenure Japanese law Modding Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Babylonian law Miss Saigon Chatsworth House EastEnders Neoclassical economics New York Jets Art Modell Boston and Lowell Railroad British Mandate of Palestine Sin City Sam Walton Queen (album) Fixtures Public domain Moore v.
