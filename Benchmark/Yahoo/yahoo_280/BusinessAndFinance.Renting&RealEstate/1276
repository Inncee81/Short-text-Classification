if i was to buy a piece of land in the us probably orlando what am i allowed to do with that piece of land and how could i buy a piece of land in the first place who should i go to just asking either way theplease believe me i don't mean to discourage you this is not an easy job to do its very demanding takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of money to find the piece of land you want for the purpose you want it for there are zoning laws and ordinances this means there are certain uses for certain pieces of land you come to the u s and go to orlando you find that perfect piece of land it just so happens there is a for sale sign on that land you call the number on the sign i m going to make this very simple for everyone there are at least two ways to look at this situation example your st question i m interested in that property on front main is it still for sale agent yes it is your nd question how much is it agent it s million your rd question that s perfect when can i come in to talk to you about it agent right now you go in to the office you are hot to trot you want that land you fill out the papers and make the deposit of one hundred fifty thousand dollars you sign the papers the seller signs the papers and you are happy but oh oh you can t use that piece of ground for what you thought you could use it for you can t split that ground into smaller pieces in fact that piece of ground you just paid million for can only be used for an airport why because that s what the mayor and the city s officers thought that would be the best use for that land you just bought a million pig in a poke its worthless to you you are stuck with it why because you didn t investigate anything about that land you thought you could use that land for anything you wanted any way you wanted you were wrong period end of story example this time you have a pretty good idea what to do you call about that same piece of land your st question i m interested in that property on front main is it still for sale agent yes it is your nd question could you please tell me what its zoned for agent sure it s zoned for an airport your rd question is there a possibility to split it up and sell smaller lots agent oh you mean sub divide it your rd question yes that s it sub divide it can i do that agent gee i just don t know i guess that s something you are going to have to find out your th question ok thank you could you please tell me where city hall is agent sure it s at broad market would you like directions to get there your th question yes please would you do that and the agent gives you directions then you go to city hall and find out the information you need you are told the only use for that land is an airport it can t be sub divided what do you do if i have to tell you every state is different every county in that state is different every municipality in that county in that state is different every piece of land in every municipality in that county in that state is different i can think of many many different circumstances and finally how could i buy a piece of land in the first place who should i go to when a person partnership or other business groups wants to buy land in the beginning and for the first two three or four projects the financing is very very hard to get what usually happens is the buyer pays cash for the land then the buyer is the owner and the owner sets up a construction loan during the time the land is under construction many times the lender wants monthly payments when the project is finished everything is put together in a mortgage the very best way to properly learn the business is working for a good reputable honest builder and management team preferably one whose name is recognizable in the area you re interested in investing in doing this should help put you in the field to get the necessary exposure knowledge and experience you'll need when you decide to do this on your own you should learn the proper and right way to run and manage the business you should ask your bosses and supervisors what books and periodicals they get and read to stay up to date with current trends and building codes you should also learn what not to do you should keep a career and vocational journal on your computer update it each and every day it makes things a lot easier especially when you may need some information about how a particular problem or situation was resolved or dusted off to refresh your memory sometime in the distant future now for some nuts and bolts you'll be dealing with raw unimproved no water sewer or utilities land this means there are no roads other than the roads and highways which border or possibly divide the land you're interested in developing you'll need money to buy that land or at the very least money to buy the option for that land you'll need money to make your presentations before various local and county governments you may even have to state your case before a u s government agency this does not mean you'll automatically get approved for the project you have in mind be it residential commercial industrial or special use the citizens and residents in that area will also have the opportunity to present their points of view for and against your particular project s you'll find some folks will be dead set against your ideas and projects from the very start why here are just reasons a one or more of the citizens could possibly believe their piece of land which you never talked with them about selling would be more suitable for your particular project because you didn't even ask them about selling their land to you they could feel they lost a lot of money b one or more of the citizens could feel the area doesn't need your idea developed at all they like the open spaces in their area they're very happy the roads aren't crowded with cars and trucks they like the rural environment they're currently living in and they want to keep it that way c they don't want to pay any more real estate taxes or for that matter any more taxes at all for more municipal services meaning employees police force fire department including schools your development could bring to that area and those are only reasons believe me there are many more then you'll need more money for surveyors impact studies and many other types of projects and obstacles too many to mention here and you haven't even had your ceremonial ground breaking ceremony yet after that ceremony this is when the heavy equipment comes in and starts grading for the roads and the lots and the improvements water sewer gas electric telephone fiber optics etc the main question are you prepared mentally physically and financially to do this answer you may be prepared mentally and physically but financially you'll probably have to borrow a lot of money and or form a corporation and sell shares in the corporation to raise that much needed either way the lender wants to be paid on a regular basis your shareholders deserve a fair return on their investment don't they i know i provided quite a lot for you to think about and consider thank you for asking your question i enjoyed taking the time to answer your question you did a great job not only for your information but for every other person interested in reading my answer i wish you well vty ron b Annuity Finance United Kingdom
