rent in california please help understand the law i have had an oral agreement to rent an appartment i have completed an application and made a security deposit i have not signed a lease agreement for this place yet because i was not sure if it was a right place for me my move in date was later in the month now i have found another place which is great and i want to get back my security deposit from the previous place which i do not want to rent anymore what are my rights thank you very much for advise it was just about a week since i orally agreed to rent the place and i was not even supposed to move in until later in the month why should i be liable for month rent the security deposit is a security to the landlord to have him take the apartment off the market for you the thing is it depends on what was signed and receipted as whether it is a refundable or a nonrefundable deposit if nothing was specified in writing most area laws would automatically consider it a refundable deposit however some states would consider that a nonrefundable because the owner did something for you took the home off the market check your receipt and application to see if there is any mention of a nonrefundable deposit if there is none then you should inform the landlord and ask for the deposit back of course the landlord will feel stiffed by you understandably so the problem with operating like this is that you make people feel you used them and wasted their time in their mind they could have been looking for someone who was serious about renting from them so they will not do anything more than they absolutely have to do for you be prepared for the owner to fight you on this they will feel they are morally in the right even if you are legally in the right Leasehold estate Leasing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Estoppel Octopus card Housing cooperative Mortgage Taxation in the United States Credit card Contract Intellectual property Annuity Public domain Rent control First-sale doctrine Property (ownership right) Renting Cyprus dispute Insurance Hire purchase Copyright Stuyvesant Town Patent Chatham Square Blackburn Rovers F.C.
