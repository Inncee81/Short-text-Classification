is it ok to be removed as a co buyer from home i'm buying with fiance she said that her mortgage company said it would eliminate some extra hassles with doing a credit check on me if the loan was in her name only however they insisted that the contract on the home be drawn up again removing me as a co buyer this sounds strange to me since it looks like i'm not involved in the purchase however they're telling me that my name will still be on the title for the home is this ok that's perfectly fine no they are not lying to you if we have a buyer that can qualify alone then we usually will use one buyer especially if the co borrower does not have enough credit questionable employment etc also some lenders require that only the name of the borrower be on the purchase contract you definately have nothing to worry about as long as your name is on the title good luck Mortgage Insurance Financial markets Predatory lending Debt Islamic banking Bank Deflation (economics) Conveyancing Security (finance) Title insurance Monetary policy Futures contract Government National Mortgage Association Capitalism Stock Real estate Student loan Mergers and acquisitions Bond Citigroup Primerica Financial Services Finance Economics Microeconomics Gold standard Annuity Home insurance Interest Life insurance Supply and demand Bank fraud Internet fraud Article One of the United States Constitution Option Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Savings and loan association Real estate bubble Unconscionability Hire purchase Ford Motor Company Annual percentage rate Money Great Depression Credit card Subsidy Usury Babylonian law Money supply Price discrimination CBS Contract Credit derivative Arbitrage Betting (poker) Timeline of the Enron scandal Payday loan Federal National Mortgage Association Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Debt consolidation Margin (finance) Personal finance ACORN Irish Life and Permanent Advance fee fraud Monopsony The Amazing Race Derivative (finance) Mortgage-backed security Privatization Sears Catalog Home Ethical consumerism Construction Wells Fargo Enron Corporation Credit history Credit union Tennessee State Constitution Warranty Oakland Athletics Foreclosure Hyperinflation Schabir Shaik Trial Corporation Lender of last resort Procurement Central bank Taxation in the United States Short (finance) 401(k) Repurchase agreement Coercion Digital rights management 2004-05 in English football Consumer finance Commodity Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
