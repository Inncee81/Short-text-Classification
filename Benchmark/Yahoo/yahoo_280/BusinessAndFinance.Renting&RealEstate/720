in large urban centers are condominiums more likely to be located near downtown areas or in suburban areas w im not sure the exact population you mean when you say a large urban area most of the newer condos i have seen lately are in the downtown areas at the same time i am seeing suburbs with huge apartments complexes converting over to condos if it is in the downtown and you work nearby there are many reasons to live downtown as long as you can afford it Suburb Campbell, California Milwaukee, Wisconsin North York, Ontario Chinatowns in North America Hartford, Connecticut Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Portland, Oregon White flight Condominium Stamford, Connecticut Las Vegas, Nevada Urban sprawl Apartment building Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area Jersey City, New Jersey Carlsbad, California Palms, Los Angeles, California Salt Lake City, Utah Downtown Syracuse Milpitas, California Trinity College (Connecticut) Downtown Los Angeles Urban renewal New Urbanism Pacific, Missouri Grand Forks, North Dakota Pentagon City, Virginia Woodlands, Singapore Cleveland, Ohio Minneapolis, Minnesota Downtown (Salt Lake City) Detroit, Michigan San Francisco Bay Area West Caldwell, New Jersey Columbus, Ohio Atlantic Station Seoul Caldwell, New Jersey Urban planning in Singapore Chinatown, Toronto Rapid transit Bridgewater Township, New Jersey Rio de Janeiro Edgewater (Chicago) Burnsville, Minnesota Silver Spring, Maryland Scottsdale, Arizona Metro Detroit Toronto Birmingham, Alabama Contra Costa County, California Bay Area Rapid Transit Pasadena, California East Liberty (Pittsburgh) San Gabriel Valley Kansas City, Missouri Northfield, Minnesota Kitchener, Ontario Eaton's Oshawa, Ontario Shopping mall Suburbanization Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia Tram Las Vegas metropolitan area Montreal Central business district Chinatown, Vancouver Downtown Kansas City MBTA nomenclature Suburbs of Johannesburg Paris Lowell, Massachusetts Kansas City Metropolitan Area Cupertino, California New York City Newport News, Virginia Essex County, New Jersey Miami, Florida Chinatown, San Francisco University of Detroit Mercy Underground city Southern California Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts Light rail Hamilton, Ontario Southdale Center Urbanization Greenville, South Carolina Beltline Louisville, Kentucky Saint Paul, Minnesota Chinatown, Los Angeles, California Dallas, Texas Vancouver
