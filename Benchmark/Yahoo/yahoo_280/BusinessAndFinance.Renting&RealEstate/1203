can i get the deposit on real estate contract if buyer turns down an mortgage loan i'm selling real estate in florida and i'm currently in contract with a buyer a large deposit is in escrow but it is contingent on buyer's ability to get approval for a loan he is approved for an loan and would have to pay down at closing this sounds like a usual type of loan given this housing market even though the buyer wants a better loan if the buyer does not go through with the contract and claims he was not able to get the loan he wanted am i eligible to collect the deposit that is in escrow you'll have to read the contract my guess would be no usually if i buy property i put clauses that read 'upon receiving acceptable financing' and upon acceptable inspection these are vague enough that i can back out if i get cold feet since it's up to me the buyer to decide what acceptable financing and inspection is Real estate broker Mortgage Islamic banking Option Security (finance) Real estate bubble Donald Trump Conveyancing Real estate Annuity Government National Mortgage Association Title insurance Oil-for-Food Programme Life insurance Advance fee fraud Financial markets Margin (finance) Bond Microeconomics Money Finance Mutual fund Internet fraud Savings and Loan crisis Debt Tax Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Assignment (law) Savings and loan association Mobile home Bretton Woods system Contract Asian financial crisis Student loan Gold standard Derivative (finance) Housing cooperative Mortgage-backed security Federal National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) Capitalism Bank Babylonian law Short selling Stock Monetary policy Supply and demand Beverly Hills, California Predatory lending Newstead Abbey Credit derivative King Ranch Usury Mary Astor Credit card Bank fraud Salary cap Money supply Investment bank Real estate developer Schabir Shaik Trial Labor theory of value Securitization Economy of Haiti Economics Interest rate Estoppel Privatization Citigroup ACORN Interest United States Postal Service Harlem Allodial title Money creation Topps Unconscionability Monopoly (game) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Put option Anarchism and capitalism Central bank Call option Carl G.
