is it ok to work with more than one realtor i'm a first time home buyer and trying to follow proper home buying etiquette i've gotten mixed messages about whether it is ok or not to work with two realtors at once some have told me it is so long as you keep track of which realtor showed which property that way if you end up purchasing the correct realtor is compensated i've not signed any exclusive contracts with any realtor i have two that i like both are helpful professional etc so what is considered proper within the industry is it ok as long as i make sure both realtors realize i'm working with another agent as well some people have told me that realtors know customers might be working with others and it's not a big deal i'm trying really hard to not step on anyone's toes and i've gotten too many conflicting answers so far please help it is acceptable to work with more than one realtor but it's not necessarily in your best interest neither of them will feel at all secure that their efforts will result in earning a commission after putting in substantial work hence you may not get the level of attention from either of them that you would get if you selected one and stuck with that person as a realtor myself i know the feeling if i am advised that i am not the sole realtor involved i tend to give my better levels of attention and service to those whom i am assured will end up getting me a commission for what i have done Real estate broker Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Contract Property (ownership right) Lie Mergers and acquisitions Mutual fund Coercion Plame affair Investment bank Islamic banking Life insurance Microeconomics Internet fraud Software engineering Cyprus dispute American Psycho Citigroup Labor theory of value Stock Supply and demand Minor league baseball Capitalism Appeal Sauna Economic inequality Past teachings of Prem Rawat Bulk vending Customs and etiquette of Japan Illegal drug trade Kylie Minogue Principal-agent problem Salary cap LiveJournal Aerial (dance move) Estoppel Equine conformation Tax Mediation Real estate Article One of the United States Constitution MMORPG A Course In Miracles Surrender of Japan Autism Advertising Mortgage U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement UK Singles Chart Reparative therapy First-sale doctrine Plame affair timeline Security (finance) Anarchism and society Jean Schmidt Customer relationship management Wal-Mart Human sexual behavior Lawyer The Apprentice 2 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Annuity Restrictive covenant Mach kernel Ethics Internet troll Simon Commission Risk management Gross domestic product Philosophy of business Monopoly Social rule Hedge fund Call centre Financial markets Advance fee fraud Domestic violence Objectivist philosophy Option Scientology beliefs and practices Babylonian law Arbitrage California government and politics Mattress Craps Day trading Arab-Israeli conflict Marcus Licinius Crassus Quality control Topps B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Pretty Good Privacy Aikido Jumpstart 3rd Grade Something Awful Therion (band)
