have i missed the boat i put my house up for sale weeks ago and have had no viewings it is a nice clean well decorated house at a decent price for first time buyers has the housing market slowed up that much recently or should i just be more patient i live in england by the way i'm wanting to buy a brand new house i have put a refundable reservation fee down and have agreed a selling price for my current house which the builders will honour they then decide when to lower the price of my house if there is no interest but i will always receive the original selling price they then hold the new house for me for weeks to give my house time to sell that's why i'm being a bit impatient thanks for your answers so far oh its slowed big time up here in scotland there has been houses in very sought after areas that would normally sell with in weeks still now on the market some months later these relativly small interest hikes are taking more of an affect than i thought they would but it seems the banks have allowed folks yet again to mortgage themselves to the hilt with year mortgages based on five times salary so when a hike comes it hurts bad Mortgage Bond Donald Trump Mutual fund Supply and demand Taxation in the United States Predatory lending Deflation (economics) Mergers and acquisitions Inflation Futures contract Microeconomics Citigroup ITV Technical analysis Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 MMORPG Federal National Mortgage Association Publicly funded medicine Gold as an investment Islamic banking Monopoly (game) Monetary policy Financial markets Wal-Mart Real estate broker Tesco Unconscionability Sears Holdings Corporation Internet fraud Central bank Great Depression The Apprentice 2 Member of the European Parliament Supply-side economics Security (finance) UK Singles Chart Life insurance Investment bank Short selling Option Advertising Ford Motor Company Mattress Real estate bubble Stock Speaker of the British House of Commons Government National Mortgage Association FairTax Rational pricing Diamond Leasing Bank Berkshire Hathaway Derivative (finance) Privatization Gross domestic product Insurance Asian financial crisis Credit card Housing cooperative New Coke Put option Anarchism and capitalism Billboard Hot 100 Economics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stock market Primerica Financial Services Irish Property Bubble Student loan PE ratio Arbitrage Euro Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Call option Enron Corporation Poker jargon Public good Health insurance British House of Commons Marketing Capitalism Economy of Russia $ale of the Century ITunes Music Store History of the United States (1918-1945) Tax National Kidney Foundation Singapore DVD Price discrimination Ashton-Tate Mortgage-backed security PlayStation 2 Habitat for Humanity International Publishing Treasury security Salary cap Auction Illegal drug trade
