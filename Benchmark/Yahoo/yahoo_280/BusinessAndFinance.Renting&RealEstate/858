inheriting a home tax question my wife and other siblings inherited a home in california years ago when their mother died the mother however had the house in a living trust so the home is now in the name of the trust i have a few questions and am hoping an accountant or real estate professional is on here and can steer me in the right direction the house only had a mortgage on it and we have been paying that these last years the house was worth about when she died it is worth now here are my questions do we need to notify the irs and if so are there any taxes involved or as long as it is in the trust we are okay if there is capital gains taxes involved are they split evenly among the siblings what are the amounts of capitol gains taxes we might be looking at thanks in advance and only knowlegable people in this subject answer thanks one more question do we pay the taxes on the amount the home was worth as long as the house is in the trust no tax issue when the house sells the tax is based on the gain from the date of the death of the mother cap gains tax will be appx of the increase in value the trust setup was most likely done such as to prevent the need to pay income tax or inheritance tax on the value of the house at time of death but if the trust was done poorly there could be more taxes to pay Taxation in the United States Life insurance Tax Mortgage Mutual fund Inheritance tax United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Property tax Personal finance Annuity Flat tax Article One of the United States Constitution Tax avoidance/evasion Tax haven Capital gains tax Insurance Tax protester Monopoly (game) Income tax Trust (Law) USA Concurrent estate 401(k) Income trust National Insurance British monarchy Hyperinflation Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bond U.S. public debt Salary cap Money Jean Schmidt Social Security debate (United States) California Proposition 13 (1978) Express trust Variable universal life insurance Donald Trump Warren Buffett Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Productive and unproductive labour Probate Capital accumulation Hedge fund Surplus value Progressive tax Trusts and estates Supply-side economics Stamp duty Federal National Mortgage Association Inflation Microcredit Social Security (United States) George W.
