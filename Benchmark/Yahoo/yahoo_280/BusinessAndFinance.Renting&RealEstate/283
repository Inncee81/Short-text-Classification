can i rent my house out even though it's not paid for i was wondering if it is legal to rent a house out when you are still paying the mortgage does it depend on your mortgage company or the agreement does it depend on where you live i live in texas if that matters if the house is yours you can rent it the mortgage company merely has a lien on the property it does not depend upon where you live keep in mind that i'm not commenting on the legality of rentals in your area you'll have to check with your local government to ensure that your area doesn't have any restrictions on rentals same goes for condos check with your association Mortgage Housing cooperative Renting Leasing Allodial title Insurance Property tax Monopoly (game) Title insurance Security (finance) Public domain Taxation in the United States Intellectual property First-sale doctrine Construction Auto insurance Rental agreement FairTax Credit score Public housing Leasehold estate Federal National Mortgage Association British residential property market Property (ownership right) Mobile home Condominium Home insurance Conveyancing Islamic banking Apartment building Estoppel Stamp duty Donald Trump Mechanics lien Value added Real estate bubble Annuity Capitalism Netflix Squatting Copyright Tom DeLay Eviction Foreclosure Derivative (finance) Motion picture rating system Bankruptcy in the United States Legal system of Hong Kong Subsidy American individualist anarchism Easement Rental car Government National Mortgage Association Rent control Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Mortgage-backed security Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Tax Reform Act of 1986 Citigroup DVD Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Karl Rove Poker jargon Savings and loan association Urban renewal Individualist anarchism Bond Corporation Blockbuster Video Lawyer Cyberport Money C plus plus Unreformed House of Commons Airport Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Separation of church and state Copyright infringement of software Separation of powers Child support Mutual fund Apartment Politics of the United States Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Intermediate consumption Online DVD rental Life insurance Harlem Credit card Assignment (law) Personal property Patent Thomas de Littleton Collyer brothers Economy of the United States Campbell, California Anarchism and capitalism British property bubble
