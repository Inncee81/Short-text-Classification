i'm closing on new construction home with walk thru and closing dates set very close together my builder told me that the walk through for my new home would be on a friday aug that my inspector should be scheduled on the thurs august and to get the report submitted to the builder day later on fri same day as walk thru then the final walk thru to be on the monday august followed immediately by closing an hour after final walk thru my gut feeling is what work can possibly be done between the walk thru on friday and the final walkthru on monday and the closing set just hour after the final walk thru the builder assures me that any work needed can be finished in hours and the final walk through should not take more than mins and thus closing can be done just one hour later i get the feeling the builder is in a hurry to close before the end of august for some reason it is august and the house is not even ready floors fixtures etc all not in i need some advice as to whether this rushed timeline is typical of new home construction yes rushed timelines are typical however you are never mandated to close if things are not completed to your satisfaction that's the purpose of a walk through and inspection if there are unfinished issues which are not addressed by the time you reach closing that is the time to raise a complaint and request an escrow amount be held until the work is satisfactorily completed if you estimate that worth of work remains insist on an escrow of to give yourself a cushion the escrow money will be paid by you to the title firm with an agreement that it cannot be released to the builder without your signature and agreement feel free to speak to the builder about your intentions should he not have the work timely completed if the builder refuses to agree to this escrow your option is to refuse to close because he did not meet his contract on time consult an attorney for further guidance Plame affair Poker jargon 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Advance fee fraud Contract Construction Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sydney Riot of 1879 Hurricane Katrina timeline Oil-for-Food Programme Toledo Strip Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Public-key cryptography SCO v.
