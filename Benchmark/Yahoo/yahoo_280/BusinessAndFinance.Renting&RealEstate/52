can the landlord legally do this just a few questions and i need quick answers and if anyone recommends me taking this to court we had a diff landlord before and we lost our jobs so he gave us time to get things striaghtened we were on the last month to pay up before this new guy started once he was gettin ready to take over he told us he wanted us to catch up with things as we were down to last month we were short bucks told him we have it the next day and he tells us well u got days to be out and only pay or i will get a evictin notice and i will take u to court making you pay and you will not win the case because of a late payment even thou we said we could pay it and would have the dollers the next day or the same day for the rest comes to find out our naighbor downstars had been envolved with out evicting complain of problems with us u cannot stop a anf yr old who been on a hour ride to settle down right away we caught her at his place and we caught hinm talkin to her about us isnt tha against privacy act when you tell another tendent about all your business as being evicted when you have to move he hasvnt giving us a evicting notice and keeps harassing us legally he has to give us one before we are evicted i think this who business isnt fair when he told me he wants us to be caught up and then turns around and wants to throw us out and then tells anothet tendent all of our business i dont think tha legal he wants us out monday because the cleaners are coming but he just cant boot us out when he feels unless he took it to court right or wrong do you think i should get a lawyer because the day he came to get his money we had the money he just didnt wanna see if we could get the tha day or tomarrow which we could have gotten it tha day if he gacve us a chance i think it manly because of her complaining of things we have never done and of course being late tha time didnt help but he stated to us he wanted us caught up please help i know i can be evicted for not paying but wha im saying is he offered me to get caught up which i was doing was down to my last month of gettin caught up he came to collect i had the money for him just short bucks was gonna ask her mother or ask him to wait till tomarrow and i will have the rest he right away wanted to evict me even thou he said he give me time to get caught up and hopes we get caught up and so forth wha i meaning with the neighbor downstairs can he legally tell my personally buiness with me and the landlord about me being evicted and wha for to her isnt tha against privacy act and she filed complaints of noise since we first moved her and the landlord before ignored her because he new she was being rediculas about everything and making false statments but this new landlord is taking everything way to far with her and tha more of the reason why he wants to evict us i have the money to pay the late tha i owed him i also have the money to pay for this month right now if i needed to but he didnt even give me a chance i was only bucks short i told him i have it today or tomarrow the bucks and i will have the rest before the tha is do for next month but he told me because of noise and past i cant but i never really made noise only when i moved in and when my sister visted for days i dont party or nothing like tha i go to work come home and watch tv and the only thing tha was in my past was when i lost my job and once i got another one months later i paid all my dues i owed like the landlord before this one requested but i still dont see how he can just evicted me on his terms without no papers and no so forth even thou i had the money and everything was fine he still wanted me out dosnt make sense tha wha im askin wha can i do cuz i cant find anything in the time i have thanx i'm not here to look for sympathy im looking for answers if you dont have anything nice to say then please do not respond to what im asking if you cannot comprehend what im typing then please dont bother im looking for answers not critizim this to me is serious and im needed serious help and there not my kids they were my sisters nd she visted for days the first day she arrived was the only time they really made noise everyday before o clock which is the time on the lease the children were in bed and even the landlord said one time he came when she had called and never heard a sound but as far as him going downstairs and talking with her about why and wha im being evicted for dosnt sound right to me she has caused me problems since i first arrived west virginia i dont want to stay here the the last thing on my mind but he keeps wanting to push me out in a few days and i cant do it untill i find sumthing he told me days or to court but i packed everything just cant do it in days i looked and it hard when u got pets any recommendation in west virginia fir apartments houses i checked the news paper but havnt had much luck now he giving me till monday cuz he wants the cleaners over and i have nothing written yet monday would be days he givin me and it not easy with animala and i giving to much up to give them away to get into a place the point i making i can he
