how can i sue my mortgage broker for lying me my loan officer for the nd time has approved me for a loan and it failed the st time we moved in on her word we were closing on such and such date on the way to the closing i recieved an email the deal was no longer no reason why then she quit her job leaving us in debt with the seller this time she sent the gfe and the preapproved letter and told us to put down the earnest money we were suppose to meet with her x's this wk and she never showed either time nor did she call we are suppose to close this wed or we lose the earnest money and are homeless with a yr old what should we do please help most of the answers so far talk about filing claims and that might sound nice but it won't protect your purchase and your deposit which is what your question was i would talk to the broker owner of the mortgage company if you were approved for a loan another person in the office can take over and finish it if you weren't approved the broker can discuss your options with you even if you didn't have a real loan yet you can most likely get approved within a week talk to the seller explain what happened how you acted in good faith that you want to buy the house you are doing everything possible to make it happen as quickly as possible etc you should do this through your agent if you have one if the seller is flexible they might be willing to delay the closing for a few weeks so that you can get a new loan yes it is certainly possible to move in to the new house before closing it's called being a renter we also call it tenant in possession likewise it is also possible for the seller to stay in the house after selling it's called seller in possession these are not always the best choices but they do happen and there are standard real estate forms for these situations if the seller cannot will not accommodate you by extending the escrow so that you can get your new loan they still might not automatically get your deposit money in california for example i've never had a buyer lose their deposit money even though one or two have had to back out after removing all contingencies the trick is this in order for the seller to keep the deposit they need the buyer's agreement to release it the buyer not wanting to lose the money sues the seller cost and files a lis pendens which means that not only is the seller being sued they cannot sell the house either the seller wanting to sell the house and not tie it up in litigation for several months will cancel the purchase contract and give the buyer their money back in return for dismissing the lawsuit this is not really fair to the seller but it does work and any real estate attorney will do it this way talk to your current landlord about extending your stay for another days document what happened so that later when the dust has settled you can file a claim against the loan company if you get to that point ask a question here again and you'll get plenty of help there are so many honest mortgage people out there don't stand for this crap get referrals to a good real estate agent and a good mortgage broker and you'll do fine good luck Contract Islamic banking Short selling Insurance SCO-Linux controversies Plame affair Stock Advance fee fraud Babylonian law Security (finance) Option Life insurance Internet fraud Oakland Athletics Mutual fund Leasing ITunes Music Store Annuity Unconscionability Concurrent estate Margin (finance) Money Futures contract Bond Conveyancing Housing cooperative Federal National Mortgage Association Estoppel Derivative (finance) Wells Fargo Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Donald Trump EastEnders Article One of the United States Constitution Public domain Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Economics Citigroup 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Schabir Shaik Trial Supply and demand Financial markets Inventory Intellectual property Theory of conduct Hyperinflation Oasis (band) Enron Corporation Warranty Timeline of the Enron scandal Monopoly (game) Karl Rove Trademark Katelyn Faber Taxation in the United States FairTax Los Angeles Clippers Hire purchase Real estate Patent Real estate bubble New Deal Primerica Financial Services Rental agreement Tennessee State Constitution Gold standard Craps Plame affair timeline Real estate economics Leasehold estate Allodial title Social rule Big Brother (USA TV series) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Poker jargon Knots Landing Government National Mortgage Association Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy World Championship Wrestling Wheel of Fortune Spice Girls Tax Avenue Q Wal-Mart TLC Animal Crossing
