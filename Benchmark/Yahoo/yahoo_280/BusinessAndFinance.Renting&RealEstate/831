parent moving near to us my mother needs to move to the same town as us for family reasons she is and a widow she is currently in a housing association house and doesnt pay any rent as her rent is paid for her through her pensions war widows pension etc housing benefit our town is quite expensive but we really need her nearby and she is desperate to move here too the rented properties here are around the mark per month for a bedroom property my neice also lives with her she thinks she will not be able to afford this amount per month plus utility bills etc if she does an exchange with someone in our town who wants to move to hers does anyone know how housing associations work is there a waiting list criteria to be met etc or is there any other way at all could she obtain a mortgage at age with many thanks if she has a secure or assured tenancy with her housing association which most do as opposed to an assured shorthold tenancy she can do a mutual exchange with any housing association or local authority tenant in the country this is where the two or sometimes tenants involved swop actual tenancies rather than just the properties this would be difficult to arrange though because it would be hard to find someone to exchange with she should ask her housing association if there is anyone on their waiting list from that area some are more helpful than others so she might not get any joy there but they may look it up and contact the other person to see if they want an exchange its worth a try there are some criteria for mutual exchange particularly in areas of high demand both rent accounts have to clear neither can have had action taken against them for anti social behaviour and the major one is no underoccupation i e if she wants to move to a bedroom property the other landlord may say no as she only has a bedroom need none of these criteria are set in law so it is at the descretion of the housing associations involved luckily though a lot of sheltered housing is difficult to let it's worth getting on the waiting list she may not be able to move to the best part of town and she will only get a one bedroom flat unless she is really lucky but wherever she lives sheltered housing is very secure and generally a very pleasant place to live Concurrent estate Estoppel Leasing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance American individualist anarchism Housing cooperative Divorce Anarchism and capitalism Eviction Mutual fund Life insurance Barrister Monopoly (game) Taxation in the United States Mortgage Annuity Public housing Rental agreement Property tax Anarcho-capitalism Security (finance) Stuyvesant Town Property (ownership right) Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Corporate governance Thomas de Littleton Contract United Kingdom corporation tax Gross domestic product Apartment Law of value Gentrification Easement Productive and unproductive labour Social Security (United States) Supply and demand Personal finance Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Renting Intellectual property Baldev Ram Mirdha Irish Land Act Bond Plame affair CPU cache Economics Allodial title Homelessness Unreformed House of Commons Capital accumulation History of the United States (1918-1945) Tax Publicly funded medicine Government of Maryland Inflation New Deal Externality Citigroup Marriage Poker jargon Efficiency wages Neville Chamberlain Maison Ikkoku Fathers' rights Social security Public good FairTax Real property Nuclear warfare Goodness and value theory Anarchism Council house Waste (law) Appeal Economic anthropology Enron Corporation Unemployment Public transport History of Ireland (1801-1922) Real estate bubble The New School at West Heath Bedroom community Domestic violence Flat tax Copyright
