how does it work when you buy a house on auction if the house is appraised at does it start at or lower it usually starts at a real low number whatever the auctioneer thinks is low and they try to bid people up from there however they usually also have a reserve ie a price below which they will not sell the property if for example the house is appraised for k but the owner is willing to take k then k is the reserve but they may start bidding at k or even lower if the bidding does not get to the k number but dies at say k they simply say the reserve price was not met and the housee is not sold and no they won't tell you the reserve beforehand bear in mind that setting up an auction takes alot of time and money so if the reserve is not met the seller lose so they truly want the home to sell also bear in mind there are fees and usually a above the price that goes to the auctioneer so even if you bid k you may need to come up with k closing costs and k auctioneer fee also foreclosure auctions are similiar but work a little differently but the differences are key still not going into that here may not interest you Mortgage Auction Ra (board game) Mutual fund Arbitrage MMORPG Online auction business model Foreclosure Monopoly (game) Mikhail Kasyanov Supply and demand Central bank Shill Economy of Russia Final Fantasy XI Real estate broker Gross domestic product Deflation (economics) Internet fraud Monetary policy Intellectual property Microeconomics Day trading Euro Stock Inflation Donald Trump Predatory lending Housing cooperative Bond Ford Motor Company Insurance Labor theory of value Privatization Call option Put option Futures contract Capitalism Surplus value Real estate appraisal Money supply Option Conveyancing Gold as an investment Fair market value Leasing Contract bridge Live 8 Public good Sit-up Ltd Paintball Rational pricing Anarchism and capitalism Initial public offering Economics Technical analysis Dividend Textbook Supply-side economics Price discrimination Commodity Foreign exchange market Hyperinflation The Apprentice 2 Commodore International American individualist anarchism Real estate economics Market system Estoppel Wal-Mart Islamic banking Stud poker Network effect Exchange value Reverse auction Real estate bubble Asian financial crisis Jack Tramiel ITV Monopoly Speculation Property tax Insider trading Security (finance) Corporation Illegal drug trade Experimental economics $ale of the Century Valiant Comics Winner's curse Tax Debt consolidation Value added tax Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Atari 8-bit family FairTax Liberty Dollar YUKOS
