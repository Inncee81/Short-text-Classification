did i lose my lease i am now living with a bunch of roommates and my lease is month to month however one of my roommates is planning to live elsewhere so is there a possibilty that the three of us is moving since my landlord won't approve of someone new to the lease it all depends on how the lease was worded generally if each roommate was named as a tenant on the lease if one leaves the lease is broken you can try to renegotiate with the owner if you want to continue with the lease by either finding a new roommate to replace the exiting one or for the remaining roommates to agree to pay the whole rent between all increase in per person amount but the owner doesn't have to re rent to you and might raise your rent if you've been excellent tenants paid on time never gave anyone any problems didn't damage or break anything etc the owner may want to keep you on rather than have to go through the whole new tenant procedure or rather than having the apartment vacant and depending on what the laws on in you area a month to month might serve you well you should read your area's laws on rentals to see under what conditions an owner can evict tenants might be that if you remain in good standing the owner won't be able to evict you and you can just continue with a month to month until everyone decides to go elsewhere Leasehold estate Leasing Eviction Rental agreement Waste (law) Estoppel Concurrent estate Renting Apartment Housing cooperative Stuyvesant Town Public housing Avenue Q Rent (musical) Apartment building Rent control Babylonian law Art Modell Irish Land Act Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Capitalism Squatting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Property (ownership right) Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Serfdom Monopoly (game) Value added Boston and Lowell Railroad Property tax Friends American individualist anarchism Manorialism Japanese law Real property Auto insurance First-sale doctrine Anarchism and capitalism CPU cache Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Racecourse Ground Public domain Intermediate consumption Inflation Prostitution in Germany Satchel Paige Harlem Surplus value Gentrification Government of Maryland Contract Eminent domain Judiciary of Hong Kong Property law Annuity Queen of Wands The Amazing Race Microeconomics ABC No Rio Wrexham A.F.C.
