where are all the tough boxers evander holyfield seems to be the last real tough guy before that frazier back in the old days all those guys were tough why don't we have them anymore except for some of those smaller mexican guys blogbaba is david tua that big japanese guy is he on steroids writersblock should be named mental block he said marquez was ko'd twice and came back and won i may be a girl but i'm not that stupid actually that was the baseball guy but writersblock is dumb too i think the toughest boxer currently active today is david tua and odds are tua has more than enough left to take holyfield or any of the weaker glass jawed european heavyweights out there unfortunately it appears a slavic trait to duck tua clearly fear of tua's punching power makes it almost impossible for david to get a shot at any of the worthless titles currently held by these paper chumpions guys like mikkel kessler and winky wright are about as tough as any in the history of boxing and they certainly are not smaller mexican guys there are plenty of tough fighters today they just lack the skill levels of the past guys like joe calzaghe and floyd mayweather are tough as nails and don't sport mexican heritage hell floyd don't even know how to put a sombrero on properly he wore it backwards for the dela hoya fight still i have to admit when it comes to toughness there is nothing like a latino fighter and guys like duran chavez and even cotto define the word toughness a lot of current heavyweight pretenders now days are products of european chemical laboratory expertise it is almost as if they lose toughness because of the artificial chemicals used to bulk them up i heard the steroids some major league ball players used were eastern european in origin they were made in a former soviet bloc states for use by olympic athletes but sold on the black market after the former soviet union went bankrupt the artificial size increases brought about by those lab experiments makes them bigger and stronger but they lose that toughness western hemisphere anthletes have and when they get in a tough fight they quit on their stools like tyson or klitschko did instead of toughing it out like the fighters of yesteryear i think it is a slavic problem and somehow it rubbed off on tyson so they just quit instead of finishing a tough fights real champions don't quit but todays heavyweights do go figure they just seem weaker somehow than the heavyweights of old Mike Tyson Evander Holyfield Muhammad Ali John Ruiz Chris Byrd Hasim Rahman Lennox Lewis Heavyweight George Foreman Sports timeline Mixed martial arts Vitali Klitschko November 2004 in sports Hulk Hogan Michael Moorer Floyd Mayweather Jr. Sugar Ray Leonard HBO Boxing Joe Frazier Lou Duva Shane Mosley Rocky Marciano Kurt Angle St. Louis Cardinals Doom enemies History of baseball in the United States 1980s Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling slang Bernard Hopkins Winky Wright Kostya Tszyu The Contender (television series) Ring Magazine Shawn Michaels Joe Calzaghe Larry Holmes New York Giants Norway national football team Softball December 2004 in sports Fernando Vargas Babe Ruth Sports in Puerto Rico World Wrestling Entertainment Dwight Muhammad Qawi Summer Olympic Games Roy Jones Jr. Pernell Whitaker Floyd Patterson World Series James "Buster" Douglas Don King Eddie Guerrero Archie Moore May 2005 in sports A.J.
