why has wlad klitschko consistantly ducked the better heavy weight contenders in favor of fighting guys like laman brewster a non champion was out of boxing for a year ray austin please this guy was an absolute nobody calvin brock a suspect contender and non champion why hasn't klitschko fought any of the heavy weight champions yet if klitschko is this devastating champion why is he so afraid of a real test why didn't he give sam peter a rematch is it because peter as a young fighter almost knocked him out in their first fight why hasn't klitschko fought briggs rahman who is a bum he could have even fought james toney a year ago back when toney fought rahman twice toney is a hall of fame fighter although a small heavy is this why klitschko was scared to fight him because of toney's hall of fame boxing skills there are three other heavy weight champs and klitschko still hasn't fought any of them that is ridiculous wlad klitschko is a fraud and his last three fights prove it the current string of eastern european fighters such as vitali klitschko nicolai valuev wladimir klitschko oleg maskaev and ruslan chagaev are being protected against any possible heavyweight fighter that appears to be a threat to their title reign another factor that has to be taken under consideration is that promoters bob arum and don king with the help of the wba wbc and ibf are manipulating the ratings another factor we have to look at is there are no serious heavyweight prospects on the horizon my friend Vitali Klitschko Chris Byrd Hasim Rahman Roy Jones Jr. Evander Holyfield Boxing World Boxing Organization George Foreman World Boxing Council Heavyweight Antonio Tarver Bernard Hopkins Corrie Sanders Muhammad Ali Sugar Ray Leonard Eddie Guerrero Archie Moore Joe Louis James 'Bonecrusher' Smith Michael Spinks K-1 Dwight Muhammad Qawi Wilfredo G__mez Wilfred Benitez December 2004 in sports Sugar Ray Robinson Andrzej Go__ota Hulk Hogan Aaron Pryor Azumah Nelson Roberto Duran Mike Weaver Julio C__sar Ch__vez Michael Moorer Larry Holmes Manuel Pacquiao Erik Morales Leon Spinks Kostya Tszyu James J.
