cotto vs mosley who will win between cotto vs mosley on nov th and why i think mosley just the only fighters mosley struggles with are either tall long guys like vernon forrest and oscer de la hoya or defensive guys like winky wright cotto will stand right in front of shane just like vargas did shane totally dominated both fights against vargas having said that while vargas gave shane a good fight the first time round he was totally shot by the time the second fightcame around cotto who is in his prime is a different kettle of fish entirely from vargas in that respect shane has never had problems with shots to the body he's got tons of heart he showed that in all four of his losses against de la hoya twice i think shane's speed power help him win a close unanimous decision over cotto Shane Mosley Oscar de la Hoya Winky Wright Fernando Vargas Miguel Cotto F__lix Trinidad Javier Castillejo Jesse James Leija Bernard Hopkins Ricardo Mayorga Antonio Margarito Jos__ Miguel Cotto John John Molina April 2005 in sports November 2004 in sports The Contender (television series) Welterweight Arturo Gatti Pernell Whitaker Bob Arum Miguel Canto Vir Cotto Boxing September 2004 in sports Chuck Liddell Muhammad Ali Johnny Tapia Centauri Edwin Rosario English cricket team Extreme Championship Wrestling Betulio Gonz__lez Joseph Serrano Evander Holyfield Joe Louis 2005 Ashes series Floyd Mayweather Jr. Lionel Rose Mike Tyson The Ultimate Fighter Chris Byrd Oswald Mosley Genaro Hernandez Richie Sandoval Yori Boy Campas Mixed martial arts David Reid (boxer) 2005 United States Grand Prix Marco Antonio Barrera Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Isra Girgrah Paul Wight August 2005 in sports Trevor Berbick McMahon-Helmsley Faction Roy Jones Jr. Babylon 5 Jack Dempsey 2005 English cricket season George Foreman June 2005 in sports Alex S__nchez (boxer) September 2005 in sports Get__lio Vargas Michael Carbajal Australian cricket team Second Battle of the Atlantic Ramsay MacDonald Henry Armstrong Sugar Ray Robinson Demarcus Corley The Battle of the Little Giants May 2005 in sports USS Augusta (CA-31) John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Iron Bowl Jorge Paez The Ashes The Rock (entertainer) Wilfred Benitez Lupe Pintor Marcela Acuna B-47 Stratojet February 2005 in sports Sugar Ray Leonard 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Lennox Lewis Vassiliy Jirov G'Kar War of the Austrian Succession New York Giants March 2005 in sports Michael Watson December 2004 in sports Samuel Serrano History of Brazil (1930-1945) Bobby Chacon
