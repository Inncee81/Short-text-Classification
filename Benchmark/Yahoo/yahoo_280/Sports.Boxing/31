mayweather what do you really think about mayweather jr a lot of people say his fight are fixed i just think he is a great boxer what are your opinons well i wouldn't say that the fights are fixed i'll just say that his opponent selection has been carefully picked especially when it comes to the timing in which he faces his opponents fighting some marquee names when they are no longer in their prime though some people don't like mayweather's style of fighting personally it doesn't bother me one bit i feel that their is a solution for every style that is faced the thing that keeps my attention in a mayweather fight is seeing whether or not the opponent is going to figure out the solution to beating mayweather would i like to see more action out of mayweather yes but i can't knock him for style of hit and run because no one likes to get hit as mentioned wondering whether someone can put together a fight plan to upset mayweather is what keeps my attention in his fights Floyd Mayweather Jr. Azati Prime (ENT episode) Star Trek: Enterprise Theory of conduct The Contender (television series) Mixed martial arts Social rule Muhammad Ali Erik Morales Arturo Gatti Boxing Daredevil Piccolo Junior Saga U.S. presidential election, 2008 Norway national football team Jonathan Archer Friends Rafael Limon Sin City Rocky Marciano Jesse James Leija Mike Tyson Evander Holyfield Poker jargon Julio C__sar Ch__vez Grandview, U.S.A.
