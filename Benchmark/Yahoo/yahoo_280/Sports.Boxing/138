where do i punch someone if i want to knock them out in one punch please do not answer if you're just gonna say something like you need anger management serious answers only aim for the upper jaw if you're low you hit them on the lower jaw if you're high you drill the nose if you're off to the side you can still make contact with eye sockets what's most important is brain shake in order to do that you need follow through on your punch meaning you aim for the upper jaw but extend through the target as if you mean to hit something inches deeper the idea is to get the head swiveling around jarring the brain the last time i ever sparred i was nearly dropped by a punch that didn't hurt hung up the gloves after that my opponent stepped clockwise so i figured it was time to throw a lead right i didn't see what happened as i lost consciousness for a split second but i worked out what happened he baited me into throwing a lead right but he slipped the punch and brought up a hook that i didn't see my extended right partially blocked my peripheral view to the right and he put his hook right in that blind spot the hook came over my shoulder and hit the side of my right jaw not a lot of power but plenty of follow through since i didn't see the punch i wasn't set to take it and my head flopped degrees to the left i lost consciousness for less than a second and i a managed to stop myself from going down but i couldn't fight a lick after that no confidence all from a slight case of head shake Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling attacks Boxing Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Punch (strike) Piccolo Junior Saga Muhammad Ali Tenshinhan Equine conformation The Contender (television series) Rigging Wing Chun Eye Poker jargon Darth Vader Volleyball Stopping power Mixed martial arts Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling match types Strike (attack) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Snooker Suplex Happy Tree Friends Worms weapons and tools Boxing training Guilty Gear Shaggy dog story Shen Gong Wu Doom enemies Vegeta EastEnders Indian Oil Cup 2005 Aikido Professional wrestling aerial techniques Terry Bogard Swingout Sin City USS Whale (SS-239) Characters of Naruto Martial art Terminal ballistics Shawn Michaels Milton H.
