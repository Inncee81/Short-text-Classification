did anybody like the legend of zorro the mask of zorro is one of my favorite movies plus it was a box office smash i didn't hear things that great about its sequel legend of zorro i heard that it was cheesier and that it was a lot less action packed gearing it towards a younger audience is this true is this one worth the look it was ok but nowhere as good as the st Zorro The Mask of Zorro Batman Catherine Zeta-Jones Shrek 2 Link (Legend of Zelda) Andy Kaufman Video game music Adventure film Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. Paul W.
