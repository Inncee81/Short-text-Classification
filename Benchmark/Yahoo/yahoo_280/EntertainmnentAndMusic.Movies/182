the new harry potter movie who's seen the new harry potter movie well i've heard from a few that it's not as good as the past four is this true what's your opinion on the movie in relation to the other hp movies better or worse for those of you that have read the book how's it in relation to the book better or worse overall did you like it was it worth seeing or not compared to the other movies it was slightly above par however in comparison to the book it was extremely worse obviously because of a time constraint and fitting it all into minutes they had to cut out important things and change a lot of stuff so that it would fit together better it would have been impossible for them to make it as good as the book though i feel they could have done better they did not do horrible i liked it but would not buy it and i think that if you are a fan than it is worth seeing otherwise i would suggest you do not see it Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Money in Harry Potter J.
