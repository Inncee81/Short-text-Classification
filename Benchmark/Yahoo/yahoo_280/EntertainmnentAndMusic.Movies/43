where does the matrix trilogy rank in your opinion of sci fi movies the first movie broke molds the second one confused many and the third's domestic gross didn't even match the production budget where do you think the matrix trilogy ranks in the history of sci fi movies do you love it or hate it do you think the last movies ruined what could have been or do you love 'reloaded' and 'revolutions' i think only the first would be the one highly regarded among the best it's a classic the concept was something that had never been done before and it's still one of my best theater experiences ever as for the sequels i'm one of the few people who liked both of them but at the same time by revolutions i didn't really care for neo anymore and smith quickly became a favorite of mine thanks to hugo weaving The Matrix Revolutions The Matrix The Matrix Reloaded Neo (The Matrix) The Ultimate Matrix Collection Smith (The Matrix) Bane (The Matrix) Trinity (The Matrix) Ghost in the Shell Architect (The Matrix) Hugo Weaving The Matrix series Kung Fu Hustle Paul W.
