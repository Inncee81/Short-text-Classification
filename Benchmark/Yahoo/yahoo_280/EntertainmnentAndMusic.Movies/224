name of movie i saw a preview for an indie underground type movie i can't remember what channel it was on but it might have been hbo it's about a young woman who is a terrorist in a big city i think she works alone the only thing i remember about the preview is that she was wearing a backpack a lot and on the subway i think the title may have the word night in it i know it's not much to go on but i thought i'd ask i know exactly what you're talking about the movie is called day night day night it's about a young girl who plans to bomb times square i saw a preview as well and remembered the name here's the imdb plot summary a year old girl prepares to become a suicide bomber in times square her accent is not particularly out of place and it's impossible to pinpoint her ethnicity we never learn why she made her decision she has made it already we don't know whom she represents what she believes in we only know she believes it absolutely the film strips the story down to its existential core it focuses on microscopic movements the smallest gestures an economy of banal details inspired in part by a story in a russian newspaper and playing off a history of joan of arc films the film transpires on the girl's face the minimalism of the face is confronted with the visual and aural noise of the city faith comes face to face with the possibility of failure The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) EastEnders Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 7 July 2005 London bombings Social rule Al-Qaeda About a Boy John Cage The nature of God in Western theology Sin City Weathermen Memento (film) Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Kurt Cobain The Internet Movie Database 2005 Bali bombings The Jazz Singer Home Box Office Fight Club Lauren Bacall Silent Hill Pornographic movie Candy Darling Little Britain Columbine High School massacre The Matrix Existentialism What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
