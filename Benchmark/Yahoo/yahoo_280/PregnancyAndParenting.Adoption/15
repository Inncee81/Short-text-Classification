fostering adoption concerned about the approval process even though know it is absolutely necessary like most potential fosterers adopters i just wonder what the process will involve how formal intrusive it will be etc the last time i got the pack the way it was worded just put me off as it sounded quite an ordeal is it thanks so much in advance i think the process can be a bit overwhelming for either foster care or adoption until you have gone through it but hang in there it will get easier having done 's of homestudies for mostly adoptions i can give you the requirements by most agencies for adoption but there are some differences in foster care the overall requirements can be less stringent but there are other requirements such as square footage for the bedrooms etc that are only for foster care many of these requirements are set in stone in our state as they are with every state and then the agency approving you will also have their own requirements some may have christian only or no smoking reqirments for example but the basic requirements are as follows job and job history stable employment history salary decent stable salary reflected on your tax returns pay stubs and employment letters taxes good history of completing verifiable tax returns marriages usually look at number less than three is preferable and length of current marriage usually years divorces will need copies of the decrees and names of exes as well as explanation of reason for divorce children children will be interviewed even if live with you part time or if they are grown references must have personal and professional therapist rabbi teacher references who have known you both for years ideally medical letters from doc stating no communicable or catastrophic ilnesses diseases and state that you are mentally emotionally and physically stable mental stability abuse history from childhood on up history and how you have resolved or coped with it arrests if you have one why and when with details and resolution verified by criminal and child abuse background checks in all states where you have lived income must be sufficient to more than just pay all bills and

be enthusiastic about the adoption for the sake of the child counseling history of marriage counseling and resolution as well as mental health counseling and therapist's names and reports alcohol and drugs no drug use and alcohol in strict moderation and if have history of addictions must have proof of resolution lifestyle generally fit and appropriate for children such as not a clubber or partier no risky habits hobbies what you do with your spare time religion spirituality do not have to attend church unless the specific agency reqires it and some birthmothers want only a certian religion or practice or the absence of it motivation to adopt why and history of desire to adopt history with children caring for nieces nephews or friend's children or volunteer work documnted childhood everything from your birth on up such as family activites discipline parental roles discipline etc family of origin how close are you now and how often do you stay in contact etc marriage stability and strengths and weaknesses duration usually at least years sex life normal agreeable to both indication of stability exes why ex relationships ended attitudes toward birthparents caring open appreciative or want nothing to do with her indication of attitude towards child as well attitudes towards people of different socio economic status general attitudes reflect how you may see child or birth parents attitudes about continuing contact with birthmother open semi open or closed most agencies will not work with families who want a closed adoption as this is not in the best interest of
