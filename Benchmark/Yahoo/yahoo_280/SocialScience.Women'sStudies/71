feminist mothers how did your sons turn out after all my daughter's in law reckon they married nice men my son was born and stayed very macho and traditional he's been doing odd jobs since he was a kid and working steadily since he was he got his high school diploma he got married when he was he is still married and has a year old daughter they just bought their first house he's been with the same company for years and is middle management and she's a sahm they're good people who care about things like the environment and animals and other people i believe the impact my feminism or equal mindedness made on him was simply teaching him right from wrong that has to be done from an early age some of the things i can think of are women are people citizens with the same rights and responsibilities when naming famous men i brought up famous women on occasion while letting him admire and have male role models i let him play with both boys and girls and discuss differences without putting them into a separate species i taught him how to defend himself against agressive girls who didn't know right from wrong without crossing a line and becoming abusive i taught him when it was ok and not ok to have sex and what rape was without overwhelming him at too young an age essentially even if a drunk prostitute was running down a dark alley naked yelling rape me there's still no excuse for rape what do you do call when he witnessed things first hand such as the bullying of girls i didn't make excuses or teach him denial we discussed everything he found himself defending girls from school bullies quite a few times when he was little and yes he has had to deal with the type of girl who was abused or something and instigates naughty things and makes false accusations he passed with flying colors because he was never tempted by people like her he knew from an early age what a nice girl was a person with a personality and her own ideas not just a sexy thing whom you know nothing about he's had to deal with all kinds of things that the men on this forum complain about but he wasn't overwhelmed by it because he knows right from wrong he didn't become a wimp or a traitor or very much different than the average successful working class american man the anti feminist traditional religious women i know are jealous of my success with raising my son that he's such a good man and their kids have lots of problems and people who were against me raising him myself because i was a single mother have had to eat their words on many occasions Abortion debate Theory of conduct Boston Public Domestic violence About a Boy Gender role Prostitution Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Silent Night, Deadly Night Friends Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Same-sex marriage Polygamy Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Great Teacher Onizuka Philosophy of language Saved by the Bell Falsifiability Kodocha The Inside Germaine Greer Knots Landing Trailer Park Boys One Tree Hill (TV series) American Psycho Springfield Elementary School Ethics French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Milton H.
