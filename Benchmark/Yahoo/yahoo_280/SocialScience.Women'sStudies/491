can women of today be equal to men since it's been done before in our women's studies classes we learned that in my country the philippines early women had egalitarian equal status to men during precolonial times they were even highly respected especially wives and formal contracts were done only in her presence then when the spaniards colonized the philippine islands the mentality was changed so that women were discriminated since it's been done before i'm wondering is it possible for women to regain their status okay to all who are answering this question i'm not trying to be a feminist here i'm just wondering if it's possible for the past to repeat itself despite present prejudices yes i think it can be done again that both men and women will be respected and valued and that we'll have a much better society but it is difficult when people see their roles changing they get scared angry and strike out so it will take a lot of progress and backlash but we'll get there Feminism Masculism Feminist movement Civil rights Sexual orientation Affirmative action Homophobia Same-sex marriage Gender role Economic inequality History of women in the United States Separation of church and state Education in Japan Gender-neutral language Domestic violence Marriage Colonial mentality Conservatism Transsexuality Generation X Homemaker Spanish dialects and varieties History of feminism Gay rights Transgender Democracy Aesthetic Realism Swami Vivekananda Same-sex marriage in Canada Blood purity (Harry Potter) Martial art Liberalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Culture Fathers' rights Mestizo Homosexuality Woman Blacks and Mormonism Left-handed Divorce Spanish language Bisexuality Equal Protection Clause Gender identity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social psychology Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Bernard Williams The Handmaid's Tale Multiculturalism Racism Marxist feminism Animal rights Asian fetish Constitution of Japan Abortion debate Canadian Senate Iberian naming customs Constitution Legal aspects of transsexualism Filipino American Epeli Ganilau American Conservatism Homosexuality and transgender National Organization for Women Islam in the Philippines Human rights in the United States Black (people) Suffrage Manila Rabbi Jewish view of marriage Philippines Human height Clergy History of the United States (1865-1918) Prostitution Psychology Hispanic Lawyer Lodge Committee Equal Rights Amendment Golf Hinduism in the Philippines Anarcho-primitivism Democratic Party (United States) Feminists for Life Coming of Age (TNG episode) Human Social rule Franz Boas Philosophy of language Indigenous peoples of the Americas Patriarchy Religious Society of Friends Black Legend Demographics of Japan Multilingual
