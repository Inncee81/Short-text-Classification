does anyone feel like the sentiment that if a woman isn't a piece of 'azz' she's not worth zero still in our society it's not so apparent as it may have been years ago but i remember especially growing up and in high school that idea was still there if a woman is beautiful and intelligent she has so much going for her if a woman is ugly and intelligent she's only worth so much even other woman have this over sexed ideas even beautiful woman who complain about it they all try don't they sometimes i wish i was invisible or that i could disquise myself as a man so that i could be human and it's so frustrating because it's not so blantantly obvious anymore is it sometimes i'd rather be dead than be a woman these days sorry i'm drunk my self esteem isn't usually so bad i agree with you to a point i think it's fairly obvious that women do face more pressure to be pretty than men do i do not think that her looks are the defining factor to her success in the business world but i do think being good looking will help you regardless of your sex i've read a few conflicting studies about this when it comes to dating if i'm talking to a girl good looking or not and she is confident funny smart and kind i would be interested in her i don't consider myself to be exceptionally good looking i don't consider myself to be exceptionally ugly theres a link in my profile to my if you're curious to see me but i have dated girls on both ends of the spectrum i realize that i am not like most guys but at the same time it does show you that there are guys like this many girls claim that they only look to the inside when it comes to guys yet they get upset when some jerk isn't into them because of their looks if that's the case then how are you into him to start with he clearly does not have the personality you're claiming to be attracted to so what does it matter anyway i hope ya cheer up everyone is worth something and if you are confident kind and smart you'll have much more success in every aspect of your life Theory of conduct Social rule Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Gender role The Amber Spyglass Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Undergrads Transsexuality Goodness and value theory Human sexual behavior Episodes of Lost (Season 1) George Costanza Sexual orientation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Asperger syndrome Plame affair The Catcher in the Rye Pok__mon Live!
