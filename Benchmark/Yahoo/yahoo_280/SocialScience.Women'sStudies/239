any feminist arguments against arthur schopenhauer lol well yes i'm pretty sure he could easily be ripped apart by feminist critique i haven't read schopenhauer first hand but from studying his influence on irish author and playwright samuel beckett particularly beckett's first novel murphy he seemed to view women primarily as a constant temptation a sort of evil that men nonetheless required and could never escape from wanting in murphy for example the girlfriend and lover of the male main character murphy is a former prostitute he both hates her and loves her for it it's a rather unhealthy way to conceptualize relationships more generally schopenhauer also suggests that humans and their constant needs and wants food warmth sex turn life into a trap where a person can never obtain the ultimate there is no such thing as the utimate sex the ultimate cup of coffee that will prevent you from ever wanting coffee again you'll always want sex again you'll want coffee again tomorrow you're trapped in wanting schopenhauer was quite bothered by this idea here's his entry at the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy which notes that schopenhauer developed an instinct recognizing mystical and essentially ascetic outlook emphasizing that in the face of what he believed to be a world filled with endless strife we ought to minimize our natural desires in order to achieve a more tranquil frame of mind and a disposition towards universal beneficence often considered to be a thoroughgoing pessimist schopenhauer in fact advocated ways via artistic moral and ascetic forms of awareness to overcome what he considered to be a frustration filled and fundamentally painful human condition since his death in schopenhauer's philosophy has had a special attraction for those engaged in music literature and the visual arts http plato stanford edu entries schopenhauer good luck i rather like schopenhauer and have had him on my reading list for a long time The World as Will and Representation Friedrich Nietzsche Objectivist philosophy Socrates Philosophy Meaning of life Reincarnation Simone Weil Friedrich Schleiermacher Goodness and value theory Free will Philo Modernism Feminism Stoicism Moral objectivism Maurice Merleau-Ponty Animal rights Theodicy Nicomachean Ethics Idealism Samuel Beckett Nihilism Sigmund Freud Spiritual evolution Postmodernism Sexual orientation Eastern philosophy Theory of conduct Bernard Williams Human nature Homosexuality Human Ludwig Wittgenstein Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Rudolf Steiner A Course In Miracles Immanuel Kant Epistemology Moral relativism Existence of God Cultural relativism Deconstruction Love Western philosophy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali George Berkeley Human sexual behavior Plato Logic Max Weber Ethics Philosophy of perception Sex-positive feminism Abortion debate Evil Unconscious mind Sin City Gender role Utilitarianism David Hume Art Atheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Critique of Pure Reason Jewish philosophy God and gender Pessimism Homophobia Sri Aurobindo Summa Theologiae Civil rights Pederasty Richard Wagner Adam Smith Sexual abstinence Person God George Lakoff Libertarian socialism Minimalism Taoism Aristotle Property (ownership right) EastEnders Internet troll Religion History of sex LaVeyan Satanism
