why do some women like to physically abused by men not me i take it personally when hit by anyone there are men and women whose sexual preferences include surrendering to members of the opposite sex and there are men and women who prefer to be sexually dominating this sort of thing often includes coproral punishment but it's not really abuse in such cases it's an agreed upon activity in which two people with kinky inclinations mutually indulge one another one might argue that it's not healthy but it just doesn't qualify as abuse abusive people treat others as hated objects and seem unsatisfied unless their victims feel truly denigrated and loathed there are lots of strange sexual preferences out there the ones that involve corporal punishment seem a lot tamer than the ones involving feet and unusual bodily fluids from having worked with abusers male and female i've noticed that some of them will pair off with their opposite equivalents emotionally abusive women will sometimes pair off with physically abusive or intimidating controlling men because no one else will have them and the same thing brings the men into relationships with emotionally abusive women there are also men and women with low self esteem who pair off with abusive domineering members of the opposite sex in both cases the relationships can be astonishingly tenacious low self esteem is one factor but the unfamiliarity of dealing with normal partners seems also involved sometimes more balanced people can seem dull to someone inured to abuse and some abuse victims lack confidence that they are capable of measuring up to the behavioral expectations of healthier partners and feel more comfortable that they'll always be good enough for their partners and of course the abuse itself exacerbates any self esteem or self confidence deficits that someone brings into a relationship but i think it's incorrect to say that anyone likes being abused it's a lot more complicated than that Domestic violence Human sexual behavior Infantilism Sexual orientation BDSM Gender role Zoophilia Child sexuality Rape Child sexual abuse Pedophilia Paragraph 175 Divorce Childlove movement Polyamory Sadism and masochism Narcissism Sexual attraction Transgender Anal sex Homophobia Sex Anger management Transsexuality Domination & submission (BDSM) Spanking Abortion debate Heterosexuality Inhibited sexual desire Gender-neutral language Bondage (BDSM) Birth control Serial killer Sexual addiction Homosexuality and transgender Physical attractiveness Fathers' rights Gay slang Gay Masturbation Human sexuality Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Drug addiction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Traumatic brain injury Orgy Marriage Microeconomics Human Ephebophilia Asperger syndrome Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Bisexuality Sexual dysfunction Dissociative identity disorder Self-esteem Theory of conduct Physical intimacy Social rule Friendship Mojave people Reparative therapy Polygamy History of sex Phone sex Sexual intercourse Sexual abstinence Bully Post-traumatic stress disorder Orgasm Women in Islam Incest Prostate cancer Oral sex Statutory rape Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Medical analysis of circumcision Sexual abuse Homosexuality Interpersonal relationship Political correctness Economic inequality Alignment (role-playing games) History of intersex surgery Supply and demand Autism Group sex Children of God Age of consent Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Dead Like Me Paraphilia Spousal abuse Trafficking in human beings
