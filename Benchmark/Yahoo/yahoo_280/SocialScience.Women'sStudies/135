why do women like to ask men for favors and not expect to give anything back a lot of women wont hesistate to ask a guy for a favor even if they have only known the guy for a short time or met him once or twice but then when a guy asks a woman for a favor suddenly she forgets how to speak properly like well umm duh get i are busy and me think the oven is on to give an example i was close friends with this girl and did her many favors and she told several times if you ever need anything just ask then when i finally ask for a favor not even a big one she was like duuuhh i don't know but i'm not just talking about this situation i mean in general women seem to have an attitude that men owe them something i asked to borrow a cd this is after jump starting her car setting up her computer helping her move and helping her get an internship well actually i asked her to make me a copy but she said no so i asked to borrow it i agree when you say that women in general in america think men owe them something i remember standing in line at a mini mart at a gas station i was in line and one guy was in front of me this woman behind me slyly tries to sneak up to the front and tries to nudge her way to the front i guess she thinks she's too good to wait in line behind men but what angered me a bit was that the guy in front of me decided to be a punk and act p ussy whooped and let her in front like he was being chivalrous to a woman trying to cut she didn't even say thank you she just felt entitled i'm all for letting someone in front of me the other day i got in line and let a woman in front of me because i realized she had been in line and she just had to get some other things but if a woman tries to slyly sneak to the front sorry i'm going to tell her politely that i was in line before her there's no rule that says women are allowed to cut in front of men still many hard line feminists will ridicule me for having this standpoint mike t after further analysis i think you should really tell this woman all that you've told yahoo answers she may be unaware of her inconsideration of selfishness many women are she may get angry or she may receive it well and apologize for her actions and make ammends along with letting you copy the cd women always say men should communicate better right well you're not doing much to improve the situation by telling us tell her what's the worse that can happen if she gets angry well you already were going to disassociate with her for her actions correct if she takes it well and uses it to overhaul her attitude then you can be friends with her again good luck i disagree with seven when she says men shouldn't ask favors from women such as borrowing a cd just because a woman gave birth to him yeah but it takes a man to fertilize the seed maybe women shouldn't ask men for favors then too nonsense last i checked the woman mike t asked a favor from isn't his mother she didn't give birth to him biological traits should be irrelevant when concerning whether or not someone can do a small favor as a friend companion associate Friends Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Avenue Q She Loves You Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Milton H.
