what are your thoughts on women who stalk men i broke up with this woman last october because she was too clingy and boring but even to this day she still wants to get back together she will not accept that i've moved on this has made me lose all respect i ever had for her its pathetic to be so desperate and to want someone who doesn't want you sick is she showing up places you go is she parked down the street watching your every move is she calling a lot i only ask because when i see the word stalk i think of an obsessive person who won't let you move without running into them otherwise it's probably just time to be brutally honest which i know you can do and tell her to leave you alone Scenes from a Memory Time Out of Mind About Schmidt The Human Stain The Apprentice 2 EastEnders San Francisco Giants Tenshinhan Taxi Driver Weaving Questionable Content Seinfeld Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avatar: The Last Airbender Past teachings of Prem Rawat Theory of conduct The Apprentice 3 Knots Landing Enneagram IP (complexity) Milwaukee Brewers Second Battle of El Alamein Sin City Cigarette Smoking Man Community of Christ StarCraft: Uprising Rape Leon White Damn Yankees Kodocha Friends Monday Night Football Akuma (Street Fighter) The Invisibles Wedding Crashers God Emperor of Dune Death Comes to Time Joke Water polo Alignment (role-playing games) Sinfest 2005 English cricket season Homophobia Night (book) Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Catcher in the Rye Current teachings of Prem Rawat About a Boy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Miss Saigon Neighbours Cody Travers Textile manufacturing Stalking The Critic Zhuge Liang Daredevil Aerial (dance move) English cricket team Surreal number Columbine High School massacre Holy Orders Shawn Michaels Sluggy Freelance Boston Red Sox History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Hacker The Young Ones (TV series) Religious Society of Friends Michel Henry Trousers Extreme Programming Dogging Ocean's Twelve Descendants of Darkness Maison Ikkoku Charles Darwin's illness USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Girl (Destiny's Child song) Philip J.
