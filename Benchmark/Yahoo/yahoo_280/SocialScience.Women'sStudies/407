what responsibility do businesses have for pregnant employees why should pregnant workers expect businesses to pay for special benefits open only to them should not all workers be treated equally why do feminists feel that pregnant women should be treated better than a person who is temporarily disabled for example i have read that here that some feminists feel that businesses should provide pregnant workers special benefits such as weeks of paid leave and should disregard the fact that the worker was absent when considering the group for raises promotions and bonuses based on performance why should businesses be expected to give this consideration only to pregnant women and not all workers i will provide paid parental leave only when i can also afford to provide an equally long periodic sabbatical for childless or those with adult children workers draecoiram help me understand if new mother or father did not contribute to a major successful project because of parental leave are you saying that a worker who made zero contribution should be given the same bonus as the one who made a significant contribution i submit that that would be completely unequal and unfair to the contributors and would create legal exposure where small contributors could claim they were discriminated against baba yaga yes i'm the boss when you've learned enough to make a few years of payroll come back and we'll talk in fact sit down let me teach you something very basic fmla allows for weeks of unpaid leave for anyone who needs it it does not discriminate for or against anyone fmla is not just for parents it's for any medical situation including caring for aged parents a sick child or a spouse dog owner confused as to what you are saying are you saying that any benefits pregnant women get should be made available to all workers if i understand you that is what i am saying i am not comfortable giving worker a weeks of paid leave because she chose to get pregnant she can take it unpaid via fmla now without allowing worker b to take weeks of paid leave at some point that is discriminatory in my opinion it will be about years before i can afford to provide the benefit for everyone i will not do it for some and not for all dog owner start a business where you have to figure out how to pay for the expensive benefits and salaries you demand and then see if you feel the same way about companies cheating their employees carrie i do provide st lt disability at no cost to the employee i do fmla paying workers for a year who don't work is financially untenable ouch i recommend that everyone who complains that companies don't spend enough money providing benefits start their own business with months of parental leave and hire only married women in their childbearing years as possible anise don't you realize that working class parents have been raising kids for decades by saving budgeting working together as families and taking responsibility for their choice to have children why is it that people feel that businesses are reservoirs of unlimited cash that they they entitled to until you have to open your own checkbook you will not understand what you are really asking for object of it's ire how can european companies do it it is their governments who are doing it with far higher taxes than the us well over in some cases that is also why us companies sell more american products in europe than vice versa secondly have you ever opened your business checkbook to pay any employees and provide these benefits why don't you put 'your money where your mouth is ' once you do that then come back and piously tell me state what companies should do thirdly once i can afford it i do intend to offer paid parental leave however i will not discriminate against persons who chose not to have children i will offer them a sabbatical after several years of employment at the same length of the parental leave lastly i started saving for retirement when it was over years away i do not intend to rely on the kindness of strangers when i'm old carrie i pay for performance taking everything into consideration the more profit the company makes the more money there is for benefits i incent employees to maximize profits which ultimately benefit them i am not trying to get rich just trying to build something solid and stable that my family benefits from and my employees benefit from steve i think too many of the people above are too sensitive about what you re asking you run a fine business and provide all the allowable benefits under the law as i understand your question you re just asking how can other countries businesses afford to provide paid benefits to its employees who take time off be it for pregnancy sick family members etc i wonder if their government assists in subsidizing the salaries of these workers taking time off in america it would be difficult to give anyone paid time off over and above their vacation and holiday paid time off i think the fmla is well written in that it only gives unpaid time off eases the burden on the employer to anyone who needs it for pregnancy or sick family members the government does not subsidize anything for employers in america therefore you cannot make a living paying people for not working i m sorry people but to pay someone for time off regardless of their condition would be to pay two people for the same job the business would go under if they did this Publicly funded medicine Abortion in the United States Compensation of employees Abortion
