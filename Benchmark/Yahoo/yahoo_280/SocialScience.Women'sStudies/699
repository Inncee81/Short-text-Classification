did you know that a commen misunderstanding for men of women is that women do not really want the bad boy she wants the guy with confidence in himself extremely sexy this is often mistaken for arrogence a fine lined difference the jerks will score but briefly and with drama ladies with knowledge of this find the confident factor in jerks to be attractive not the jerk both sexes need time and age to filter which is which but i speak the truth steve in a way i believe you are right i cannot give a good rationg to your answer because it is so gross to me we ladies do get over this evetually it is a hurtle for all women you are so right its the immaturity that leads to guys thinking that if they play the bad boy they will get the girl in my school days i was one of those jerks being the bad boy always got me dates with the best lookin girls but ultimately it was me that was the loser it took me years to shake the bad boy image and in later life i struggled to get a date because of it i have been with my partner for years now we have beautiful children and my partner likes the fact that that i have the confidence to be myself and not create a false image to impress i am by no means goody goody and still make mistakes but i have also learned to apologise and make the efforts to not do them again girls don't want to get hurt so ultimately the bad boys lose by getting dumped Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Urusei Yatsura Avenue Q Age of consent Kodocha Friends Jon Secada Will Smith Sex and the City George Costanza The Fairly OddParents Child sexuality Humphrey Bogart Phoebe Buffay's songs Can't Hardly Wait Transactional analysis Stewie Griffin Plame affair Days of our Lives The Shining (film) EastEnders Time Out of Mind AFI 100 Years series The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Little Britain Scientology beliefs and practices The Amber Spyglass Shawn Michaels Saki Sydney Riot of 1879 Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Asperger syndrome Boston Public Undergrads Game show Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Masturbation Hey Arnold!
