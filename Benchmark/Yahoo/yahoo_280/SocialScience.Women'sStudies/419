why do many amerian women forget that equal rights should come with equal responsibilities for years i have heard many of women complain that american men are sexist when they dont believe in paying them equal promoting them or treating with equal respect yet many of these women fail to acknowledge that there are areas where men are more lenient on women or even make excuses to justifywhy treating women better than men is not discrimination one example of that is selective service another issue is the criminal justice system if a woman like debra lafave sleeps with an underage boy we are willing to take any excuse as to why she did what she did however we wuld not do the same for a male the same can be said about capital punishment many states such as texas virginia and others who hand out the death penalty quickly for male murderes are very rare to hand down a death sentence for a woman under the same circumstances with regard to selective service the stance i take is that it should be all together abolished neither draft for men or women but that ties more to my political beliefs than gender relations i agree with you that the criminal justice system is jaded however it's interesting to note that those cases are in fact capitol trials but the punishment determined by the jury is almost always more lenient on women to me this shows that it is not necessarily the system itself that is sexist but society in general that still sees women as the weaker sex and more evidence of the patriarchy techinically this would go for number one too as the politicians responsible for selective service are elected to office by the general population many modern women today are in fact benevolent sexists google it and many men whether equal minded or not still view women as the weaker sex deserving of special treatment any feminist worth her salt fights against this recognizing that it is a sexist society with leftovers from the patriarchy and further recognizes how much feminism is still necessary as it is the only gender rights group politically powerful enough to do something about these inequalities Feminism Masculism Gender role Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sexism Fathers' rights Civil rights Gender-neutral language Abortion debate Gay rights Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Affirmative action Jury trial Homophobia Economic inequality Unlawful combatant Appeal Domestic violence Democracy Fathers' rights movement in the UK Equal Protection Clause Rape Radical feminism Capital punishment in the United States Homosexuality and Christianity Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution Patriarchy Penis envy Liberalism Athenian democracy Same-sex marriage Woman Heteronormativity Roper v.
