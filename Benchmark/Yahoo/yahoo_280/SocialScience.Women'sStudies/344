violence against men ladies what's your opinion on this issue do you think that violence against men is wrong and not to be tolerated or is it just funny and you don't care at all what happens with men that's a really good question i'm going to divide my answer into parts part will be about something that really needs to be said the feminists especially should read it it's going to be about the patriarchy misandry and the power of women part is going to be an expansion of poster 's answer as his is a good one part did you know one of the reasons men are physically stronger than women and naturally aggressive is to compete for them men in the past would compete with each other hoping to ''win'' the female that would include managing a certain animal beat the other male in a fight etc our society has always been about pleasing women in marriage the man has to buy a ring for the woman woman says ''oh i wish i never had to do the dishes again'' man tries to please his woman and comes up with the dishwasher yep that's how our society is always trying to please women anyway i doubt i sound really convincing here so i'm going to explain more below feminists will have you believe that before feminism in medieval times and the likes women were heavily oppressed they'll exaggerate everything by saying things such as ''in ancient greece raping women was not considered a crime '' false thieves had their hands cut off can you imagine what rapist had the punishments for crimes committed against women were so much harsher than today's women by far weren't equal to men but they received much preferential treatment and privileges i'm not here to talk about the past though i'm here to talk about modern patriarchy and how women are doing politically economically and socially let's talk about political power first women make up the majority of voters have you ever wondered why male representatives would pass such a misandrist law such as vawa which in it passes off girls and women as the victims and boys and men as the perpetrator because women make up the majority of voters and representatives know that if they want to stay in office they have to please the majority the majority being women what better way to please women than to pass a law where only they are protected and are victimized in it never the less i guess feminists consider this oppression why don't feminists lobby for a proportional voting system here's an example men are going to vote and women are all those men are going to vote for obama and all the women will be voting hillary as it stands in our current system hillary would win with of votes while obama would lose with of votes the fair thing to do would be to make it proportional the proportional way to do it would be men voted for obama which is of men while women voted for hillary which is of women then this would translate to of votes go to hillary and to obama feminists aren't really concerned about it though they're concerned about getting more female representatives in office and the day we get more up there is the day our society will take a step towards a matriarchy and slowly by slowly it will be since women make the majority of voters and have more power than men to choose now that we know women are politically more powerful let's talk about economic power now first of all women aren't paid less than men that's nothing more than a myth and if anyone needs sources or logical reasoning as to why a wage gap is not due to discrimination then feel free to email me having cleared this out of the way let's have a look at the rest women being the ones who get pregnant get much more paid and unpaid maternity leave than men do paternity leave i suspect this is another clear example of women being oppressed by the patriarchy so even though economically women are that not much better off than men they still are time to talk about social power women in society are and always were given special privileges and benefits from minor privileges such as opening doors for them standing up when one woman enters the room taking you're hat off pulling a woman's chair opening the car door for here women children first etc to major privileges such as not hitting a woman and lesser jail times for crimes yep the majority of judges are males and go easier on the female it's even been reported that female judges go easier on males but those female judges make up a minority of judges a couple weeks ago an article was posted stating that in cases involving a child women were punished more severely well child abuse or neglect crimes are just two types of crimes men receive harsher punishment in thievery grand theft auto murder assault rape sexual assault etc yep women not being punished as they should be is definitely an example of patriarchal oppression women are sooooo oppressed so far don't you think let's talk about the media in the media men are portrayed as incapable idiots especially on commercials all the feminists will be saying ''well men are the ones in control of the media '' which is correct but women make up the majority of tv watchers and the majority of consumers in most households women decide where when and how the money is spent while the man is the main breadwinner and the woman is the one who uses the money the man gains it does seem like individually the man is more powerful since he could make the decision without the woman and the woman would be hard pressed to find a job were the man to die so yes here men hold more power but only as individuals women as a whole ultimately control the economy since they are the ones who buy stuff they indirectly influence companies profit margin and workers wages as well as the price of products Barack Obama Fathers'
