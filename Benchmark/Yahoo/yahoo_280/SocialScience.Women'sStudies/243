is sex is sex for the modern day women i mean is it safe to say that i dont have to worry about how they feel about it because its their duty in the modern day to be responsible for their own act rather then blaming the guy so you do think i have to be a little hypocritical about it then well just for arguing sake if a women chooses to leave a man because she doesnt like his sex then its fine but why when a man leaves her then it becomes a diffrient story if the ladies are open to casual sex then they should be responsible for this kind of scenario sex is not a bargaining item as long as you have sex with an adult and are honest it is her responsibility to make the right decisions and take care of herself if she chooses to have sex with you it is her decision as she has her own free will to say yes or no sex is for mutual pleasure not exchange of favors so if a woman sleeps with you in the name of casual sex expecting something else it's on her not you Human sexual behavior Polyamory Bondage (BDSM) Anal sex Sexual intercourse Transsexuality Abortion debate Oral sex Feminism BDSM Sexual orientation Social rule Sexual revolution Gender role Human Gay bathhouse Orgasm Same-sex marriage Children of God Sex-positive feminism French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Friendship Homosexuality and Christianity Free will Birth control AIDS Androgen insensitivity syndrome Zoophilia Stewie Griffin Age of consent Pederasty Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Goodness and value theory Infantilism Avenue Q Rape Phone sex One Tree Hill (TV series) Atomic Kitten Sadism and masochism Bisexuality Humphrey Bogart Prostitution Casual relationship Divorce Strap-on dildo Patrick Hillery Adoption Sex toy Athenian democracy Feminist movement Democratic Party (United States) Alignment (role-playing games) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Ethics Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Economics Theory of conduct Harm reduction Homosexuality and Islam Marriage Child sexual abuse The Merchant of Venice Nudity Homosexuality in Japan Prisoner's dilemma Politics of Canada Margaret Mead Big Brother UK series 6 Transactional analysis Homosexuality Sex education Masturbation Sento History of sex Orgy Theodicy Statutory rape Fathers' rights Childlove movement Safe sex Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Little Britain Same-sex marriage in the United States Sex and the City God Emperor of Dune Laura Schlessinger Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Pornography Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Gender Child sexuality Hillary Rodham Clinton Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Same-sex marriage in Canada EastEnders Grimke Sisters Presidential system AIDS pandemic
