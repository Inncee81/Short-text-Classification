do you think its sexist that men can go topless but women cant lol b dorian i like your style my sentiments exactly just curious where do u live where women can go topless benjamin h valid point just me asking a question is immature i was asking for others opinions grow up you little brat yes because it's an example of women being expected to adjust their lives according to men's preferences breasts are seen as obscene or sexual because men are attracted to them but that's certainly not their breasts' primary purpose and there is nothing unhygenic about going topless but men have redefined them to be shameful sexual objects unless of course they're being put on display for sexual reasons in which case it's just fine and dandy with men if men have a problem with a pair of breasts being used for something other than giving them a hard on quite frankly that's not women's problem and there is no reason why we should have to cater to this idea also where i live going topless is actually legal and women still don't do it imagine all the stares you'd get shudders but why shouldn't women at least have that option Breast Nudity Sexual orientation Sexual revolution Pornography Transsexuality Feminism Pedophilia Child pornography Gay Zoophilia Gender-neutral language Domestic violence Sexual attraction Theory of conduct 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social rule Nudism Gender role Abortion Same-sex marriage Narcissism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Undergarment Child sexual abuse Video game controversy Human sexual behavior Biology and sexual orientation Political correctness Prostate cancer Incest Homophobia The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Shaggy dog story Originalism Brassiere Roe v.
