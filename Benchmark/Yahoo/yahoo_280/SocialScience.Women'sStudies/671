has masculinity in men been demonised so much by society women that men no longer have a gender identity i asked this as a purely theoretical question out of an interest in sociology and gender studies not because i have a 'crisis of my identity' was it too much to ask to expect a proper theoretical academic discussion on this topic from most of you and sammie thank you so much for being the first one with an intelligent point to make even though i don't agree totally you make a good point isildurs babe i am not posing the question can a man only be a man if he can dominate a female so get off your nazi feminist high horse and see if you can start writing some intelligent answers for a change and aggression is a part of masculinity it is a natural biological and psychological response of the human male as are traits such as the need to be strong emotionless tough virile athletic etc direct competition of physical skill and or strength is a feature of masculinity which appears in some form in virtually every culture on earth these are some examples which you yourself have admitted have been demonized by society yet they are a natural form of the male psyche and we cannot help but have these traits so how do we act behave express ourselves when we are told our natural responses are wrong how do you personally define masculinity there are a lot of excellent books on this subject which i won't go into and quote but just do a little looking under gender studies or just look up books on masculinity men and women are studying what the word means in context who defines it how it is understood culturally how it evolves there's a great book called female masculinity very cool book lots to think about i feel that masculinity has been analyzed and broken down and that there is effort being made to re define masculinity masculine traits are what we as a culture society come up with and then create this rigid system where male bodied people men are expected to exhibit certain qualities and behaviors that are called masculine sometimes men get the idea especially in certain cultures that masculine men beat their wives and girlfriends and subjugate them they believe that masculinity means superiority over women and over things that are deemed feminine female bodied people women are expected to adhere to rigid standards of what our society currently deems to be acceptable or required feminine characteristics otherwise she is mocked and presumed to be gay and vice versa when men don't act masculine enough the equating gender identity gender expressionand sexual orientation labelling things strictly feminine and masculine is damaging men and it is damaging women as well as the androgenous and the genderbending genderqueer transgender population people are finally realizing that to be a masculine man one doesn't need to use physical force to dominate others and overpower them masculinity doesn't require one to dress one certain way play sports work manly jobs have manly hobbies activities etc its being re examined and evaluated letting men know they have the freedom to be whoever it is they're hardwired to be that they can like flowers or interior design wear pink and watch food network and not be any less of a man i've known plenty of guys who say they don't fit in because they aren't into sports they only have sex with partners they love and care about they have jobs that have been associated over time as 'womens work' and that they hate it and don't feel accepted by other guys some men go too far to try and prove they're tough guys super masculine and they go around knocking people down literally and figuritively to prove they are real men who call the shots don't take crap say what they want and can kick anyones a if they wanted to men are making strides toward being able to forge their own path and define for themselves their gender identity without trying to live up to someone else's definition Homosexuality Human Sociology Human sexual behavior Grammatical gender Cross-dressing Homophobia God and gender Physical attractiveness Gender identity disorder God Social rule Social psychology Ethics Homosexuality and Christianity Theory of conduct Gay slang Domestic violence Rape Political correctness Religion History of intersex surgery Asperger syndrome Masculism Intersexuality Woman Masculinity Power (sociology) Science Carl Jung Goodness and value theory Queer Reparative therapy Intelligent design Gay rights Franz Boas Man Zoophilia Same-sex marriage Butch and femme Meaning of life A Course In Miracles Culture Drag queen Lesbian Postmodernism God the Father John Money Infantilism Quebec French Species Girl Deconstruction Hierarchy Martial art Atheism Alignment (role-playing games) Susan McClary Scientific method Goddess Spanish nouns Joke Human nature Friends Bulgarian language Gay Nicomachean Ethics Democracy Liberalism Little Britain Jacob Neusner
