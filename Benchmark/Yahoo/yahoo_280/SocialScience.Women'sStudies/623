what is your opinion of this quote by robin morgan regarding the need for feminism and let's put one lie to rest for all time the lie that men are oppressed too by sexism the lie that there can be such a thing as 'men's liberation groups ' oppression is something that one group of people commits against another group specifically because of a 'threatening' characteristic shared by the latter group skin color or sex or age etc the oppressors are indeed fucked up by being masters racism hurts whites sexual stereotypes are harmful to men but those masters are not oppressed any master has the alternative of divesting himself of sexism or racism the oppressed have no alternative for they have no power but to fight in the long run women's liberation will of course free men but in the short run it's going to cost men a lot of privilege which no one gives up willingly or easily sexism is not the fault of women kill your fathers not your mothers source robin morgan goodbye to all that pg kind of an audre lorde thing the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house well i have to say that the overall impression i get from this is that women are helpless and i honestly don't think women want to be perpetuating that particular stereotype i also don't like the last line as mentioned by others there are so many generalizations here that i find it really difficult to swallow any of it the notion that there can be no men's liberation groups bothers me men oppress men some women oppress men and if these men form groups to feel empowered what's the issue there is no way i buy into the stanley fish school of thought which suggests that only whites can be racists which is also what morgan is implying i would have to say that this argument has more negatives than positives and it perpetuates stereotypes feminists have been trying to eliminate imho Feminism Sexism Homophobia Masculism Sex-positive feminism Radical feminism Racism Asian fetish Gender-neutral language Democracy Black (people) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Affirmative action Gender role Media and ethnicity Simone Weil Homosexuality and transgender Beat generation Coercion Nigger Jews as a chosen people Political correctness Oppression Bertrand Russell God and gender White privilege (sociology) Sexual orientation Speciesism Germaine Greer Alcoholics Anonymous Civil rights Religion and sexual orientation History of South Africa in the apartheid era Orgasm 613 mitzvot Blacks and Mormonism Hate speech Uncle Tom's Cabin Human Reparations for slavery Andrea Dworkin Patriotism Marriage Islam as a political movement Rape Anti-Zionism Franz Boas Paternalism Oral sex Queer Robert A.
