is it wrong to watch shows like the discovery channels supermax for the guys i find myself watching these shows about maximum security prisons and stuff just to look at the guys i know these are bad guys and i would never date or want anything to do with them but when i watch the show i seriously can't help but look even if i change the channel i end up coming back to it and more than once i have had to go get a pantyliner during a commercial break is this a guilty pleasure is it ok to look at guys like that even though i know they are bad it seems like the badder they are the more pumped up and violent they are the more i am intrigued this is somewhat of a moral dilema for me seems pretty tame to me i used to enjoy watching queer folk tight buff bodies yum just don't get to know them men you could get messed up thoughts like they're misunderstood and you can help them or their situation EastEnders Supermax Friends Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show American Psycho Human sexual behavior Russell T.
