a male friend of mine took a women's studies class and got a c but well was the female professor sexist a guy i know that took women's studies received a c by the professor but averaged out he scored a high b the class was a combination of exams regular exams and final he showed me all of his graded tests and essays he got a b on the first exam an a on the second exam an a on the third exam and an a on the final there was one essay he got a b a small percentage of the grade was class participation he said he was one of the top in the class that spoke and discussed two girls and himself do female professors generally discriminate against men and grade them harder due to bitterness and other personal issues these female professors have waswis instead of childish personal attacks try addressing the issue waswis i did not assume the worst about her how does one gauge the worst the worst i can possibly think of is if i thought the proffessor was the devil incarnate secondly you just used more name calling in your edit is it difficult for you to not name call where did i attack females in this question in fact i didn't state that the professor was sexist i asked the people if they thought she was sexist everything i listed was all of the criteria for passing the class there was only one essay no projects exams and of the grade was class participation waswis actually i was clarifying what another person was saying they weren't really my own words in all of your responses around g ws you seem pretty angry bitter and hostile you need to look at the syllabus and see how the points are divided syllabuses are generally required to explain the grading point system there may be papers he's not showing you for example it's very unusual for a class to consist of one essay did he not do the others did he not show them to you because he did not do well if he can show that he did earn a better grade based on the instructor's grading system then he should talk to the head of the department that's the next step in the chain of command Massachusetts Institute of Technology IB Diploma Programme Advanced Placement Program Numerus clausus Graduate school A-level Education in Romania Education in the United States National Certificate of Educational Achievement Lawyer Professor International Mathematical Olympiad Hogwarts Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination College admissions Starfleet ranks and insignia Education in Malaysia Education in Singapore Secondary education in France Homophobia Pitaten Martial art Affirmative action Sexism Prostate cancer Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gender-neutral language Education in Portugal Driver's license Law school Junior Certificate Sexual orientation Education in Australia Education in Germany Expert system Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME ELO rating system Juris Doctor United States Naval Academy Bar examination Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Franz Boas Aikido Baccalaur__at Education in Taiwan Philosophy of language Feminism Lynbrook High School Joke Victorian Certificate of Education Past teachings of Prem Rawat Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination Theodicy Civil rights Love Hina main characters Second language acquisition Fahrenheit 9/11 Tripartite System Whose Line Is It Anyway?
