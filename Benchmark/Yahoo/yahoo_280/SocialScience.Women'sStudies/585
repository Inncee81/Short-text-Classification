if i were trapped and sinking in quicksand what would you do i would toss a rope to you and help pull you out here is a good description of quicksand and rescue the idea that a person can be sucked into quicksand is a complete myth quicksand is formed when an upward flow of water generally from an underground spring is of sufficient pressure to counteract the weight of the soil grains when this happens the individual grains are not held together and they are unable to support any weight through the physical interaction of the grains bearing on each other there is no suction force associated with quicksand if there were it would draw the soil grains more tightly together and actually make the ground harder consequently it is literally impossible for a person to be sucked screaming into quicksand and disappear leaving only a floating pith helmet as is so popular in the movies in fact since humans are made mostly of water the specific gravity of the sand water mix is substantially higher than the human body so a person walking into quicksand would sink to about waist depth then float it should be a simple matter to paddle one's way back to more solid ground the screaming would be optional Quicksand Tide Bong Equine conformation Bladderwort Naval mine Professional wrestling holds Phase (matter) Weightlessness Flood geology Suction Sewage treatment Gravity Happy Tree Friends Casting Naruto jutsu Water Internal ballistics Carburetor Drowning Root Professional wrestling throws Siphon Aerial (dance move) Soil mechanics Vacuum Dry quicksand Gold standard Canoe Water (molecule) Burial Table tennis Supernova Geology of the Moon RMS Titanic Avalanche Thermal power station Seismic retrofit Golf Vacuum cleaner Trapping Suspension bridge Volleyball Ecology Suicide methods Car handling Breastfeeding Aquifer Fire fighting Dredge Water purification Buoyancy Archimedes Weight training Glossary of climbing terms Sailing Carbon dioxide sink Glossary of American football Carnivorous plant Hemp Strap-on dildo Glacier Oceanic trench Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Wood Plate tectonics Sea-Monkey Causality Nuclear fallout The Dalek Invasion of Earth Leather Diamond Diver rescue Fishing Drill bit Knife Force Swimming Glossary of firefighting equipment Mattress Hydroponics War of the Worlds (2005 film) Armored Core Borehole Scuba set Plough Canal lock Soil Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army) Rocket fuel Friedrich Schleiermacher Lake Porosity Waterworld
