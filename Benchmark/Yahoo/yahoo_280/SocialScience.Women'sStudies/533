why do you think wendy mcelroy defends pornography while claiming to be a feminist http www secularhumanism org library fi mcelroy html kind of an interesting viewpoint and it strongly goes against the thinking of the likes of andrea dworkin and katherine mckinnon my carrie this certainly touched a nerve with you i'm not sure if pornography is beneficial to women personally or politically hence encouraging women to get into the sex industry however i do not judge women who choose that path as i believe it to be a personal decision you can be pro women and enjoy tasteful pornography too the two don't necessarily contradict each other i don't like watching women get beat or abused in a movie but i enjoy watching two beautiful adults having consensual sex those who become promiscuous use their bodies for money etc mostly do it due to financial reasons or past sexual trauma either way they need our support and compassion not judgment and prejudice some become businesswomen like jenna jameson they continue to remain in the business because they choose to who are we to say what is degrading or not for them to do as women we should strive to supporting each other so that all women have more options to choose what they want to do with their lives but never judge another for their personal decisions Sex-positive feminism Human sexual behavior Andrea Dworkin Feminism Transsexuality Christian right Infantilism Zoophilia Feminist movement Masculism Child sexuality Sexual orientation Prostitution Abortion debate Anarcho-capitalism Civil rights Pornographic actor Gender role Anal sex 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Homophobia Fathers' rights Child sexual abuse Sexual dysfunction Orgasm The 120 Days of Sodom Childlove movement Bondage (BDSM) Rape Pornographic movie Same-sex marriage Pornography in Japan Motion picture rating system Human sexuality Incest Linda Lovelace Oral sex Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sexual addiction BDSM Jenna Jameson Lesbian Homosexuality and Christianity Dissociative identity disorder Gender-neutral language Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Election Consensual crime Decision making Larry Flynt Androgen insensitivity syndrome Microeconomics Paraphilia Pedophilia Divorce History of feminism Roman Catholic Church North American Man/Boy Love Association Women in Islam Catharine MacKinnon Exorcism Atheism Prejudice Roe v.
