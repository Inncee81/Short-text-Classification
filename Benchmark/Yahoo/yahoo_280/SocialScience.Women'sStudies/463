does she my pastor's wife is over the music ministry i have always admired her for what she does and have always wanted to be close with her i have grown into a very mature young lady and have made the decision to live for god the right way she has told me that i am a leader and that when i dance i really catch the attention whenever church service is going on i catch her looking at me from the stage she will sometimes have her eyes closed as if she were in deep thought then she would open her eyes and look at me whenever she looks at me i get a vibe it makes me feel warm on the inside i love her like a mother what is behind her words and actions it sounds like she has potential to be your spiritual mother if you let her she sees something great in you and if you link hearts with her i bet you will go on to do great things good luck Jon Secada Roman Catholic Church Church of Christ Pitaten Church of Christ, Scientist Religious Society of Friends The Jazz Singer Muraqaba Second Vatican Council Sant Thakar Singh Minister of religion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Shining (film) Book of Mormon John Wesley John the Baptist Pentecostalism Janet Jackson Nachman of Breslov Prayer in Christianity Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Blood on the Tracks Justification (theology) Poker jargon One Tree Hill (TV series) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ten Commandments Simone Weil Humphrey Bogart Waking the Dragons Shaggy dog story Whitney Houston House music Love The Emancipation of Mimi Angel Sanctuary Care Bears Scenes from a Memory Maison Ikkoku Confucius The Invisibles Numerology Opus Dei Little Britain Original sin Baptist Oh My Goddess!
