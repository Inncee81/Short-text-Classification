love being bossed around and put down woman love being made to feel worthless by powerful men who really are better than us we should'nt deny that we are less intelligent less competant our iq scores and lower income along with any other measures of success with prove us inferior women have lower self esteem our entire purpose in life is to look attractive so that rich succesful men will pick us out of a crowd but we really shouldnt be upset about this its just the way it is please girlfriends do dig deep search your soul and give us your true reaction comments also tell me how likely you are to be interested in a guy with these beleifs he'll be reading this so if you want to hook up a date go for it edi for those of you who want to know why i would post such a thing because people have different view points in life this is his to say that someone reading this is then going to start thinking like this is like saying someone who watches the simpsons is then going to start living like homer seriously does anyone agree with this guy by the way he's young so help him out ladies tell him what you think or dont answer the question its quite simple edit push theatrics you see what you want to see if this male wants to man up and tell you all who he is let him otherwise i wont reveal his identity as a matter of principal and privacy he's just stating his beleifs i told him i'd try to help him see other womens opinions rather than argue no troll shark did you hit your head on a rock it wasnt you i was just informed by him that some of you agreed with him hu aside from men was there anyone who agreed with him thanks ladies lots of great responses my intention was not to make this guy look bad which is why i chose not to reveal his name but he is someone we all know here in gws and i do hope he has a better sence of what it is we don't want i should mention there was one girl that agreed with him my personal feelings are that most women don't want to be treated badly we want to feel respected apreciated and desired my opinion what about a little bit more generalization lol ok my stand replying to the nice gentelman that sent you this message woman love being bossed around and put down sorry not this woman not even when i was very young this doesn't make me a man by the way before you think it i have a sweet nature i am caring and feminine but i don't let anyone treat me like trash woman love being made to feel worthless by powerful men who really are better than us ugh who wants to feel worthless if so there would be no sense in being alive we should'nt deny that we are less intelligent less competant our iq scores and lower income along with any other measures of success with prove us inferior wow i am sure you learned this from the women in your family it is a pity that you have not being able to meet intelligent and capable women well intelligent people attract intelligent people women have lower self esteem some could be but women are not doing bad at all after centuries of opression and abuse from guys like you please don't get married our entire purpose in life is to look attractive so that rich succesful men will pick us out of a crowd some women but also some men i have two brothers that have just exploited the whole family for money i have worked all my life they both are lazy sitting like kings expecting to be fed therefore i moved very far away from them they have exploited for money girlfriends and wives both of them today are divorced they deserve it because the women were the ones making the money but we really shouldnt be upset about this its just the way it is this is highly paternalistic perhaps the guy likes you and this is the only way he knows about how to communicate with a woman edit gosh i just read that supposedly this was to help him well i was perhaps too rough but i have to say that i have heard these same lines by multiple men all of them with big issues so is better to begin at least to contemplate that at the end perhaps things are not the way they were written in ancient books remember that for centuries the description of women was written by men still directing my words to this
