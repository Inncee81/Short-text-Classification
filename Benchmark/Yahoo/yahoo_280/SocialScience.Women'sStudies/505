do some women get some kind of a 'high' off of rejecting men seems like there are a lot of women out there that will string a guy along who they are not really interested in for a certain amount of time then just walk away without giving him anything they usually leave when the guy starts to expect something for all his efforts i think this is cruel and selfish and i don't understand why some women feel the need to do this yep it's true women do reject' men for pleasure deidre that said it's a two way street' is wrong for one the main gender that has to do all of the asking at and effort is the man so men usually aren't in the position to reject a woman i think it's especially disgusting that women do this since most women don't know what it's like to make the effort to initiate conversation not an easy task many women obviously don't value or respect the courage a man has to have to just go up and talk to a woman especially since most women would be scared to death to walk up to a man and initiate conversation and make the first move also i notice women handle rejection far worse than men this girl i knew told me about how she decided to make the first move and talk to this guy to tell him she liked him you know something guys usually do and tried to ask him out he told her nicely that he wasn't interested and she was depressed about it for months she never initiated conversation or made the first move again after that not easy is it ladies to me i would like nothing better than to see these women that get a high off rejecting men be rejected themselves of course that may never happened since these women strategically put themselves in a position where they can't be rejected since they never initiate conversation or make the first move now how many women will get mad at me now that i've told the truth Humphrey Bogart Social rule Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story EastEnders Friends God Emperor of Dune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
