feminists what can we do to quill the stereotypes attached to our beliefs it seems so many anti feminist arguments are based on stereotypical ideas of what feminism is and not the truth my usual reaction to this is for god sakes please read a book about it before jumping to the flannel wearing man hating lumberjack conclusion but this solution implies that only the unknowlegdeable are responsible for this stereotype and i am a firm believer in taking personal responsibility in any conflict situation is there anything we are doing to perpetuate the stereotypes and what can we do to cast them aside hmm clearly the spirit of personal responsibility is one sided so far nothing on what someone can do themselves just a whole lotta you should do this or you should do that yeah we're really getting somewhere sorry to disappoint delish as i've said many times i consider myself feminist masculist and equalist extraordinaire lol perhaps as some seem to have assumed that my beliefs do not fall in line with feminism because i post often about men's rights goes to show that the feminist stereotypes are alive and well she doesn't hate men so she must not be a feminist right wrong go burn my bra and stop bothering you eh lol ladies seriously there must be something we can do about this some answerers are making it waaaay to easy for me to just blame their ignorance of the subject i emailed u delish well i think it's too late maybe not in all actuality but too many feminists are the man hating bla bla bla and they don't want to change stereotypes run us we want to know what we're getting into before we get into it so we make rash judgments it's not going to change no matter what we do because too many like being the stereotypical feminist and too many like having a stereotype to attack with all we can hope to do is change the minds in the small world around us let our friends see that we are who we are and don't fall in the stereotype and even when we do follow one stereotype it doesn't defne us Feminism Theodicy Gender role Feminist movement Abortion debate Postmodernism Masculism Theory of conduct God and gender Gender-neutral language Homophobia Religion Deconstruction Philosophical skepticism Phaedo Transcendental argument for the existence of God Ten Commandments Religion and sexual orientation Ethics God Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Propaganda Fictional character Goodness and value theory Supernatural David Hume Plame affair Creationism Socrates Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fathers' rights Moral Politics The nature of God in Western theology Charles Darwin's views on religion Sex-positive feminism Internet troll Bob and George Little Britain Criticism of Mormonism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Objectivist philosophy Public domain John Wycliffe Fight Club Presuppositional apologetics Joke Philosophy of language Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Goldstein's book Scientology beliefs and practices Anti-Mormonism Trinity A Course In Miracles Political correctness Mary Wollstonecraft Mary, the mother of Jesus Moral objectivism Atheism Anarchism Animal rights Religious Society of Friends Kyle Broflovski New Testament Transsexuality Dualism (philosophy of mind) God Emperor of Dune Evil Simone Weil Reaction to Darwin's theory Complexity classes P and NP Free will Grimke Sisters Roman Catholic Church Mormonism and Christianity LaVeyan Satanism Autism Hate speech Opposition to cults and new religious movements Paradise Lost Utilitarianism John Howard Yoder Professional wrestling match types Social psychology Same-sex marriage in Canada Children of God Great Apostasy Social rule New anti-Semitism Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Vacuous truth Adam-God theory Democracy Karen Horney
