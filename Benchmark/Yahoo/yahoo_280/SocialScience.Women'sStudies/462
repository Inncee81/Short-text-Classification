is their a double standard on the gws forum for decency a lot of women here are always complaining about men trolling and posting offensive and angry material here what do you think about this post from a woman below wow so you must have not had a relationship in a long long time there must be something going on with you mentally that's made you act this way women are leaving the 'gender and women studies' section so that makes men stronger hahahahaha you have some serious issues all your questions are f cking stupid especially this one it makes no sense at all you are the biggest tool i have ever come acrossed in my whole life while i find this post hilarious i just want to point out how if a man posted this against a woman he would probably get a violation notice or his account deleted this is also part of an earlier point i made that women are just as abusive as men if not more but men don't always complain about it crazylady what kind of stupid are you this is not for women only it is titled gender women's studies even if it were just titled women's studies you would have to be pretty sexist and ignorant not to mention stupid to believe it is for women only you make a good case but i think your point is a bit off based i think that the men who troll are much more abusive however i think that there are more women who committ isolated incidents of trolling the one i find most used and the one that bothers me the most is wow so you must have not had a relationship in a long long time there must be something going on with you mentally that's made you act this way mostly because it is just stupid if any of them took seconds to talk to the trolls they would find that they happen to mostly be intelligent and very socially adept people they only do the trolling because it makes people mad and im not condoning it but it is funny sometimes Internet troll Gender-neutral language Domestic violence Rape Sexual orientation Gay Troll 2channel Homophobia Theory of conduct Transgender Transsexuality Divorce Plame affair Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Philosophy of language Joke Social rule Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Child sexual abuse Troll (Discworld) Spam (electronic) Laura Schlessinger B3ta Ron and Fez Homosexuality Abortion debate Homosexuality and transgender Shit Paragraph 175 Garfield Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Andrea Dworkin Sexism Gender role "Weird Al" Yankovic Incest Fathers' rights Dilbert Pedophilia Zoophilia Human sexual behavior Political correctness LaVeyan Satanism Singlish Little Britain Stupidity EastEnders Homosexuality and Judaism Slashdot subculture Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Ex-gay Gender identity The nature of God in Western theology 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Opie and Anthony Asian fetish Witch-hunt Have I Got News For You Economic inequality Trolls (Warcraft) Abortion Discrimination Autism rights movement The Marshall Mathers LP Dissociative identity disorder Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Communications Decency Act Big Brother UK series 6 North American Man/Boy Love Association SpongeBob SquarePants Something Awful Forums Theodicy Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Constitution of Ireland Infantilism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fiddler on the Roof Gay rights Bisexuality Intelligence quotient Kodocha Male prostitute Feminism World of Warcraft Gender identity disorder Serial killer Borderline personality disorder Flaming GameFAQs message boards Reparative therapy Radio Yerevan GameFAQs Condon Committee Cliff Richard Karl Rove Satanism
