fire is the most tolerable third party by henry david thoreau i love this quote but i dont know what it means if there are any professors of philosophy or anyone well read with henry david thoreau ideas please tell me what he meant by that quote i was able to confirm using gutenberg that ralph waldo emerson cites fire is the most tolerable third person among thoreau's unpublished writings the works by thoreau available through gutenberg do not include the quotation a further search using google provides an abundance of persons quoting thoreau but apparently they all depend upon the emerson citation having failed to find the quotation in context i can only conclude that while two is company and three is a crowd a fire can be very welcome to the two when they are out in the wild or together at the hearth Henry David Thoreau Transcendentalism Henry James Sr. Charles Ives Mexican-American War Louisa May Alcott Concord, Massachusetts John Brown (abolitionist) Conservation ethic Poetry of the United States History of modern literature William James Walden New England Plutarch Nathaniel Hawthorne Romanticism Amos Bronson Alcott Walt Whitman Shot heard 'round the world Christian anarchism Civil disobedience Victorian literature Transcendental Generation Thomas Carlyle Johann Wolfgang von Goethe John Burroughs Greater Boston Stanley Cavell Wendell Berry Quotation T.
