cuz if you call for someone's help they just might push you back down there was once a girl who hung out with her friends every friday night a girl who would say lol after every words she would laugh

hung up school started and the girl walked to lunch alone laughed but only when she thought about how stupid she was to fall for him and discarded all of her friends from any future friday night fun what happened to the up beat loving girl i m really starting to miss her more and more and sometimes i wish i was still years old because the hardest thing i had to deal with then was ken breaking barbie s heart but now now i must be barbie because ken simply destroyed me imagine a world without war a world without aids a world never poor because everyone got paid a world with clean air so everyone could breathe a world where leukemia didn t still your hair and where going blind allowed you to see imagine a world with endless dreams dreamt will all eyes open a world filled with sunshine beams and words for the def spoken imagine a world in color and the black and white will soon go a world where we love each other and where every star can glow for being the girl who never lets herself think anything will go right who never lets herself get too excited cause she knows she ll be let down who never lets herself like that guy too much just incase who s more disappointed each

real friend then was stabbed in the back again who has parents who just don t won t listen when she tells them that who gets ignored on a daily basis who feels invisible to even important people in her life who has gone through a day being able to count the amount of words she spoke on two hands who goes to sleep feeling alone who just can t wait for things to one day be better different this is for you girls these girls have more strength than any other every day ordinary people never once in their life get recongized for it these are the girls who deserve amazing boyfriends amazing friends

that girl never the girl just that girl the one that gets used hurt lied to betrayed confused the one that boys go to when they need someone to hold onto the one that s never the girl i m always the second best never have i been the one to make boys fall weak at the knees drop everything cause they love me so much want nothing more than to be with me be amazingly happy cause they have me i m the other girl i m getting used to being her every girl wants prince charming while he may be nice all i m thinking i d rather have the guy that s gunna call at am just to say hi or someone who ll stop by my house after just hanging up the phone cause he wants to see how i m really doing cause i said i was fine but we both know i m lying or the guy who ll stay home on a saturday night with me cause i m sick bring me my favorite kind of candy even though i can t eat it cause my stomach flips at the idea that guy that one guy he may not be prince charming to anyone else but he d be my hero my knight in shining armor time is tricky you have whole months even years when nothing changes a speck when you don t go anywhere or do anything or think one new thought then you can get hit with a day or an hour or half a second when so much happens it s almost like you re born all over again into some brand new person you for damn sure never expected to meet no decision you make is wrong as long as it s yours i m living for something i can t even explain i can't really tell you who i am because to me i'm a mix of different things i watch tv shows that other people may find ridiculous i have hobbies that some people may find weird i play sports where i might not be the all star of the team but i have the determination to try these qualities are what make me me if you can't learn to accept that then you obviously don't know the meaning of acceptance i know you think we're better off friends you don't want to ruin what we have now but how do you know if you never try we could be the couple everyone wishes they could be we could be completely in love we'd never know because you were too afraid to take the chance make something more beautiful then it already is im not your exgirlfriend im more like the best thing you ever let go i wish i could pause everything i wish i could put my life on hold just for a second i wish i freeze my tears for a little while i wish i could put emotions on layaway until i know how to handle them there s a difference between you can t have everything in life and you can t talk without taking action believe me i would grant all my wishes if i had the power but i don t so the only other choice i have is to close my eyes and runaway bend down to my knees and just pray be thankful for what i have this very day and for everything i ve been blessed to say depend on no one because in life there s a road you take and one day that road splits in two at the end of each road is success or failure this isn t a guessing game it s a you re the only one that can choose your destiny by depending on no one you make your own decision on you re life so choose wisely because either way there s no one to blame around you yesterday was a day before today tomorrow is after today today is after yesterday but before tomorrow yesterday is behind both tomorrow and today today is between yesterday and tomorrow so tomorrow will be today after yesterday which ever way it goes live for right now because those days aren t guaranteed not even to the richest man flashback turn back in time where you used to sit hours watching the rugrats where you wouldn t ever leave your house without your nano baby and when blues clues was actually challenging rewind back to the times when your favorite shows were doug ren stimpy pinky and the brain aaaaaaah real monsters and rocko s modern life when you watched re runs of tgif step by step family matters dinosaurs and boy meets world when you remember reading every series of goosebumps or in that case remember listening to your mom read them as she grew bored and bored and as you grew more excited as to what would happen next when bringing plastic cartoon lunch boxes to school was pretty much cool and saying not after every sentence was the way to talk when every argument was settled by rock paper scissors bubble gum bubble gum in a dish or daddy had a donkey inky binky bonky when cops and robbers was a daily activity and when hide and go seek was put to pause only when it was snack time the days when we used to actually obey our parents and when the radio was all we depended on for music when you knew that kimberly the pink ranger and tommy the green ranger were meant to be together when you always wanted to send in a tape to america's funniest home videos but never taped anything funny so you gave up when the magic school bus made you think that school buses could fly and when yo yos made you popular when getting married meant buying your crush a ring pop and blabbing some random words behind the dumpster when reading that little paper in the fortune cookie meant everything to you because it predicted your life the days when you could tell furbie all your little secrets and expect him to talk back and when beanie babies were the talk of the class when you got creeped out by are you afraid of the dark and when you knew the macarena by heart when you lied to your parents to bring you to mcdonalds because you were starving when really you wanted to play in the play place when gas was a gallon caller id was a new thing and when checking out drawing books and rainbow fish from the library was the cool thing to do before we realized all this would eventually disappear we didn t bother to think of how good things were flashback to the world we live in now you think you know who your true friends are wait till high school see who's there for you when your ex boyfriend spreads rumors about you think you'll never do drugs wait till it's right there in front of you all your friends are doing it think your tough wait till you say the wrong thing to the wrong person see who backs down first think you're smart wait till you have an english paper science project history test a minute monologue due tomorrow cause you were absent for day think you're cool wait till you're the only one who doesn't make the sports team see how cool you are then you think you're popular wait till your parents can't afford the new hollister jeans everyone has think you'll never fall in love wait till a guy looks deep in your eyes says he loves you think you'll never get your heart broken wait till that same guy who said he loved you is holding another girl behind your back think you won't have sex wait till the guy you think you love says it'll make you closer think nothing's going to happen to you yea wait till you're sitting in a jail cell wondering how you got caught think that you're always going to be your own individual well wait till one morning when you look in the mirror you're just like everybody else dear boy so maybe you i were supposed to end this way both going in our own directions we are two completely different people and no matter how hard we tried we couldn't overcome our differences no i'm not sad that it's over between us but yet i'm not happy either we had something special but in the end the sparks just didn't cut it anyways i'm mostly writing this letter to tell you i've met someone else someone else who can make me smile give me butterflies someone who reaches for my hand first and likes to rub my thumb just like you did he knows that i love it when boys hold the door open for me i love to joke around he makes me happier then i've been in a long time maybe he could be the one who knows but boy i want to thank you you showed me what love was what love meant i hope someday you find the perfect girl because obviously i never was and never will be at least not for you i wish you all the love happiness in the world all i ever wanted was for you to be happy and i guess now i'm finally getting my wish goodbye boy never forget me i love you sincerely me i was really only coming to your house that night to pick up my movies and a few sweatshirts i left there i wasn't looking for a conversation i wasn't searching for one last good bye kiss you had moved on and i had convinced myself that getting back my stuff was the last step and then i too would move on but as i grabbed the movies off the shelf and turned to face you for the last time i felt my heart start to beat faster and the butterflies i kept telling myself weren't there started to make me smile and as you came closer my palms started sweating it was like the past month we had forgotten what we made what we had and in a matter of minutes it came back to us as you put your hand on my face and we kissed i felt like my heart slowly became unbroken and all the tears were suprisingly worth it and i realized that maybe losing you was what i needed to show myself that you truly are my everything and then baby we fell completely in love with eachother all over again do you see her face girls like that are born with a boyfriend we go to school for thirteen years the one thing they never teach us is how to say goodbye here i am sitting here again reading quotes again with only one person on my mind the whole time laugh at stupid jokes cry get revenge apologize tell someone how much they really mean to you let someone know what they're missing laugh till your stomach hurts live life because tomorrow's not guaranteed to anyone i'm sick of pretending i don't care 'cause obviously i do i'm sick of being treated this way especially by you i don't want to hear that you don't care and you tired of hearing about me even if it's true i don't want to hear that you've fogot about me and found someone new when all i can think about is you news flash when a girl says she's cold you're not supposed to say me too sorry hun but unlike you i'm not a doorknob where everyone gets a turn i'm more of a casino where only the lucky ones win the jackpot you know it s love when the silence between you two is comfortable the world is going to throw us a million reasons why this isn t gunna work out between us but i m armed with the one reason why it will i love you you can t do this you can t put one relationship on hold for another it s like call waiting you leave one person on hold long enough they re going to hang up love your enemies just in case your friends turn out to be a bunch of bastards don t be flattered that he misses you he should miss you you re deeply missable however he s still the same person who just broke up with you remember the only reason he can miss you is cause he s choosing everyday not to be with you i don t want your boyfriend nobody wants your boyfriend that's why he s with you everyone says love hurts when actually love doesn't hurt love didn't leave you for some other girl it didn't cheat on you nor did it break your heart so stop blaming love for once and start blaming the ahole that treated you like crap and gave you up two people who broke up could never be friends but if they are then they were never in love or they still are my ex and i still are im not really sure which is the case lol how come guys exchange facts but its assumed girls are gossiping are in a bad mood but its assumed girls are pmsing are always hungry but its assumed girls need to get in shape and lose weight just dont want a girlfriend but its assumed girls are too ugly to get a guy guys get away with things too easily a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes hope you liked them much lov god bless
