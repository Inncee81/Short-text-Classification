will i get in trouble for writing exempt on my w i would like to stop having taxes withheld from my paychecks i understand that i will still be liable for paying them come tax season is it ok if i go ahead and change my w to exempt i plan on paying my taxes of course just later am i allowed to do this on line where you would claim exempt it says this year i expect to have no tax liability but in your question here you are saying that you do expect to have tax liability it's pretty clear that no you aren't allowed to claim exempt when you don't meet the rules to do so that is true but i've heard of people being able to pay all at tax season for all of you asking why i want to keep my money a little longer it's called interest my portfolio has maintained a yield for the last few years why not squeeze the interest out of what i pay in taxes i'm not worried about not being able to come up with money to pay taxes there is no what if you may only claim exempt if you meet the following tests you had tax liability last year that means that the total tax line of your return was you reasonably expect to have tax liability this year from the sound of your question it appears that you do expect to have a tax liability this year for that reason you may not claim exempt for withholding purposes doing so would constitute filing a fraudulent form w there's a penalty for doing that you need to understand that your taxes are not due and payable on april th they are due and payable as the income is earned on top of the penalty for fraudulent filing you would also face penalties and interest for underpayment of taxes throughout the year that would eat heavily into any interest that you might earn by socking the money away until april th United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) FairTax Tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Flat tax Life insurance Microeconomics Corporation Tax resistance Insurance Tax protester 401(k) Capital gains tax Contract Bond Dividend Salary cap Inheritance tax Credit card Property tax Liability First Amendment to the United States Constitution Article One of the United States Constitution Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Income tax Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Tax avoidance/evasion London Congestion Charge Tennessee State Constitution The Amazing Race Allodial title Income trust Individual Savings Account H-1B visa Dividend imputation Deposit Interest Retention Tax 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Fractional-reserve banking Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Student loan Slander and libel Capitalism Mutual fund Gross domestic product Social Security debate (United States) Variable universal life insurance Tort Limited liability company Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Security (finance) Wal-Mart United States Postal Service Progressive tax Mortgage National Insurance U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Compensation of employees Treaty Tax haven Tax exemption Jizya Form 1040 Administrative law of the United States Freedom of Information Act (United States) Social rule Canadian Senate Scientology U.S. Electoral College Capital punishment British monarchy Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Plame affair Babylonian law Personal finance Express trust Football (soccer) Ponzi scheme Bank fraud Payroll Unemployment benefit 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Hyperinflation U.S. Internal Revenue Service Wealth condensation
