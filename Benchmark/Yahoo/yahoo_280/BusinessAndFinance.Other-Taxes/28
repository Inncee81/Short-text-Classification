minnesota renter's rebate i was wondering if i can still file for my renter's rebate this year almost august even though i didn't file taxes because i didn't work the year before it asks for your total gross income from federal tax return but i don't have one and it asks for mfip benefits received and i do have that from the year so can i still get the rebate just using the mfip and no tax return federal gross income from working thanks for the help i would say that you need to prepare a federal tax return at least doesn't mean that you have to file it but probably should file one to show that you had filed a valid federal return and then you should be able to get your renter's rebate i've attached a link about minnesota renter's rebate and there's no mention of a deadline Taxation in the United States Dividend imputation Tax FairTax Flat tax Gross domestic product Inheritance tax Tax protester Value added tax Warren Buffett Income tax United Kingdom corporation tax Rebate (marketing) Wal-Mart Biodiesel Microeconomics Compensation of employees Measures of national income and output Social Security (United States) German federal election, 2005 Progressive tax Trickle down effect Tax exemption Best Buy Unemployment benefit Minnesota United States Postal Service Life insurance Domestic partnerships in California Form 1040 Student loan National Insurance Edgar Renter__a 401(k) GNU General Public License Commodore 64 Tom DeLay Reaganomics 2004-05 NHL lockout 2003 California recall Plame affair Immigration to the United States Timeline of the 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Public domain Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Matt Hardy Bruce Johnson German car number plates Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Alan Keyes Price discrimination Surplus value Bush v.
