did anyone have an open air toaster it was a toaster that had sides one slice of bread went on each side then you would close it and toast not sure if that is the proper name for it wow buttercup that is so cool i love museums and would love to see the toaster museum thanks for the sites we didn't have an open air toaster but had one that was kind of a frame shaped with a door on each side incidentally the doors got hotter than the devil so we kept a pair of pliers in a kitchen drawer so we could use them on the doors there was no timer on the toaster you just sort of winged it when you thought one side was done you grabbed the pliers opened the doors and used a fork to flip the half toasted bread out of the thing then you turned the bread over and did the other side took forever so my mom used to make toast in the oven for my dad my brother and me and the oven made toast was great as i recall Toast Red Dwarf characters Hot dog Kitchen Microwave oven Breakfast French toast Treehouse of Horror V Barbecue Pop-Tarts Grilling Knife Futurama (TV series - season 5) Futurama (TV series - season 4) Door English muffin Shaggy dog story Cuisine of Denmark Futurama (TV series - season 1) Pliers The Shining (film) Stove Refrigerator D__ner kebab Pulp Fiction French fries Jewish cuisine German cuisine Xiaolin Showdown Fire fighting Series finale Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Murphy's law Opie and Anthony The Toasters Aerial (dance move) Rice pudding Domesticated turkey Saw II Full English breakfast Doug Bacon Toasting Domestic AC power plugs and sockets In-N-Out Burger The Doors Grilled cheese sandwich Amateur telescope making Solar cell McDonald's Sushi RuneScape quests Grandview, U.S.A.
