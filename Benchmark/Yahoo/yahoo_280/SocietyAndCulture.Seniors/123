how pleased am i today my sister came yesterday and the present she brought was wonderful sorry if it sounds a long story but i just have to share this one sis still lives in my home town they have had a heritage day it was funded by the national lottery on display were things from the local museum and old photos of where i lived they also made a book with audio tape which my sis bought me there is a photo of my grandad in there who i adored taken in when he was a founder member of a social club which is still there today except it's bigger and modern now on the display was an original photo of my mum with her mum which i've never seen and my sis has ordered a copy for me that is so special cos i lost my mum when she was in those days no one could afford a home camera like we have today so there are hardly any photos of mum with her mum and i'm just so lucky i will soon have one so my question is how can my day get better than that x i recently managed to get some photos of my mum and her sister who was our favourite aunty taken when mum was about eighteen and aunty was sixteen in just before the first world war so i can imagine how pleased you must be to have them my grandad was in one photo i just remember being taken to see him when i was six years old in he was ill in bed and i looked under the bed and found a wooden truncheon he used to be a special constable he died soon after and i suppose he was in his final days when i saw him Avenue Q The Star Wars Holiday Special EastEnders About a Boy Act of Parliament Paul Is Dead Shaggy dog story Cliff Richard Only Fools and Horses Bro'Town Play School The Aunty Jack Show Social rule C__sis Captain Thunderbolt Girls Aloud The Emancipation of Mimi Bat Boy Wonderland (McFly album) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Copy protection British sitcom Maria Korp 2005 trial of Michael Jackson AFI 100 Years series Roswell UFO incident Oasis (band) Torquay United F.C.
