does it really make a difference if you get a high end digital camera doesn't do raw files i am looking at a really nice camera that doesn't have a raw feature but i've read from a couple of professional photographers that it's really not that important as far as controlling an image when you use software i have read that taking photos in 'raw' format has advantages over regular jpeg files but some professional photographers claim that if you use photoshop you can fix the images that no one can tell the difference what the original format was maybe you can click on the little pencil icon under your question and add details to tell us specifically which camera you are looking at raw would not be necessary for most photography pros might like it for the flexibility that it gives in image adjustments but i would bet that for every raw image that is taken or are taken in jpeg Digital photography JPEG PNG Raw image format Image file formats Photography Digital image editing View camera Windows XP Photograph QuickTime Digital camera Screenshot ImageMagick GIF Traditional animation Panoramic photography Mouse (computing) Tagged Image File Format Macromedia Flash IPhoto Goatse.cx MP3 Camera IPod Canon EOS PlayStation Portable Digital single-lens reflex cameras Konica Minolta Photographic film Exchangeable image file format Apple Computer Stereoscopy JPEG 2000 Charge-coupled device Ebook Dither Technicolor Floppy disk Leica Digital cinema Common Unix Printing System Photographic lens RGB color model Medium format Enterprise content management Macro photography Disk image XML Data compression Nikon Corporation Nikon D70 Computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Geographic information system MiniDisc File format Blog Canon T90 Movie projector ITunes Photojournalism Vorbis DVD Contax Digital video Rangefinder camera StuffIt Circle of confusion AmigaOS Bluetooth High-definition television Closed-circuit television 2D computer graphics Extreme Programming Image Microsoft Office Cinematography Electronic journalism Pixel Reality television Hubble Space Telescope Unicode Typeface Pixel art International Phonetic Alphabet Microsoft Paint PlayStation 3 Yearbook File Allocation Table B3ta Xbox 360 Digital rights management ATI Technologies
