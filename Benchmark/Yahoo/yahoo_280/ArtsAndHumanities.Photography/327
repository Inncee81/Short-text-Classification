should i apply for news photog job my local paper small town circulation est area population est is advertising for a weekend photographer yes i work during the week but i wonder if anyone has any thoughts on what it would be like to be a weekend warrior the ad stipulates that knowledge of digital photography is mandatory but i think i've got that knocked at least to the level required for their publication i've already been published in the paper enough times that i've lost count so i know how to edit and submit to their standards i imagine the job would involve covering some local sports no professional teams festivals and events and the occasional fire or accident just based on what i see running already the geopgraphic area would not have me on the road at all as their circulation area could be circumscribed within a cirlce of about a mile radius you know the demands of the job so talk to me sidebar i admit that part of the attraction is that there is a brand new race track auto under construction miles from home it will be for scca and club events for a few years but i am picturing how nice that press pass would be at times i've worked as a musician in a party band weddings etc and i know what it's like to see people out there who are not expecting to see their dentist in an alternate role i also know what it's like to work with the public when they treat you like a servant instead of the educated person that you are just in case you want to warn me about those aspects of this idea of course my wife would play a major role in my decision is it accepted practice to have an assistant accompany a photographer on jobs with restricted access like a race for instance or is that pushing it too far antoni i don't have a portfolio as such but as i say i've submitted photos before for publication some were novelty shots and some were just newsworthy events where i noticed they were not able to send a photographer i never asked for money but just sent to shot in as a favor i know the publisher formally anyhow and the editor personally and a few of their current photographers if they insist on a degree in photography or a portfolio that's the end of the road for me i know the lack of prior experience of some of their photographers so that would not be a problem if they want a portfolio i'll send them to my flickr site or refer them to my previously published shots haha pali i am not worried about becoming well known as i said this is a small town where i was born and i have lived for years i have a degree of notoriety in town already due to appearing as a musician in a local band in a recently departed life serving on local boards and committees etc my plus would be that i actually already know most of the people i would be photographing and wouldn't have to ask how to spell their name poppa since my kids are grown and out family time is less of a concern but i appreciate your thoughts i do still have my wife to consider and that's the main reason i mentioned taking her with me we can hit the events and run an assignment would be a good excuse to check things out and another assignment would be a good excuse to leave early if the event was not so hot antoni i did a couple of weddings years and years ago as a gift to the bride and groom who could not afford a proper photographer any more than i could afford a proper gift i found that i ended up practically serving as the wedding planner as nobody had a clue what to do next i walked them through the obligatory stages of a reception under the guise of setting up the next picture photographer and wedding organizer i'm building quite a resume for my job app already well i talked to my friend the editor about this position and he said forget it you would be a piece of meat that certainly is not my intention as i would do it only for fun as d put it a weekend fling i have no intention of leaving my career and i also don't want to ruin my love of photography so i have decided to let this opportunity pass on to someone else i appreciate everyone's input and i will give the points to d for adding the perspective that i ought to leave this opening as a way for a younger person who wants a career in photography to get their foot in the door i had not considered that i might be depriving someone of their new career i notice that you are a dentist if i read all your material correctly i am wondering why you might be considering taking a weekend photography for your small town newspaper if you are thinking of making a career change i can understand it but if this is just a weekend fling for you you are not going to like this answer there are many young people out there who would love to start a career in photography and a small town newspaper is a good place to start this kind of a job does not require college or experience only a talent for making a good photograph when needed if you are not considering a career change my opinion is that you will leave this job to be filled by a talented young starting photographer and stick to your own stable and relatively well paying profession i have owned a relatively successful commercial photography studio in the cleveland ohio area for over years it is a difficult profession to start out in if you do not want to make it your profession don't deprive someone who wants to devote their life to photography out of a job opportunity just because you feel that a weekend part time job would be an ego trip Plame affair Education in the People's Republic of China Avenue Q ITV
