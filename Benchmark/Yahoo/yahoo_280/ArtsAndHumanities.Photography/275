what are some interesting ideas to write a book on i really want to write a nonfictional book that includes lots of photography because i'm just as interested in photography as i am in writing i couldn't think of anything that really strikes my interest and i want to use the opportunity i have to drive cross country to include in my book as well any ideas hi as you plan to write non fictional book the experiences you encounter on your road trip will be a good topic to cover as they'll be from your point of view i'm assuming most of the topics would have been covered by most authors and if there's a unique topic to write on i wonder if someone will share but if they do that'll be awesome so i believe what you feel about the country the places you visit and the people you meet will make it an interesting read the life behind the picture will be more interesting than just the picture your experience in a smaller town compared to a bigger similarities dis similarities between towns what do they enjoy how do they enjoy celebrations unique events their role models heroes uniqueness of a place s and ofcourse how you see and how you would describe a place there'll be enough information material to collect in the end you'll have to choose what may interest the readers it's your experience that you would like to share with others Photography Computer Frank Herbert Jacob Neusner Non-fiction Surveillance Digital photography Homeschooling The Chronicles of Narnia Robert A.
