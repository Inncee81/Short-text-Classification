what is a good camera ive been taking pictures with a basic sony digital camera and enjoy it but i want to start taking better quality pictures so what is a good beginner camera that i can take better quality pics with let me parrot what other people have said as well learning photography or at least buying a decent intorduction to photography book will do a lot more than buying a new camera it is always a joy for me to take a friends point and shoot digital camera that supposedly takes horrible photos and take some amazing photos with it just with some simple knowledge about photography to reiterate the point the quality of your photography has more to do with knowledge than camera that said if you are already studying photography i would suggest either a new nikon d or a used d or d the reason for preference for nikon dslr's is simply that i can use my older lenses from the 's and 's with them i am not forced to go out and buy the newest digital lenses Digital photography Photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Single-lens reflex camera Nikon Corporation Digital camera Nikon D70 Stereoscopy Camera Macro photography Leica Panoramic photography Camcorder Canon EOS Cinematography Anamorphic widescreen Photographic lens Digital camera back Panavision Photojournalism Street photography Secure Digital card Point and shoot camera Rangefinder camera Binoculars Underwater photography Closed-circuit television Nikon FE2 Raw image format Digital cinematography Henri Cartier-Bresson Medium format Depth of field Nikon FA Canon EOS-300D Photograph Amateur astronomy Nikon FM2 Cosina Fine art photography Canon Inc.
