digital camera filters ok so i have three filters for my new camera and i kinda have a basic understanding but i was hoping for someone to explain them more and maybe give examples of when to use them they are uv filter flourescent polarizer a uv filter serves primarily as a lens protector it's totally transparent to visible light so it has no effect on the color balance of the image when used with film it could sometimes have the effect of removing a blue cast from an image digital normally has no uv sensitivity though so it really does nothing other than protect the lens a fluorescent filter is used with color film to correct for the color cast of fluorescent lighting and make the photos taken under fluorescent look more neutral with digital it really serves no purpose since you can adjust this in camera using the white balance function a polarizer has two primary functions in photography the first is to remove reflections from non metallic surfaces windows water etc the second is that it can be used in certain scenes to increase color saturation in particular it will darken a blue sky and remove reflections from green foliage to make it appear more green Photography Filter (optics) Digital camera Color temperature Polarization Color Filter (photography) Digital photography Technicolor Stereoscopy Cinematography Enlarger Gamut Sunglasses Microscopy Glass View camera Fluorescent lamp Rendering (computer graphics) Ultraviolet Pixel Camera Liquid crystal display Anaglyph image Infrared Charge-coupled device Laser Color blindness Stage lighting Leica Macro photography Telescope Film Television Observational astronomy Konica Minolta Optical coating NTSC Sun Anamorphic widescreen Oscilloscope Glasses Fluorescence Light Ray tracing Color space Movie projector Dither Antarctic krill Depth of field Digital image editing Fluoroscopy Diode Photographic lens Eye Color theory Motion picture terminology RGB color model Computer animation Diamond Aurora (astronomy) Canon EOS Camcorder Holography Reflecting telescope PNG Lightsaber Bicycle lighting Clementine mission Headlight Traditional animation Rainbow Raw image format Photograph Cloud Eyepiece Panoramic photography Parallax Digital cinema Confocal laser scanning microscopy Computer vision Federal Standard 1037C Contax Cassini-Huygens Optical phenomenon Film speed Zoom lens Iris (anatomy) Bayer filter
