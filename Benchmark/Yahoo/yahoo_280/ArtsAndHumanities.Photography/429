my mom glued my baby pictures and school pictures onto the paper and some onto album pages about years ago is there a way to remove them without ruining the pics i would like to put them in archival albums it would be ideal if you had the original negatives so that you can have them reprinted but i am assuming they are gone in this case then i would suggest before you do anything to have the images scanned after this what i would do is proceed to get a rubbermaid box and a humidifier the basic concept is that you are going to place a sheet of photos inside the box and gradually increase the humidity inside the box until the glue sepparates from the paper as there are a myriad of different types of humidifiers and rubbermaid containers you will have to use your imagination as to how to setup the humidifier box by the way this is a technique which will also work with images affixed to glass the one thing which you really want to avoid is heat as excessive heat will destroy the emulsion of the photograph as these photos are most likely rc prints or resin coated prints they are quite durable as they have an almost plastic like quality to them unlike older yet more aesthetically pleasing fiber based prints on a final note if the humidifier doesn't cause the glue to sepparate from the photo there is one final thing you can do you can always immerse the paper and the photos into a pan of cold water the key is to use cold water because hot water will cause the emulsion on the photo to peel all photos whether you are talking about rc prints or fiber based prints do in fact go through a water bath so as to clean any excessive chemicals off them in particular fix allowing the photos to immerse in cold water should cause the paper to disentegrate but at the same time the paper which is not archivally safe will release acids into the water once the paper is fully saturated with water you can peel the photo from the paper once you peel the photo from the paper i would suggest you run the photos in a continually bath of cold water for a few minutes to get rid of any acids which may have leached into the paper or surface anyhow like i said before you begin any of these procedures get the images scanned first without having the photos in hand and doing an evaluation of what process would work the best it is hard to say which procedure to take Photography Photographic film Solar cell Printed circuit board Plastic Furnace Digital photography Milk Cookware and bakeware Pottery Solar power Water Glass Gramophone record Water purification Photographic paper Collodion process Enterprise content management Welding Traditional animation Magnetic resonance imaging Laser engraving Fiberglass Printmaking Floppy disk Tofu Nuclear power Paper Drawing Sterilization (microbiology) Soldering Jute Stereoscopy Temperature Cold fusion Movie projector Textile manufacturing terminology Aluminium Surrealist techniques Boat building Japanese tea ceremony Hand grenade Cannabis cultivation Upholstery Polyethylene terephthalate Electrophysiology C-41 process Knife Mattress Carbon nanotube Hamster Optical fiber Enlarger Carbon dioxide Technicolor Acne Explosive material Shroud of Turin Energy development Fire fighting Houseplant Etching Drill bit Bread Vitamin C Epoxy Hyperthermia Road-rule enforcement camera Bong Computer virus Tattoo Regular polytope Printing press Coffee Lighting Weathering Swimming Sento Perfume Bookbinding Drowning Color Naval mine Hydroponics Windows Vista Atari 8-bit family Internal ballistics Laser Tooth enamel Chromatography Cancer Brewery Nitrocellulose
