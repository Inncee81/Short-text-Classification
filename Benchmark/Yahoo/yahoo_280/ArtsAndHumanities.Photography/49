blown highlights when a highlight is blown all detail lost it is my understanding that the detail that was there is lost forever my girlfriend however insists that she can bring the detail back from a blown highlight by pulling curves in ps personally it's my opinion that she thinks she can because she can make the highlight look normal can i get a ruling on this is it possible to retrieve details in a blown highlight fhoto my question was not how to avoid blown highlights this i know this disagreement actually arose while i was helping a more inexperienced photographer interpret histograms and blinkies blown on the histogram anything above contains no additional information however some things that are apparently blown just below can be salvaged using curves shadow highlight which uses a totally different algorithm or a variety of other techniques further images that were shot in raw can sometimes have their highlights salvaged due to the increased dynamic range that is captured recorded just past the edges of the histogram and can be pulled back in during raw conversion other than that as the other answerers stated you can clone or burn but in that case you are disguising the blown highlights not recovering them so if its truly blown beyond even the increased dynamic range of the raw file if applicable then no it can't be recovered Digital photography PNG Histogram Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Digital image editing Bob and George Megatron Autism Public-key cryptography Plame affair XML Expert system Linked list Classical music era Obi-Wan Kenobi Vegeta Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Windows Vista Scientology beliefs and practices Radix sort Memento (film) Professional wrestling match types Cognitive science Sin City Link (Legend of Zelda) Virtual memory Internal ballistics Automatic number plate recognition Dynamical system Logic Boba Fett Drill bit Wind power Artificial neural network Geographic information system Handloading Audio data compression Abduction Phenomenon Dither Glen Jacobs Curve Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Supply and demand Philosophy of language Algebraic geometry Database Second language acquisition Super Nintendo Entertainment System Holography Shawn Michaels Gravity Bubble Bobble Computer forensics Knife Labour economics Darth Vader The Invisibles MP3 Transformation problem Windows XP Transmission Control Protocol John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Day of the Daleks Items in the Metroid series Panoramic photography Black hole Stone Cold Steve Austin Fractal Microeconomics Digital cinema Datatype Land use forecasting Princess Zelda C programming language A Course In Miracles Aikido 9/11 conspiracy theories Rendering (computer graphics) Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 IBM PC compatible The Death Gate Cycle Piccolo Junior Saga Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Computer vision Drawing Humpback Whale Comet Normal distribution Password Raw image format Karl Rove OpenDocument Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Redundant array of independent disks Syphon Filter Planetary orbit Teller-Ulam design
