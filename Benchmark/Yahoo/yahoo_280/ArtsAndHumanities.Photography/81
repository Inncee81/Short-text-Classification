thoughts on a long exposure photo http www flickr com photos thejokker thats fine its an old shot of mine and i wasnt sure how much i liked it there is no real focal point in the photo your cover on the table stands out as well as your face but they just make your eyes wander back and forth between them too much your eyes should either immediately go to the focal point or have them led to it by the way the photo is composed in your photo my eye is lead no where it just keeps looking for something to lock onto and it's also a bad use of long exposure you face and body is blurry becaused you moved during the long exposure lighting seems good so there is no need for a long shutter speed but not all is bad i was looking through your photostream i too am a flickr com user and came across a photo i really really like http www flickr com photos thejokker in set it's good in every way i especially love the white outline of her head View camera Flickr Photography Stereoscopy London Canon T90 Depth of field Shutter speed Film speed F-number Eyepiece Digital photography Butterfly HyperText Transfer Protocol Cinematography Macro photography Panoramic photography Aperture Professional wrestling throws Single-lens reflex camera Sutro Tower Konica Minolta Remora Suplex World Wide Web Equine conformation Domain Name System Enlarger Movie projector Professional wrestling attacks Time-lapse Professional wrestling holds Street photography Shutter (photography) Professional wrestling aerial techniques Automatic number plate recognition Uniform Resource Locator Shen Gong Wu Volleyball Saturniidae Exposure (photography) HTML element Drill bit Twelve Swords of Power The Long Game Rangefinder camera Columbine High School massacre Rafflesia Boxing Table tennis Knife Death Note 2005 Kashmir earthquake Snooker Glossary of climbing terms Tae eul ju Pinball Phishing Saccade Physical attractiveness Canon EOS Autopsy Contax Parallax Bhagavad Gita Mouse (computing) GunZ The Duel Color temperature Boom Town (Doctor Who) SX-70 Nikon FA Photo sharing Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Who Framed Roger Rabbit Spatial disorientation Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Website Railway signal Ajax (programming) PlayStation Portable Camcorder SAML Photographic lens Bad Wolf Wood carving Lens (optics) Billiards Photographic film Eye The Parting of the Ways Laser engraving Nikon FE Where No One Has Gone Before (TNG episode) Albinism Archery The Shining (film) Second Life Quotation mark
