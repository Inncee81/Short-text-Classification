why do you think some people do not like taking photographs photography is ok for me i'm certainly not an enthusiat but there're always people disliking taking photographs not only of themselves but also others i can't understand why isn't is good to have some of your memories saved in a hardware some people aren't comfortable taking their own pictures so they settle for second hand memories pictures someone else took it takes time and practice to do any new skill some don't care to learn it others are afraid of being judged harshly that's too bad to me photography is a personal art form and journal those are memories that will last notice what people do when a flood or tornado comes besides the family treasures they save the photos i think that says a lot don't you but i don't mind if a person doesn't want to take pictures that's their choice however it is a bit imposing to ask can you take a picture for us or can we get a copy of that i mean i'm flattered but there are times i've missed the photo i wanted because i was preserving someone else's memory with today's cameras it's easier than ever all one has to do is try Photography Theory of conduct Stereoscopy Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Photograph Social rule Digital photography Surveillance Time Out of Mind Aesthetic Realism Humphrey Bogart Photojournalism Panoramic photography Kender Traditional animation Digital camera Henri Cartier-Bresson Dyslexia Unemployment W.
