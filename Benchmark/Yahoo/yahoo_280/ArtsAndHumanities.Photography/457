i'm taking my senior portraits today and i'm not looking forward to it i dont really know what i want to wear and i've got pimples all over my forehead and i just dont feel up to it but i've re scheduled about times so i have to take them today what can i do to make myself feel better it's not that i'm not confident it's just that i dont feel ready the first piece of advice i have for you is to wear something new even if it is just a new piece of jewelry or borrow something from someone this always makes me feel special rather than just wearing something that i always wear as for the pimples i know that it sucks to have blemishes and you dont fell you look your best when your skin isnt clear i take senoir pictures on the side and for my clients if they ask i photoshop out their blemishes on the pictures that they what to print i do it for free but some places might charge a little extra for it it never hurts to ask also don't cake on alittle of makeup to cover them up sometimes this just draws attention to the area smile and be confident and the attention will be drawn to your smile rather than your forhead for a more natural smile think of something that makes you happy or better yet bring a friend along they will make you feel more comfortable and make you smile i hope that this advice helps alittle good luck Atomic Kitten Social rule Plame affair Care Bears Visit of King George IV to Scotland Mr. T Billboard (advertising) Jennifer Lopez Jon Secada Current teachings of Prem Rawat 613 mitzvot Aerial (dance move) Poker jargon Birthday Titanic (1997 film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Sin City Upholstery Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Our Friends in the North Mattress Pitaten Drawing Characters of Naruto James T.
