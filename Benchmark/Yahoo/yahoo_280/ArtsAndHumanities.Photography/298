digitizing old photographs i'm currently trying to digitize all my old photos including those b w ones by scanning it and compiling it in digitize format for easy storage and organize in chronological order the question is how much resolution do i have to set my scanner to scan at for optimum quality storage files those photos are mostly x in does scanning it at a higher resolution like dpi better than dpi will it enable the file to print larger like x with equal quality to those print at x please advice thank you on question we must also consider about the optimum size of the files don't think it's sensible to scan a x in photos with dpi resolution and result in a mb file size dpi dots per inch so basically the higher the number the better the quality of the scan using the higher resolution will allow you to enlarge the picture without losing much quality too Dots per inch Image scanner Digital photography Pixel Photography Raster graphics Tagged Image File Format Digital camera Photographic film Video codec Ebook Typeface Television Image file formats Windows Vista High-definition television Mouse (computing) Enterprise content management Geographic information system Digital Digital video Anamorphic widescreen Widescreen Digital circuit Video Laserdisc Compact disc Portable Document Format CompactFlash Digital camera back Floppy disk ZX Spectrum Digital television Sudoku DVD Halftone Digital image editing Photograph Stereoscopy Magnetic resonance imaging PNG Digital cinema Hash table JPEG Display resolution MP3 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Aspect ratio (image) Internet pornography Computer Color printing Atari 8-bit family Photojournalism PlayStation Portable Oscilloscope ATSC Videotape PostScript H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Audio data compression Macro photography Camcorder MPEG-2 Film preservation View camera VHS Medium format OpenVMS Betacam Gamut Computer printer C programming language BASIC programming language IPod Bluetooth Functional magnetic resonance imaging Map Panoramic photography Unicode Xerox Digital cinematography USB flash drive Atari ST Computed tomography Biometrics Compiler Redundant array of independent disks Halting problem Information Technology Infrastructure Library Memory Stick Raw image format Moir__ pattern Binary and text files Debian Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Movie projector Gmail
