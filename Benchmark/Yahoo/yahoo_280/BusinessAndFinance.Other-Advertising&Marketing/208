what would you do if selling something through paypal and the recipients address is nigeria the person has asked for an invoice for the goods from me paid the money even after i explained that what they want to pay for my item is too much money as its cheaper to buy brand new they still paid it and the shipping address is nigeria does it sound dodgy to anybody in paypal it doesnt say the money has been received but i did have an email from what looks to be from paypal saying this person has made the transaction she says she lives in the us and the goods she purchased are to be sent to her son in a missionary school in lagos nigeria edit auction overpayment fake check in another updated scam the scammer offers to buy some expensive item e g jewelry or a car that the prospective victim advertised on ebay for example or a legitimate classified ads website such as craigslist by official certified bank or cashier's check the check will have an accidentally or mutually agreed higher value than the price of the item so the scammer asks the victim to wire the extra money to some third party as soon as the check clears because banks in the usa are required by law to honor a check within working days even before a check has cleared they will report the proceeds as available for withdrawal before the check is presented to the issuing bank for clearance and the fraud is discovered most banks will hold the victim accountable for the value of the counterfeit check there is a simple way to avoid many instances of ebay auction overpayment fraud the scammer usually or always wants to buy the merchandise immediately so if the auction offers a buy it now option the scammer will use it to end the auction request shipping and offer the overpayment if the seller detects the scam and refuses to sell the item they risk the scammer posting negative feedback therefore if the seller avoids offering buy it now the scammer will be able only to send the seller a message requesting to buy the item immediately for an overpayment the seller can then deny or simply ignore the request the scammer does have the option of participating in and winning the auction because the check they'll use is fraudulent they can bid however much is necessary if a seller's auction is ended by someone clicking buy it now there is still a way to detect scamming the buyer will ask the seller to ship to a different address the buyer will hide the address until he she sends the seller a shipping label to print the shipping label's information may reveal a faraway address often in lagos nigeria that the seller may not have wanted to ship to however this is often not the case anymore most scammers are simply after the cash from the return of the overpayment and do not want the item unless it is highly valuable to the scammer such as cell phones and laptops the shipping address many times is real and located in the u s in this case the address is usually a mule another scam victim who has been conned or otherwise convinced into accepting the packages and either forwarding them to the scammer or holding them indefinitely a variation on the ebay scam involves sending a request for payment for an item that the alleged seller does not own but the scammer claims they have sent since actual ebay item numbers are used this has been a nuisance for legitimate sellers Bank fraud Neopets E-mail spam Diablo II: Lord of Destruction PayPal Electronic commerce Spam (electronic) MMORPG Mutual fund Plame affair Supply and demand MapleStory Mail-order bride Stopping e-mail abuse Insurance Life insurance Islamic banking Arbitrage Fraud Scam baiting Credit card Live 8 Tax Surveillance Mortgage United States Postal Service Credit card fraud Illegal drug trade Bulk vending Money Pyramid scheme Click fraud Estoppel Something Awful Forums Make money fast Liberty Dollar Wal-Mart Gmail Google Annuity Bank Autograph Money supply Option Price discrimination Short selling Schabir Shaik Trial Futures contract Warranty Real estate broker Automatic teller machine Hyperinflation Bond Something Awful Best Buy Advertising Stock Oil-for-Food Programme Network effect Online auction business model Rational pricing Monopoly (game) Mensal__o scandal Anonymity Commodity markets Art forgery Derivative (finance) Amazon.com Financial markets Bluetooth Call option Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Poker jargon Dot-com ROM image CPU cache 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio FairTax Data retention Privatization Social Security debate (United States) Cheque Conveyancing
