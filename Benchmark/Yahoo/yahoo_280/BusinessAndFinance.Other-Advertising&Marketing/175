adult content or not please only read if you are years of age the following are navel rings which would you consider adult content should i separate them from the display that everyone sees in my store and if so should i put them under the counter and only show them to persons over or just put them on the counter in a different area navel rings sex sells porn star s l u t sexy virgin b i t c h pimp tastes like chicken orgasm donor f u c k you f u c k c u m guzzler blow me strippers rule horny tie me up bend over b i t c h sex slave i'm wet xtc a pot leaf two venus signs interlocked lesbian sign a gay pride triangle little angel born naked an eight ball tongue rings lick me pillow biter two venus signs interlocked lesbian sign sexy eat me b i t c h sorry about the little symbols in the descriptions it is the closest characters i could come up with to show what the picture on the 'ring' looks like and yes i already have a good idea of which ones are adult i just want your opinions which ones could i place in the normal display if any i would say put the sexy pimp because some kids think that means cool that's pimp gay pride ones little angel and eight ball in the normal counter and the others put in a separate counter but not necessarily off limits because any kid that has a belly or tongue ring that is under age most likely knows about that stuff anyway i mean i doubt you get troops of five year old kids walking through your store buying rings maybe put them where not everyone is going to automatically look at them unless they are really looking because i doubt that you would card people each time they came in the store and how would people know about them unless you showed them it's not like people are going to walk in and say you don't happen to have any eat me rings right and they have things that say b and such at stores like clairs which is predominately for younger teen girls anyway and also by keeping them hidden that would leave you to judge who you think would be interested and not put off by you offering to show them those a girl could walk in in complete office attire and then what do you think she would be angry that you thought she was like that or she might be a closet freak either way i wouldn't want to be put in the situation Pornography Friends Trailer Park Boys Gay slang Drawn Together Motion picture rating system Little Britain Prostitution Avenue Q Pornographic movie Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Jumping the shark Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Weebl and Bob Married... with Children Gay bathhouse Sex toy About a Boy Marilyn Monroe Bisexuality Howard Stern Human sexual behavior Asperger syndrome Strap-on dildo AVN Awards Teen Girl Squad Hentai Surveillance Same-sex marriage in the United States Our Gang Professional wrestling match types Kylie Minogue Sinfest Pornography in Japan Child pornography Ranma __ characters Stuttering Poker jargon Gender role Anal sex Garfield Gay Humphrey Bogart The Inside Laura Schlessinger El Goonish Shive The Best Page in the Universe Homosexuality in Japan American Psycho Homosexuality Great Teacher Onizuka Futurama (TV series - season 5) Infantilism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hazing Gay rights Sexual orientation Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Male prostitute Ocean's Twelve FoxTrot Knots Landing Pedophilia Sex and the City Magic (illusion) Will & Grace Striptease Transsexuality Jam (TV series) SpongeBob SquarePants Something Positive Revolutionary Girl Utena Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Toilet Boogie Nights Age of consent Puberty Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Family Guy John Holmes (actor) Lesbian Naruto jutsu South Park Professional wrestling holds Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jennifer Lopez George Costanza Child sexual abuse
