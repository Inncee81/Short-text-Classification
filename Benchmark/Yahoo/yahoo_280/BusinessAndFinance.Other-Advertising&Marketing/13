sales do you think it would be an effective strategy to hire a small army of outside sales people to sell my t shirts and i would give them bucks a sell plus a small bonus and do you think it would be okay to ask for orders and payment in advance all good advice i'm gonna have to let you guys vote for it thanks to all for the ear and the advice do you make custom shirts to order or do you have a bunch of shirts made up already if you have them made up already you will sell more put the salespeople out there with premade ones and do the commission a shirt and if they sell in one day or whatever the number just under the highest sales for the day are now they get an extra for customized shirts have your staff take orders and if it has a persons name on them it would have to be paid in full at the time of the order most likely unless you have a nice display or can do them up at the time of the sale you won't do too many of these if you have a storefront or you personally go to small businesses stores builders etc and show samples of custom made shirts that you can sell for less than the regular stores do because you have no overhead you could do multiples on things that way Real estate broker Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
