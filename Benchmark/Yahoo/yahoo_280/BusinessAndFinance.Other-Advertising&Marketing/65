photographing a public golf course legal question the next time i play my favorite golf course i want to take a digital picture of one of my favorite holes and use it as the background image for online and print advertising for my business can i get into big trouble for this probably not this is the section of law called torts whereby you would pay money for the damage the course owner suffered because of you using the photo will the course owner suffer damages it's hard to see how they could and in most cases if they objected they would simply ask you to stop using the photo and never file suit against you however if your actions became known and the course objected the course management could legally refuse to allow you to play the course in the future it's probably much safer is you use the photo and don't identify the course by name and you could always make the photo write and ask permission and then use the photo whether you have permission or not but you'd have a chance of using the photo with permission realistically unless your company is huge the course will probably never become aware of your usage if you took a photo from the internet and that photo was copyrighted about the copyright owner could sue you without showing damages Copyright Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Fair use SCO-Linux controversies Public domain Tort Copyleft Intellectual property Contract Google MAME Tort reform Negligence Enterprise content management Copyright infringement of software Digital rights management Spyware Recording Industry Association of America Software patent debate First-sale doctrine ROM image Electronic Frontier Foundation Microsoft Personality rights Scientology versus The Internet Prior restraint Photography Copy protection United States Postal Service Copyright law of the United Kingdom Privacy SCO v.
