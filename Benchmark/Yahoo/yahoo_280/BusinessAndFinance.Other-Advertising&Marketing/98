how long on ebay does it take after listing an item for it to show up in search results im selling items on ebay and when i go to my ebay then to the items im selling its been over an hour since it says they started but when i search them on ebay they dont show up in the search results what happened it can take a couple of hours between and a lot of people will usually increase the cost of mailing an item by an additional cents and using the extra cents you can set a time and day for when your item begins selling that way their website ebay has enough time to set up your item and give it the full amount of time instead of listing it right away keep in mind since your item will end at the same time you listed it as either hours days etc you can also set up the time to cooridinate when your item is finished Amazon.com Live 8 Neopets Network effect Online auction business model Gmail Topps Labour economics Yahoo!
