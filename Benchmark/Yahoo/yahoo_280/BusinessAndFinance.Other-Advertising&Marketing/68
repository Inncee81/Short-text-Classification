how do i advertise for a tag sale without putting signs on public property our town has recently passed an ordinance banning all signs from public property including street signs tree belts and telephone poles the main way most people advertise is by putting a sign up at the nearby intersection and another at the end of the street however with the new ordinance no one can do that any more i live on a side street that doesn't get much traffic how can i attract potential customers to my tag sale while avoiding the fine that goes along with putting signs up it sounds as if you are a in a small town go to your local radio station i work for a major market cluster and more and more businesses of all sizes are turning to radio i am not quite sure how long the sign ordinance will last when's the next election for city council however for the time being go with radio it's top of mind if the message is clear and concise and not super long you should be able to drive more traffic to your business i am guessing the station's rates are reasonable look at value not prime and just make sure you create a compelling message i wish you well Advertising Billboard (advertising) West Side Highway Lechaina U.S. Highway 1 Traffic light Direct marketing Ethernet Traffic Woodlands, Singapore Interstate Highway Network effect Music radio Road safety BBC Vehicular cycling Laws of Singapore American Broadcasting Company Political campaign Tobacco advertising Leicester City Centre Management Rules of the road Suburbs of Johannesburg Street Cable television U.S. Highway 66 London Piccadilly Circus Broadband Internet access Grand Theft Auto III UK Singles Chart Computer and video games Bike lane debate Radio Pulaski Skyway Government of France Tag Ann Arbor, Michigan Loudspeaker Beverly Hills, California San Gabriel Valley Boston, Massachusetts Spam (electronic) Freeway Windermere, Florida WNEP-TV Nintendo GameCube Nottingham Citigroup Grand Forks, North Dakota Shopping mall E-mail spam Long Island Rail Road Elis Prefecture Reading, Berkshire Street furniture World Championship Wrestling Queen Street West Intellectual property RSA America Online Search engine optimization King City, Ontario RKO Pictures CPU cache U.S. Highway 91 Filling station Television in the United States AT&T Rugby, Warwickshire Highway Drag racing Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Transportation of Los Angeles Single Transferable Vote Trademark Marketing Northamptonshire Taxation in the United States Sioux City, Iowa Zoning Internet fraud XERF Grand Central Terminal Air traffic control Electrophysiology Prime Minister of the United Kingdom West University Place, Texas Birmingham Spice Girls Shrewsbury President of Ireland Surveillance Cape Town James Hahn Sydney Pacific, Missouri Public-key cryptography
