what's wrong with hacked pokemon i've seen that some people don't like hacked cheated pokemon why are they weaker please answer it depends on how you hack your pokemon hacked pokemon can be hacked beyond the normal limits nintendo put on pokemon so for instance you can put higher than maximum values on certain attributes such as attacks and defense or give pokemon abilities and moves that they cannot normally learn this is blatant cheating and if detected relatively easily by nintendo could bar you from playing online unfairly against others hacked pokemon can also be made to have the best natures modest to maximise their stats special attack for their moves as long as they are hacked to have maximum allowed values and no more it's dificult to detect that they are hacked as they occur naturally in the game and be bred and trained to these values these pokemon are a little unfair but as they fall within the limits of the game they are not abnormal and can be passed off as normal pokemon Cheating in Counter-Strike Pok__mon Abilities Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon Gold and Silver Missingno.
