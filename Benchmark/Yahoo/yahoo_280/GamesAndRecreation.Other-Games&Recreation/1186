how do you play how do you play light as a feather stiff as a board you know that weird game that they always play at sleepovers that always looks so fun i wana float in mid air hehe found this while i was looking for something else and remembered that someone had asked hope it helps you there's other sleepover games at that site too light as a feather stiff as a board ingredients just add guests to play the basic premise of this game is to have one person lie on the floor while everyone else sits on his or her knees around her with both hands slightly under her there is one storyteller who sits by the head and tells a made up story about the person on the floor's life and her untimely demise at the end of the story everyone chants light as a feather stiff as a board repeatedly as they lift her off of the ground the idea is to have everyone believing that spirits are helping to lift her off the ground in reality she is probably being lifted because of all the people helping to lift her take turns and tell a story about everyone Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Suplex Professional wrestling holds Volleyball Badminton Professional wrestling attacks 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Comanche Mattress Escape from New York Whose Line Is It Anyway?
