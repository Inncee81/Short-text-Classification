can someone explain how selling things at gamestop works who do i go to and how much do i get for example how much would i get if i sold a old psp and a nba game how does it exactly work you go in and talk to the guys at the counter they will scan the items and find out how much trade in value you can get for it if you elect store credit you can then buy other games and the store credit will be deducted from your balance some stores will allow you to get cash but there is usually a steep cut in price for cash as opposed to store credit if you don't want to spend all the money at the time and you have an edge card i think it costs like bucks and you get an extra on trade ins and off used games they can put the excess on the edge card for you to use later you can use the credit for anything in the store games consoles pre orders accessories you name it Wal-Mart PlayStation 3 N-Gage Octopus card Credit card Nintendo Video game crash of 1983 Microeconomics Nintendo DS Citigroup RuneScape economy Sears Holdings Corporation Supermarket Los Angeles Clippers Bulk vending Computer and video games Internet fraud $ale of the Century Nintendo GameCube Money supply Final Fantasy XI Animal Crossing MapleStory Commodity PlayStation 2 Oyster card Best Buy Arbitrage Retailer PlayStation Portable Commodore 64 Poker jargon Surveillance Money Hybrid vehicle Capitalism Bond Electronics Boutique Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Slot machine Betting (poker) Handheld game console Paintball Tax Game Boy Inventory Neopets Hyperinflation Commodore International Bank Loyalty program Supply-side economics Nintendo Entertainment System Corporate finance Aldi Monetary policy Atari 2600 Gold standard Console wars Food Stamp Program Major League Baseball television contracts EFTPOS Electronic Arts Loss leader Password (video games) RuneScape cheats Textbook Capital accumulation Magic: The Gathering Electronic commerce Argos (retailer) Deflation (economics) Finance Confidence trick Monopoly (game) PC Engine MetroCard Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Warren Buffett Short selling New York Knicks Islamic banking Counter-Strike The Sims 2 Advanced Squad Leader Let's Make a Deal Online shop Interest Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas MMORPG Futures contract Topps Game show Xbox 360 TurboGrafx 16 Intellectual property Sony Computer Entertainment Mortgage
