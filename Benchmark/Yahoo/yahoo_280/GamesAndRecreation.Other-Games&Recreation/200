how to smoke hi i have been smoking since i know several tricks like the french inhale and smoke rings but when i smoke i only pull the smoke out and let it stay in the mouth i just recently found this new fetish when people take in smoke and breathe it inside there lungs and they begin taking without smoke coming out from their mouth after they talk they breath the smoke out i tried it but i get coughs is there a proper way of doing this it's called actully smoking you're not inhaling it you need to actully smoke and inhale i would really recommend not trying it and just keep pulling it in your mouth once you get used to it not coughing it's real hard to quit i started years ago i'm and now i smoke packs a day and spend almost a month Bong Lung cancer Pneumonia Cancer of the larynx Cigarette Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Drowning Smoking pipe Common cold Cannabis (drug) Bronchitis Fire fighting Lung Hand grenade Air pollution Nicotine Cocaine Breastfeeding Inhalant Legionellosis Asbestos Carbon dioxide Smoke-screen Diving regulator Cystic fibrosis Shaggy dog story 2001 anthrax attacks Breaststroke Smoking fetishism Mechanical ventilation Hookah Mojave people Emphysema Firefighter Tightlacing Coconut crab Pneumoconiosis Smoking ban Hydrogen sulfide Tobacco Cancer The Inside Tetrapod Medical cannabis Diving Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Kretek Cigar Butterfly stroke Acute respiratory distress syndrome Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cigarette Smoking Man Cyanide Causality Daylight saving time Swimming The One With the Thumb Breath Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pink Floyd trivia Survivor (novel) Frogman Gas mask Toilet humour First aid Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Health issues and the effects of cannabis Dead Like Me Lung volumes Backstroke STS-51-L Circular breathing Liquid breathing Rebreather Snus Gerund Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Doom enemies Body piercing Late Night with Conan O'Brien USS Abner Read (DD-526) Fishing Xenon The Wack Pack Reptile Blue Whale Sub-Zero Methamphetamine Front crawl Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency Magic (illusion) Suicide methods Pneumothorax Hypercapnia Arguments for and against drug prohibition Sport rowing
