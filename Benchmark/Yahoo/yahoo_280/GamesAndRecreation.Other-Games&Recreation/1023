splinter cell double agent help on xbox im quite far into it im in jba compound and been exposed as a nsa traitor i refused to shoot the hostage who was captured my boss and have now killed all jba members but now i dont know where to go running around aimlessly any help would be appreciated you've come very close to finishing the game in games like sc da you should be very watchful and aware of the surroundings coz every area is been designed with some importance anyway dont worry you are not in a helpless situation at the start of that level after killing that jba guy who points a gun at you to kill the nsa leader your boss you should take a retina scan on that jba guy's eye coz without that scan you cannot proceed any further once you've done that you must go to the restricted area floor where you get jba members' private rooms n lounge are i hope you've got the voice recordings of one of those jba members' voices from the previous levels the easiest route to those upper floors is through the fire exit stair case or you can take the other entrance to the restricted area where those chemical mine producing machine is but i'm taking the fire exit stair case so go up the stairs and come to the door where you have to place the voice recording then enter from that door and turn right and walk straight down passing the corridor to the jba leader's room then turn left walk a bit and turn right go to the end of that corridor and you'll get a identity checking door enter from that door by placing that retina scanned sample you got from that jba guy at the start of the level then go through that corridor and turn left where you get another door i cant remember exactly whether you have to show an identity there as well but you'll be fine thats actually a lift enter that lift and go down so i think i've sufficiently answered to your question enjoy the rest of that level this game is all worth playing Stairway Conspiracy (TNG episode) G-Man (Half-Life) Escape from New York Natural Selection (computer game) Perfect Dark Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Tenshinhan Columbine High School massacre Max Payne Metal Gear (video game) Sin City Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Syphon Filter The Shining (film) James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing Fire fighting Blood (computer game) Aerial (dance move) The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Glossary of partner dance terms Shaggy dog story The Ark in Space Rose (Doctor Who) The Champions Bristol Grammar School Poker jargon Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) 11001001 (TNG episode) Eggerland series Combine (Half-Life 2) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Legends of the Hidden Temple The Invisibles K' Bad Wolf Team Fortress Classic Time Crisis 3 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Swingout Conker's Bad Fur Day StarCraft: Uprising The Tomb of the Cybermen Metroid Prime Door Dalek (Doctor Who episode) The Doctor Dances The Star Wars Holiday Special Bubble Bobble Elevator The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Mario series enemies Terminal ballistics Blackjack The Parting of the Ways Railway platform Doom enemies Castle of the Winds Eastern Illinois University Cube (film) Halting problem Banjo-Tooie Wolfenstein 3D Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater The End of the World (Doctor Who) Pyramids of Mars Photography Super Mario 64 Colony in Space Tag Wood carving Docklands Light Railway The Caves of Androzani Items in the Metroid series Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME GunZ The Duel Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Surveillance Resident Evil 4 The Curse of Fenric Muni Metro Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Professional wrestling throws British national identity card Tank The Mysterious Planet Eye Battle Frontier RoboCop
