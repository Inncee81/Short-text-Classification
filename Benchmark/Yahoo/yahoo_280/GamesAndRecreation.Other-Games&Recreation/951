why don't my guppies eat something wrong is it ammonia levels i was gone all weekend and my guppies couldn't be fed i figured they would be alright since it was only days anyway i came back to find both my males dead one of my yellow females also dropped her fry one baby and the pregnant orange and blue female looked very sickly both the mothers did although the fry was active quickly i removed both the males and put a bit of food in the tank to see if they would eat i was mainly concerned about the fry none of the fish went to the top to feed and the females were both in one corner of the tank just floating and very lazy i moved the fry into a pitcher of tank water and put a bit of food on top which he gladly ate after about two minutes of him eating i put him back and took his mother she barely ate even though i left her in there for a good minutes i couldn't get the orange female very pregnant one in there so i left her my question is whats wrong both the females are very slow and continued lazy and seem to have no interest of eating or swimming a few times their tails have been higher than their bodies in this sort of look i know they're sick but whats wrong i'm worried about the fry should i continue feeding him by removing him from the tank or should i purchase sinking pellets what about the females is there any medicine i can buy to help them regain activity levels i also had a thought about ammonia how do i test this and how to i lower it for them what else do i have to do to their water i condition it but what else should i buy today is it the size of the tank i've got guppies in a gallon with a hour filter running is that the problem please help me are you sure they have not simply eaten without you seeing they should be eating at some point if they are not then something is wrong good luck Sea-Monkey Shark Goldfish Fish farming Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Knots Landing Breastfeeding Marine aquarium Shaggy dog story E85 Sewage treatment Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Hydrogen economy Piccolo Junior Saga Pregnancy Fugu Egg (food) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dairy Clownfish Hypoglycemia Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ecco the Dolphin Carbon dioxide Brewery Veganism 1957 World Series Philip J.
