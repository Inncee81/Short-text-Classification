turtwig chimchar piplup or other what is the best starter pokemon i think it's piplup you can pick up decent grass and water pokemon pretty early in the game fire pokemon are harder to come by the earliest one is ponyta and they are really a bit rubbish until you get them to a high lvl due to this chimchar is prob the best pick its dual type of fire fighting is a nice combination too i would usually bypass fighting pokemon in my team yet have a single type fire pokemon being able to have one pokemon with both types is very handy my team i started with chimchar then picked up budew and psyduck pretty early on and had my full team that i used for the elite before i even reached the second gym golem alakazam and staraptor completed the lineup Pok__mon types Pok__mon Abilities Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Charizard Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon (video games) Alakazam Orre Bomberman Pok__mon Red and Blue Missingno.
