rate my pokemon diamond team i just need some suggestions and ratings for my pokemon team im also getting a wifi connection usb soon and was wonderin if this team will be good enough to be a match for opponents over wifi i have never used any action replays gameshark codes etc so dont think i hacked this team heres my team dialga lvl thunder fire blast earth power roar of time giratina lvl shadow force energy ball earth power fly dragonite lvl surf thunderbolt draco meteor blizzard infernape lvl blast burn close combat flamethrower fury swipes luxray lvl strength discharge thunder crunch heatran lvl heat wave fire blast earth power dark pulse any suggestions will be greatly appreciated thanks also if ur just gonna say pokemon sucks or its gay just dont bother answering ok dialga nice but i think you should get flame trower instead of fire blast beacuse of the pp and of the accuracy the same for thunger try getting thunderbolt instead girantina nothing to do with it perfect dragonite i have also a gragonite but i think his move set should be dragon pulse flaem troweer for ice weaknesses surf and im still not sure which is better fly or thunderbolt but since one of your pokemon will or shall have thunderbolt then teach him fly or maybe aerthquake infernape not one of my faavorite pokemon but i cant understan why having to fire type pokemon if you stil want it in your team then teach him a better fighting move else than close combat because that way yopu will lose defense and your opponent will take advantage of that teach him gras knot for the water weaknesses how about changing him for lucario luxray good job i think i needs no change at all for an electric type i prefer having ampharos heatran still haven't catch him but his moves are great im not sure it can learn any electric move but it would helps for the water weaknesses i will give ya' i think taht maybe this wasnt what you wanted to hear but i think is the best i also havent battled on wi fi but i will try so i can battle you i will e mail you so you can rate my team hope it helps Pok__mon types Pok__mon Abilities Aggron Charizard Dragonite Bagon Pok__mon Trading Card Game Diablo II: Lord of Destruction GunBound Naruto jutsu Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Items in the Metroid series YuYu Hakusho Diablo II Lightning Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Wild ARMs 2 Piccolo Junior Saga R-Type Marathon (computer game) Mewtwo Quake III Arena RuneScape weapons Static (superhero) Internal ballistics Son Gohan Explosive material Power Rangers: SPD Vegeta Metroid Prime Shen Gong Wu P-47 Thunderbolt Warrior (World of Warcraft) Orre Rayquaza Directed-energy weapon Characters of Naruto Fast bowling RuneScape Maverick (Mega Man) Pok__mon Crystal StarCraft StarCraft Secret Missions Skarmory Pok__mon Gold and Silver Thunderbolts (comics) Tank A-10 Thunderbolt II Raichu Fire fighting Altaria Final Fantasy magic Terran (StarCraft) Sacrifice (computer game) Pok__mon Live!
