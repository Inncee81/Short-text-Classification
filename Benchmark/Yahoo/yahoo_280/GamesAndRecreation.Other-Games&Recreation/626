pokemon diamond please what are the codes are everyone talking about in pokemon diamond people keep saying that they have or so masterballs and are doing something with them to find the pokemon they want what is this all about also please rate my team mr mime lvl physic substitute trick recycle dialga lvl metal claw dragon claw roar of time ancientpower gastrodon lvl surf waterfall strenght body slam roselia lvl giga drain ingrain cut toxic spikes infernape lvl flame wheel rock climb rock smash dig kadabra lvl newly caught oh yeah what tms could i teach my pokemon to make them better and where do you get earthquake what are friend codes and how do you use them can wifi be activated in ireland because i cant use it and how do you get to the end of victory road i dont know anything about the codes but i can rate your team first of all if you want a good team you must delete all the hm move from your pokemon such as rock smash since they are rubbish and teach them all to bibarel infernape is speedy and boasts offensive stats but is weak against water so you could send it out with gastrodon in a double battle whose ability storm drain will absorb water and none will hit infernape i think you need to re arrange your team so that you have each pokemon protecting the other but apart from that its okay you only need one psychic type as two will make your team weaker towards speedy and powerful ghost and dark types i would replace one of the psychic types with a staravia of a normal flying type that has a strong attack as they can bring down legendary pokemon easily with hyper beam since they attack first and hyper beam's attack power is boosted since the pokemon is the normal type also in tactical battles you could send out gastrodon with a normal flying type as the flying moves will protect gastrodon from its one weakness grass and the ground type of gastrodon will defeat electric types before they are able to launch attacks unto your flying type in a single battle if you teach a speedy normal flying type the move captivate it may reduce the special attack of the foe these are some of my ideas and tactics that i learnt from ultimate battles i think its good to include the following types in any team grass fire water ground and normal flying as they just about cover most of the weaknesses of other pokemon if you want to protect a psychic type from ghosts you can teach it shadow ball or a normal type with a very high attack stat that move a good tactic for a single battle is to give a strong attacking pokemon with weak defensive stats a salac berry and teach it endure so if you know the foe can defeat you in one hit you can endure it then the salac berry will raise your speed so that you will attack first next turn if you teach infernape sunny day it will boost its fire power and resistance to water type moves and in a double battle with a grass type knowing solar beam it only takes ones turn to charage and then attack Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon Trading Card Game Wild ARMs 2 Items in the Metroid series Cradily Mewtwo Charizard Tenshinhan Volleyball Roselia Altaria RuneScape weapons Protoss Naruto jutsu Boss (video games) Bagon Baseball Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Sacrifice (computer game) GunBound Static (superhero) Team Fortress Classic Sonic Heroes Transformers: Cybertron Missingno.
