pokemon diamond legendaries i want to get uxie mespirit and azelf but someone told me that i need palkia or dialga how do i get them detailed please inside of the cave use rock climb to climb your way up to a team galactic grunt fight him and then continue along until you have to fight another one on the very east side of the cave you'll find an exit leading back outside head north and then down into the crevice there's a cave down there as well as a few grunts although you won't be able to proceed deeper into the cave until team galactic is off of the mountain so you can ignore that cave if you wish after they leave come back to this entrance and you can snag yourself tm dragon claw as well as exit to the northern part of the mountain so instead use rock climb to get yourself up onto the western cliff again if you have a pokemon that can use strength you will be able to use strength on the boulders to fight less pokemon on your way to the west regardless of if you have it or not you'll want to head to the west until you find another entrance into the mountain back inside you will find a path leading to stairs climb the stairs and then fight the two grunts on the next floor keep going and you'll find another flight of stairs upstairs you'll find another grunt fight the grunt and then keep going north until you reach an exit leading out note at this point if you don't have at least ultra balls or dark balls you should turn back now and buy some you will want to have them for one of the upcoming fights you will now be on the very top of the mt coronet amidst the ancient ruins known as the spear pillar fight the two grunts guarding the entrance in a double battle and then head north a bit to see a dangerous sight mars jupiter and cyrus after some intense dialogue cyrus will proceed to awaken dialga or if you're playing pokemon pearl palkia in the most amazing scene ever in the history of pokemon games at least that's what i think save your game and heal your pokemon because you're about to enter a pretty challenging fight when you're ready step north and mars and jupiter will challenge you to a fight just then rival will rush in to help you out eager to get his revenge on jupiter from their battle in lake acuity earlier boss battle commander mars commander jupiter ' ' v v v v v v bronzor stl psy l bronzor stl psy l moves moves gyro ball

chimchar will be buizel roselia and infernape if you started with turtwig munchlax unfortunately is not that helpful it knows metal sound stockpile body slam and swallow however there is a good way to get some more use out of rival knock out his munchlax unlike previous partners whenever rival loses one of his pokemon he'll replace it with the next pokemon on his roster any of his pokemon will be more helpful than munchlax so try and knock out munchlax whenever you're able to this is one of the things that makes this fight a bit of a challenge at times it will seem like a vs battle since rival has horrible judgement when using moves mars and jupiter rely heavily on annoying you their bronzors are able to use light screen and reflect to reduce the damage you deal and they can use confuse ray to confuse your pokemon their damaging attacks will be welcomed compared to their constant annoyances so try and deal with them as quickly as possible so they have minimal impact fire type attacks are your best bet although water fighting and dark type attacks will also do well mars' purugly is still a threat particularly after gaining a few levels since the last time you fought it its slash attack will probably inflict a lot of damage so try and hit purugly with a strong fighting type attack to render it incapible of fighting as soon as you're able to just watch out because it will have the added support of the bronzors or whichever other pokemon is out jupiter's skuntank is rough as always it has flamethrower in its roster so be careful with any of your steel type pokemon just handle it the best you can although their golbats are last in line they are also very annoying able to confuse and poison you as well as use mean look to prevent you from switching your pokemon one of the golbats knows sludge bomb while the other knows poison fang fortunately they're easier to take down than the bronzors a great strategy to use on these two is to target only one of them leaving one's bronzor out while you focus your attacks on the other commander's pokemon this way you won't have to deal with two powerful pokemon at once however you'll have to put up with the annoyances of the bronzor after beating the two ladies rival will heal your pokemon and will then run off now its just you cyrus and one angry time ruler pokemon space ruler in pearl obviously cyrus will instruct dialga to begin using its power to take over destroy the world but just then your little pixie friends the legendary trio will appear and will stop dialga from unleashing its true force boss battle

lucario lv haunter lv bibarel lv ' ' cyrus' pokemon have gotten much stronger since the last time you fought against them they've all been evolved to their final stages gained or levels and he's even added a gyarados to his line up his honchkrow has high attack special attack and even pretty nice hp so be wary of its attacks use rock electric or ice type attacks against it to do the most damage you should be familliar with fighting gyarados by now so just use the regular tactics against it electric type attacks are its bane weavile is very fast and very strong it has just a little less attack than honchkrow but a tremendous amount more speed it knows scissor cross which is a high power bug type move last up is cyrus' crobat it is the fastest of all of his pokemon and it is capable of using confuse ray air slash bite and cross poison after beating cyrus he and the other commanders will leave shortly thereafter professor rowan and dawn will arrive and tell you that you have to beat or catch dialga or palkia in pearl in order to save the world drastic you know it there's no turning back now save your game and get ready to fight against the time or space ruler pokemon legendary pokemon if you're playing diamond dialga stl drg l if you're playing pearl palkia wtr drg l ' ' ' ' ' do not use your master ball on dialga or palkia they are actually very easy to catch in comparison to other legendary pokemon save it for either mesprit or cresselia later on dialga or palkia although i'm just going to say dialga for right now will be the strongest wild pokemon you've encountered it has diverse types making few attacks effective against it it also will have over in every stat as well as over special attack making its attacks quite painful to endure its signature move roar of time is a dragon type hyper beam that will inflict massive damage on the target but will render dialga unable to attack during the next turn all of its moves are offensive moves so expect a hit every single turn except for the turn after it uses roar of time don't use your strongest attacks on dialga if you have intentions of catching it instead just whittle away at its hp using hyper potions when your hp gets low and tossing ultra balls or dusk balls whenever you get the chance if you accidentally knock it out just reset and try again opening up the fight with a quick ball or two might also prove to be effective after stopping dialga by either beating it or catching it rowan and dawn will come over and congratulate you on your victory dawn will then lead you back to where you entered the ruins as rowan says something alone before leaving return to the spot where you fought dialga except keep going north and you'll find an adamant orb which will boost the potency of dialga in pearl you will pick up the lustrous orb which pretty much does the same thing for palkia at this point you can now go to sunyshore city to the east of the valor lakefront where the man was previously blocking your way however if you want a chance to catch some powerful legendary psychic pokemon you'll need to revisit all of the lakes i don't know about you but i'm not about to turn down our little pixie friends so get going to the lakes unless of course you really aren't interested in which case go to section s lake verity items tm fire blast ' ' now that you've freed the legendary trio lake verity's water level has risen so you can now surf on the lake there's a field of tall grass with tm fire blast in it on the southwest side of the lake but you'll want to surf over to the island cave in the middle of the lake inside you'll find mesprit one of the three legendary pokemon of the game similar to the legendary birds entei raikou suicune and the regis from the previous games speak to it and instead of entering a battle you'll be shown a picture of mesprit which will be added to your pokedex and counted as seen and it will then flee from you rowan will then enter the cave tell you a bunch of stuff and then tell you that you can track mesprit's position by using the marking map application on your poketch the one with the symbols on the map you'll be able to determine mesprit's position by the blinking face on the map in order to encounter it you'll need to be at the same location its at and will need to encounter it inside of tall grass be warned though it will run immediately unless you use an attack like mean look any damage you do or status conditions you inflict will remain on it for your next encounter if it flees legendary pokemon mesprit psy l ' ' ' ' ' s lake valor pokemon encounter rate frequently tall grass frequency ' type s level s morn day night bibarel nrm wtr staravia nrm fly psyduck wtr chingling psy noctowl nrm fly items tm thunder ' ' upon returning to lake valor you'll find that all of the water has been restored yay no more flopping magikarps similar to lake verity you can surf over to an island cave or over to a field of tall grass located south of the cave in the field you can pick up tm thunder inside of the cave azelf waits however unlike mesprit azelf will actually fight you right there no running so save your game in case you accidentally knock it out or run out of ultra or dusk balls and prepare to fight it legendary pokemon azelf psy l ' ' ' ' ' azelf knows nasty plot a very potent move that sharply increases azelf's special attack making its attacks deadly be very cautious about that attack and try to put it to sleep or paralyze it so you give it as few turns to use it as possible it is also considerably harder to catch than dialga or palkia so you'll need to throw lots of ultra or dusk balls at it before you'll catch it since you're in a darkened cave dusk balls will be the most effective type of poke ball to catch it with but even they will have a low chance of actually catching it s lake acuity pokemon encounter rate frequently tall grass frequency ' type s level s morn day night bibarel nrm wtr sneasel drk ice psyduck wtr chingling psy noctowl nrm fly items tm blizzard ' ' back in the snowy lake acuity there's another field of grass in the northeast section of the lake and like the two lakes before it an island cave in the middle of the lake tm blizzard can be found in the field of grass inside you will find uxie the third of the legendary trio save your game and then start the battle against it legendary pokemon uxie psy l ' ' ' ' ' uxie focuses more on defense than offense it knows amnesia which will raise its special defense sharply making your special based attacks much weaker than they are usually it also knows yawn which will put your pokemon to sleep on the next turn unless you switch it out so if it uses that attack switch out your pokemon unless you want to be put to sleep dusk balls are your friend here as uxie is also inside of cave but they'll still have a difficult time containing the little yellow pixie
