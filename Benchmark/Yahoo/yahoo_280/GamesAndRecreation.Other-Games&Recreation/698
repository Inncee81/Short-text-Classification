my sewing machine is too fast i have a brother xl sewing machine that has only been used about twice i've tried sewing with it but it sews way too fast and i don't know how to slow it down it is controlled by a pedal and i looked on the pedal for any speed adjusters but there arent any and the machine doesn't have anything to adjust speed either does anyone know if there is anything i can do to adjust speed like change the tension or stitch length or something i just started sewing with a machine and i dont know everytime i press the pedal even if its as slow as it can get the sewing machine goes really fast still i dont know what to do i'm a sewing machine tech and i will tell you that this problem usually stems from inside the footpedal most likely it is making contact too soon and taking off the only way to fix this is to open it up and see whats happening possibly reshape the contact so it runs slower otherwise its a circuit board problem inside the machine some electronic machines need to have the speed recalibrated by a technician of course if your stitch length is too small it will go up and down faster so lengthen the stitch length with the knob if its new and has warranty still take it back or take it to a sewing machine dealer or repair place and have it checked out good luck Sewing machine Carburetor Sewing CPU design Electric motor Cray-1 Equine conformation Digital circuit Drill bit Wind turbine Oscilloscope Bicycle brake systems Drag racing Bicycle Dog agility RISC Action potential Textile manufacturing terminology Violin Manual transmission Central processing unit Fast bowling Tractor Musical terminology Heinkel He 100 CDC 6600 24 Hours of Le Mans Floppy disk Disc brake Pinball Recumbent bicycle Knitting Horse gait Toyota Prius Tire Flight controls Computer bus Computer Helicopter Guitar Poker jargon Autogyro Overhead lines Bubble Bobble Internal ballistics Kilt Glossary of climbing terms Beatmatching Computer virus Piano First flying machine Arcade cabinet IBM PC compatible Swingout Snowboard Hard disk Mattress Gas metal arc welding Universal Serial Bus Heinkel He 112 USB flash drive Second Battle of the Atlantic Extreme Programming Shaggy dog story BMW M5 Pedal steel guitar Turbocharger Tempo Knife Motorcycle Floyd Rose Debugging Compiler optimization Auto racing Ethernet IBM 1620 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Handloading Printed circuit board Dodge Neon Windows XP Ben Johnson (athlete) Embedded system Anti-aircraft warfare Gliding Kayak Jet engine Climbing equipment Racing bicycle Rugby union positions Textile manufacturing The Time Machine
