can you explain the game sudoku to me how is it played what are the rules and how do you win the strategy for solving a puzzle may be regarded as comprising a combination of three processes scanning marking up and analyzing the approach to analysis may vary according to the concepts and the representations on which it is based the top right region must contain a by hatching across and up from s elsewhere the solver can eliminate all the empty cells in the region which cannot contain a this leaves only one possibility shaded green the top right region must contain a by hatching across and up from s elsewhere the solver can eliminate all the empty cells in the region which cannot contain a this leaves only one possibility shaded green edit scanning scanning is performed at the outset and throughout the solution scans need to be performed only once in between analyses scanning consists of two techniques as follows cross hatching the scanning of rows to identify which line in a region may contain a certain numeral by a process of elimination the process is repeated with the columns for fastest results the numerals are scanned in order of their frequency in sequential order it is important to perform this process systematically checking all of the digits counting in regions rows and columns to identify missing numerals counting based upon the last numeral discovered may speed up the search it also can be the case particularly in tougher puzzles that the best way to ascertain the value of a cell is to count in reverse that is by scanning the cell's region row and column for values it cannot be in order to see what remains advanced solvers look for contingencies while scanning narrowing a numeral's location within a row column or region to two or three cells when those cells lie within the same row and region they can be used for elimination during cross hatching and counting puzzles solved by scanning alone without requiring the detection of contingencies are classified as easy more difficult puzzles cannot be solved by basic scanning alone a method for marking likely numerals in a single cell by the placing of pencil dots to reduce the number of dots used in each cell the marking would only be done after as many numbers as possible have been added to the puzzle by scanning dots are erased as their corresponding numerals are eliminated as candidates a

create a contingency for the far right hatched cell based on the complete row across it must be a the partially filled sub square determines that and must go in the top row these create a contingency for the far right hatched cell based on the complete row across it must be a edit marking up scanning stops when no further numerals can be discovered making it necessary to engage in logical analysis one method to guide the analysis is to mark candidate numerals in the blank cells edit subscript notation in subscript notation the candidate numerals are written in subscript in the cells because puzzles printed in a newspaper are too small to accommodate more than a few subscript digits of normal handwriting solvers may create a larger copy of the puzzle using two colors or mixing pencil and pen marks can be helpful edit dot notation the dot notation uses a pattern of dots in each square where the dot position indicates a number from to the dot notation can be used on the original puzzle dexterity is required in placing the dots since misplaced dots or inadvertent marks inevitably lead to confusion and may not be easily erased an alternative technique is to mark the numerals that a cell cannot be the cell starts empty and as more constraints become known it slowly fills until only one mark is missing assuming no mistakes are made and the marks can be overwritten with the value of a cell there is no longer a need for any erasures Fischer Random Chess Eight queens puzzle Halting problem Binary numeral system Cross Sums Single Transferable Vote Magic square Traditional
