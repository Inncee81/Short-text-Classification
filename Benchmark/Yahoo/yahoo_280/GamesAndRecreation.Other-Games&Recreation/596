wasn't the legend of zelda twilight princess easy i mean some parts were hard like lakebed temple but the rest was pretty obvious i would rather play maoras mask or ocarina of time which is te best game ever if you have any questions feel free to ask me i think twilight princess is the best game ever but that's because i've never played oot or any other zelda game didn't have an n never got ww for the gamecube but now i got a wii and tp sounded fun i think twilight princess was easy enough to get all the way through but challenging enough to keep me in the game for a while it took me around hours to beat the main story plus hours to get all the golden bugs poe souls and beat the cave of ordeals still haven't got all the heart containers pieces yet the hardest part was definitely cave of ordeals because you had to do a lot on a limited supply of health one thing that would've made boss battles harder is if they didn't put a million hearts in the boss arenas it also may seem easier because of the controls it takes much less time to aim by pointing the remote than it would to line up using an analog stick i thought some of the puzzles were hard most of the enemies were easy except for the heavily armored ones and those flying things that you had to clawshot their shields The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time The Legend of Zelda series The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Princess Zelda The Legend of Zelda series enemies The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Legend of Zelda series songs The Legend of Zelda series characters The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time places Ganon The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Boss (video games) The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Zelda II: The Adventure of Link The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Koji Kondo Nintendo GameCube The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Nintendo The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Zora The Legend of Zelda series races The Legend of Zelda Nintendo 64 Master Sword BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Super Smash Bros.
