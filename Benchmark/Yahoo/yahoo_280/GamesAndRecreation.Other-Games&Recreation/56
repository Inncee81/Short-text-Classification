does this pokemon team own other pokemon trainers please rate out of ten separately torterra example here are my pokemon torterra lvl leaf storm att earthquake att cut att rock smash att dialga lvl roar of time att thunderbolt att earth power att dragon pulse att uxie lvl hyper beam att extransenory att future sight att yawn att azelf lvl extransenory att future sight att uproar att skill swap att togekiss lvl fly att facade att ancient power att toxic att lumineon lvl rubbish surf att waterfall att water pulse att water gun att hey decent team but it could use a bit of touching up i think torterra should not know cut or rock smash you could replace the two with maybe giga drain grass knot stone edge if he can learn that i'm not sure i don't use legendaries so i'll let you leave them the way they are what is the ability on togekiss if its serene grace you need to teach it air slash as the flinch occurence is increased i'd say replace fly or ancient power with fly someone could switch in a pokemon without a flying weakness to take the hit since it takes two turns your lumineon is low level so is hard to rate depending on if it has higher special attack or physical attack should determine if you have use waterfall or surf and you only need water move so try to give him a little more variety overall your team has very high potential i like all the pokemon that you use give them better move sets and you will be sitting pretty Pok__mon types Aggron Dragonite Tenshinhan Pok__mon Trading Card Game Flygon Wild ARMs 2 Naruto jutsu Charizard Mewtwo Missingno.
