gears of war melee trick so i know theres such thing as host advantage but does that add an advantage to the melee it seems every time i play my friend online we hit each other at the same time the first time but he somehow hits a fraction faster sometimes he even has enough time to get a headshot with the sniper or sometimes only i hit him but he has enough time to kill me with the shotgun he doesnt have me red or anything i just dont get how he can recover so quickly anyone know why on a side note anyone know other mini games to play my friends and i play tag with the frag grenades list any others he most likely did a quick reload perfectly and got the firepower boost before he went to fight u or maybe he is jut better Team Fortress Classic Quake III Arena GunZ The Duel SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs GunBound Half-Life Battlefield 2 Halo 2 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Natural Selection (computer game) M16 (rifle) Day of Defeat Counter-Strike Half-Life: Opposing Force Final Fantasy XI Star Wars: Battlefront II Diablo II Guilty Gear Quake 4 Super Smash Bros.
