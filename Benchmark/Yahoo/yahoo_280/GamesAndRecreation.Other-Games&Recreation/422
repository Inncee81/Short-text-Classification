how can u find mime jr in pokemon diamond i can never find it in the wild i wonder if its rare you can find wild mime jr's on route and they are a bit rare but keep trying and you should have one before long breeding would work but then you would need either a male and female mr mime or a mr mime and a ditto which would be even harder to get so the grass in the routes i suggested would be your best bet for finding one Pok__mon Abilities Missingno.
