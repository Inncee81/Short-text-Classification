pokemon gold version parasites i was playing my pokemon gold version a while ago and i took my pokemon to the pokecenter i didn't have the sound up and it seemed to be taking longer than usual to heal them then the lady gave them back and said your pokemon are fully restored but they have a parasite that i can't help you with or something like that i didn't save the game so i never found out what happened with it or how it affected my pokemon anyone else seen this what in the world was it you should have saved your game the parasite in question is called the pok rus it's an extemely rare virus that doubles your pok mon's stat growth it spreads through contact so if you battle an infected pok mon your pok mon will catch it and if you keep an infected pok mon in your party the virus will spread to the rest of your team unless it is stored in the pc the virus goes away after hours unfortunately once a pok mon catches the pok rus it gains an immunity to the virus so you can't reinfect it Pok__mon Gold and Silver Missingno.
