who to add to my pokemon team i have scizor infernape elekid ambipom sudowoodo who should i put in for the th pokemon i did have a steelix but idk if she was the best answer so n e ideas you might want to take out ambipom and elekid as well one types hardly survive because they have a solid weakness lets see you've covered scizor steel bug infernape fighting fire change sudowoodo into golem it will help much rock ground if you can get a sneasel dark and ice are both types you dont have yet and sneasel is very good one of my favorite pokemon in fact a water dragon palkia would be a great addition if you have pearl it doesnt have much weakness dialga however you already have a steel type so it would be no good lastly instead of an elekid a rotom would fit you better level rotom legendary electric ghost can be caught in the old chateau before you go there set your ds clock to am and bring some pokeballs and a grass type find the room that has the tv save and talk to the tv rotom will pop out and its ur chance to catch it even though its very low it will grow up to be one of the most hardest pokemon to beat because it has only a handful of weaknesses its levitate resists ground attacks and its ghost type resists normal attacks Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon Colosseum Pok__mon Gold and Silver Scyther Sneasel Aggron Missingno.
