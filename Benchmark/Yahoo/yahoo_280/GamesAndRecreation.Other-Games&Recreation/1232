pokemon diamond elite hi i have a level luxray torterra dialga staraptor roserade and floataz and i cant do the first elite person does any one no anything that could help me or can someone tell me where i can get a high level fire pokemon please help meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee oh does any one no how i can get my pokemon level up high quickly is there any way of cheating without cheat cartridges hey well first of all your pokemon are way too low of levels you need all of them in the 's at least and some in the 's range and to tell you the truth luxray's aren't that good i would recomend geting some different pokemon like get rid of luxray staraptor and roserade you already have a plant type and get a crobat for flying a garchomp would be really good instead of your luxray and for a fire pokemon try and get a chimchar infernape from gts or a rapidash will do really good there are no cheats for levels but the best way is taking your worst poke giving it an exp share and then going through the elite four slowly gaining levels and the floatzels aren't the best so i would recomend a gyarados Pok__mon Abilities Pok__mon (video games) Missingno.
