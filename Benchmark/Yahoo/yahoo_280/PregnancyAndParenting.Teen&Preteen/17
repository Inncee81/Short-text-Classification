why do parents always assume that school's the only stress in a child's life ok i am in matric and i do agree that studying is important and all but my mom is driving me nuts it's all she ever talks about and when i try to explain to her that school work is not the only stress in my life she asks what other stress there is but i can't tell her my friend is pregnant and i'm helping her through that i might be pregnant and i'm still trying to juggle school with all of this help here's the problem communication with your mother you'd be surprised how much your mother probably would understand if you just took the time to share your feelings and problems with her being possibly pregnant is a big thing why weren't you using protection for a obviously smart girl to have unprotected sex there is no excuse for that trust me when i tell you that everything you are doing will be put on hold mayby even never happen if you have a baby at this point sure you could go back in the future and finish mayby but for now life stops because you have to make baby number one please tell your mom she can be your biggest support yeah mayby she'll be mad at first but thats only because she wants whats best for you and having a baby right now is not it as far as your friend goes it's nice to be there for her but you need to worry about yourself keep your boundries call your mom god bless and good luck Friends Teen Girl Squad Baby Blues Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Shaggy dog story Charmed Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Abortion debate Incarnations of Immortality The Fairly OddParents Rocko's Modern Life Doug Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kyle Broflovski Hollyoaks Jam (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a Boy Timmy Turner Pitaten Theory of conduct The Catcher in the Rye Breastfeeding She Loves You Mystique (comics) Transsexuality My Life as a Teenage Robot Pregnancy Great Teacher Onizuka Transactional analysis Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Jon Secada Cliff Richard Sharon Tate Rugrats The Amber Spyglass Intelligence quotient The Family from One End Street God Emperor of Dune Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Ashlee Simpson Show Ocean's Twelve W.I.T.C.H.
