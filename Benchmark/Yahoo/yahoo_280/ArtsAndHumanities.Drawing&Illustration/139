do you consider an anime style to be art this is a question that has been asked countless times and i just want to know your take on it do you think that people who draw with an anime style should considered true artists by your definition not mine try to give reason as to your answer for those of you not so savvy by anime style i mean a drawing style that is similar to the kind you see in anime shows some shows that may ring a bell are dragon ball z salor moon naruto pokemon and other shows like this just a little extra background here i concider myself to be more of a cartoonist rather than an anime artist but i can't deny the fact that i have anime roots ever since picking up a how to draw manga book in rd grade i'm a year member on deviantart com which is filled with anime art as well as other styles and often times you run across that one person who bad mouths anyone with an anime style i don't watch much anime these days i don't watch any current series and my favorites are the little known last exile and the hilarious azumanga daioh i read a lot of manga though and an equal amount of american comics just to keep myself balanced and tend to like mangas more than anime another reason i'm asking this question is because both my art teachers disregarded my cartoony style as not art and assumed i did nothing else even though i'm constantly doing realist art as well and this bothers me while anime manga does get a lot of flak from art schools and such it is still art art is applying a medium with an attempt at creating something however it gets a bad rap because many of the fans have misguided view that drawing anime simply memorizing the flat symbols without learning traditional standards of art all of the good artists who draw anime have knowledge of the fundamentals of art like anatomy lighting perspective composition etc you should look the works of masashi tanaka who has graduated in the fine arts http www geocities co jp playtown king html this is his comic book illustrations http lambiek net artists t tanaka masashi htm no matter what style you have to draw realism if you know your anatomy you will have better command over any style you choose everyone's taste in art and perception in art will differ so whether anime is art or not is subjective to personal opinion your teachers probably have a bias against cartoons in general Manga Azumanga Daioh Anime Comics Drawing Martial art Art Philosophy of mathematics Postmodernism Dragon Ball canon Whose Line Is It Anyway?
