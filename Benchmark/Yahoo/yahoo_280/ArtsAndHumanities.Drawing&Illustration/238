advice on my drawing ok so the other day i started a color pencil using prismacolor berol soft lead high quality pencils drawing of a red telephone booth the booth is the focus of the drawing and the people walking past are very blurry you cant see any facial features i colored the people with colored pencil as well but now looking back i want to make everything outside the red telephone booth black and white there is no way i can erase the coloring in the people i considered painting over the people and doing everything else outside the telephone booth with paint black and white remember would this be all right also i have heard of using an exacto knife to scrape off the very top layer of the paper in order to get rid of a mistake is drawing paper too thin for this or is that just for paintings thank you ps this is drawing paper from a sketchbook its probably too thin you'll weaken the paper and wont be able to draw on it often times with the right eraser you can get the majority of stuff out but something cool you can do with the exacto knife carefully cut out the phone booth and paste it to another page and then draw the people it will give the drawing some texture and dimension and make the whole piece pop Drawing Traditional animation Pencil Typewriter Casting Glass Pastel Lead Wood 2D computer graphics Textile manufacturing Telephone booth Surrealist techniques Piet Mondrian Francis Bacon (painter) Knife Pottery Drew Struzan Shroud of Turin Diamond Hey Jude Solar cell Rendering (computer graphics) Wassily Kandinsky Eraser Katana Paint Geologic time scale Rayleigh scattering Time Out of Mind Abstraction Toilet paper Chess terminology Superman Tag Dr. Seuss Pixel art Violin Tofu Photography Anaglyph image Babe Ruth The Ashlee Simpson Show Upholstery White Hair Bassoon Tattoo Paleoclimatology Glaze The Shining (film) Pulp Fiction United States dollar Diamond simulant Little Britain Frogman Modem Flag of the United States Sword making Mattress Color Wood carving Stereoscopy Laser engraving Microsoft Paint Billiards Super Mario 64 Bowie knife The Warriors Technicolor Piano Mario Hearing impairment Carl Barks Ice cream Woodworking Drill bit Telephone directory Yellow Grace Cossington Smith Fountain pen Satchel Paige Lithium Rice paper Gramophone record Mokume-gane Black (people) Dodge Charger Portrait miniature Babbitt metal Archery Crayola Scarification Light-emitting diode Blood on the Tracks Ammolite Paper RuneScape quests
