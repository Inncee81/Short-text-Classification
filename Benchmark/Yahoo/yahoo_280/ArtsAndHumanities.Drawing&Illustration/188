logo copyright question if i'm designing someone's website or ebay store and they sell brand name clothing and or accessories is it legal to put the designer logo somewhere on the page to show customers what brands they carry or is that infringement also if someone sells video games or something is is ok to use images of the video game characters on the web page i think thats considered infringement but i've seen it before so i just wondered thanks i'm not the one who wanted to use the video game characters i just saw them used on a website somewhere and wondered about it well everyone has a fairly fuzzy knowledge of this but a good rule of thumb is to remember your not selling their logo but their product the first thing is that logos aren't as important as the product but sometimes they do matter you can use most logos without permission if dealing with their product just so long as you do not claim ownership or use it in a way that uses their name to sell your own products services using the disney logo on a doll that was not made sold by disney that said logos are very sensitive since they represent the coperate identity you are representing threw their products you may need to get permission to use it from the coperation and the easiest way to find out is to ask email them they might even give you a better graphic to use as far as video game characters this is an entirely different beast you are falling into an area where you honestly don t have the rite to distribute the information usually its ok to post official press release images screen captures which have been un edited though character art such as desktops and un released content such as screen caps of cut scenes for instance might make the developer mad a rule of thumb for video games which seems to be widely used is to use press release material you can use photographs you take though usually that is only of the entire product case disc manuals ect photographs do not apply to characters and other content unless you have permission to post it again ask for permission you might be surprised what they say i'm no expert and i don't pretend to be and i hope someone more knowledgeable can correct anything i've said in error Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Apple Computer Google Digital rights management Pretty Good Privacy Nintendo SCO-Linux controversies Theory of conduct Trademark Windows 2000 MAME Enterprise content management Sega Dreamcast Fair use Microsoft Public domain Windows XP Copyright Screenshot Warez PlayStation 2 First-sale doctrine Copy protection Intellectual property Photography Sega Saturn PlayStation Portable Apple typography Floppy disk Expert system Commodore International DVD PlayStation 3 ROM image Computer Resident Evil (video game) XML IBM PC compatible Logo Internet fraud The Star Wars Holiday Special Pok__mon (anime) Spam (electronic) Censorship in Australia Xbox 360 AmigaOS Atari 8-bit family Nine Inch Nails Copyright law of the United Kingdom Yu-Gi-Oh!
