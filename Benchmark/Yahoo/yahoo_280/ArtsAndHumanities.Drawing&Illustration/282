how do you make prints of your artwork i am an artist that does mostly traditional artwork as well as some digital work i am wondering how the art print system works how do i get my work scanned or photographed or such and where to take it to get it printed what types of paper to use or processes like glicee matte etc and how much it usually costs thank you in advance i know that this is a tough question to answer magpookie and dey are right a there is no general answer to your question and b you can try some stuff out on the internet but you need your artwork in digital form first i'd recommend going to one or more copy print shops directly there are a lot of them in cities here so i suppose it will be the same in your country and i find that sometimes even a small workshop can deliver amazing results if you make an appointment they will show you what they can do and you can feel the paper important and see what the print would look like on their screen if you go to more than one you can compare prices get a variety of suggestions sorry but some things just can't be done on a platform like this you need to go and see real people that's how i met my friend in a print shop by the way nice side effect good night anna Photography Traditional animation Digital photography Art Stereoscopy Digital art Enterprise content management Color printing Theory of conduct Konica Minolta Sampling (music) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Demoscene IBM PC compatible Prostate cancer Modem Hyperinflation Graphics Extreme Programming Geographic information system Photocopying United States Postal Service Avenue Q Ebook Portable Document Format UK Singles Chart Sega Saturn Copy protection Mid-levels Video game music Widescreen Game programmer Open access Printmaking Direct marketing Xerox Microeconomics The Emancipation of Mimi DeviantART Dot matrix printer Manga Book Printing press A Course In Miracles Computer Blood on the Tracks Inflation Copyright Little Britain Magic: The Gathering Newspaper Digital television Roswell UFO incident System/36 Nintendo GameCube The Apprentice 2 Digimon RISC Password Slide rule Killian documents CPU cache Electronic voting Cinerama Drew Struzan Open source culture Screen-printing Expert system PRS Guitars Milton H.
