how do i draw a storm i want to draw one with clouds and lightning and rain thanks in advance also i want to know how to draw a snowstorm thanks what's a storm clouds are heavy and dark so make some clouds shade your paper with random shades making some semblance of storm clouds no sharp edges should be present the storm should get darker near the horizon now use a typewriter eraser or kneadable eraser to pull some short quick highlights out that will turn into the precipitation use the pencil to edge the highlights to pull them out carry on from there depending on the type of storm you want for example lightning should be carefully pulled out as stark white with a thin eraser some glow should be present try using a tortillion to pull the background away from the bolt a snowstorm is different basically you're shading with white the highlights become the fog instead of shading Drawing Lightning Supercell Cloud Thunderstorm Rain Typewriter Winter storm Disaster Lightning rod Mercury Atlas 6 Climate of Salt Lake City Natural disaster Cumulonimbus cloud Fog Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 RuneScape skills Spark plug Weather satellite Screw Legion of Super-Heroes Imperial stormtrooper Force powers Headlight Weather lore Drill bit Traditional animation Radar Water vapor Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Lightning safety Internal ballistics Severe weather terminology (United States) Robot Master Gameplay of StarCraft USS Tunny (SS-282) Solar power Weather forecasting Radio controlled airplane Combat Mission (computer game series) Pottery Battle of the Bulge Heavy metal music Guitar Sacrifice (computer game) Knife Moby-Dick Moon 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Swimming Comet West Indian cricket team Cherubimon M16 (rifle) Cat coat genetics Space elevator Yu-Gi-Oh!
