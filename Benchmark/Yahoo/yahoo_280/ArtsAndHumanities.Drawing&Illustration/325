what should i draw i want to draw something but i cant think of anything any suggestions would be ok even random ones like saying a plate with a fork on it or something also i would like some ideas of what to make collages of but be specific not just saying themes like food or colors but actual ideas like hot dog or blue thanks the weather can be an interesting platform take a storm as an example you would need different blues greys and whites to form the background you could feature various anomalies like lightning rain and cloud perhaps you could add coloured umbrellas and other relevant items raincoats boots e t c the same can be done for all types of weather you could even represent the seasons in the same way i hope this may inspire some ideas good luck and take care c j Lightning Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Color Rain Resident Evil (video game) Cloud Sgt.
