industrial piercing i really want to get an industrial piercing and i am like sure but the only thing stopping me is knowing that there will be big holes in my ear if i decide to take it out and never put it in will the holes ever close up if when i decide to remove it and also if you have ur pierced can u share ur expierience of getting it pierced and things that i shood know b hand oh and if you can please send me a link or website about it with pics and stuff thanks the holes close up pretty fast once its removed but you can still put a bar through if you want as long as you allow it to heal keep it clean just as you would any normal cartilidge piercing except make sure the bar is kept clean too as it can get quite dirty causing it to be unhygienic and not look good due to bits of dried lymph on it usually what the pierce should do is take a measurement and get a bar to that size then mark it up for both angle and distance then do seperate piercings and pass the bar through just like putting in normal jewellery if its not put in place properly it can cause it to be very uncomfortable hence why its important to get it done accuratly and have both done at the same if possible theres plenty of stuff on bme however i think you can only view so many pics before you have to register and either pay or contribute ive been a member for some time now so am unsure as to how many it is good luck Drill bit Violin Knife Hamster Poker jargon Prince Albert piercing Barbell (piercing) Social rule Body piercing Archery Terminal ballistics Fast bowling Condom Sampling (music) Thermal power station GunBound Diamond Screw U.S. presidential election, 2000 Tattoo 2000 Australian Grand Prix Humphrey Bogart Dairy Tenshinhan Vampire Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ear piercing instrument Betting (poker) Swimming Eyepiece Naruto jutsu Swingout First Battle of the Atlantic Upholstery Menstrual cup Dry cleaning 2005 Belgian Grand Prix CPU cache American football strategy EastEnders Nine Inch Nails Franklin Pierce Milton H.
