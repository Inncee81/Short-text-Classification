does differin work better than proactiv i've been using proactiv for about years now and it's been great but my mother wanted me to see a dermatologist to see if there was anything better he put me on differin i've seen commercials for it before but does it really work better differin is much stronger then proactive that's why a lot of doctors reccommend it the only thing i didn't like about it was that before your acne gets better it gets worse first so just make sure to use it when you won't have to make many special apperances for like a week Acne Dermatology Red Hot Chili Peppers EastEnders Psoriasis Scar Isotretinoin The Critic Amineptine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Theory of conduct Lupus erythematosus The Contender (television series) Denis Law IBM PC compatible One Tree Hill (TV series) Soap opera Hidradenitis suppurativa Seventh Doctor Humphrey Bogart 1957 World Series Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Bill Cosby Debugging Valentino Rossi Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sampling (music) Jessica Simpson Paul W.
