i have braces and they look hideous on me what can i do to like my braces better i see other kids in my class smiling like they're no big deal but for me all i can do is laugh with my mouth closed and it makes my face like scrunched up if you know what i mean i'm really self conscious about it and people make fun of the way i laugh i don't want to laugh with my braces showing hi the more you try to cover your mouth the more attention you will attract to your braces and people will know your self concious about them just keep thinking of how nice your teeth will be once they're off its just another phase you're going through and once they start straightening up it will be less obvious again try not to stress sweety you've got them for a reason and it will be better in the end Aerial (dance move) The Ashlee Simpson Show Drill bit Social rule Shaggy dog story Equine conformation The Fairly OddParents Canoe Squidward Tentacles Cro Bracket Undergrads Milton H.
