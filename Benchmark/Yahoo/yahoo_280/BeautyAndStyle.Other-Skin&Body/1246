disposable razors how do you use them ive never used a razor before you need shaving cream or something or can you just shave your legs like that details are appreciated thnx to those who answer heey well i would buy quite a good razor not really cheap cause most of them end up giving you nicks and they don't give you a nice shave buy a brand that is quite big and be prepared to pay a little extra for a good one ooh i have also found that mens shavers work really well your legs look like they have been proffesionally waxed gillete's mens works well also some shaving gel cream would work but if your short on cash a really good alternative is hair conditioner it is good when you shave it works best in the bath because the steam opens up your pores and you can do it sitting down put the gel cream conditioner whatever on the area where you are going to shave and keep it off the water shave in the opposite direction of hair growth for example leg hair grows downwards so shave upwards be careful on the knees and joints you don't want any nicks they aren't painful but boy do you bleed a lot when finished pat yourself dry and put some lotion on the area where you've shaved for extra silkiness a tan makes those pins look even hotter go by the pool for a tan or some lotion that builds a gradual tan nivea works well do not shave your face or anything like that it's just wrong for a girl but yeah if you want to shave armpits sure but wax sometimes cause you don't wanna be left with dark pits extra hope that helped ox lotsa love vicky x Shaving Pubic hair Razor Leg shaving Sento Professional wrestling holds Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Depilation Professional wrestling throws Haircut Hair Puberty Waxing Manicure Beard Poker jargon Dairy Professional wrestling slang Upholstery Ren and Stimpy Aerial (dance move) Psoriasis Hiberno-English Comanche Ron and Fez True Crime: Streets of LA Powerbomb Jon Secada Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Happy Tree Friends Little Britain Guinea pig The Ashlee Simpson Show Humphrey Bogart Billboard Hot 100 Textile manufacturing Strap-on dildo Care Bears Menstrual cycle 613 mitzvot Sin City Coffee Tanning Professional wrestling match types 2000 Australian Grand Prix Leather Tarantula Gay bathhouse Tofu Shaggy dog story Stomach cancer The Adventures of Pete & Pete Theory of conduct Joker (comics) Skinhead Wound Fecal incontinence Singlish Keeshond Full House Kurt Angle Shawn Michaels Knife Teen Girl Squad The Beach Boys Timmy Turner Cuisine of Denmark Gelatin Casting Fast bowling Friends Sunlight Osteoarthritis Dog Moustache Acne Joe Namath Swimming Leaf Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers About a Boy Diving Barber Laser hair removal Codename: Kids Next Door The Fairly OddParents Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Physical attractiveness Hall & Oates Backstroke
