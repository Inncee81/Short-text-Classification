tissue being shattered by gun with cartilage piercing i watched a couple videos on youtube getting done at claire's their cartilage and they said they've had no problems or anything with it like people are saying how many of you actually have had problems or what's your thought's on this thank you no problems meaning infections shattered cartilage etc i have both ears pierced in my cartilage and had them both done at different claires i didn't have any of the hard bumps or anything like that just some soreness i've had them done for about a year be careful though that if your hair is long and when you twist the earring you make sure that you get the hair off of the post before you take it out of your ear when its time i had that problem and pulled a clump of hair and yes some pus through the piercing when it was time to change the stud i prefer the gun because it's over quick but if you're really concerned i would look into other places such as a tattoo piercing place where they use a needle i've heard as well of people getting large hard bumps behind their ears if you do decide to do it at claire's just be sure to keep it very clean and twist no matter what anyone says it will be sore for awhile Body piercing Earring Ear piercing instrument Ear Tattoo Hepatitis C The Inside Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Equine conformation Drill bit Violin Strap-on dildo Traumatic brain injury Temporal bone Cartilage Babe Ruth Skin Methamphetamine Domestic rabbit Terminal ballistics Bone Poker jargon Myxobolus cerebralis Keloid Radiation therapy Larynx Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Internal ballistics Diving Ear canal Condom Nose piercing Mandible 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blood Simple Hearing impairment Balance disorder Stomach cancer Play piercing Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Social rule Psoriasis Characters of Lost Computer and video game genres Penis Rosacea Body modification M16 (rifle) Otitis externa Dragon Booster Futurama (TV series - season 5) Comanche Breastfeeding Group A streptococcal infection YuYu Hakusho Haircut Smallpox Earwax Autopsy Hearing aid Tenshinhan Medicine Dobermann Knots Landing Naruto jutsu Otitis media Textile manufacturing AIDS The Dalek Invasion of Earth Dialysis Dreadlocks Cat The Ashlee Simpson Show Cytomegalovirus Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Jackass: The Movie It's All Gone Pete Tong Intravenous therapy Cancer Aerial (dance move) Keeshond Claire Redfield Havanese Anus Hair metal Trapped in the Closet Hip fracture Sento Osteichthyes Bedsore Professional wrestling throws Proprioception RuneScape quests Operation Market Garden Cocaine
