my friend has low self esteem because of how she looks what can i do okay well my friend has very low self esteem because she thinks that she isn't pretty she says she has a big nose and big lips so i want to make her feel better but the only way i can start is to help her with her looks her nose and lips aren't huge just a little bit large and no one really cares about them except her so i was wondering how to help her reduce the appearance of her nose and lips or make them seem smaller but of course once she is satisfied she's going to want to know how to lighten her elbows and knees ugh so is there any instant ways to lighten them or if not easy ways and she wants to know how you can clear up your skin not of acne but of the zit like bumps ppl get thanks the problem is within her psyche you can't change how she thinks and feels she will have to do that on her own no matter how you give her tips to make her nose or lips appear smaller she will not be grateful and follow those ideas she can go get those instructions herself if she really wanted to but she is not budging just stop listening to her when she talks like that if she wanted to know she would be the one asking us and not you some day she will visit a psychologist and find out what her internal mental way of thinking about herself is caused by and get that solved on her own otherwise she will read up on the net and try different makeup Theory of conduct Skateboarding trick Volleyball Drill bit Social rule Shaggy dog story Coming of Age (TNG episode) Humphrey Bogart Acne Milton H.
