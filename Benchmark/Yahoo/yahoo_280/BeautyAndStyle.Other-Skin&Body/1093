bareminerals ok so i love watching the bareminerals infomercial on tv fantasizing about what my skin could look like if i actually owned this product i was wondering if this is truly a miracle product does it make skin look flawless without actually looking like makeup is it actually a good investment thanks for the advice wuv i am absolutly shocked at the answers you've recieved i've used bareminerals for about a year i use all of it including eye shadows blushes radiance mascara etc and i love love love it words cannot describe how much i love this product i actually get excited to put my makeup on everyday it's light doesn't come off when you sweat and it's incredible fast to put on it's fool proof which is why i was suprised to read that people say it's cakey i would say it's totally worth the to try it out you can go to sephora and buy the starter kit i recommend going a shade lighter i don't feel that i have fair skin but the fair matches me perfect and anything higher is way too dark the kit includes a dvd which shows you how to properly avoid the problems many people who have answered your question say they have had also i have extremely oily skin and the mineral viel removes all shine for the entire day while i am in love with the product however my mother who is in her mid 's doesn't use the product because it doesn't look very good on skin with wrinkles i would recommend again going to sephora let them put it on you and you be the judge the products also last foreverrrrr i buy the foundation powder twice a year good luck Cosmetics Tattoo Little Britain Theory of conduct The Star Wars Holiday Special Fecal incontinence Ultraviolet Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Physical attractiveness Surveillance Yu-Gi-Oh!
