eyebrow piercing i got my eyebrow pierced in may and i believe its infected its tender still and hurts sometimes what do i do to heal it as apparently it was never fully healed in the first place if its infection which im sure it is how do i get rid of it it has pretty much been tender ever since because of the dirt which gets into eyebrow piercings movement and the amount of hair follicles near the wound eyebrow piercings are prone to infections you must be diligent with cleaning to prevent infections however if an infection does occur it can turn nasty very quickly because there is no tissue under the skin of the eyebrow the infection can quickly turn into a large cyst the area of the piercing can become very red and tender and there can be a large amount of discharge from the wound the easiest method to remove infection from the wound is the application of a hot compress get a clean hand towel or paper towel and hold it under very hot running water test the heat of the compress so that you can just bear the heat on the wound be careful not to apply it when it's too hot as this can result in a bad burn hold the hot compress on the wound until you feel the heat dissipate altogether remove the compress and gently bathe the wound with warm salty water don't squeeze the piercing to remove any infection just apply very gentle pressure with a clean tissue repeat the hot compress a couple of more times until all residue is removed from the wound follow this process twice a day until the wound settles down if this doesn't alleviate the infection you will have to see a doctor for antibiotics the doctor may tell you to remove the ring don't do this as the jewelery allows any exudate to come out of the wound if you remove it there will be no way of allowing the pus out of the wound if antibiotics fail to stop the infection you have no choice but to remove the ring however in my experience this is very rare hope it helps Tattoo Body piercing Acne First aid Urinary incontinence Massage Common cold Wound Sauna Group A streptococcal infection Welding Prostate cancer Psoriasis Earring Eczema Boil Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Manicure Wound healing phases Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Energy development Sewage treatment Dialysis Menstrual cup Scar Cellulitis Intravenous therapy Inflammation Sento Breastfeeding Terminal ballistics Brewery Abscess Stomach cancer Transformer Hyperthermia Sterilization (microbiology) Fecal incontinence Allergy Rosacea Eye Hydrogen economy Internal ballistics Movie projector Bone fracture Bleeding Dairy Electrophysiology Carpal tunnel syndrome Keloid Fire fighting Escherichia coli O157:H7 Chronic fatigue syndrome Carbon dioxide Domestic rabbit Diseases of the honeybee Menstrual cycle Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jet engine Snake Ear piercing instrument Billboard Hot 100 Nuclear fallout Tesla coil Professional wrestling holds Gonorrhoea Traditional Chinese medicine Puberty Medical analysis of circumcision Scarification Violin Chinchilla Condom Anthrax Chalazion Staphylococcus aureus Strap-on dildo Agar plate Spacecraft propulsion Spark plug Pharyngitis Fusion power Conjunctivitis Axial compressor Seismic retrofit Survival skills Pneumonia Foodborne illness
