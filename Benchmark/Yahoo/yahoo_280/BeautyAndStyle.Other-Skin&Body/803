proactive does it work for you what are your experiences with it does it completely clear everything i only get a few small pimples but i want to be completely pimple free and no other products work very well for me approximately how much per month is it i used proactiv like years ago and it worked wonders on my skin it cleared acne removed a few acne scars but it left my skin a little dry in the beginning i don't have major acne issues but i use to to get rid of whiteheads and blackheads i bought a new set of proactiv like a month ago and can no longer use it because my skin is now sensitive to benzoyl peroxide the main ingredient in the bottle the first night that i had used it a couple of hours later while i was sleeping i kept scratching my face then all of a sudden i was constantly scratching my face for a good three to four hours woke up in the middle of night went to the bathroom and my entire face swelled up my eyes were poofy it looked like i had cried for days my entire face was red and swollen i never used the cleanser toner and repair lotion all at once anymore now i only use a small dab of the repair lotion at night to get rid of blackheads and whiteheads on my forehead my forehead is the only part of my face that can handle the lotion i tried again to apply lotion on my cheeks and chin and nose and the next day they swelled up all red so no more proactive except on the forehead Acne Cosmetics Rosacea Benzoyl peroxide Scar Tattoo Keloid Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Shaggy dog story Manicure Scabies Physical attractiveness Cleanser The Amber Spyglass Face Eczema Plastic surgery Hydrogen peroxide Head Shaving Organic peroxide Dialysis Griffon Bruxellois Fecal incontinence Champagne (beverage) Group A streptococcal infection Body piercing Sin City Skin Sunscreen Herpes simplex virus Conjunctivitis Piccolo Junior Saga Androgen insensitivity syndrome Great Teacher Onizuka Cat Radiation therapy Elephant Miss Saigon Beatmania IIDX Shroud of Turin Chocolate Knots Landing Isotretinoin Dehydration Black (people) Sterilization (microbiology) Fiddler on the Roof Dandruff Night (book) The Catcher in the Rye The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Traumatic brain injury Sleep Cliff Richard Characters of Naruto Explosive material Fancy rat Vampire Mosquito Cephalic disorder Tuberous sclerosis Project Entropia Thermoregulation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Doom enemies Japanese tea ceremony Weather lore Phish Days of our Lives Aloe Use of poison gas in World War I Pubic hair Urticaria Hamster Corrosion Rapid eye movement Breastfeeding Solar eclipse Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pope John Paul I Dragon Booster EastEnders President (game) One Piece minor characters Moisturizer Ultraviolet Mattress Bart chalkboard gags Old wives' tale Hi-Fi Murders Urinary incontinence Invader Zim Daylight saving time Sesshomaru Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)
