sorry if this doesnt make sense im thinking of having eye surgery done im but im just wondering can you get surgery to make your eyes look a different shape i dont need dramatically i mean just cut off some skin to open up the eyes so they look bigger also the main problem i have with my eyes is my right top eyelid is lower than on my left eye so it looks like my left eye is more open but i dont wont surgery to have my right eye lid more open like the left i want my left eye to look like the right but i dont know can they make your eyelid drop more or do they add on a tiny sliver of skin or something i really want eyes more like uma thurman because one eye is heavy lided like hers i just want the other one the same if that makes any kind of sense my eyes are sorta round id just like them to look a bit more long instead you are you shouldn't be having surgery on any part of your body unless its absolutely necessary why in heavens name would you want to operate on your body to make yourself look like someone else have you no sense of pride or individuality there are people in the world who can't see and you are worried about looking like some weirdo actress nice your parents must be proud or far too rich Face Eye Plastic surgery Snake Atomic Kitten Eyelid Kill Bill Dog Social rule Prostate cancer Textile manufacturing Conjunctivitis Wood carving Cat Hair Radiation therapy Body modification Theory of conduct Fecal incontinence Quarashi W.I.T.C.H.
