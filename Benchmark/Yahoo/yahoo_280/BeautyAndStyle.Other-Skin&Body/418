what is getting your nose pierced like i got mine done my freshmen year of college and it didn't hurt very much at all i was scared out of mind too so i was anticipating the worst i got scared when i saw her pull out a huge needle like thing but it was only the tube they put against the inside of your nose for the needle to go through the put some greasy stuff on your nose as lubricant then just push the needle through it just felt like a little pressure and a small amount of sting afterwards i thought it was weird how i could see a small shimmer of the stud it was a little bit sore but it didn't bleed very much at all and wasn't as bad as when i first got my cartilage done i don't have it pierced anymore and it was a little over a year ago that i let it close there is no scarring at all and i can only tell it was actually pierced by rubbing the inside of my nose Earring Body piercing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Ear piercing instrument The Inside Poker jargon Piccolo Junior Saga StarCraft: Uprising Futurama (TV series - season 5) Time Out of Mind Diving Vampire Characters in the Smurfs Textile manufacturing Nine Inch Nails Equine conformation Milton H.
