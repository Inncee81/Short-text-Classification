is my belly button piercing infected i got my belly button pierced about a month ago and it's been fine this whole time it hurt for only a week and since then there has been no pain and the redness went away after a week and a half it seemed to be healing great i use the salt solution yesterday i noticed that there was a little green puss coming out of it and today it seemed to bleed a little it doesn't hurt at all and i haven't hit it on anything i'm just wondering if this is part of the healing process or should i be concerned it's gotten a little red again but as i said no pain at all it's only on the top hole i don't know if i should put anything else on it to help clean it more or just keep doing the way i have should i see a doctor or is it not that serious i really don't want to see a doctor since i have no insurance but i don't want it to get infected either please help it's not infected thats the healing process i've had mine done since march and it on and off does that simply keep using the salt solution if u stopped use it like twice to three times a week never use polysporin as it will give u a rash cuz it reacts with the sergical steel and never use alcohol rubbing pads as it will dry out and flake the skin just keep salting it and it will be fine Body piercing Tattoo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Smallpox Stomach cancer Psoriasis Violin Wound Prostate cancer Iron Earring Intravenous therapy Traumatic brain injury Fecal incontinence First aid Brewery Miscarriage Childbirth Female genital cutting Jon Secada Casting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bacon Homeopathy Gilding Otitis externa Antiseptic Nine Inch Nails Decompression sickness Medicine Piccolo Junior Saga Treehouse of Horror XV Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cliff Richard Acne Group A streptococcal infection Fancy rat Poker jargon Syphilis Manicure Peanut Skin Boom Town (Doctor Who) Dialysis EastEnders Aerial (dance move) Mouth ulcer Diarrhea Medical prescription Callus Cirrhosis Aloe The Contender (television series) Methamphetamine Mattress Crash test dummy Urinary incontinence Anthrax Blood (computer game) Breastfeeding Carpenters Upholstery Babe Ruth Theory of conduct Naval mine Fleetwood Mac Swimming Bruise Diving Electrophysiology Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Mouse (computing) Play piercing Sulfuric acid Menstrual cycle Survival skills The Shining (film) Time Out of Mind Coeliac disease Social rule Tenshinhan Scarification Ninja Scroll The Beatles discography Sodium chloride Adjustable gastric band Terminal ballistics Eczema Tuberculosis Chlorpromazine Hydrogen chloride Collodion process Rash Massage Aluminium Namie Amuro Zinc Internal ballistics
