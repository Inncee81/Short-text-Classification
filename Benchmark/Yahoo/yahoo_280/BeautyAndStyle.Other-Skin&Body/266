labret rings when to change to the post okay so it's been and a half weeks my aftercare card said wait weeks the h ocean product i'm using is made with seasalt and helps it heal faster than it normally would today was the first day i didn't notice any redness is it okay to change it out to the labret stud is there still a risk of infection i started smoking agian and clean it constantly and havent had a problem tell me what do you think coming from someone that has over piercings leave it alone for awhile you said today was the first day you didn't see any redness leave it alone for a little bit it looks like its starting to heal and you really don't want to put yourself back in the healing process by bothering it more give it another week with no redness or pain and i would think you would be ok to go ahead and switch it it seems like you are doing everything right to heal just give it sometime so you can make sure it is ready to be changed i would really hate for you to have taken all this time to heal it and something as silly as changing the ring too early set you back in your healing or even get it infected i know you are really ready to go to something new but it will be worth it in the end when you can switch it without having to worry good luck Body piercing Earring Lip piercing Tattoo 2000 Australian Grand Prix Nipple piercing Social rule Tenshinhan Piccolo Junior Saga Ethernet Bryan Robson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ocean's Twelve Burroughs B5000 CPU design 1957 World Series Tongue piercing Breastfeeding Miscarriage Mercury Atlas 6 Shaggy dog story Prostate cancer Heinkel He 100 Milton H.
