mexican candy and lead hey recently i've wanted to pick up some assorted mexican candy but i'm worried it still has lead in it i live in the bay area does anyone know which brands have the lead and if they've been cleaned out or even a list of clean candy thanks the most recent recall was for de la rosa pulparindo a tamarind candy generally the issue with lead and mexican candy has been that the wrappers have lead in the inks used to print on them certain kinds of candy are acidic and leach the lead into the candy tamarind is the biggest offender because it is so acidic so staying away from those candies or limiting your consumption to one or two pieces a month may be the best solution keep an eye on the fda website they announce the recalls quite regularly california also threw extra money at testing mexican candy more often to assure that we're not giving leaded sweets to our kids the fda offers an rss feed for the recall notices so you can keep up to date http www fda gov oc po firmrecalls rssrecalls xml when buying mexican candy look for packages that look fresh dollar stores are more likely to have older packages that are being cleared out of bigger stores but sometimes they cater to their clientelle so get to know your stores there are some local confectioners in the bay area that may be recreating mexican favorites there are a few in the los angeles area ask around or check chowhound com to see Food and Drug Administration 2003 California recall XML Mozilla Firefox Topps Cable television Coffee RSS (file format) Hamster California Postage stamp M&M's San Gabriel Valley Advance fee fraud Marilyn Monroe Podcasting Rave party Berkshire Hathaway Candy RFID Milk Soft drink Confectionery BitTorrent Thimerosal Coca-Cola Wheel of Fortune Bulk vending The Apprentice 2 Satchel Paige Burger King Kit Kat Sugar substitute Smarties (Ce De Candy) Acne Aspartame Windows Vista McDonald's Day of the Dead Tootsie Roll Industries Toyota Prius Breastfeeding Trademark Gmail Mexican-American War Tamarind Dairy Ajax (programming) Humphrey Bogart British Columbia Chili con carne Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Best Buy Tattoo Chocolate Aggregator Fancy rat George Costanza United Parcel Service Organic food Representational State Transfer Neopets Atari 8-bit family Cheese Chinatown, Los Angeles, California World Wide Web Surveillance Garth Brooks Game show Bicycle lighting Wal-Mart Blog Billboard Hot 100 Milpitas, California Heath bar Let's Make a Deal Gramophone record Phil Hendrie Teletext Arguments for and against drug prohibition Microeconomics Kyle Broflovski Coal Claremont, California Cuisine of Malaysia Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
