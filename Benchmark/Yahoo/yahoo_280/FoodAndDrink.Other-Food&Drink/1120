are cakes supposed to be alcoholic or is it supposed to cook out i purchased a cake for a friend from a bakery it is a specialty cake made with rum i thought that the rum was used for cooking to flavor but would cook out of the cake the cake had so much alcohol it was burning our throats and no one could eat it thank goodness the adults tasted it before the kids got to sample it needless to say we brought it back and told them there was so much alcohol it burned our throats apparently they just pour the rum over the cake the bakery acted shocked because i told her we were going to give it to the kids i didn't know they did this i thought the alcohol was supposed to cook out of it i am pregnant and this would have been equivalent to drinking was there an error in preparation or are cakes made this way if they are why don't they come with a warning label like alcoholic beverages like i said i always thought the alcohol burned out to leave the flavor only some rum cakes are soaked in rum after the cake is finished so you're getting all the alcohol from the rum the bakery should bake it clear that the cake is soaked in rum and not flavored with rum Rum Coffee Cookware and bakeware Bread Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Japanese cuisine Apple Sake Beer French cuisine Korean cuisine Grog Tea Chocolate Roman eating and drinking Tofu Pizza Moonshine Fruitcake Alcoholic beverage Alcohol Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Malaysia Wine Cuisine of the Southern United States Vodka Absinthe Breakfast McDonald's Mooncake Idli Cider Cantonese cuisine Food Cacha__a German cuisine Mai Tai Aging barrel Bengali cuisine Rum-running Cake Barbecue Baking Pisco Cuisine of Laos Trailer Park Boys Tea Classics Mochi One Tree Hill (TV series) Dr Pepper Scotch whisky Ginger Soup Soba Birthday Cookie Date Palm Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pasta Cocktail Oasis (band) Brewery Cauim Peruvian cuisine Root beer Pancake Soft drink Knots Landing Potato Tlingit Doughnut Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Homer Simpson Chili con carne Ramen Marie Antoinette Piccolo Junior Saga Richard Chase Flour The Apprentice 2 Risotto Vanilla Liqueur Ethanol Distilled beverage British cuisine Kosher foods Common bean Gluten-free diet Restaurant Theory of conduct Peanut Jonestown Sugar George Burns 2005 trial of Michael Jackson
