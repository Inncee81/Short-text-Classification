what's the best way to get your pork joint to crackle i heard about rubbing salt in but i can't help thinking there must be more to it than that primarily because i have rubbed salt in and it still didn't crackle if you nearly always get crackling on your pork joint can you please share your method with me thanks in advance first fo all pour a little olive oil over the outside then rub the salt into the skin make sure the skin is already well scored slit with a sharp knife and then put it into the oven that is already good and hot make sure the joint is cooked open and not covered check on it and make sure it isn't burning and if necessary turn the oven down a bit as it is important to start high and then go down rather than the other way round as a final cheat if this didn't work and it should you can finish it under a hot grill Barbecue Bacon Bread Cantonese cuisine Stove Jewish cuisine Grilling Internal ballistics Soap Pizza Tofu Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Denmark Vampire Cookware and bakeware Hot dog Kashrut Drill bit Wok Mayonnaise Knife Peanut butter Poker jargon Welding Sandwich Lisa the Vegetarian Cuisine of Malaysia Japanese cuisine Happy Tree Friends Motor oil Ham Sulfuric acid Rais massacre Kitchen Cuisine of the Philippines Roast beef Pottery Snake French fries Fire fighting D__ner kebab Leather Hansel und Gretel Casting Cooking on a campfire Domesticated turkey Pork rind Indianapolis 500 Korean cuisine Pancake Idli New York Giants Vinegar Tattoo Textile manufacturing Mango Risotto Soul food Rice pudding Chili con carne Memorial Stadium, Clemson Jiaozi Microwave oven Peruvian cuisine Solar power French cuisine Roman eating and drinking Fire extinguisher Piccolo Junior Saga Upholstery Salad Fingers Renewable energy Shaggy dog story Dodge Charger Cuisine of Laos Explosive material Dim sum Campfire Indian Oil Cup 2005 2003 World Series Hamburger Nunchaku Dosa The Strangerhood Radio controlled airplane Ramen McDonald's Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Aloe Korban YuYu Hakusho Woodworking Milton H.
