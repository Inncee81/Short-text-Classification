pertaining to culinary school i am years old and for the first time my local community college is offering culinary with the opportunity to earn a masters degree a passion of mine for a long time i can't keep myself out of the grocery store or the kitchen i'm highly creative and love learning new recipes via cookbooks and internet nothing like frsh produce and meats i have kids and my wife supports my choice very much plus she already likes my cooking so she won't be negative she understands i will have to work less hours and spend more time in class presently i am taking my pre requisites since the first culinary class does not begin until next august i have some nervousness about starting is this normal i am more excited then anything also i'm very driven and i want to establish myself strongly in the industry i believe perhaps some business classes after my culinary education could perhaps benefit me in the long run in the industry any suggestions note my course does offer intro to menu planning and cost controls intro to career management purchasing etc would osmeone who is already in this industry reccomend any sort of business classes on top i want to be versatile in the industry yes it's perfectly normal to be nervous i was when i went back to college for hospitality and restaurant management getting back in the college groove and being a non traditional student is nerve wracking for the first week or so if part of the culinary program doesn't offer the business classes which i'd be surprised if they don't then yes take them really important things like accounting marketing advertising etc those all tie right in to running your own place or having to be a manager sounds like you have all your ducks in a row congrats on going Walt Disney World College Program University of Houston Community college Columbia University Management information system Chinese cuisine Japanese cuisine British cuisine Microeconomics Master of Business Administration Auguste Escoffier Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Education in the United States Spice Girls Florida State University Lyceum of the Philippines French fries Recipe Chili con carne Kitchen Master's degree Chiropractic Wal-Mart Julia Child Management Garlic Extreme Programming Price discrimination Food Dog training Cooper Union Wall Street Baruch College Action potential Economic inequality Chinese University of Hong Kong Sam Walton Seneca College College of the Southwest Education in Australia Tesco Economics Culinary Institute of America Affirmative action Polish cuisine Chef Mapua Institute of Technology No Child Left Behind Act Le Cordon Bleu Babson College Enterprise content management Education in Romania Education in Hong Kong Saimin Ramen Urinary incontinence Cuisine of the Southern United States Advertising Homeschooling Minimum wage BAE Systems Johnson & Wales University About a Boy Pizza UK Singles Chart Education in Taiwan Washington University in St. Louis Tofu Emerson College Past teachings of Prem Rawat Peruvian cuisine Redundant array of independent disks Pennsylvania State University Athabasca University Cass Business School, London Thomas Keller Hamburger In-N-Out Burger Law of value Cooperative education Medical school Billboard Hot 100 AMA Computer University Florida Institute of Technology Warren Buffett University of Texas at San Antonio Software engineering Strategic management Jewish cuisine Dallas Baptist University Otterbein College
