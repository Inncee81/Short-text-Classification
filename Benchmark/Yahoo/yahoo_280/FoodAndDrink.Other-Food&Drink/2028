what year did taco bell come out i'm just curious my yr old asked me this today i had no answer for him so i though id try to get an answer here thank you glen bell was when he left the marine corps in world war ii was over and the economy was switching to peacetime pursuits in five years business would be booming and fast food along with it glen came home to the sleepy agricultural town of san bernardino certain that families would be in the market for the recreational activities that disappeared during the war he first thought of a miniature golf course but after facing his financial situation he went to work on something more the size of his pocketbook a hot dog stand bell's drive in was the name of that first stand and glen learned the business as he went his next unit would only be large enough for one person to operate and strictly takeout in he sold the first stand and began to build a perfected version the menu would be hamburgers and hot dogs as he began building his second the mcdonald brothers started their first unit in a strange stroke of coincidence also in san bernardino glen became increasingly interested in the idea of alternative menu items he was an avid mexican food take out customer and as such was well aware of the hang ups in ordering tacos to go from a full service restaurant if you wanted a dozen he recalls you were in for a wait they stuffed them first quickly fried them and stuck them together with a toothpick i thought they were delicious but something had to be done about the method of preparation my plan for experimenting with tacos he says was to obtain a location in a mexican neighborhood that way if tacos were successful potential competitors would write it off to the location and assume that the idea wouldn't sell anywhere else so glen searched out a good location in the right part of town on a busy main street he began by selling various hot dogs including a chili dog he formulated the chili dog's sauce himself and it would later become our taco sauce at the same time he researched tacos the shells had to be prepared quickly and efficiently they had to be fried first and stuffed later he had seen a crude version of a deep fry basket for tortillas made from stainless steel it was very experimental but i went ahead and had someone make one for me we hadn't thought about using wire yet so we came up with a heavy stainless version which stayed very hot and fried one at a time the idea for the first commercially fried shells would be picked up by the manufacturers of packaged shells now widely available in markets glen experimented until he was satisfied with the taco ingredients and proportions the next issue was how to introduce them there wasn't room for new items or to diversify the menus in the little stands we built then so i decided to sell cent tacos from a little window off to the side he says i'll never forget the first taco customer because naturally i was really concerned about his reaction he was dressed in a suit and as he bit into the taco the juice ran down his sleeve and dripped on his tie i thought 'we've lost this one ' but he came back amazingly enough and said 'that was good i'll take another one ' bank financing for the fledgling fast food industry was still out of the question so with tacos selling well and glen ready to open a second stand in barstow it was no coincidence that he added shakes to the menu a local ice cream manufacturer offered financing in exchange for carrying their product barstow was a ways away and glen was busy in san bernardino so he promised young ed hackbarth that he would eventually lease the stand to him if he would move out to barstow and run it ed took over the stand and later was to build his own as the founder of del taco with tacos selling so well it was time to put in a stand completely dedicated to them financing was still a roadblock so glen took a partner in order to be sure he was in a position to follow through with more stands when the idea took off between and he built three taco tia stands in san bernardino redlands and riverside Fast-food restaurant Fast food D__ner kebab Hamburger Breakfast Hot dog Cuisine of Denmark Pizza Tofu San Bernardino County, California Chili con carne Taco French fries Food Microsoft Strategic management Chinatown Windows XP Korean cuisine Street food German cuisine American Chinese cuisine Inland Empire (California) United Parcel Service IBM PC compatible Ramen Petroleum Barbecue MRE Microeconomics Welding Cuisine of the Philippines Quesadilla WordPerfect Japanese cuisine Shaggy dog story Peruvian cuisine Organic farming Fish and chips Cable television Piccolo Junior Saga Pancake Futurama (TV series -
