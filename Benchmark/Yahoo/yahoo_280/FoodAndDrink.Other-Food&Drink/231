can chocolate affect your behavior i find when i eat chocolate i become eccentric crazy and hyper for example a few months ago i purchased a large bag of easter eggs at lunch and ate them throughout the afternoon by the end of the day i was jumping around pretending i was a chipmunk this was out of character even for me as i am normally extraverted and outgoing anyway i was wondering what it is in chocolate that makes me act this way it's not just the sugar because when i eat surgery foods i don't behave differently and it isn't just the caffeine because when i drink red bull or coke i don't get really hyper it only seems to be with the chocolate why is this or is it just me imaging the chocolate has an effect i believe it can i am agitated if i eat brownies the babysitter said she could tell when my son had chocolate because his behavior became erratic he did not act that way just because he ate sugar or drank caffeine pop he has always had allergies he is an adult now and unfortunately was diagnosed as bipolar and worse he reacted violently to taking paxil so watch yourself in case there is some connection Caffeine Chocolate Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fecal incontinence Bipolar disorder Insomnia Hypoglycemia Conker's Bad Fur Day Food Breakfast Kodocha Soft drink Antidepressant Dog Urinary incontinence Cuisine of the Philippines Stomach cancer Pitaten Word of Wisdom Energy drink Mental illness Cocoa Tea Endometriosis Addiction Crohn's disease Coffee Folic acid Hiccup Breastfeeding Elephant The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Happy Tree Friends Customs and etiquette of Japan Migraine Allergy Cake Meal Theory of conduct Calvin and Hobbes Red Bull Sleep About a Boy Schizophrenia Clinical depression Trailer Park Boys Fasting Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Asperger syndrome One Piece minor characters Binge eating disorder Cuisine of Denmark Tooth Mouth ulcer Yerba mate Drink Sonic the Hedgehog Porridge Coconut crab Russian joke Brian Griffin Acne Teen Girl Squad Cocaine The Catcher in the Rye Irn-Bru Cookie Chicken Dieting Hyperactivity Stuttering M__ni__re___s disease Hangover Spidey Super Stories Cat The Smoking Room Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Tofu Roald Dahl Little Britain Tooth enamel Chronic fatigue syndrome Pump It Up Human sexual behavior Social rule Frog Rice pudding M&M's Ovaltine Milk Lisa the Vegetarian Homer Simpson Superman III Lunch In-N-Out Burger Kit Kat Anemia
