a follow up to the greens question thanks for everyone who answered my question but i felt that i had to fine tune my question a bit my fiance loves to juice as many people mentioned but i prefer the 'store bought' powder version it goes by the name of greens but that's here in canada it's not cheap at per container but it's supposed to be really good stuff now my original question was can i just drink this instead of eating my veggies cuz i don't really eat alot of veggies i don't like them corn some grean beans now and then cabbage as in coleslaw lol some fruit and that's about it yeah i can get my fibre or whatever elsewhere so i'm not worried about that it's mixed daily with apple juice also i really want the benefit of the vegetables antioxidants etc without having to eat them it doesn't taste all that bad either you get used to it no doctor would recommend this but as long as you get your fiber in and take a vitamin you will be ok Antioxidant Fecal incontinence Vitamin C MRE Vegetarianism Jewish cuisine Beet Russian cuisine Veganism Cuisine of Denmark Dietary fiber Wine Hamster Ramen Coffee Food Breakfast Nutrition Folic acid Breastfeeding Potato Beer Kit Kat Common bean German cuisine Tocopherol Healthy eating Cuisine of Malaysia Food preservation Chocolate Chili con carne Theory of conduct Peruvian cuisine Sauerkraut Milk Pomegranate Frugivore Cuisine of the Philippines Mango Avenue Q Dieting Domesticated turkey Cuisine of Singapore French cuisine Organic food Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Guinea pig Little Britain Muesli Russian joke Cheese Soul food Domestic rabbit Textile manufacturing Lemon Marmite Pet skunk Jon Secada Apple Cuisine of the Southern United States Fanta The Fairly OddParents Maize Swedish cuisine Food storage Colorectal cancer Kiwifruit Dim sum Barbecue Ice cream Bread Patent medicine Hiberno-English Date Palm Cuisine of Argentina In-N-Out Burger Tea One Piece minor characters Food guide pyramid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mnemonic Natt__ Hot dog Watermelon Bulk vending Carrot Rum Paprika Broccoli Jute Conker's Bad Fur Day Bengali cuisine Nabemono Vegetarian cuisine Flavonoid Hey Jude
