my freezer thawed and refroze should i replace it or am i doing something wrong i have a fridgeidare chest freezer that is approx yrs old i noticed a few weeks ago my ice cream had liquefied but every thing else was frozen solid now every thing on the top partially thawed and then all the ice and water froze solid in the bottom of the freezer the unit is still freezing ice along the inside of the walls is the unit bad or is there a common problem here also i defrosted the unit approx mths ago sounds like there's a problem with the defrost system call in a service tech most likely the defrost timer is running slow and keeping the freezer in defrost mode too long while in defrost mode even after the thermostat meant to prevent what you have happening trips to turn off the heater the compressor is disabled shouldn't be too bad service call fee and a defrost timer could also be a bad thermostat about the same price Refrigerator Thermostat Freezing Ice cream Ice Freezer Apollo 13 Life in the Freezer Slow cooker Glacier Dairy Carbon dioxide Toyota Prius Atari 8-bit family Embedded system Furnace Sea ice Mountaineering Sento Cryonics HVAC Home repair Freeze drying Solar power IBM PC compatible Thermal power station Traffic light The Price Is Right Mars Exploration Rover Water (molecule) Tofu Coffee Robot Master STS-62 Autonomous building BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Diseases of the honeybee SB-129 Bubble Bobble Mammoth Heat Bagel Metroid Prime Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Ice hockey Ice age Sea level rise Rise of Nations Avalanche Bone marrow transplant Final Fantasy magic Basement Windows XP Ceramics Cooler Fog Timer In The Groove (game) Soyuz T-13 Equine conformation Phase (matter) Rebreather Philip J.
