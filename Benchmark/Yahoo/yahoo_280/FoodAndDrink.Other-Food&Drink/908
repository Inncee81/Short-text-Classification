what is your favorite cut for steak and how do you like it new york t bone porterhouse rib eye filet mignon sirloin or some other my favorite cut is an argentinian cut called cabreria which is basically the tenderloin part of the porterhouse but cointains the bone its very tender lean but has a lot more flavor than the filete mignon due to the closeness of the bone perfect combination of health tenderness and flavor which i happen to like better than the rib eye i like it medium with salt and a hint of pepper gimme a good red wine and i'm in heaven kevin its a longer cut along the bone not like the more round like mignon which is not as close to the bone and more into the belly so don't try to get ssmart with the argentinian new beeding styles and by the way the least used muscle is the tenderloin which is the most tender and lean rib eye are also tender but have more marbeling fat mmmmmm francois tres bien you'll probably be surprised at my favorite cut the ranch steak this is because i like to grill my steaks and i like some fat on the meat so that it has flavor and doesn't dry out on the grill most of the finer cuts of steak don't have enough fat for grilling the ranch steak cuts i get from a local grocery are just heaven never gristly or tough i too don't care to season a good steak much the natural flavor of a good cut is the best medium rare a little salt and pepper and of course a fine wine you're a man after my own heart now i know this is not a french wine but italian but try a bottle of brunello di monticiano you'll never forget it but a fine burgundy is good too sante et bon appetit forgive me for leaving out the accent aigu lol T-bone steak Cuisine of Denmark Kebab Barbecue Wine Japanese cuisine Cajun cuisine Cantonese cuisine Ramen French cuisine Jewish cuisine Tenderloin, San Francisco Hot dog German cuisine Chili con carne Equine conformation Pork chop Tofu Soul food Hamburger Wood carving Bacon Cuisine of Africa Ham Cuisine of the Philippines French fries Chocolate Cuisine of the Southern United States Fast-food restaurant Chicken soup Milk Abdomen Steak n Shake Cuisine of Malaysia Kosher foods Pizza Hiberno-English Cheesesteak Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Fancy rat Cuisine of Brazil Rib Cuisine of Laos Jon Secada Roman eating and drinking Fish and chips Coffee Oyster Peruvian cuisine Fajita Puberty Horse meat Risotto Capsicum Comanche Sin City Babe Ruth Humphrey Bogart Pork Peanut Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Food preservation Foie gras Red Hot Chili Peppers Pottery American Bison Food Sternum Galbi Cuisine of Greece Crocodilia Moe Szyslak Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asado Ultimate Muscle Hip hop collaborations Hell's Kitchen (television) Rum Cheese Professional wrestling holds Champagne (beverage) Knife Time Out of Mind Pinot Noir Chile pepper Bon Jovi MRE Bengali cuisine Social rule Professional wrestling throws Common bean Mountain Dew The Lovely Bones
