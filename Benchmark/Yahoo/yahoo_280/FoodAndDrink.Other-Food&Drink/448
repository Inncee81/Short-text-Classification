when they say let turkey stand minutes before carving is that in or outside the oven if it's outsde won't it get cold i just saw a video that says we should brin it put it in salt water for hours o so is this good and how exactly does it help make it more juicy it is best to rest roast meat for ten to twenty minutes outside of the oven this allows air to circulate when a joint or bird is removed from the oven it is still cooking and will continue to cook for a few minutes more the juices will set and the fats will re coagulate making the food easier to carve the food will stil be warm and if anyone wants their food piping hot the slices can be put under a warm salamander broiler for a minute or so howqever the sauce or jus that you have made to accompany the dish will ensure a comfortable temperature for the food Barbecue Domesticated turkey French fries Cuisine of Denmark Cookware and bakeware Bacon Tofu Cantonese cuisine Jewish cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Sandwich Roman eating and drinking Kitchen Hamburger Cuisine of Malaysia Japanese cuisine Hot dog Chicken soup D__ner kebab Pizza Foodborne illness Stock (food) Cooking on a campfire German cuisine Breakfast Kosher foods Chili con carne Sauce Yoghurt Soul food Bagel Ramen Bengali cuisine Peruvian cuisine Solar power British cuisine Ice cream Sauerkraut Cuisine of Argentina MRE Roast beef Idli Korean cuisine Beef noodle soup Salad Cuisine of Brazil Peking Duck Coffee Comanche Cuisine of Singapore Egg (food) Food Sunday roast Cooking Brewery Dim sum Nabemono Cuisine of the Southern United States Dairy Peanut butter Fish and chips Toast Steaming Sushi Chicken Pancake Kebab Fire fighting Slow cooker Dishwasher Carbon dioxide Recipe Pasta Stove Soy sauce French cuisine Bento Curry Soup Roux Cuisine of Africa Dumpling Baking Ham Ketchup Food processing Hot pot Risotto Mayonnaise Kraft Dinner Cuisine of Thailand Russian cuisine Thermoregulation Collard greens
