can you ship food by mail i live in another state and the place i want pizza from is a five hour drive away when i was in the area and ordered from this place they would fix it a certain way so it was better suited for travel i was wondering if i could order it and have them ship it to my house or something i know this sounds silly but it's really great pizza and i don't get a chance to go up there very often yes but i don't recommend it in your case since the food needs to be packed and sealed properly to ship ideally they would freeze the pizza and ship it in dry ice and most pizzerias are not equipped for that and it would be expensive and not taste the same as fresh pizza i have places i like like that and what i do is plan special visits to the area and make sure i stop there not the best answer i know though i speak from experience Pizza Pizza delivery Refrigerator car Street food Domino's Pizza Sausage Gustavus Franklin Swift Fast-food restaurant Cuisine of Brazil Bikini Bottom 1925 serum run to Nome Hard disk Invader Zim Tofu Pizza Hut Cruising (maritime) Carbon dioxide Spaceballs Drowning Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Avalanche Chicago, Illinois The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Oregano Coffee Food preservation Tea Confederation Bridge RuneScape skills Fishing Curry Water Black pepper Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Floppy disk Beltway sniper attacks Chicago-style pizza M16 (rifle) Grandview, U.S.A.
