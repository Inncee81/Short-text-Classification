a crapload of ants in tub of uncooked rice we have a giant tub of uncooked rice and theres ants everywhere the ants are in the rice on top of it sitting on the sides of the tub and stuff how do i get rid of the ants without throwing all the rice away the ants usually follow a trail so i recommend that you move the tub of rice to a different location so you don't have more ants going into the rice this location is just temporary so you can start getting rid of the ants for example in the backyard at the new location leave the lid off and brush off the the ants when they exit the tub eventually you'll get rid of the ants since more ants are going out than coming in also at the new location you can use a dustbuster to pick up the ants on the side of the container as they move off the rice just vacuum them off if you don't care about the top layer of rice just a shop vac and just vacuum the top layer of rice and ants Top-bar hive Customs and etiquette of Japan Casting Ant Sushi Aerial (dance move) Vacuum cleaner Upholstery RuneScape quests Boy's surface Textile manufacturing Pottery Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carburetor Ant colony optimization Rice Tofu Boyd Rice Jerry Rice I Ching divination Rice University Sea-Monkey San Francisco 49ers SimAnt Hamburger Sake Ice cream Swimming pool Volleyball Carnivorous plant Cincinnati Bengals The Inside Draw poker Jackass: The Movie Japanese tea ceremony New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Idli Coffee Treehouse of Horror VII Rail terminology RuneScape locations One Piece minor characters SMTV Live Che Guevara Raw food diet Buick Skylark Water (molecule) Alien Ant Farm Two-stroke cycle Japanese cuisine Condoleezza Rice Anne Rice A Tale of a Tub Roman surface Big Brother (USA TV series) Milk Mattress A Bug's Life New England Patriots Adam & the Ants The Cartridge Family Agar plate New York Giants DualDisc Theory of conduct Bong MapleStory National Football League Lore $ale of the Century Betting (poker) Tesla turbine Skateboarding trick Blood (computer game) Oakland Raiders Edgar Rice Burroughs Ice resurfacer Super Bowl XXIII Planetary nebula Vacuum Polypropylene Glutinous rice The Giver Swingout Snake Poker jargon Hard disk Chicken soup Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Barbecue Shen Gong Wu Happy Tree Friends Dairy Portugal national football team Professional wrestling holds Pancake Lindy Basic Super Bowl XXVII Curtin University of Technology Preston, Minnesota
