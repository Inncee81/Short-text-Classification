how long will a rotisserie chicken last in the fridge i bought the chicken on thursday and it is now saturday i just made a pasta dish with it and my general rule of thumb is that once cooked meats poultry beef pork are good for another two days possibly a little conservative i know i am thrown by the rotisserie chicken though because it was cooked on thursday how many more days do you think i can eat the pasta dish if any i guarantee two is good usually days are okay for cooked meats that are stored in refrigeration the main concern then is quality not safety you have a good yes conservative rule so relax while taking a course in microbiology we were to bring in a food item i decided to bring in bbq beef i even let it sit out for hours before placing in the refer after plating it on media in the lab and a proper time and heat it had zero cell growth one reason for this is because of course the heat killed the bacteria that was on it also the moisture of the meat was greatly reduced and bacteria and fungi need water in order to survive relax your food is good for more days MRE Food Food preservation French cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Barbecue Cantonese cuisine Hamburger Escherichia coli O157:H7 Pasta Foodborne illness Cajun cuisine German cuisine Ramen Cuisine of Malaysia Sausage Egg (food) Chili con carne Cheese Stock (food) Korean cuisine D__ner kebab Chicken Dim sum Taiwanese cuisine Agar plate Tofu Kitchen Refrigerator Hell's Kitchen (television) Cooking Cuisine of the Southern United States Slow cooker Compost Gyros Steaming Cuisine of Africa Meat Dumpling Cha chaan teng Salad Taboo food and drink Steak McDonald's Vegetarianism Shawarma Irish cuisine Dairy Bacteria Roman eating and drinking Satay Bolognese sauce Halaal Sandwich Chinese cuisine Grilling Russian cuisine Sauce Kosher foods Soul food Solar power Pie Soup Hakka cuisine Omega-3 fatty acid Pizza Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of the Philippines Cookware and bakeware Cuisine of Laos Cuisine of Vietnam Fish and chips Chicken soup American Chinese cuisine Food science Agriculture in Australia Pork Curry Fugu Sewage treatment Sauerkraut Sterilization (microbiology) Livestock Chopsticks Shelf life Couscous Shanghai cuisine Peruvian cuisine Jerky (food) Bacon
