where is the best pizza in the us name the city restaurant deep dish or thin crust and how and why it's the best one day i want to travel the us tasting all the pizzas i love pizza p s i live in a small town in the south and the best i have had so far is like papa johns thin with italin sausage mmm good but i bet you guys from ny and chicago and elswhere know of some better places i am from chicago and if you like deep dish i'd recommend lou malnati's uno's used to be good but i didn't like it so much last time i had it even though uno's and malnatti's are very similar and at one point were actually owned by the same family a father and son respectively i believe uno's is now a huge chain and i can safely say it sucks forever malnati's is a chain but the original locations are still good ricobene's offers a real nice slice but i can only recommend the location on th street and during their lunch rush though they will warm up the slice for you their deep dish is a little more tomato y than malnati's but it's real good and so is their pan pizza malnati's will send you a pizza in the mail frozen and it's really a good representation of what you'd get in the restaurant if you bake it right please do that for yourself right now for thin crust or pan a place with a few locations is rosati's the one near elk grove village i can vouch for that's near chicago there's a place called the tower or something it's near lake forest and it has delicious thin crust i must sound like a snob but you really haven't had pizza until you've eaten from a small regional chain or an individual store the big places have their dough frozen and pre molded they skimp on the topings and make a characterless pizza with reliable pre fab ingredients that taste the same every time which is good and bad do yourself a favor i don't mean to crap on the south but restaurants are real hard to do in rural areas the southern palate is also different and seems to appreciate muted flavors reliable textures get to big cities in the north and you will remember forever good luck and have fun oh and stay away from the frou frou places they are all flash and no substance Chicago-style pizza Bread Pizza Hut Cuisine of Denmark Breakfast McDonald's Hamburger Hot dog German cuisine Barbecue Cuisine of the Southern United States Fast-food restaurant French cuisine Bagel Fish and chips D__ner kebab Cuisine of the Philippines Cheese Tofu Korean cuisine Papa John's Pizza Sushi Dim sum Cookware and bakeware Sauerkraut Food Cajun cuisine Pizza delivery Ramen Craps Sausage Cuisine of Singapore Tomato Cuisine of Argentina Potato chips Potato Cha chaan teng Oregano In-N-Out Burger Pie Wall Street Hot pot Full English breakfast Jewish cuisine Pancake Tlingit Curry Domesticated turkey Cuisine of the Midwest Peruvian cuisine Chili con carne Idli Vegetarian cuisine Tea French fries Meatloaf New Haven, Connecticut Apple pie Brewery Fugu San Andreas (state) Ketchup Shakey's Pizza Bengali cuisine Cuisine of Norway Recipe Baklava Cookie British cuisine Yakitate!!
