question about what i just ate help please well ive been eating pure healthy for a month now and today was a big family thing since my mom came back to visit us and it was this whole thing but to sum it all up we went to dennys i haven't eaten any fried food in months so i decided to order the ranch steak and instead of french fries and onion rings i orderd corn and mashed potatoe without the gravy and a fruit cup that had grapes and pineapple i generally think that it wasn't that bad because none of it was fried and id just really like a second opinion am i going to get fat from just this meal also earlier today i had an apple and a turkey sandwich wheat bread and low fat mayo and a hardboiled egg did i exceed my calorie intake for the day i don't know the calorie count for denny's foods but you did good you ate lightly before going out and i commend you for not using the family get together as an excuse to pig out if you did exceed your calories for the day it's no big deal i'm sure you didn't do it by much you did the best you could under the circumstances and one day won't set you back Hamburger Cuisine of Denmark McDonald's Sandwich Cuisine of the Southern United States Jewish cuisine Breakfast Domesticated turkey Soul food Hot dog Fast-food restaurant MRE French cuisine Japanese cuisine French fries Fish and chips Dieting Pizza Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of Argentina Tofu Food Potato Cuisine of Africa Omega-3 fatty acid Fast food Obesity Cajun cuisine Vegetarianism Bread Bengali cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Little Britain Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of the Philippines Ramen Cuisine of Singapore 613 mitzvot Super Size Me Bacon Egg (food) Dumpling Roman eating and drinking Atkins Nutritional Approach Veganism Barbecue Pig (zodiac) Street food Dim sum Cha chaan teng British cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Food preservation Food guide pyramid Korean cuisine Polish cuisine Porridge Low-carbohydrate diet Cantonese cuisine Dietary fiber Kosher foods Healthy eating Cuisine of Austria Fasting South Beach diet In-N-Out Burger Bagel Calorie Cuisine of the Midwest Salad Bodybuilding Serbian cuisine Deep frying Potato pancakes Milk Pancake Folic acid Burger King Philip J.
