flavored water nutrition help so i was wondering is flavored water actually good for you i notice most if not all have splenda or some kind of sweetner in it so is flavored water just as healthy for you as drinking regular water every day i don't like drinking plain water so is it ok if i substitute flavored for regular thanks i personally am against flavored water i think there was just an article about them in the wall street journal they cost a million bucks simply for added flavoring and supposedly more nutrients they are loaded with calories for water which to me is so not worth drinking when it's just water plain ole water is hard to beat it is like the most natural healthy thing you can put in your body why mess with it to me the calorie thing is the worst part if i am going to be taking in more calories by drinking water i don't care if it is flavored or extra healthy then it is just so not worth it Calorie Dieting Energy Coffee Healthy eating Dietary fiber Breastfeeding Nutrition Folic acid Fasting Chocolate Soft drink Atkins Nutritional Approach Bread Standard enthalpy change of fusion Diet Coke McDonald's Cheese Soy milk In-N-Out Burger The Coca-Cola Company Sugar substitute Egg (food) Tofu Life extension Eutrophication Tocopherol Social rule Major League Baseball television contracts Brewery Obesity Omega-3 fatty acid Pig (zodiac) Vodka Calorie restriction Domesticated turkey Hypoglycemia Theory of conduct Nutrient Dr Pepper American Psycho Escherichia coli O157:H7 Microeconomics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Trans fat Hyperthermia Diet soda Cider Ramen 7 Up Asiago cheese Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hamburger Coca-Cola Cuisine of Brazil Rum New Coke Flax Flavouring DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Organic food Humphrey Bogart Poker jargon Horseshoe Junk food English plural Sake Mercury (planet) Gatorade The Apprentice 2 Human height Fish farming Water Fast food Potassium Kosher foods Reconstruction of Iraq Monopoly (game) Japanese tea ceremony Lemonade Goodness and value theory Brown rice Degree Fahrenheit Stomach cancer Quake III Arena Customs and etiquette of Japan Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious Polyols Prostate cancer Rice President (game) 2000 Australian Grand Prix
