is there a difference between organic and all natural foods at my local health food store i was told that the only difference is that the all natural foods have not been inspected by the fda so they cannot put the word organic on the item i do not know if he knew what he was talking about it sounds about like our government though to have 'organic' on the label food has to undergo testing they check to make sure that there is no pollen drift from genetically engineered plants nearby or pesticides that blew over from a neighboring farm that it says 'organic' means that it passed the test all natural foods may not have been tested since it costs a lot they also may have failed the test all natural foods might have pesticides that blew on them from another farm but the growers didn't add anything like that themselves Organic food Organic farming Genetically modified food Diseases of the honeybee Pesticide Food and Drug Administration Food irradiation Food Illegal drug trade Vanilla Hydroponics Genetic engineering Pollinator decline Genetically modified organism Pollination management Biotechnology Coca-Cola Flower Pollination Honeybee Biological pest control Sustainable agriculture Vegetarianism Apple Overpopulation Codex Alimentarius Pesticide poisoning Pesticide misuse Local food Transgenic maize Factory farming Plant breeding Alcohol fuel Organic gardening American Red Cross Green Revolution Animal testing Allergy Dairy United States Department of Agriculture Poison Nuclear power Plant Genetics Ecology Milk Handloading Software testing Maize Cannabis cultivation Evidence of evolution Agricultural policy Honey Trade war over genetically modified food Banana Macroevolution Fish farming Deforestation Pepsi-Cola Sugar substitute Mosquito Cooperative Omega-3 fatty acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Luminiferous aether Stomach cancer Veganism Biodiversity Chernobyl accident Cheese Slow Food USS Williamson (DD-244) Bee learning and communication Biology Biodiesel Science Oscilloscope Genetic algorithm Kashrut Conifer cones Synergy Lauren Bacall Domestication HIV test Agricultural machinery Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement Coffee Gypsy moth Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Foodborne illness Agriculture Space Shuttle program Agricultural wastewater treatment Norman Borlaug Animal Agricultural science Aspartame Folic acid Bus models used in New York City Transit
