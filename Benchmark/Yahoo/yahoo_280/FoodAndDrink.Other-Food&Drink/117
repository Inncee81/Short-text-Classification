why milk is called slow poison god is great becoz he created me which milk is it referring to processed milk that's been homogenized and pasturized that comes from corporate dairies where the animals are pumped full of hormones steroids and other chemicals where the cows are milked whether they are sick or healthy that milk yeah i'd go along with that statement then if anyone wants milk that is actually nutritious they should look into cow share programs you can purchase a share in an organic herd of dairy cow from small local family farms you can not get raw milk unless you own the cow in the us typically you can buy a half or whole share the more shares you buy the more milk you get per week we are empty nester's now so we get a gallon a week it's great and we're seeing many health benefits from the raw milk not only us but our dog and cats who are enjoying this treat as well the notion that milk is only good for infants is incorrect there are many nutrients in milk that we who are well over need and enjoy the benefits of those who are afflicted with different allergies is also well documented benefits not brought about by processed milk i have no problems digesting raw milk but did have problems with processed milk and other dairy products such as ice creme yogurt etc those problems are gone much the same as indigestion heart burn since we began eating strictly organic foods over years ago it's a great way to enjoy life Milk Dairy farming Vegetarianism Veganism Pasteurization Livestock Breastfeeding Cattle Dairy product Organic farming Food Chocolate Raw milk Dairy cattle Cheese Raw food diet Coffee Soybean Lactose intolerance Domestic goat Escherichia coli O157:H7 Soy milk Cat Infant formula Lactobacillus acidophilus Crohn's disease Honey Omega-3 fatty acid Guinea pig Goat Tofu Insulin Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Breast milk Yoghurt Vitamin D Gastrointestinal tract Tea Coeliac disease Nestl__ Rooibos Kashrut Peanut Kosher foods Dog Agriculture in Australia Sewage treatment Acne Kangaroo Healthy eating Economy of the United States Waste management Hamster Factory farming Animal rights Protein Soft drink Agriculture Vitamin C Domestication Chronic fatigue syndrome Growth hormone treatment Medicine Local food Meat analogue Taboo food and drink Vegetarian nutrition Fancy rat Common Agricultural Policy Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Trans fat Illegal drug trade Domestic rabbit Dieting Earthworm Economy of the Soviet Union Refrigerator car Rice Stomach cancer Puberty Cancer Gastroparesis Cuisine of Denmark Foodborne illness Eutrophication Hormone
