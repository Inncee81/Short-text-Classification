diet exercise advice first off i am a year old male who is and lbs i want to get down to to look a little more toned got to get rid of the beer belly well i started my workout last week and i am riding my bike mile a day and eating better meals i have broken my meal in to calorie meals a day about hours apart the meals are low sugar high protein like fish chicken and beef nothing fried and i no longer drink sugar drinks i drink ounces of water a day i just wanted to know if this was a good way to lose ten pounds in one month and also i have been stealing my moms weight watchers for some of my meals are those okay most have around calories and grams of protien and like grams of sugar will those be okay to diet with or do i need to stop eating those please if anyone can think of anything else to help me reach my goal give me some advise thanks to everyone who answers that's really amazing actually i used to be in pretty much the same shape as you at pounds and preparing to leave for college so i altered my diet as you have done by cutting out sugar drinks such as soda and thinks that weren't beneficial to my body and working out is good though if you want a toned look and want to get ride of a 'beer belly' biking isn't really the best way to cut stomach weight given you will loose weight by biking that much just maybe not exactly where you'd prefer i would suggest if you are specifically targeting your abdominal region to purchase an exercise ball like the big ones you see at gyms and occasionally on tv you can procure one for a relatively inexpensive price then lay on it with your lower back and just do crunches going as far back as you can and as far forward google 'exercise ball exercises' for more exercises or ask an employee at a local gym for advice on optimizing your results with it anyways that is what i did mostly and i biked and played basketball and lifted weights a lot so instead of being a pound average looking guy after about months of that i'm now and have lean cut muscles i would just say eat healthy don't cut out any food groups except for sugar anyways it only gives you temporary energy when you consume it anyways you don't need the weight watcher meals i would just as i did learn to cook for yourself learn to cook healthy for example using olive oil in place of butter or things like that just to make your meals better a lot of my meals were high protein high carb low cal do research on 'good carbohydrates' try to include them in as many meals as you can they give you invaluable energy and will help you focus and stay awake easier at school and work if you'd like to discuss what you can do to shed weight further you can either email me or contact me via aim arcticfable i hope this helps and i wish you well in your endeavors also the meals is good for keeping your metabolism running at peak capacity and burning the most amount of fat possible in a day however i would recommend eat a well balance hearty breakfast as this is your first meal of the day providing you with most of the energy for the day especially if you eat small meals for most of the day and at night is when i would consume most of your proteins because when you are sleeping is when your muscles are doing most of the repairing and rebuilding from stressing them by working out in the morning with breakfast is when you'd want more 'good carbs' for energy to stay with you throughout the day Obesity Milk Veganism Nutrition Breastfeeding Healthy eating Insulin Omega-3 fatty acid Coffee Tocopherol Cuisine of Denmark Stomach cancer Vegetarianism Egg (food) Diabetes mellitus Tooth Bread French cuisine Coronary heart disease Super Size Me Exercise South Beach diet Alcoholic beverage Dietary fiber Sleep Equine conformation McDonald's Cheese Chicken Domestic rabbit Adjustable gastric band Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fancy rat Fecal incontinence Ramen Cuisine of the Philippines Glycemic index Bacon Cuisine of Brazil Soft drink Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Glycogen storage disease type I Weight Watchers Fasting Chocolate Folic acid Fugu Hamburger Protein Sugar substitute Meal Puberty Raw food diet Growth hormone treatment Peanut Calorie Barbecue Tofu Peruvian cuisine Calorie restriction In-N-Out Burger Bong Microeconomics Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Africa Motorcycle Little Britain Binge eating disorder Marathon (sport) Internal ballistics Acorn Trans fat Japanese cuisine Explosive material Insomnia Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hyperglycemia Cat Aspartame British cuisine Chronic fatigue syndrome
