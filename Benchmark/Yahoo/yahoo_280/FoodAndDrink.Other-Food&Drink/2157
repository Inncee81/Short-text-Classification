what are simple sugars and processed grains give an example of what foods i might find these in if you're going to have a calorie sweetner is splenda ok for you is any whole wheat bread ok what do they mean by processed grains hmmm you might have better luck asking this in the math science section because this is a chemistry question it has to do with how easy the molecules are to break down i believe sugars like honey cane sugar glucose syrup corn syrup are all very easy to break down and metabolize but some more so than others i think glucose is the easiest for mountain climbing you can get these nasty packets called gu and i think they're just solid glucose so you can get the quickest energy yech anyway along that same continuum are the other carbohydrates that's what sugar is a simple carbohydrate starches and grains are complex carbohydrates because i believe they're made up or multiple simple carbs joined together i think potato starch and white rice are all pretty basic i think it's easy for your body to break them quickly into sugars so you can get hungry again awfully soon white flour the processed kind is just the endosperm of the grain which again is easy to break down the germ which is protein and the bran fiber are left in in whole grains so you've got a lower concentration of the white easy stuff the endosperm and the protein and fiber are now in there making the bread harder to digest and keeping you full longer whole wheat breads pastas etc usually are made of a mix of whole wheat and white refined flour because whole wheat is heavy and the white flour lightens it up it's good to choose a bread that's got whole wheat flour as the first ingredient i believe or anything that's got high fiber and protein counts finally i love splenda i say go for it i use it all the time hope that helps good luck Glucose Sugar Biochemistry Brewery Carbohydrate Atkins Nutritional Approach Low-carbohydrate diet Cereal Wheat Dietary fiber Food Glycemic index Sugarcane Hypoglycemia Nutrition South Beach diet Cell (biology) Polysaccharide Veganism Gluten-free diet Dieting Japanese cuisine Vegetarianism Potato Ice cream German cuisine Sucrose Protein Honey Rice Alcohol fuel Photosynthesis Soy protein Gluten Bran Sake Glucokinase Sugar beet Coeliac disease Tooth Sucralose Sugar substitute Nutrient Brewing Cellular respiration Hamster Breakfast Milk Insulin Soul food White bread Maize Cassava Jewish cuisine Cajun cuisine Genetic engineering Pancake Metabolism Glycogen Bodybuilding Flowering plant Fecal incontinence Soup Weight training Glycogen storage disease type I Beer Ecology Food guide pyramid MRE Pizza Plastic Cuisine of Singapore Alcohol Cuisine of Brazil Bengali cuisine Fermentation Moonshine Soft drink Oatmeal Folic acid Acetic acid Polyols Kellogg Company Vegetarian cuisine Gatorade Porridge Soy milk Citric acid cycle Peruvian cuisine
