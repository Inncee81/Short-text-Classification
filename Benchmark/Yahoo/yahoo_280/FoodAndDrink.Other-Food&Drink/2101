what do you think about the fda and the chocolate okay so i just saw right now on yahoo news that the fda wants to replace cocoa butter which is used on chocolate and change it with vegetable oil however many say that the cocoa butter is part of what makes it so good and with vegetable oil it just wouldnt be the same so do you guys think they should f k off and focus on more important things like tainted meat or is it okay for them to change the recipe on a delicious snack most of us love my mistake either way whoever wants this needs to f k off and let us be the grocery manufacturers association put this petition together but the chocolate manufacturers association the ones who'd be allowed to make this substandard chocolate also signed off on the proposal if you're unhappy with it and i certainly am definitely tell the chocolate makers that you don't want them passing off this vegetable fat substitute stuff as the real thing http chocolateusa org about us our members asp if you read over the grocery manufacturers association proposal there are lots of other things you probably wouldn't like to eat as well including yogurt made with powdered milk instead of fresh milk chemical treatments in cheeses instead of pasturization and enzyme modified egg yolks instead of real egg yolks in mayonaise they think this is progress at least that's how they're selling it to the public in reality is cheaper and more efficient most of these products can already be made they're just asking to use common everyday words that we understand to pass them off to us mayonaise means something we understand that as a shorthand for the common ingredients currently allowed the same with chocolate chocolate without cocoa butter would not be the same thing Ice cream Chocolate Breakfast Cheese Hamburger Mayonnaise Kosher foods Dairy Tofu Veganism Kit Kat Cake Food Vegetarianism Coffee Omega-3 fatty acid Soap Butter German cuisine Trans fat Cuisine of Brazil Jewish cuisine Margarine Curry Cocoa Recipe French cuisine Pancake Cookie Organic food Biscuit Vegetarian cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Japanese cuisine Pizza Cuisine of the Philippines Sandwich Meat analogue Dairy product Bengali cuisine Healthy eating Soybean Plastic Chili con carne Oreo Fecal incontinence Soy milk Food and Drug Administration Soup Sugar Yoghurt Ramen Mooncake Polish cuisine Food preservation Wal-Mart Bagel Soul food Bread Rice pudding Cantonese cuisine Egg (food) Peanut Ovaltine In-N-Out Burger Microeconomics Gumbo Cuisine of Africa Snack food Porridge Cream (food) The Hershey Company Hamster Cadbury Schweppes Rice Krispies Cheesecake Biodiesel Genericized trademark Twix Amul Lactose intolerance MRE Saturated fat Hot chocolate Peruvian cuisine Patent medicine Rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II Milkshake Heath bar Lecithin Roman eating and drinking Soy protein Genetically modified food
