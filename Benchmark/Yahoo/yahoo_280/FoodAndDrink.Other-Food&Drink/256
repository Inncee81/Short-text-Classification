sell food to supermarket i make chocolate darn good chocolate how do i sell it to supermarkets that vary in size from several to hundreds of chain stores please provide link if possible thanks david i do sales for a company that sells snack items so this is what i would do your best bet may be locally owned specialty or gourmet shops you'd be more likely to ask for a premium price at these and get them with these stores typically the owner is who does the grocery buying but sometimes the manager can you will just need to ask for a larger supermarket call and ask for the grocery manager speak to the grocery manager and ask if they do the grocery buying for the store if they do there's your person if not ask who does you may end up having to call a corporate headquarters and speaking to the grocery buyer there be sure to have all your info prepared package size cost to the buyer targeted retail price and what the stores margin will be how much they will make off of it and what the margin is a nice colorful brochure can come in really handy and be prepared to mail or drop of samples of your chocolate they are going to want to try it first usually don't be discouraged if you have to do some tracking down of the person you need to speak with be sure to get names and be prepared to deal with no's have answers to objections ready in case they say they already carry a lot of chocolate or they don't have a market for it whatever have your reasons ready to go i hope this all helps i spend a lot of my day trying to find who i need to talk to and convincing them they need our product oh also if you are dealing with someone who actually works at the store be concious of when you call you don't want to call during their busy times best of luck to you i hope you do well Supermarket Wal-Mart Tesco Sears Holdings Corporation Retailer Food Microeconomics J Sainsbury Aldi Berkshire Hathaway Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Loss leader Price discrimination Electronic commerce Inventory Sobeys Wall Street Best Buy Eaton's Supply and demand American Broadcasting Company Tax Organic food Zellers Chocolate Piggly Wiggly Internet fraud Tesco Ireland Investment bank Coffee Fry's Electronics Boots Group Costco UK Singles Chart Economics Target Corporation Delicatessen Marketing Asian supermarket Publix Chinatown Albertsons FairTax Trader Joe's Publishing Commodore International 7-Eleven Woolworths Limited Pricing Shopping Woodward's Kesko Stock Liquor store The Apprentice 2 Filling station Privatization New Coke Convenience store Mergers and acquisitions Insurance Li Ka Shing W H Smith Loyalty program Pizza Jewel (supermarket) Supervalu (United States) RuneScape economy Department store Health insurance Vending machine Shopping mall Warranty CBS Ethical consumerism Dairy ASDA No frills Monopoly Monetary policy Gold as an investment Supermarkets in the United Kingdom McDonald's Capitalism Ahold Candy bar Supermarket Sweep ITunes Music Store Ice cream Safeway Inc.
