cochlear implant question for deaf teens or adults i'm unsure if i will receive any answers but here is my questions anyways i have an year old profoundly deaf student was implanted at the age of in with a recommendation to not implant surgery went ahead anyways the implant has never really worked well for my student he has the outdated advanced bionics ci parents do not bring my student in for updates or mapping my question is there is an update for the advanced bionics ci and wondering if any deaf teens or adults have had success with this updated ci i'm going to push for this update this year when i meet with his parents again in a few weeks the prior answerer is incorrect when saying that cis work only of the time if this were true they would not be fda approved the failure rate of cochlear implants are less than i don't understand how the parents got the surgery done when the implant team recommended against it that's very difficult to do if the implant has not worked for your student it probably has been due to difficulties such as poor family support and lack of training rather than a device failure you don't just put an implant on and all of a sudden a person knows how to do it there is a specific auditory rehabilitation process that must be followed or the wearer often cannot use it properly this is why going through candidacy has many aspects and is hard to find someone to do it if the team recommends against it your question is very difficult to answer without knowing either the internal component or external component of the implant internal pieces are made to be able to be updated with future technology you 'update' the external piece not the internal piece changing the internal peice would mean they would have to go back in surgery which could be risky however the external peice could be updated but if the student is not using the one he has properly an updated exernal peice will not help instead of pushing for a new peice push for more services for the child this child should have an iep and needs av therapy auditory verbal speech therapy and an oral teacher of the deaf these services if provided can be done at school the iep should also incude a complete audiological evaluation yearly which takes the cost off the parents which may be the reason they are hesitant to keep up with the implant this would help the child much more than trying to get the parents to pay for an expensive upgrade to equipment they obviously don't facilitate to begin with please email me if you have any questions sorry for the spelling spell check isn't working Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Prostate cancer Medicine Scientology beliefs and practices Second language acquisition Education in the People's Republic of China Infantilism Growth hormone treatment Stuttering Special education Education Dyslexia Aphasia Hearing aid Abortion Condom Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Food and Drug Administration Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Transsexuality Urinary incontinence Divorce Models of deafness Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Graduate school Windows 2000 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RFID Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tai Chi Chuan Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Controversies in autism Motion picture rating system Antiretroviral drug Milton H.
