do all kids with autism have behavioral issues my son who is has been diagnosed with autism he is very affectionate maintains good eye contact has almost no aggression or behavioral issues the only issues in language delays can a child be diagnosed with autism even if he has no behavioral or self aggression issues autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed via the dsm manual as you know there is no blood test but to be diagnosed a child must meet a certain number of criteria listed in the dsm more than limited eye contact and aggression as painful as it is to have received the diagnosis please know that the earlier the diagnosis the better the end result for your son if you have not already done so check into joining a local support group in your area be sure that you are not confusing behavioral issues with inappropriate behavior aggressive behaviors etc i have taught students with autism spectrum disorders for years each of them had their own distinctive behavior issues that were mostly strange odd rather than as society would call bad part of my task was to retrain them to show more socially acceptable behaviors rather than flapping your hands wiggle your toes in your shoes i had one student who was affectionate like your son it was cute and endearing when he was young but as he got older it became inappropriate and was creepy to those who did not know him as i did bear hugging strangers petting people's arms randomly giving back massages trying to sit on the teacher's lap and snuggle in th grade as a youngster he had been reinforced that what he was doing was nice and being a good boy however as he got older he could not understand what the problem was and he often felt rebuffed by others it is hard for children on the autism spectrum to generalize some things and compartmentalize others please be sure that your son understands that affection is for family and close friends only and that he should not greet the mailman the same way that he would you Controversies in autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Autism rights movement Autism epidemic Autistic spectrum Sensory Integration Dysfunction Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Antisocial personality disorder Schizophrenia Dyslexia Clinical depression Human sexual behavior Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Stuttering Physical intimacy Adult attention-deficit disorder Cephalic disorder Personality disorder Traumatic brain injury Borderline personality disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Mental illness Post-traumatic stress disorder Schizotypal personality disorder Dissociative identity disorder Azumanga Daioh Dog Bipolar disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Psychosis Motivation Transsexuality Narcissistic personality disorder Anti-psychiatry Psychoanalysis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Speculation of famous people who might have autism Sexual orientation Schizoid personality disorder Sexual addiction Drug abuse Psychiatry Ethical challenges to autism treatment Coeliac disease Prostate cancer Autistic culture Tai Chi Chuan Cancer Autistic enterocolitis Childlove movement Education in the People's Republic of China Paraphilia Narcissism Multiple sclerosis Dog training Social psychology Mental retardation Reactive attachment disorder Gender identity disorder Generation Rescue Breast cancer Color blindness Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Anxiety Milton H.
