autistic son won't eat at daycare my son is and recently started at daycare he is having a very hard time adjusting to it he refuses to eat and works himself up sick to the point of vomiting how can i make this easier on both of us and get him to enjoy school daycare can be very tough for autistic children it tends to have a lot going on with minimal adult supervision and lots of noise if your son has sensitivity to noise amounts or volume you may want to have him wear headphones get a cheap pair at the dollar store and cut the wire off or earmuffs to dampen the volume and noise while he adjusts the next thing to do is to follow the daycare schedule at home as well at least for now he is not used to the changes so having them apply all the time should help next you will need to take a look at the daycare you have chosen have they had any prior exeperience in working with children on the spectrum are they simply expecting your son to fit right in and follow along are they frustrated by the issues that are popping up if they have no expereince and are simply treating him like any other child you need to educate them first you need to clearly explain your child's diagnosis his likes and dislikes and a list of the warning signs that he is beginning to have a tough time work with them to find a way to help him understand the schedule a picture schedule with the use of visual or sound cues for transition plenty of warning that it is time to move on to the next activity the possibility of having just one aide work with him for now if your son has an iep and if he has not been screened by the public school i highly recommend doing so he may qualify for a special pre k that would take place for half or a full school day limiting his time in daycare provide a copy of it to the daycare they are not legally bound to follow it but it can give them useful information on how to handle your child and his needs finally you will have to really look at this placement give it some time but if things have not shown some level of improvement and your child should be happy not just managable you may need to reconsider this placement not all daycare is appropriate for all kids special needs or not autistic children have a tougher time child care issues are one of the biggest challanges special needs parents fact it is the reason i have never gone to work there were simply no options available that met my son's needs now of course many parents have to work if your son is not happy in his daycare you may want to consider using an in home child care provider rather than a center or look for a smaller home based daycare i hope some of this helps Autism Autism rights movement Asperger syndrome Day care Hearing impairment Surveillance Gramophone record Fecal incontinence Motion picture rating system Diabetes mellitus Autistic community Loudspeaker Education in Japan Education in the United States Microphone Androgen insensitivity syndrome Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Amstrad CPC Economics Expert system Computer Violin Poker jargon Controlled Substances Act Anorexia nervosa Education in the People's Republic of China Economic inequality Infantilism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Medical prescription Visual Basic Ethical challenges to autism treatment Prostate cancer Legal research Chiropractic Transsexuality Fast bowling Kindergarten Collision detection Humphrey Bogart Pitaten Plame affair Windows XP Divorce Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum About a Boy Probation officer Windows Vista Contract Autism epidemic XML Hypoglycemia Dyslexia Hikikomori A Course In Miracles Kodocha HIV test Electrophysiology Betting (poker) Unreal No Child Left Behind Act Emergency Medical Services Nurse Strap-on dildo Naval mine Hearing aid National Football League Dissociative identity disorder Intelligence quotient Breastfeeding Terri Schiavo Medicine Sensory Integration Dysfunction Movie theater Digital circuit Euro Education in Germany Cannabis rescheduling in the United States ZX Spectrum Japanese tea ceremony Redundant array of independent disks Special education RISC Oscilloscope Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Extreme Programming Cheating in Counter-Strike Cold fusion
