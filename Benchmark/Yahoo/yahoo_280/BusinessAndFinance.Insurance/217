how can i go about cashing an insurance check with two other parties one signed the other mia on the check this can get complicated you must first of all make some effort to locate the mia if that fails you may attempt to prevail on the insurance company to issue the check just to the two of you but don't be surprised if that runs into a dead end the other option is to have the policy if it is still in force endorsed to change the name of the insured to take off the mia name and then ask for another check if not ion force get it reinstated and then endorse off the mia somewhere along the line a surety bond may be required which basically says that you and the other payee agree to make up the difference if the mia shows up start with the agent who issued the policy and work your way from there Life insurance Insurance Title insurance Contract Bond Annuity Lloyd's of London Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Blackjack Health insurance Variable universal life insurance Unemployment benefit Bank Universal life insurance Mutual fund Surety bond Algerian Civil War Democratic Party (United States) Schengen treaty Foreign policy of Japan Security (finance) Monetary policy Trust (Law) USA 2003 California recall Predatory lending CPU cache Financial markets Kyoto Protocol Microeconomics Nuclear proliferation Money creation Paul Hackett Bail bondsman Inflation Citigroup Social Security debate (United States) Open access Nuclear option (filibuster) Cyprus dispute Primerica Financial Services Yield curve Charles I of England ACORN U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Stock Politics of Russia Jean Schmidt Separation of church and state Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Wal-Mart Eliot Spitzer Labour economics Liberalism Year 2000 problem Vietnam War Poker jargon Mortgage Commodity markets Euro Democracy Model (economics) Oakland Athletics Betting (poker) Corporate finance Centre Party (Germany) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Esperanto grammar Finance Flat tax Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Japan-United States relations Harry Bridges Internet fraud Abortion in the United States Presidential system German car number plates Fianna F__il John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004 Government debt Bob McEwen Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Money Social Security (United States) US health reform under FDR Bob Rae Money supply Jimmy Carter E-mail spam Intelligent design Tom DeLay Corporate governance Evel Knievel Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change The Amazing Race Bill Bradley US health reform 1912-1920 FairTax Read my lips: no new taxes
