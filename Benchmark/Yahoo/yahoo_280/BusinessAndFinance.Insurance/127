should i get life insurance i am going to be and i am having a beautiful baby boy in january would it be a good idea to get life insurance yes you should get life insurance you can afford so that your child will be taken care of should you die prematurely i respectfully disagree with those who say term life insurance is the only way to go term life covers you for specified amount of time or term all of the premiums that you pay for a term life policy will be gone however when the term is up you have purchased security but that is all you will never see that money again if you get a whole life policy the insurance company will invest your premiums and your policy will build cash value over the years a whole life policy will never expire as long as you continue to pay your premiums if you live years and day more you will still be covered under whole life you will not be covered under your year term policy if you live to you will still be covered at some point your cash value can be used to pay the premiums for you to keep the policy in force you can also borrow against the cash value a whole life policy is more expensive but you are young and should get a good rate the usual knock against whole life is that you could take the money you would save by getting term life and invest it into something with a better return that may be true but be realistic would you really invest the premium savings would you invest them in a sure thing whole life is guaranteed to build cash value and how exactly are you going to invest a month save up for months and buy one share of google stock to find out more go here http www lifeinsurancewiz com good luck Insurance Variable universal life insurance Annuity Mutual fund Bond Term life insurance Warren Buffett Universal life insurance Financial markets Finance Health insurance Bank Hyperinflation Option Citigroup Social Security (United States) Debt Margin (finance) Yield curve Contract Stock Social Security debate (United States) Fixed income Predatory lending 401(k) Economy of Russia PE ratio Security (finance) Lloyd's of London Derivative (finance) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Gross domestic product Pension Publicly funded medicine Deflation (economics) Interest Corporate finance Great Depression Individual Savings Account Money Mortgage Capital accumulation Short selling Auto insurance Primerica Financial Services Title insurance Credit card SCO-Linux controversies Inflation Berkshire Hathaway Medicare (United States) Government debt Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Modern portfolio theory Neopets FairTax Arbitrage Unemployment benefit Tax Supply-side economics Capital asset pricing model Medical malpractice Gold as an investment Mergers and acquisitions New Deal Microeconomics Federal Reserve Keynesian economics Actuary Public policy Intellectual property Institutional fund management Betting (poker) Philatelic investment Rational pricing Income trust Retirement plan Monetary policy Money supply Closed-end fund Gold standard Cost of capital Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Investment bank Charles Ponzi Flat tax Capitalism History of the United States (1918-1945) Home insurance Savings and loan association Unemployment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
