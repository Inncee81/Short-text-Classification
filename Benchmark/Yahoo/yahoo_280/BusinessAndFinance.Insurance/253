i want to cancel my whole life insurance policy i've had it for yrs will i get any money out of it i want to cancel simply because i've found better coverage at a lower cost elsewhere i want to know if i should expect any money from my investment usually a whole life policy will show a table of the cash value it accrues over time unfortunately three years is usually when you start to see anything since it has been three years since you took out the first policy i'd suggest using the resources at www life fdn org to determine how much insurance you really need this is an independent site put out by the insurance industry and not one company trying to steer you toward a particular product since you are used to spending more for the whole life i suggest setting the difference aside in some kind of investment account your local edward jones agent can show you options that will grow at a much faster rate than a whole life policy and give you the flexibility to access the funds without jeopardizing your insurance benefit value Life insurance Insurance Annuity Variable universal life insurance Bond Inflation Mutual fund Citigroup Pension Term life insurance Social Security (United States) Health insurance Economy of India Universal life insurance Finance Social Security debate (United States) Corporate finance Economy of Russia Financial services Primerica Financial Services Microeconomics Publicly funded medicine 401(k) Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Capital accumulation Economy of Belgium Warren Buffett Government debt Interest Wal-Mart Unemployment Gross domestic product Free trade Debt Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Political economy Nuclear power phase-out FairTax Reaganomics Lloyd's of London Model (economics) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Financial markets Economic inequality Institutional fund management Derivative (finance) Individual Savings Account Economy of Norway Contract Blackjack Bretton Woods system Yield curve Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Stock Federal Reserve Taxation in the United States Common Agricultural Policy Economy of South Africa Title insurance PE ratio Actuary Health savings account Open access Say's law US health reform under FDR Microcredit Outsourcing Medicare (Canada) Economic relations of Japan Privatization Economy of Pakistan Asset National Kidney Foundation Singapore Argentine Currency Board Certificate of deposit Euro Auto insurance Gold as an investment American International Group Economy of Chile Social issues in the United States Retirement plan Economy of the Philippines Deficit spending Surplus value CPU cache United Kingdom corporation tax Health care in the United States Labour economics Ponzi scheme Toronto-Dominion Bank
