when changing auto insurance companies am i bound by law to show the new policy to the old insurance company say today is st feb' i had an auto policy from farmers that expired on st jan' today i buy a new policy from a different insurance company aaa when i discontinue service with farmers am i bound to show the new insurance policy to them also will i get charged for the period from st jan' to st jan' by farmers say today is st feb' i had an auto policy from farmers that expired on st jan' today i buy a new policy from a different insurance company aaa when i discontinue service with farmers am i bound to show the new insurance policy to them also will i get charged for the period from st jan' to st jan' by farmers editing after reading replies this is for the state of california yes i did not renew the policy because the rates were high and it took me a months time to find a new cheaper provider aaa and so i am changing the provider now after a little over a month thanks for the input guys adding a few things that might clear a few doubts i had farmers insurance from st july to st dec' i got a letter from the agent with the increased rates so my premium increased a bit for the period of st jan' to th june' so i decided to not to go with farmers and it took me a while to get a better quote i moved and switched jobs etc so i have not paid anything in advance to farmers they sent me the revised rates which i did not like and hence asked them to discontinue so the q is that if i don't pay anything to farmers if they ask me to pay any amount or if they owe me something and they refuse to return me the amount or return less amount can i take any action against them and secondly if farmers let s the dmv know about the month out of insurance coverage can the dmv take any action here's the deal if you were to have asked farmer's to cancel as of a previous date and had no replacement coverage as of that requested cancel date then farmers would have been allowed to charge you up until the date you actually requested cancelation if you had already paid the premium in advance you'd get a refund of everything but the days during which there was no replacement coverage if you has paid nothing yet to farmers you'd get a bill for the days example on feb you tell farmers to cancel you as of jan a backdated cancelation but you had no replacement coverage as of jan farmers then cancels feb and charges you for the days in between or refunds for all but those days if you had paid them in advance why is this because if you had a claim during those days farmer's would have been on the hook to pay it and if it were a big liability claim you'd want them to pay it furthermore a claim for an occurrence during that days could come in several months later a classic whiplash claim for example now if you did have replacement coverage in force as of the requested cancelation date farmers will want to see proof of it you needn't show then the actual policy a copy of the front declarations page is enough or else a copy of an evidence of insurance card will do the trick you might also be required to sign a statement saying that to the best of your knowledge there are no claims nor any circumstances that might lead to a claim during the days give 'em that and they know there was other insurance as of the date you want to cancel even if that date is in the past you'd get your premium back or if there was no premium paid and no prior balances anywhere you'd be billed nothing so chances are you'll be charged up until the date you asked for cancelation because you can't show you had other coverage for the days prior to that this is a good thing now you're out of hot water with the dmv the reason for this is that the state is very interested in coverage being there in case of an accident therefore insurance is required likewise if you cancel for any reason you are required to have replacement coverage so the insurance is continuous understandably the last thing farmers or any carrier wants is to be on the hook for a claim during a period of time when they weren't getting their premium thus they won't let go of the policy until they see evidence that something else was actually there if they don't have that the state will stick them with your claim the policy is based on a simple promise if you'll pay us a premium will pay or defend your covered losses that are reported to us unquestionably had there been a claim during the days after you wanted cancelation farmers would have had to pay likewise they're entitled to the premium for that period of time the only exception is when there is other coverage in force and quite understandably farmers wants proof of that if you do have empty days the state might discover it it takes awhile sometimes but eventaully the dmv computers will see the gap and you'll be asked to show them evidence of coverage if you can't ptovide it penalties and fines will vary according to the state you're in typically you'll pay a fine plus what the premium would have been had you been covered through the state auto insurance fund by whatever name it goes not all
