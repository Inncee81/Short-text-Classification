am i entitled to something for loss of months of full benefits my company offers the best benefits however they screwed my out of months of benefits after a month layoff i was originally told i had to wait months then told by union the last week of july she'd take care of it so i tried to get it started early to get my kids in football but no one who said they would help actually did so i finally use the aug insurance and i found out today that all my benefits were canceled on aug and i took my son for the physical and they did a ekg and he needs to see a heart specialist to rule out heart attack but my hr is completely unreliable i called again to try to resolve but i am completely frustrated i don't know who to blame i feel robbed what compensation could you give someone when you rob them months of medical vision and dental after coming back from mo layoff am i entitled to something for the loss of months ok i understand your frustration but i don't see the loss once you became eligible for benefits aka when you've been recalled to work you're entitled to have your claims paid as if you had the benefits if someone forgot to add you on that's it that's all you're entitled to so you don't say what claims you accrued and you don't say when you were recalled back to work you don't say why your benefits were cancelled on august st so it's really hard to comment on it you just need to check with your hr every day until this is straightened out or maybe your union rep will do it for you but the more people you get involved the more confusing it's going to get Unemployment Insurance Wal-Mart Poker jargon Prostate cancer Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 2004-05 NHL lockout Workers' compensation Unemployment benefit Chronic fatigue syndrome Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Howard Dean Health insurance Multiple sclerosis U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Sydney Riot of 1879 Life insurance National Kidney Foundation Singapore Social Security (United States) Traumatic brain injury James T.
