im looking to upgrade my video card i am currently running agp x x ati radeon se ugh okay so the old card isnt going to be cutting it because i want to get into gaming nowadays fear a lil wow quake half life this card runs mid to low settings and gets crappy fps anyway i have it narrowed down to the ati sapphire x there is two though one has memory and a mhz core clok while the other has memory and a mhz core clock both with a ramdac they are the same price and the card has high ratings on the net is this a good idea and if so which of the two cards should i buy thanks this is indeed the best you'll get for agp even though the memory is wasted even for the most demanding games the mb one with the faster gpu should be your choice but most likely the power supply of your pc will not be strong enough it should be at least w for x x and you should use a power connector line only for the video card thus not connected to hard disk or dvd player as well finally make sure your pc is up to gaming in general gb ram and a ghz cpu are the bare minimum ATI Technologies GeForce 6 Series Radeon Xbox 360 Xbox GeForce 4 3dfx Radeon X Series Pentium 4 Power Macintosh G3 EMac NVIDIA PlayStation 2 Overclocking PlayStation 3 Atari 8-bit family Atari ST Nintendo Revolution PowerPC Personal computer Computer bus Nintendo GameCube PowerBook Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Front side bus IBook GeForce 2 Doom 3 Apple II family DDR2 SDRAM Xserve GeForce FX Apple Macintosh PC motherboard Central processing unit The Sims 2 PowerBook G4 Windows Vista IBM PC Commodore 64 Graphics card Amstrad CPC Sound Blaster Acorn Electron ZX Spectrum MSX Athlon ThinkPad Atari 2600 IBM PC compatible Hard disk Celeron CPU cache CPU design Commodore 128 RISC Power Mac G4 Cube BBC Micro Sinclair ZX81 PC Engine Laptop TRS-80 Color Computer Pentium M Poker jargon Voodoo 5 GeForce 3 Amiga Sega Dreamcast Computer hardware USB flash drive Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Microprocessor VIA Technologies First-person shooter GeForce Northbridge (computing) IPod Oscilloscope Computer Cyrix Windows XP Zilog Z80 INMOS Transputer SAM Coup__ VIA C3 TRS-80 Acorn Computers Secure Digital card Computer and video games Sega Saturn
