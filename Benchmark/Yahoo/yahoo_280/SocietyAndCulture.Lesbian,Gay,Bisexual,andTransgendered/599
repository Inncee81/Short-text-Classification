going to a bbq in hours it is a friends bbq who my brother fancies and wants to be with hes very nervous no idea why though anyway should he play it cool and dress casual or should he wear something that will make people aware that hes 'on the pull' a few questions ago i asked if i should help my brother although i am going to help him still i think i am going to watch him and see what happens going to step in if nothing has progressed by pm do you have one in black tracer lmao whisper to be honest i prefer him to be casual whenever hes out on the pull thats all there is uses them for one night and leaves them i dont want my friend to get the wrong idea just want to hear outside views casual loose fitting shirt with a nice pair of khakis i state loose fitting because if they end up in a room somewhere or behind some bushes removable clothes are always the best bet i wish him luck and you are a good brother Little Britain Sharon Tate Indian English Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Social aspects of clothing Blood on the Tracks Jeans Kilt Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) EastEnders Big Brother (USA TV series) Clothing Jet engine The Apprentice 2 Textile manufacturing Good Morning, Vietnam The Dalek Invasion of Earth Patrick Star The Contender (television series) Sydney Riot of 1879 Undergarment Hip hop rivalries Silent Night, Deadly Night Fancy Crane The Inside Barbecue Miss Saigon Columbine High School massacre Piccolo Junior Saga The Ashlee Simpson Show Lindy Hop Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Jiddu Krishnamurti Theory of conduct Suit (clothes) G-Man (Half-Life) The Star Wars Holiday Special Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Canadian Armed Forces Japanese tea ceremony Big Brother UK series 6 Okashina Okashi Milton H.
