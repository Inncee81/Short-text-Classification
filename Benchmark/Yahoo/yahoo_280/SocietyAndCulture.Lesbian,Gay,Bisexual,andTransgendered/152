do two wrongs make a right i have always been told that wrongs do not make a right but according to an article i recently read online in the baptist press if it isn't right it is at least better in a story discussing an ex gay they say although glatze's new religion of mormonism denies essential elements of christianity his story of leaving homosexuality is nonetheless significant http www sbcbaptistpress org bpnews asp id if his conversion to mormonism denies essential elements of christianity in their eyes he must still be going to hell i do not see why they are so happy about this can anyone clear this up for me am i missing something or do they just have an anti gay agenda where anything bad for gays is good for christianity no dearest i don't think you're missing the point i think that glatze missed the point instead of confessing up to his drug usage and party animal lifestyle it seems that he and the church allowed the full blame to be laid right on his homosexuality rather than his substance abuse you didn't miss a thing you hit it right on the head which might not be a bad idea for those who wrote that article naughty naughty me Ex-gay Church of Christ Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mormonism and Christianity Mormon Criticism of Mormonism Book of Mormon Christianity Theory of conduct Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Baptism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Anti-Mormonism Anti-gay slogan Jerry Falwell Homosexuality and Christianity Bill O'Reilly (commentator) EastEnders Roman Catholic Church Family First Party Christian right Curse and mark of Cain Evil Homosexuality Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Bisexuality Sexual orientation Rick Santorum Avenue Q Laura Schlessinger Religion and sexual orientation Zoophilia Great Apostasy Christian eschatology Same-sex marriage Vernon Schillinger Pope Benedict XVI Charles Grandison Finney Sabbath Denis Law Criticisms of Christianity Calvinism Eucharist Heaven Same-sex marriage in Canada Marriage God Homophobia Orson Scott Card Sun Myung Moon Merit Mormonism Holy Orders History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints History of the Latter Day Saint movement Biblical canon Original sin Pitaten Separation of church and state Reparative therapy Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Ethics Homosexuality and Judaism Martin Luther Gay rights William A.
