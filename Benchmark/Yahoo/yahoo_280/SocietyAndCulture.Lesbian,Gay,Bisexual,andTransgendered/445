how do i shave my butt and butthole as well as other things i want to have a smooth and hairless ass as well as the crotch area also there is some hair on my chest i want to get rid of i was wondering what the best method would be to do this stuff and what materials i'd need and how in the world i would be able to shave my rear without being able to see it shaving results in a very temporary smoothness best advice is to not bother shaving it since it will come back itchy until you shave it again or let it grow all the way back nair works nice on legs and might be fine for your chest hair but never near very sensitive areas like your crotch and anus waxing results will last longer than shaving since the hair is removed from the root plus there is no razor stubble even when it grows back however it has the same risk of ingrown hairs that look like pimples electrolysis would get rid of it permanently but is expensive and not instant laser hair removal might be an option but there is much debate whether it is as permanent as electrolysis many people have reported permanent results but it depends on the person apparantly if you shave your privates mach safety type razors are best as long as you don't slide them sideways ouch i cringe at just the thought shave in the warmth of a shower stall or bathtub it may work best to do like the ladies who shave their legs and soak beforehand you will need a slippery agent shaving cream i like to use oil of olay or dove body soap for shaving my armpits and bikini area buy yourself a nice real hair bristle body brush and loofa pad to lather yourself up with as well as for exfolliation to prevent ingrown hairs take smooth firm strokes in the direction of the hair growth yeah i know it's impossible to see which direction that is use your sense of touch to feel which gives the smoothest results once you start shaving you will have plenty of future attempts to develop what works for you or else suffer the itch of the stubble Shaving Waxing Leg shaving Hair Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Beard Baldness Strap-on dildo Razor Pseudofolliculitis barbae Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Global Gillette Anus Psoriasis Haircut Professional wrestling holds Acne Tattoo Diving Sento Mattress Hypertrichosis Violin Mosquito Professional wrestling throws The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Eczema Aerial (dance move) Jock itch Tofu Prostate cancer Drug test The Inside Breaststroke Combine (Half-Life 2) Hard water Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling attacks Late Night with Conan O'Brien Drill bit Guinea pig Cat Cross-country skiing Spanking Customs and etiquette of Japan Head shaving Dog Equine conformation Puberty Hazing Coffee Plane (tool) Woodworking Buttocks Tarantula Wound Scar 613 mitzvot Aluminium Brazilian waxing Stomach cancer Manicure Androgen insensitivity syndrome Russian joke Textile manufacturing Swimming Codename: Kids Next Door Horse Herpes simplex virus Volleyball 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Allergy Stem cell Mixed martial arts Traumatic brain injury Leather Swimming pool Car handling Hydrogen economy Manual transmission Electrology Jackass: The Movie Dairy Foodborne illness Breastfeeding Hyperthermia Drowning Malignant melanoma GunBound Kodocha Drawing Philosophy of science The Amber Spyglass
