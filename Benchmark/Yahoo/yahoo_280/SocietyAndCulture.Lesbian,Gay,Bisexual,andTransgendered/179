fragile inside a partner asks you to becareful with their fragile heart they don't know if they can survive the pain again is that being too dramatic lol she does tend to be a little over dramatic at times but i like how the other chicka put it could be i am being manipulated omg those words run chills up my spine my last partner told me that and also how horrible her last partner was to her she would repeatedly tell me how she's scared of falling for someone because she didn't want to get hurt after being with her for a while i saw the things about her that pushed her former partner to the things that she did if someone were to come at me with that line again i'd run kicking and screaming in the other direction just ask her what part she played in the last relationship if she accepts no responsibility for her part in things run for the hills good luck to you Nine Inch Nails Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
