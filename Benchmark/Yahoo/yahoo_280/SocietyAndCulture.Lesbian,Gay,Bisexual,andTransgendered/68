do u ever get over ur first true love i just came out of a five year relationship with my ex boyfriend i have been alone now a year and cant get over hime and move on i try but keep comparing other guys to him and thats why im still single and cant let go im gay by the way but that should not make a difference when it comes to love i think it really depends on your age as to how quick you can move on some people just don't care and they walk away and those like you and i who do genuinely care bear the brunt of the time it takes you do get over him eventually and the second love of your life is most always better than the first i still remember the first and travel to see him and his current love when i can and leave my current love at home as he does not want to meet my past i can be friends with my first love but can now see why we would not last he is not as caring and monogamous as i will always be it took me about a year and a half to really begin to live again and then about and a half years till i fell head over heels literally and figuratively again Polyamory The Amber Spyglass Social rule Friends Human sexual behavior Sex and the City Emotions (album) One Tree Hill (TV series) Glossary of partner dance terms One Life to Live Love Hina main characters Care Bears Swingout Something Positive The O.C.
