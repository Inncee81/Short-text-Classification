the nature of marriage i have a multi pronged question about the nature of marriage what is your definition of marriage do you think that marriage has always been the same way or has it changed if so then how has it changed if gay marriage was legalized in the us how would it affect heterosexual married couples and potential heterosexual couples don't just say it won't tell me why not i think that marrage is a relgious thing and partnership the legal side of it is something everyone should have dont think this means im agaist gay marrage im not but why would i want to get married in a church where the priest dont want me there if i get married i want to do it in an inclusive church so therefore i think marrage is something everyone can attain from any relgious congeragation christian muslim hindi in a group where the leader is ok with it as for has marrage changed over time yea it has greatly in fact its only in last century that the major changes have come about before marrage was a way on ensuring a women was essensally sold from a father to another man women were treated as propertie so if peeps give bull about marrage being accient and sacred just remind them thats it changed a hell of alot in the last years as for how in the us it would affect hetrosexual married couples the only affect would be a billion dollar boast to the economy acording to some experts so there will be an economic impact but as for the other stuff they fear in other countries to date canada spain other places with civil partnerships uk etc there has yet to be any negative side effects or any effect hetrosexual married life as of yet so from that currently the conclusion would be there is only postive improvement and no visable negative regarding the effect on peoples lives Marriage Same-sex marriage Same-sex marriage in Canada Gay rights Federal Marriage Amendment Civil union Sexual orientation Homosexuality Same-sex marriage in the United States Polyamory Religion and sexuality Same-sex marriage timeline Human sexual behavior Religion and sexual orientation Civil unions in the United Kingdom Homosexuality and Judaism Homosexuality and transgender Homosexuality and Christianity Clerical celibacy Coercion Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Laura Schlessinger Heterosexuality Same-sex marriage in Spain Homophobia Inflation Ten Commandments Roman Catholic Church Supernatural Pharisees Gay rights timeline Defense of Marriage Act Intellectual property Polygamy Age of consent Huldrych Zwingli Lawrence v.
