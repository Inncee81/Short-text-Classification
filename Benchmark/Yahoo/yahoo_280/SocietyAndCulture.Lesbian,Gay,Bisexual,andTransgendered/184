coming out advice i'm a fourteen year old bisexual male i've known for quite a while i've been different however the only people i have told openly that i am bisexual were a few of my close friends and it's basically had the 'osmosis' effect my family however is different i come from a family of two older sisters who have already clued in and a mother and father my father seems slightly homophobic and my mom is just the kind of mom who would say ew that's icky if she saw two lesbians or gays kissing so i need advice on how to come out when and just how to approach them thank you in advance sorry by 'osmosis' effect i really meant to say 'butterfly' effect whereas in something small becomes much larger i know where you're coming from i've come out with the fact that i'm bisexual to my mom and sister this year but not to my dad because like yours he's homophobic i will tell him eventually but like you i'm scared however my best advice i could give you is to tell them when you're ready the best way to move towards sexual identity acceptance is to be honest about who your are maybe if they realize that someone they know and love is bisexual they will face their homophobia and come to see that your are a good person worth loving regarless of your sexuality one of the biggest reasons why people are afraid is because they don't understand help them understand by sharing the truth best of luck to you you will be okay Homophobia Bisexuality Coming out Sexual orientation Recurring South Park characters Lesbian Gay Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Human sexual behavior Religion and sexual orientation Gay rights Boston Public Kurt Cobain Homosexuality Homosexuality and Christianity LGBT The Fairly OddParents Ex-gay The closet Homosexuality and Scientology Outing Queer Friends Transsexuality Reparative therapy One Tree Hill (TV series) Anal sex Alyssa Jones Pedophilia Homosexuality and Neopaganism Gay slang Laura Schlessinger Violence against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered Group sex Marriage Rent (musical) Heteronormativity Gay community Phoebe Buffay's songs Rocko's Modern Life Sex education The Ashlee Simpson Show The Adventures of Pete & Pete Homosexuality and transgender Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Transgender Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Anderson Cooper Polyamory The Smoking Room Biology and sexual orientation Same-sex marriage Sex and the City Wilson Cruz Gay village Effeminacy Will & Grace Supporting characters on Will & Grace Kim Possible Transvestism Social rule Stewie Griffin American Dad!
