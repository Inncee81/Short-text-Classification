why are many gay men obsessed with getting rid of their body hair many gay guys that i know have spent time and money shaving waxing plucking and depilating their body hair even and to some especially their pubic bush they will trim it meticulously and some even shave them off completely it's a mystery to me oh i'm quite hairy myself and i don't bother with such niceties neither am i a grizzly just that i could never understand the obsession with hair or lack of it it's one thing to keep yourself well groomed but it's quite another to spend hours obliterating every hair on your body shaving your face is fine and so is grooming your pubes or underarm hair but i draw the line at men waxing their legs arms and chest unless they plan on becoming drag queens not that i wouldn't go out with them but some of them can be obsessed to the point of being anally retentive personally i do not understand gay people who shave their bodies i mean why are they doing this it is just natural for a man to be a bit or more than a bit hairy even if he is gay perhaps they simply want to separate themselves from hetero people by doing this but it is a very weak point since many heterosexuals shave their bodies as well i myself find a man attractive when he is a man and not a frog sorry but this is what i believe in anyway it is a mystery indeed perhaps it is just well some kind of fashion thing but spending time and money shaving waxing plucking their body hair wow they should work on their relationships instead of this no offence but if you want sex not your hairy ness is the major factor if you want a serious relationship not your hairy chest will count either so then why it is their decision however so i do not care but their choice is not my style long live the hairy men Pubic hair Hair Gay slang Gender role Shaving Social role of hair Anal sex Human sexual behavior Leg shaving Sexual orientation Heterosexuality Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Homosexuality and transgender Puberty Friends Wig (hair) Aerial (dance move) Pedophilia Tarantula Waxing Physical attractiveness Swimsuit Baldness Effeminacy Moustache Transgender Bear community AIDS Gay Sex and the City Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Acomoclitism Age of consent Social rule Marriage Gay bathhouse Same-sex marriage Androgen insensitivity syndrome Zoophilia Crab louse Pornographic movie Razor Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Sexual attraction Homosexuality in Japan Polyamory Transsexuality Domestic violence Sexual dimorphism Avenue Q Eric Cartman Skinhead Vulva Chest hair BDSM Social psychology Biology and sexual orientation Lawrence v.
