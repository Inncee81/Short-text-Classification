gay marriage is it a contradiction how can gay's want to get married when if you look not speculate or guess you'll find that marriage is a religious thing and from what i've read pretty much all religions are against it therefore how can you want something from something that condems you secondly how can the government dictate whether gays can be married or not when there is supposed to be seperation of religion and state third how do you spell check this portion of the question p s this is a serious question i'm not really one way or the other on the issue and yes i have checked the earliest marriage found was a religious seramony hence the start of marriage i really wish i could put this in the religion catagory and this one for interjoining answers kacie and charlie those are exactly the answers i didnt ask for how can someone believe what you say when you can't even read a question o k your right same question to the athiests o k some of you misunderstood my question i'm not asking wether or not they should be alowed i am asking why would they want to i can see life union or something like that but marriage is based in religion also any church that uses king james or any other version of this bible condems it this is to include even the satanic bible i havn't been able to study wicca yet sorry and the bibles don't condem the athiests i wouldn't want a church to sanctify my relationship if that church condemned me but there are churches who will perform commitment ceremonies in lieu of marriage i would consider that option you've hit on the heart of the problem government has granted rights based upon religious ceremonies and probably shouldn't have done that there ought to be a distinct discrete separation between the religious ceremony and the civil contract i'm not sure how to spell check this l Same-sex marriage in Canada Marriage Separation of church and state Roman Catholic Church Same-sex marriage in the United States Opus Dei Infant baptism Fundamentalism Sexual orientation Religion and sexual orientation Federal Marriage Amendment Jewish view of marriage History of the British constitution Resurrection of Jesus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Puritan Abington School District v.
