why would any lgbt people want to be christian christianity is the leading attacker of lgbt rights in america christianity has turned a lot of people into intolerant bigots the bible is not a credible source of information a lot of it's claims have been disproved by science i would think that lgbt people would be smart enough to see past the lies and hyprocrisy of christianity so why are there still lgbt christians brainwashed maybe i agree that people should be able to believe what they want if people believe in god that's fine i just would think that most gay people would be religious without following organized religion becuase we know how harmful it can be i'm just still a little baffled at the number of lgbt christains i don't quite get it i know their are some good christians but in general christianity has not been very good to our community but to each his own as much as i dislike most religions i want people to be able to do whatever they want as long as they aren't hurting other people i definitely agree with you but if they want to be christians then i think they should do what they want and i wouldn't mock them because of their decisions or they way they live their life it isn't fair in light of everything the community faces from others we don't need to be angry at each other LGBT Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theory of conduct Homosexuality and Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fundamentalism Homosexuality Cult Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Sexual orientation Religious Society of Friends Gay community Value system Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Marriage Evil Homosexuality and Scientology Scientology controversy Witch-hunt Opposition to cults and new religious movements Same-sex marriage Section 28 United Church of Christ Criticisms of Christianity Satanism Status of religious freedom in France Christian Voice The nature of God in Western theology Christian right Religious conversion Alcoholics Anonymous Violence against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered Gay rights Children of God Urantia Philosophy of religion Post-cult trauma Transsexuality Anti-Mormonism Ex-gay Soul Theology Christian anarchism Rastafari movement Religion and sexual orientation Karma National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce Resurrection of Jesus Reparative therapy Separation of church and state Michael Savage (commentator) Anti-Defamation League Strong atheism Rich Mullins Messianic Judaism Drag queen Liberal Democrats (UK) Reincarnation Sin Christian apologetics Christian-Jewish reconciliation Liberal Christianity Human Rights Campaign Intelligent design Queer theology Agnosticism Infant baptism Unitarian Universalism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Metropolitan Community Church Unification Church Satan Supernatural Coercion Witchcraft Russian Orthodox Church Existence of God James Dobson Friends Family First Party Scientology S__ren Kierkegaard Michel Henry Falun Gong The relationship between religion and science Ten Commandments Trinity Christianity Church of Christ, Scientist Creation-evolution controversy Homosexuality and Judaism Predestination William A.
