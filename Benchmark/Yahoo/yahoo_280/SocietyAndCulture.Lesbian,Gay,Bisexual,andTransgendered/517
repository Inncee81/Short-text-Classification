how do i go about subscribing to logo we only have cable in my house nothing extra like hbo or on demand so i'm sure logo isn't included in our package i'm looking for a way to recieve logo however i need a way to do it without my parents knowledge i'm not out yet to them and the last thing i want is them wondering why i'm asking for logo what can i do about this it looks like watching it at a friend's house is about the only option unless you do actually get it then again it may come with a better regular cable package and you could ask for it because of some of the other channels but instead just use it to watch logo might be a good idea to watch some of the others in front of you parents so they don't think you're not using it and cancel the extra services i got the digital cable package instead of the basic and it just came with it did around and see if you can find it or beg your parents to upgrade and then look for it you may be able to get it without having to ask for that specific channel Cable television Home Box Office Television in the United States Media in Canada Disney Channel Austar Public Broadcasting Service BBC Atari 8-bit family FX Networks Television TiVo Bluetooth Now Broadband TV Satellite television TBS (TV network) Major League Baseball television contracts DVD MTV2 Channel 4 Digital television DOCSIS Television in Canada Freeview British Sky Broadcasting The Movie Network Chorus Communications MTV The Daily Show Optus Television Sex and the City Microsoft Owned and operated station Xbox 360 Television rating system Rogers Communications IPTV Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Cartoon Network Discovery Channel ITU-T USA Network Viacom Dish Network Cinemax EastEnders Friends Pay-per-view Movie studio Showtime (television) Floppy disk PC Engine Digital Subscriber Line NTL Digital cable Integrated Services Digital Network XM Satellite Radio The Amazing Race Telephone exchange StarChoice Video on demand High-definition television Sky One Five (TV) Commercial broadcasting ABS-CBN Wi-Fi Foxtel Atari ST Nintendo GameCube Communications satellite Jam (TV series) Xbox Television syndication Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Fox News ITV British television Cable modem Vertical service code The Movie Channel Federal Standard 1037C Modem Pirate decryption Sky Digital WTBS (TV) Time Warner American Broadcasting Company BBC Three Motion picture rating system Product Lifecycle Management Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Copy protection Bad Wolf Nintendo Revolution Mozilla Firefox Messerschmitt Bf 109 Telegraphy WNEP-TV
