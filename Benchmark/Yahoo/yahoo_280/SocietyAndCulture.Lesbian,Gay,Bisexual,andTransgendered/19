how out is out enough i am struggling with the balance of how out to be part of me wants to tell the whole world and break down barriers and fly my queer flag proudly the other part of me thinks my sex life is nobody else's business unless they're involved in it to some extent it also feels like making an announcement about coming out just reinforces the differentness of being queer if i were straight i would never go out of my way to ensure that my co workers knew i like with women so how could i bring up liking men without making it seem like a big deal for now all my close friends know but i still haven't told my family as there has yet to be a male special someone to introduce them to standing on a street corner hold a foot tall sign saying i'm gay no really out is whatever you think it is who cares what someone else thinks you should do if you are not pretending to be straight while hiding a lover behind a closed door then you are out oh and as far as wearing something you have to explain at work i was a bit uncomfortable telling my boss when he asked what my pentacle was but hey it's my belief and what i am i just said it was a symbol of my faith and let him lead any other questions he had now he thinks it's cool and wants to go to lunch with me to learn more so you never know maybe someone will look you in the eye and say they are too Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gender role Social rule Friends Queer as Folk (U.S.) Human sexual behavior Shaggy dog story Sexual orientation The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sin City Kyle Broflovski Avenue Q Dead Like Me EastEnders Gay The Smoking Room Kill Bill Theory of conduct Queer Coming out Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hide and Q (TNG episode) St. Elmo's Fire (film) Soap opera Scenes from a Memory The Shining (film) Homophobia Milton H.
