what would your followup question be to the democratic candidates if you could ask candidate a follow up question who would it be and what would you ask i would ask this senator obama considering your stance on same sex marriage you stated civil union gives all the same rights as civil marriage so it is equal do you consider sitting in the back of the bus or drinking from the colored water fountain okay because you still get to ride the bus and you still get to drink some water your logic says it would be equal and fair disclaimer i understand my example is a bit harsh but to many in the lgbt community it feels the same to us mistermoo i thought i was the only one that caught that i would repeal article of doma after every other candidate said scrap doma i think she does not want to harm her hubbies legacy tab h i posted a slightly revised version on visiblevote http visiblevote logoonline com video the candidates on gay marriage comment i like obama's stance other than this minute ramble suggesting separate but equal that he gave last night i am hoping that after he thinks about it he can further explain his views my followup would be for senator clinton why would you only suggest a repeal of part of doma rather than the whole thing it is an entirely discriminatory piece of legislation edit believe me a lot of people noticed that i think quite frankly i believe she is correct in the defense that she gave of approving doma to begin with that without doma we would currently be looking at an approved constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage it is much easier to repeal a law especially an unconstitutional one than a constitutional amendment but i think that the time for doma has passed and it is now time to push for equality Defense of Marriage Act Same-sex marriage in the United States Federal Marriage Amendment Lawrence v.
