poem i wrote looking at the past the days that we had remembering our memories the good times and the bad i regret not telling you the feelings i had inside i knew it wouldn't matter so i pushed them aside i continued every day pretending i was fine but deep down inside i was wishing you were mine you may be gone but forever in my heart though you're in a better place we will never be apart you're up in the heavens an angel you have become i loved you oh so much i thought you could be the one i just wish you knew i loved you with all my heart i wish we could go back and make a brand new start but now it is too late you will never know the emotions i've felt and how i loved you so i guess this is the end our final goodbye knowing you are gone always makes me cry this was written to my bestfriend that passed away i was inlove with him since i was year old but never told him r i p nick i miss you wow the depth of emotion in this poem you have a really good handle on rhythm and rhyme also this poem is a great example of an abab quatrain excellent and i'm so sorry about your friend oh and i give it a keep writing you have a gift Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Scenes from a Memory Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Friends Cliff Richard Quatrain Emotions (album) Shakespeare's sonnets Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Amber Spyglass She Loves You Hey Jude Poetry The McGuire Sisters John Berryman Social rule Mojave people Remix Kodocha Shaggy dog story Care Bears EastEnders Leonard Cohen Humphrey Bogart Tupac Shakur Billboard Hot 100 Angel Sanctuary Dean Koontz The Curse of Fenric The Beatles discography About a Boy Theory of conduct Nostradamus Rhyme The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Knots Landing Blonde on Blonde Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Series finale The Inside Four Quartets Unreleased Madonna songs Blood on the Tracks Sonnet Mnemonic Phoebe Halliwell Oh My Goddess!
