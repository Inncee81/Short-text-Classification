can you criticize my poem hey guys this is a poem i wrote about life in the city and the way america is all about rushing and not looking back enjoy and please criticize people are walking along the crowded streets they rush only stopping for the speeding cars they rush past the poor musician playing beautiful music for they are too busy going places the homeless man sits next to the musician thankful for his blanket as he searches for hope everyone is different here but they appear the same in their suits these crowded streets could be more than just a city these rushed people cry out to be more more than a blur of unspoken colors each one has an unheard story an america that is hidden untouched i am young but i have seen the people walking along the crowded streets some envy how fast these people walk i envy the homeless man who walks slowly i like your poem very much much truth is revealed in your poem as you are very observant the last line i envy the homeless man who walks slowly leaves me wondering why you envy that person a homeless person has a story a reason for ending up in the streets he walks slowly because he has been effected by a hard life perhaps or an injury in a war the fast walking fast paced person could walk through life without seeing anything or anyone around them focused only on their own personal goal or gain but for myself i do not envy the homeless man i may have respect for him if i got to know his story or have sympathy for him i might say i hold no interest for those moving in the fast lane but the homeless man has captivated my attention he walks slowly but his eyes are open to the world around him and he feels something hopes for something and watches for a sign of change i am not suggesting you change your poem just offering my take on the subject your ending left me wanting more reason for your envy of a homeless man Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Swingout The Shining (film) Milton H.
