what do you think of this poem a father s nightmare how can this rage not explode when i see her eyes looking but not seeing fixed but wandering she s everywhere but here seeking refuge where i don t exist or where i am dead or just a twig she feeds to the flame blue with her wrath she has mastered the contours of my anger and i still grope along the fence of her defense isn t silence sweet then why the muteness my voice has summoned drown me now where is the shore of this imploding sea of silence how can a clever plan fail trap her in a minor encounter where even her faintest meow is enough to unlock her lies and the torrents of diatribes i have long nurtured but how can i bear her empty stare her frozen gaze that sets me ablaze o how i seethe seeing her lips smirk i love it Darth Vader Characters of Naruto Slayers Odyssey Blood (computer game) Shaggy dog story Sacrifice (computer game) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ranma __ characters Sin City Night (book) Naruto jutsu Happy Tree Friends Saruman Races in the Warcraft universe Mahou Sentai Magiranger Transformers: Cybertron The Amber Spyglass Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Virtual Realm The Shining (film) The Venture Bros.
