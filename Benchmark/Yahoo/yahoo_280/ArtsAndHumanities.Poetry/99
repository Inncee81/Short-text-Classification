two poems how i feel for you and how much i love you cant be expressed in words all the poems i write to have nothing new about because they olny say one thing and that is that i love you tell me what can i do i olny think of you your sweet and kind now that ive fallen for you i cant live without you until you are with me and in front of me to see the air will seem colder the sun wont seem as bright and neither will the moonlight the flowers wont be as beautiful the days will be slower the food wont be as fulfilling unless you are there to share until you are here to hold my hand to keep me warm when the air is cold to watch the sun shine and the moonlight to pick the beautiful flowers to watch you eat next to me nothing in the world will seem right thanks Frankie Laine Weather front Japanese tea ceremony Emily Dickinson Sunlight Beatles for Sale Poetry Kigo Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven) Eli Siegel Breakfast Torquato Tasso Paradise Lost Cupid and Psyche Siegfried Sassoon Time Out of Mind Severe weather terminology (United States) Yehuda Halevi Care Bears Sweet potato John the Baptist Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Rose Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Weather lore Korean cuisine Eucharist Jon Secada Customs and etiquette of Japan Salad Fingers Tofu Precipitation (meteorology) Reaction to the assassination of John F.
