comments on this poem please growth i'm old enough now no need to rub rose petals on the truth anymore i smelled the reality of this cluttered with forgotten poems carved walls spirits and loss my lonely home sits awake and waiting for me i really like this linz i think i see why some think it is disjointed but to me the notion of growing to the point of being able to return home and as i read it revisit your past is a powerful one it also looks like you took great care in writing this it feels precise and succinct with that in mind i am reading smelled as being intentionally past i e coming even when rubbing in the rose petals i went back and forth on whether it should be smell but i think it does more as you have it i would consider playing with spirits and loss to work one more concrete image in there but it certainly works as is well done Simone Weil W.I.T.C.H.
