a new poem a little different any thoughts i'm using the expression better angel differently than how it's probably usually used i found out what it means after i wrote the poem hopefully the poem will show itself how i meant the expression to be used any comments or thoughts would be nice thanks one more thing i wrote this last night and have been editing but i'm not sure on the puctuation just bear with me not your better angel you of all should know of me there is a sin burried deep in shadow darker than the night no stranger to my thoughts but stranger to the light the sin itself matters not but every day has in evil fought against my god though his gracious son already says that he has won and you are blind to all my wrong you have called me all along my better angel though it seems strange you have never seen my soul's dark face oh to think perhaps you have but never shunned and never laoughed instead in silence loved me still oh tolerant heart and loving will but another speculation comes into my head with pounding drums perhaps you hide a deeper shame and so have given me the name your better angel heaven above alas my heart's is no true love mine is not the power to judge a soul well though i think you are my better angel i had a couple mis spellings in here sorry i'm not sure if i should leave it at this or work harder on editing what do you think i understand what you meant its a great poem you should be very proud of this was great makes you look at your life and how you life it and it makes you want to be a better person its great you did a wonderful job keep up the good work take care Jon Secada Sola fide Hell Justification (theology) Angel Devil The Amber Spyglass Summa Theologiae Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Socrates Israel ben Eliezer Fallen angel Evil Meaning of life Conan the Barbarian A Course In Miracles Qiyamah Paradise Lost John the Baptist Duties of the Heart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Book of Isaiah Eastern Orthodox Church Nora Roberts Church of Christ, Scientist Soul Original sin Confucius Ludwig Wittgenstein Sinfest Religion Repentance AVN Awards George Fox The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Theodicy Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) C.
