a bit of a change tell me what you think so poem it's a bit of a change from those prior though still rather awful tell me what you think oh as an aside the last time i wrote a poem the lines kind of spilled over so an accidental lack of punctuation and capitalization occurred and i went on vacation without my computer and had no chance to select a best answer sorry to anyone who cares i voted for the answer i liked best anyway even that which is not it's just so beautiful and i can't help but sigh each time this beauty leaves my sight my hearing and my touch my senses i can't help but regret the times the times i've witnessed this beauty and failed to act upon the things i feel inside the things that i think i should naturally be doing but can't bring myself to do ah but everything is so silly and i can't help but laugh at the things i've done and look forward to the tings i might yet do with as much anticipation as trepidation i ran out of room i'm always so scared but always so calm and relaxed always so sad yet never happier i suppose thats the way things in life take form at least for me all is balanced in a chaotic sort of way balance is everything and everything is balanced this is the only universal truth that i hold to the only philosophy that i accept as fact it is the basis of all that i am at least for now everything is so beautiful this world we live in for all it's faults and horrors and ugliness is exquisitely beautiful if it was not then we would never know beauty and all of humanity would be cursed i fear that our children will live in a world bereft of all beauty it is this thought above all else that truly chills me this music is so wonderful and even though i can't understand the words i understand the meaning for that is the way of music and that is beautiful what is beauty all is beautiful even that which is not this is good it needs to be cooked down a little try to say this in four line stanzas Theory of conduct Ethics Supernatural Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Death Gate Cycle God Emperor of Dune Goodness and value theory Shaggy dog story Intelligent design The nature of God in Western theology Theodicy Determinism Deconstruction Time Out of Mind Science Anthroposophy Bernard Williams The Amber Spyglass Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Philosophical skepticism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Aesthetic Realism Cyberspace Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Meaning of life Kasparov versus The World Philosophy of language Das Lied von der Erde Phaedo E.
