i wanted to share something with you this is a peom i wrote i won several awards for it hope you like it i am not making an antiwar statement just a statement for us to win and them to lose is often times hard to choose if it was worth the lives it cost to suffer through the human loss to go to war and not come home when kids grow up all alone to lose a mother or a father kills the souls of son and daughter till the day theyv'e wept and cried remembering then one who died congrats on writing an award winning poem i'm not sure if you just wanted to share this with us or if you'd like comments regarding how to improve it it's a good poem the rhyme is pretty good and the feeling is that the words fit and are not forced there are however a few spots that show you either didn't post the exact version of what you entered in the contest or that you made a few typos or omissions when you posted it here for example they've not theyv'e you need a the in the last line to even out the beats and make the phrase flow more naturally the one who died i'd also have suggested until the day instead of till the day for the same reason beats regarding the concepts i'm not sure it's really all that difficult to choose between whether we want to win or lose i would never endorse i war i didn't want to win whether or not i did win is up to factors beyond my control but i'd certainly choose to win if i sound nit picky it's only because that's what any poem needs no matter how many awards it may have won if it can be improved you should try to improve it edward fitzgerald wrote the most widely read poem in the english language it's called the rubaiyat of omar khayyam and if you haven't read it you might want to put it on your reading list his first translation version has sold more copies than any other single english poem in history outside of the bible yet he edited and published at least other versions of it after he was successful because he thought he could make it better did he make it better it's a tough call because the original is the one most often cited yet there are those who would claim that each version was more accurate than the previous so edit if you want to improve even if it's already doing or has done well or not it's your poem and obviously your choice congrats again and keep writing Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Edward FitzGerald (poet) Poker jargon Determinism History of the English Bible Translation Omar Khayy__m E.
