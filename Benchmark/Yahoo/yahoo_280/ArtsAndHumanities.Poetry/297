what is your new opinion i changed my th stanza form my fist draft and would like to hear what you have to say i have an idea for a title as well but if you would like to contribute as you travel on the path you are not alone for a barrier has been drawn that time in moments will stall neither true night nor true day will ever prevent me returning once again to my full glory as the dusk of night falls return to the path of normality i will be there though not in clarity for in the moments that swiftly pass look close you may see released dreams awaken to reality knowing i am truly free set upon for a moment hidden as the sun controls not fearing for knowing as the moon takes her hold for twice rising then twice falling always in full glory i am all passing again times wasteful friend returning again the marrows end word edit sp form to from i like your poems but the first stanza of this one leaves me confused i'm not sure how you get from you are not alone to for a barrier has been drawn that time in moments will stall this is not like you are there a few missing lines how does having a barrier make you not alone especially one that has been drawn in time that in moments will stall i'm not even sure what that means your second stanza's uneven meter is created by the first line too many beats and the last syllable of glory is not an upbeat like me was check it out again the poem moves on and i see where i think you were going with this but it isn't one of your best i'd suggest you start over it's just my opinion and i'm sure others will disagree but you need to edit pretty much every stanza and line the marrows end you can do better than this and you usually do i suspect you had a good vision of what you wanted to write put something down to capture it then posted before you had a good chance to go over it i'd work on it a little while longer picture what you want to say picture a beginning and an end and what you need to do to draw a straight line between the two i'd love to see the rewrite keep writing Surrealist techniques Poker jargon Alliterative verse Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Hunting of the Snark Time Out of Mind Poetry John Berryman Empire Burlesque Meter (poetry) Nashville Skyline Children of Dune Milton H.
