poem of william shakespeare somebody can tell me where do i find this poem but the complete version after some time you learn the difference the subtle difference between giving a hand and fettering a soul and you learn that to love doesn't mean to support yourself and that company doesn't always means security and you start to accept you loss with your head up and eyes straight ahead with the grace of a grown up not the sadness of a child and that being flexible doesn't mean you are being weak or that you don't have a personality for no matter how delicate and fragil a situation is there are always two sides you find out that just because someone doesn't love you the way you want to be loved it doesn't mean that person doesn't know how to love and she loves you as much as she can

you understand that friends change and you realize that you and your friend can do nothing or everything and still have good times together and you learn that the people you care the most are taken away from you too fast that is why we should always say caring things to those we love because it might be the last time we see them and you learn that you shouldn t compare yourself to others but to the best you can become you learn that it takes a long time for you to become the person you want to be and that life is too short and you learn that it doesn't matter where you've already gotten to but where you are going and if you don't know where you're going anywhere will do you learn that either you control your acts or they will control you and that being flexible doesn't mean you are being weak or that you don't have a personality for no matter how delicate and fragile a situation is there are always two sides of it and you learn that heroes are those that did only what was necessary you learn that patience requires a lot of practice you find out that sometimes the person that you expect to kick you when you fall is one of the few that will help you up you learn that

suppose you learn that you should never tell a child that dreams are foolishness few things are so humiliating that it would be a tragedy if he believed that you learn that when you are angry you have the right to be angry but that does not give you the right to be cruel you learn that just because someone doesn't love you the way you want to be loved it doesn't mean that the person doesn't know
