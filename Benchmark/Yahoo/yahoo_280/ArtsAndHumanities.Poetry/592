do you ever get inspired creatively by a song which song has served as an inspiration for you to write mine is the theme song from baywatch interestingly enough the words am i strong enough to put up a fight am i brave enough to make it through the night send a chill right through me every time i hear it and it makes me wish that one day the words that i write will also have an inspirational effect on people there are times that it works that way for me the tone or mood of songs often provides inspiration more than the lyrics do it may be cheesy but i find billy joel's piano man often has that effect on me i have always thought that if one is receptive enough anything can provide inspiration at any given time i find it absolutely fantastic that the theme from baywatch inspires you i love it Billy Joel I Want to Hold Your Hand Time Out of Mind Mixtape Infidels Bringing It All Back Home Beatles for Sale God Save the Queen Empire Burlesque New Morning Charles Ives Robert Schumann Shot of Love Cliff Richard Paul McCartney Musical theater Please Please Me On the Road A Hard Day's Night (song) Hey Jude (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction A Day in the Life A-ha Slow Train Coming Emotions (album) Make Believe The Times They Are A-Changin' Fr__d__ric Chopin Elton John Song Sgt.
