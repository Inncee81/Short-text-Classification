i wrote it but it doesn't seem to flow most of my poetry doesn't rhyme and i've been experimenting opinions welcome always excuses excuses all sound the same lets find somewhere to lay the blame certainly not on the parents or the offspring let s just sue and see how much money it brings it s our generation all these little fucks mortgaging their futures to old navy and starbucks cup of coffee and making the minimum payment if we can our lives are owned by sally mae and uncle sam not to mention mom and dad they seem so proud of their little grad the last day of kindergarten we celebrate and the true milestones dissaparate and i know my puctuation and capitalization are erratic sorry dancing bee i like your answer i felt the same way about it however being a little brutal brings something out in people guess i may have been ranting a little the points you make in the poem are powerful and powerfully made i love the intensity you have here the trick is to keep the intensity in a more controlled form poetry even free verse yes i know this is not exactly free verse is tightly controlled language and can express powerfully through that control you noted the capitalization and punctuation so i won't belabor that a way to help with the flow is to begin by picking out lines that seem to either go on too long or lose the rhythm within the line count the number of syllables in each line and see if there are lines that stick out in this regard look also to see if there are phrases you can tighten up cutting words if you don't need them one line i would take as an example in large part because it sticks out quite a bit for me the line that begins cup of coffee has syllables far more than any other line it also seems to ramble within the line you could shorten it while retaining the near rhyme with the next line to simply buy four dollar coffee pay bills if we can it says the same thing but more tightly and more rhythmically i am not in the habit of re writing others' poetry and you may well find another better way to re write the line the point is to focus in line by line or even word by word and fine tune it Poetry Meter (poetry) The Marshall Mathers LP Biblical poetry Rhyme Mnemonic Stuttering Rapping Alliterative verse Crossword Hey Jude The Adventures of Pete & Pete E.
