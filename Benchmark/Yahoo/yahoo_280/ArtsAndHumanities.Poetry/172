a deep poem i made please tell me what you think about it d life is like a rainbow with a beginning and an end lined beautiful colors like humans they depend we are those colors representing our souls with our own different shades our own different goals red the is aggressive ill tempered tinge throwing tantrums as it lives frozen in cringe stereotypically so but deep down inside lives a fiery love no other can provide and then there s yellow so warm and bright but commonly missed as it s pale and light still yellow tries hard to stand out of the crowd shining so gracefully in rainbows so proud blue is the calmest the coolest of the lot so passively gleaming not a color it fought boring dull or depressing as it may seem blue brightens the days with its powerful beam and then the silver platter purple the royal tint born ignorant and rich with an arrogant glint trying so hard to grasp image of what is real the heart of the purple is the most ideal next is the green whose humble sense shows the neutral the normal it sticks to the prose limited to laws the green is not daring its nature s to nurture as it s loving and caring last is the orange the ecstatic and wild playful and funny much like a little child boisterous brave and at times quite mean true orange is gentle smart and keen united we form this emblazoned wonder through the good bad achievement and blunder as each shade stands for the color of the heart which was packaged with us as from the very start colors arching for a moment they last before disappearing into the past just as we live we play and love life is as quick as that rainbow above although the illusion disappeared without adieu begins another life another rainbow another color anew orange yellow purple green red and blue one of these colors lives inside of you i did not copy this i made it myself d i just thought it would be nice to compare rainbows to life i'm glad you liked it though oh well erm i'll take that as constructive criticism i didn't mean it to be deeeeep like with hard words and thick layers of symbolism to dig through i meant it to be deep in a way that it had a solid meaning but easy enough for everyone to understand did you really write this are you are pulling one on us if you did take it off of here some one will steal it and get rich seriously the poem is beautiful i love poetry Color theory Color Care Bears Diamond Dragon Booster Rainbow Light-emitting diode Synaesthesia Humphrey Bogart Pysanka Diamond simulant Blue Characters in the Smurfs Time Out of Mind Bubble Bobble Lightsaber Tour de France Link (Legend of Zelda) Poker jargon Rainbow flag Billiards My Little Pony Rainbow Islands Wassily Kandinsky Shaggy dog story Technicolor Colours, standards and guidons The Dunciad Collectibles in Bionicle CIE 1931 color space Tag Gray Wolf Chaos Emerald Black Purple Pottery Wood Discus (fish) Color blindness GunBound Deep Purple The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Blood on the Tracks Pansy Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Heavy metal music Theory of conduct Shen Gong Wu Art Summa Theologiae Numerology Koi Power Rangers Missingno.
