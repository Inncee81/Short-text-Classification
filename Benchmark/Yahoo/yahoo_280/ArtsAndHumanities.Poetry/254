any comment final flight of light sunday morning your voice slid a slice of light into my eyes your smile dusted the debris of memos and bills off my shoulders and i wished the time to stand still so that i could cling to the tender laughter in your eyelashes so that i could lay my head on your tiny thighs and listen to the riddles rivuleting from your tongue riddles that yesterday were rattled and clipped by the anger that oozed from my eyes mouth and fist a beast that refused the warm breeze brought by the sea of your why s a how i wished i could tie the sun and lift it above the hills a little longer i still would like to play with you to annoy you to say sorry and to sleep embracing you my child but the dusk has already fluffed its wings the wind has whistled the final flight of light to art flood thanks for the suggestion but my intention is not just tying and lifting the sun a little longer yes it's an important image and emotion but as you can see in the poem the experience i want to convey is much much richer than what your suggestion can capture that was very deep and powerful it uplifted me in my time of need you should get it published Samson Sesshomaru Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling holds Shen Gong Wu Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Apollo 11 Gesture Odyssey Emoticon Comet Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Aerial (dance move) The Hobbit Happy Tree Friends Casualty lifting Sin City Conan the Barbarian The Venture Bros.
