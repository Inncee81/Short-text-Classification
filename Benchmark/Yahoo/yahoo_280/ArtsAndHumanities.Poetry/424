is this poem worth publishing please analyze sunset because in every sunset awaits another death a peasant's soul gripped by fear first his family lost and in distress then his country down on one knee begging for his god to come through does he think he can conquer death or is it just a concept embedded deep within his mind as he awaits the onset of yet another sunset because in every sunset awaits another death the beauty of poetry is two fold layers of meaning and imagery as a reader i don't want you to tell me i want you to show me i want to feel it not just read it sunset death gripped by fear these are poetry cliches can you show me the fading glory of the sunset with your words can i feel the breath of the grim reaper on my neck as i read your poem i feel your poem is too straightforward i do not find a pattern or intentional non pattern in the rhythm or rhyme scheme that you chose your poem is my loyal dog sat next to me better poetry would be moist and rhythmic panting assured me of his constance i'd go back to the drawing board and really reach deeply into your arsenal of metaphors and paint a picture with them Poetry Milton H.
