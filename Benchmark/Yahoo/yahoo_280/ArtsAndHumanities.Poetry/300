a poem called the garden of angels comments please broken wings sing to me as i fall into the unchanging sky stars are surrounding me but i see no light these walls are caving into me and i can't seem to find my way out of this maze this maze of fallen angels now i see that i am one of them i am one of them falling into the night the night that has nothing to offer me succumbed to darkness i love this feeling let it consume who i am welcome to the garden of fallen angels the title should be the garden of fallen angels sorry bout that well its an amazing poem i could never write like that but for some reason it didnt seem very original im sorry good luck tho The Amber Spyglass H.D.
