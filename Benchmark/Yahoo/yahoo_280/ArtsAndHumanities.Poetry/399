are you a poet post some of your poetry i already did but here goes one you're my first thought in the morning my last thought at night i dream of you by day and i think of you all night awake i lay just thinking about what we could be but knowing the whole while that you aren't for me and though i dream and fantasize by night by day by noon and even though i realize that you are my sun and moon and even though the sky is gray when you're around it's blue and though the grass is burnt and brown it's green when i'm with you i know that i can't have you and i lament this so because in your arms just to your arms is where i long to go a nice peom i put up a minor peotry contest it's not something you might have written before but something you made up just at the moment you are writing it into the computer so don't worry about people stealing your peoms cos it wouldn't be something you spent days to make anyway the voting would be starting within minutes so it might be too late but if you still want to try it's at http answers yahoo com question index ylt aukeadgltdacxefyrnhpqcbsy ix qid aalcy g nice job you want a peom well let me just write one directly from my head too i think about your goodness i think about your love i think about your aboundance of grace that has kept me through this race it's not because i'm sinless it's not because i have a heart like an angel but it's because you loved me just as i am so even as i pass through life's faces i want you to know that you would always be in my heart even when you don't seem to be in my acts love you forever jesus Jon Secada Avenue Q Frankie Laine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Paul Is Dead The Amber Spyglass Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Qiyamah Characters in the Smurfs Cliff Richard New York Giants Sin One Tree Hill (TV series) AFI 100 Years series The McGuire Sisters Bon Jovi Billboard Hot 100 Freddy Fender Philosophical skepticism The Pet Sounds Sessions American Idol Season Four songs Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Characters of The Sandman Current teachings of Prem Rawat Anne Rice Humphrey Bogart Batman: The Animated Series Carrie Jacobs-Bond The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan The Human Stain Blood on the Tracks John Berryman Dream Job (Season 1) The Beach Boys Apollo 8 Friends Oh My Goddess!
