another poem i wrote a new girl in class she s eight years old she s always quiet and does what she s told atop her head is a little girl s hat she hides her hair just like that during lunch the girl sits alone nobody s there she s on her own she lifts off her hat and shows her head the teacher s heart fills with dread little molly is shining bright she knows she s going to win this fight her hair is gone it all fell out little molly has no doubt she smiles each day it may be her last don t treat her so fragile she isn t glass deep inside she knows the truth she prob ly won t live past her youth little molly s tears fall down her face she shows the world her rolling grace dancing her dance each day awake she tries to make not one mistake little molly s mom called in today this is all she had to say my little molly will be gone she asks you to play her favorite song she s sick right now and won t return she hopes her friends will stop and learn continued below little molly s sick with cancer no doctors know the answer today will be her last day here she asks you to not shed a tear little molly is shining bright she knows she s going to win this fight her hair is gone it all fell out little molly has no doubt she smiles each day it may be her last don t treat her so fragile she isn t glass deep inside she knows the truth she prob ly won t live past her youth little molly s tears fall down her face she shows the world her rolling grace dancing her dance each day awake she tries to make not one mistake little molly died that very night she gave her mom a rose of white she smiled her smile and laughed once more then little molly learned to soar very emotional poem made me very sad and at the same time made me realize how special each moment is and isn't that what we as poets want for our poems to reach out and grab someone's attention whether love or heart ache or even something as what you just spoke of i felt as though this poem did exactly that and i applaude you so in other words very very excellent poem Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Pok__mon Live!
