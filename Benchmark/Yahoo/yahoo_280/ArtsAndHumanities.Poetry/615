how do you like this one insomnia pt the world awakens with the dawn i lie in shadows still withdrawn my mind weighs heavy my heart like lead i take cold comfort in my bed i try to rise into the day and keep the shadow ghosts away but bound i am no known escape the cling to me while i'm awake shadow demons lay in wait my fear of them will not abate they rip my soul they tear with claws my spirit locked within their jaws they wrestle me 'til day is done and finally they know they've won yet out of reach sweet sleep still taunts my body's pained my mind it haunts very very good i can truly relate to this it is haunting yet touching at the same time if i might just make one suggestion the line and finally they know they've won with two they's it is kind of redundant maybe rephrase it like and finally know they have won or something like that but take out one of the they's it just throws that line off but that is a totally awesome poem kris and there is nothing wrong with dark poetry so many people read it and relate to it it speaks to a lot of people so never silence your voice one of my poems once it was done i realized was quite dark most people think of nuclear war when they read it but it didn't come from a dark place in me i wasn't in a dark mood when i wrote it each person's voice poetry speaks from their experiences a lot of times but sometimes the words just come to you and you write them down they aren't based on any actual experience please keep on writing Time Out of Mind Kain (Legacy of Kain) Sin City Blood (computer game) Socrates The Amber Spyglass John Berryman Milton H.
