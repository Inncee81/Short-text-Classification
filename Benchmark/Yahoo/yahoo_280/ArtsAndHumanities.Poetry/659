give me your truly honest opinions please out of range so many things hang in the balance this juggling act is not one of my talents i try to go on but a wall's in my way how many debts now must i pay i try to forget what can't be forgotten if i take one more step down i'll be hitting the bottom some guidence is what i need but no one's around there's so much confusion i can hear my head pound a little understanding is all i really need it's like walking down a dark road w no one to lead i blindly grasp for reason where there is none like looking for hope through the barrel of a gun how can i find answers to questions i don't know where exactly form this point am i to now go how much more of this can my mind take this shell of a person i portray is so fake so many things i've kept secret all my life i feel a sharp pain in my back it's a knife life goes on i know but can i handle the change i yell hoping someone will hear but they're all out of range i like your poem my suggestion is this to make it flow better look at your rhyming rhythm and try to keep close to the same syllables example so many things hang in the balance syllables this juggling act is not one of my talents so many things hang in the balance this juggling act not one of my talents the use of a comma can take the place of a word and give you the same impact that is my only suggestion i think you have everything clear enough thank you so much for sharing anna Jon Secada Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
