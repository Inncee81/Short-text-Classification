just wrote a new poem not love or heartbreak btw can someone tell me how it is and rate it wouldn't life be perfect if the drama would disappear if we could go to rest at night without any fear if we could fall in love once and have it everlasting if all the insecure people would stop harming thier lives by fasting if students could go to school without an abundance of stress if you could love someone so much and not be obsessed if we could watch the news and not see people in tears if we could go talk to best friends we haven't seen in years sometimes i wish life could be different but sometimes i like it the same because what doesn't kill you makes you stronger the battle of life is a game i'm trying to write better poems so if you could could give me any tips on what you think i could do better let me know the idea of the perfect world you painted was leaving me with the feeling where would the adventure be what challenges would need meet why would we dream when while we where awake it would be all the dreams we need the shortness made it easy to enjoy it because you didn't explain the same thing in differant ways and i would rate this poem a very nice good painted picture with few words Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Scenes from a Memory W.I.T.C.H.
