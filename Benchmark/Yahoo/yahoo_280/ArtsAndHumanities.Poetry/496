why do you hate dark poems i'm very sorry but i don't write happy poems i was abused as a child and i am not a happy person i write to try and release this poison from inside me i know some of you want happy uplifting poems but many of us don't feel that yes there are beautiful things in life and i try to see that beauty but it has forever been clored by my experiences i'm sorry that depressing poems aren't in keeping with the upbeat attitude alot of you have but please some of need to write this just to get through the day i am in therapy and take anti deppresants but they help very little so the next time you poke fun at someone who wrotes depressing poetry or you slam them for being sad or morose stop and think there are reasons we write this way if you don't want to read them just don't not trying to upset anyone just explaining why some of us write the way we do dancing bee that would be fine if it were just my poetry that is dark and people don't like but i see lots of people who write dark diturbing prose slammed i understand what your saying and for the most part agree i write as a catharsis a way to let loose some of the poison in me that will surely kill me just as an infection would if not treated i just was making the point if some of the people here who obviously have a bias towards dark emo goth of even poems about cutting or suicide don't wish to read them don't it's ok i know exactly how you feel i posted a dark poem and got alot of negative feed back from poeple who obviously dont understand why we write i also have had some tramatic experiences and writing is the way that i let it all loose i write what spills onto the page the eaisest and sorry to say but for me thats not happy things you explained it so well and i really hope those poeple will actually take your advice Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Traumatic incident reduction Borderline personality disorder Anne Rice Poetry Pitaten Sant Thakar Singh John Berryman Aesthetic Realism Anglo-Saxon literature Infantilism Clinical depression Boston Public Kodocha Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Meme The Amber Spyglass Emo Michael J.
