critique this poem be merciless you where does it all go dig into skin with stray cat claws dog howls at night to harmonica songs candles burn low all out of matches stare at the sputtering wick as it flashes more than a day without sleep and tired to the bones but my mind s caught a streak putting off my drink to empty out my head getting just a bit closer to the tracks i claim i tread but trying is a bitch trying takes time dedication regularity and best of all conviction though it pleases just the same to talk and dream and so i tend to do instead educated and fairly well read and lazy or uninspired heart sedated by a faint desire more ego than i like to admit half a clich still half a clich plain to see what ties me down the most is me just fix it boy it s not so hard sober up and get serious focus i am only energy in motion a white astral aura the bearded man keeper of souls and enlightenment has not called on me i have not shown the proper respect because my spirit is equally as old and in this life i can see only my half of the power and possibility ever undulating through time vilcabamba ecuador copyrights reserved by poster i could go back and look for things to adjust but honestly it was a nice smooth read normally i get nervous at one word line breaks not saying i don't do it myself but everything flowed it had a real bluesy tone to it it would work really well in a spoken word format nice specific detail and good clear voice how about i promise to be merciless on your next poem Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sinfest Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Diablo II: Lord of Destruction W.I.T.C.H.
