how do you get college textbooks ready hello i am going to a community college in san diego and i've already choosen several classes the question is when do you buy books for the classes do you buy them ahead of time i still don't know what books that i'm gonna need or do you wait until the professor to tell you what to buy thank you for answering you wait if you go ahead and get the books it may turn out that you have bought the wrong book some of my professors did not require you to buy a book they thought it was a waste of time and money some professors tend to stick with an older book while other professors of the same course may want you to get the newest edition of the book do not buy them ahead of time you have a while to get the books after they tell you what book and what edition Textbook GED The Amazing Race Poker jargon William A.
