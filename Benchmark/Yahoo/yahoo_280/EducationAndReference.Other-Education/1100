what can you say or what is your opinion regardless sex education in grade school or high school help me guys answer this kind of question just state ur own opinion or answer in here i'll wait for your answer guys thanks in advance i am an old man but i have some very reserved values so please remember as you read my answer when my children were very young it was me that had to tell them about sex and what their body parts were age appropriate i was an air force medic and my wife felt that i was much better equipped to teach about this than she was this is where the rub comes i knew what to say and not to say but there are so many families that even the word sex in their house is a four letter i know it is three word where neither parent will discuss this with their children this means that a child's sex education is out behind the school house talking about it with their ignorant friends this is paramount to the blind leading the blind i don't like it that a school is teaching sex but some one has to teach our children and do it in a age appropriate manner i think that parents should be doing this job but many won't or can't and it needs to be done so it gets a thumbs up from me Sex education Education in the United States Prostate cancer No Child Left Behind Act Milton H.
