should i go to penn state berks or penn state main campus this depends on you your major and your financial situation i went to a commonwealth campus first and it was a great choice for me then i transferred to up with some majors it does not matter if you start at up in my case the classes were much smaller at my commonwealth campus which is why i went there first i was accepted at up but decided to start in a smaller environment more individualized instruction etc and away from the sororities and parties of up i always had the intention of transferring to up however other majors you should really start at up up is a great place i've worked there gone to school there and now go back several times a year for football and alumni events if you are looking for the stereotypical penn state experience than go to up at least sometime during your stay at psu also the more well known faculty are at up and the library is world class regardless you cant go wrong and you can always transfer back and forth University of Pennsylvania Cornell University Fraternities and sororities Georgetown University University of Alabama University of Michigan Reed College Emerson College Virginia Commonwealth University University of Connecticut Carnegie Mellon University Boise State University Bates College Duke University William Penn Ivy League California State University, Long Beach Vanderbilt University Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania Northwestern University University of Chicago United States Naval Academy Rice University Education in the United States York University California Polytechnic State University Brown University Franklin and Marshall College State university Oregon State University Washington State University North Carolina State University Caulfield Grammar School Joe Paterno New York University University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign American University University of Western Ontario Portland State University Georgia Institute of Technology Babson College Florida International University University of North Dakota University of Idaho Dublin City University University of Washington University of California, Berkeley University of California, Santa Barbara Rutgers University University of Arkansas Arizona State University University of Massachusetts Amherst Purdue University Syracuse University Middle Tennessee State University Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania Boston College University of San Francisco University of Wisconsin Southwestern University Dartmouth College University of Southern California University of Virginia Louisiana State University Nittany Lion Trinity College (Connecticut) University of Pittsburgh Johns Hopkins University Education in Germany University of Sydney Yale University Hopkins School Harvard University Ethics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus University of Tennessee Princeton University Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology Merrimack College University of Notre Dame Quizbowl Baylor University Northeastern University, Boston University of North Texas Kansas State University Dalhousie University Massachusetts Institute of Technology University at Albany Savannah College of Art and Design University of Rochester San Jos__ State University University of Central Florida Trinity College, Dublin Whittier College University of Arizona University of Texas at Austin Stony Brook University Mapua Institute of Technology
