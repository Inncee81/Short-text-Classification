i m studying at manchester unversity the univ has rejected my project on the grounds that matter is copied can anyone help me appeal to them that i should be given a chance appeal should be solid and with some grounds uh oh i can tell you i use to correct papers at the university of montreal and rejected project for being copied normally you can go in appeal and win but more than often you might lose reason being that if you are the corrector normally a good one while back up its saying by bringing the original version and show the comparison with the copied paper i am not saying you did it but if you didnt then you need to find out what they base themselves on and which other paper or book they think you've copied from there is nothing wrong with paraphrasing or basing yourself on another piece of work if references are done properly meaning that every single bits you inspire yourself from needs to be noted with a reference at the bottom or end of your text if you state you didnt know then maybe you might win this could be your best chance History of the English Bible Creation according to Genesis Appeal Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Theory of conduct Monty Hall problem Bush v.
