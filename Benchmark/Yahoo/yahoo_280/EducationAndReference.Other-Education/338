does anyone know any high schools in toronto canada that has driving courses i want to learn how to drive when i am years old i am only years old and in grade so i want to know if anyone knows any high schools in toronto that has driving courses or classes thank you typically these are run outside of the school driving classes are not part of the curriculum in ontario high schools you cannot earn credits towards your diploma by learning how to drive if you have the money i highly recommend young driver's they are the most known and respected driving school but they are also the most expensive there are other schools you can look into but keep in mind that you get exactly what you are paying for a cheap driving school will offer fewer in car lessons and less classroom time as well where the pricier ones offer much more classes are usually run on evenings and weekends with day time classes usually only offered in the summer or march break if possible try to pick a school that offers one on one in car lessons there's nothing worse than trying to learn how to drive with two other students sitting in the back seat with you Education in the United States Graduate school Ontario Academic Credit Education in Germany Education in Singapore College Education in Australia High school Teacher Advanced Placement Program Education in Hong Kong GED Secondary education in the United States Medical school Law school Community college Caulfield Grammar School Education in Taiwan Grade (education) Education in Canada University of Toronto Education in Malaysia Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Portugal IB Diploma Programme Queen's University Secondary education in Japan Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Stuyvesant High School Homeschooling National Certificate of Educational Achievement James Ruse Agricultural High School College admissions No Child Left Behind Act Student loan University of Toronto Schools Secondary education in France Education in France Driver's license John De Lorean Mutual fund Physician Education in Albania A-level Worcester Polytechnic Institute Education Indianapolis 500 Lawyer Education in Japan Seneca College Hopkins School Tripartite System Cooper Union York University Australian Qualifications Framework Kindergarten Education in Romania Associate's degree Experiential education Kwantlen University College Sport utility vehicle SAT Gran Turismo (game) The Citadel (Military College) Carnegie Mellon University Education in Sweden School Insurance Brown University Whitewater Hunter College High School Education in England Light rail Education in the Republic of Ireland French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Gwinnett University Center Hillsborough High School Stevens Institute of Technology PLATO Anglo-Chinese School Scarborough RT (TTC) University of Maryland University College Barrister Microeconomics Alexander Technique Taipei American School St. Michael's College School Adult education Distance education Athabasca University Japanese tea ceremony Primary education Pennsylvania State University Upper Canada College Charter school
