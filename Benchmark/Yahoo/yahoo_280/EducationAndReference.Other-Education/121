freshman in days im scared to death and on top of that i have to ride the bus the bus is no big deal in middle school but in high school it seems so awful and i think i mite be turning emo help please to not be scared key be prepared how you will have an opportunity to know your schedule ahead of time so take advantage of that and highlight where all your classes are on a map of the school so you can plan where to go each period and not get lost even better arrive to school half an hour early and walk and find each of your classes before school starts because places don't always appear the same in life as they do on a map it may sound stupid but it's better than looking stupid later in the day when you get lost or arrive to class late because you couldn't find your class or something meet up with your friends before school starts call your buddies up and set up a meeting spot with them for lunch or whenever you can even ask them if they want to come to school early with you so you can both look for your classes wear something comfortable so that you can at least feel comfortable trust me it helps you don't need to go out of your way to wear something you think looks good if it's going to make you feel self conscious or uncomfortable throughout the day besides no one remembers what you wear on the first day of school bring food a water bottle and money and your school supplies and books of course last but not least don't even worry about riding the bus honestly people in high school are so concerned about themselves that they don't even notice who comes on and gets off the bus its not a big deal a bigger deal is making a good impression with your teachers and classmates people in high school are more mature than middle schoolers at the fact that they know just because you ride the bus it doesn't mean you are a complete loser good luck and have fun Social rule Shaggy dog story Kodocha Doug Pittsburgh Steelers The Catcher in the Rye Great Teacher Onizuka Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga The Amazing Race The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Recurring South Park characters Garfield Time Out of Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Milton H.
