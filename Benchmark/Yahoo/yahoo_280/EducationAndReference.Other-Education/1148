how can i get to med school in nyc an area of generally good med schools with only a gpa is this possible gpa and on each mcat section honestly it has alot to do with luck i went through the whole ordeal multiple years and never went to med school a lot of extracurricular activities and a good essay are about all you can do to get your application noticed after your gpa is set from there it just depends on how good of a mood your interviewer is in since they just pick two interviewers at random that only see a select group of students the whole process becomes too subjective Medical school College admissions Grade (education) Regents of the University of California v.
