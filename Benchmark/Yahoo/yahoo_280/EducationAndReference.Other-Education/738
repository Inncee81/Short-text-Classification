how is it like to work at mcdonalds i need a job any ideas where i could start working at entry level i dont have any experience but i am willing to do anything i am not sure where i could find a job thank you for your comment hey i'm in pretty much your same position although i have a bit of work experience it's been really hard for me to find a job been trying all summer applied to places so far although all of my friends got the second or third job they applied for even though they had the same or less job experience just luck of the draw i suppose pretty much any place you walk into that has a help wanted sign apply to don't be afraid to call or walk in and ask how the hiring is going so that the person hiring can put a name to a face otherwise you're just another piece of paper on a stack if you are uncomfortable with your lack of job experience make a resume including all of your school accomplishments and extracurricular activities and turn in with application ask friends or relatives to keep an eye out for places that are hiring also it is a bit late now but a lot of cities have a special teen employment program for the summer maybe next year you can look into that some schools have a class that helps you to get a job and you work during their block ask your counselor about this finally just because you have a good feeling from a job possibility or interview do not stop applying for anything else good luck hope you fare better than i have so far actually though i have a promising interview at k mart next week so who knows edit the vast majority of kids i see outside of school working are working at restaurants fast food or sit down so maybe put some extra effort into that job area Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Education in the United States Graduate school Unemployment Friends Software engineering Education in the People's Republic of China Philip J.
