question toward practical resolutions there are many times when i sense within an answer to a question a bit of anger frustration exasperation impatience etc i wonder then what topics would the forum prefer questions be asked of it not that i'll find an easier more convenient way by which to approach the forum in the future but that perhaps an inkling of suggestion may help post question which would cover more interests to be explored then answered with more enthusiam i thought of this question because of certain remarks that have been made which led me to believe that some folks were tired of certain topics and wanted more variety so what topics would you like to have a questioner address as to fulfill the interest curiosity needs preference of more people please respond with serious concern and attitude those that mock please mock for the sake of just mocking outside this question for i've asked it with sincere curiosity remember suggest topics of interest that would lead the questioner provide a point of true interest thank you yeah definitely you know i am also thinking about leaving this page some people believe that ravens guide travelers to their destinations others believe that the sight of a solitary raven is considered good luck while more than one raven together predicts trouble ahead what do you do little raven you will not lead me or you will Ethics God Emperor of Dune Theory of conduct Internet troll Coercion Mathematics Philosophy Current teachings of Prem Rawat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Meaning of life Plame affair A Course In Miracles Prem Rawat Mystique (comics) Parapsychology Consensus decision-making The nature of God in Western theology Atheism Free will StarCraft Episode VI Internet forum Have I Got News For You The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Goodness and value theory Planet Jarrett Downing Street memo New York Giants Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reality Sexual orientation Expert system Philosophy of mathematics Research Past teachings of Prem Rawat Socrates Singapore gay equality movement Mat Cauthon Predestination Child sexuality The Hidden Curriculum Cognitive science Breaker Morant Supernatural String theory Blog Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Scientific method Nicomachean Ethics One Tree Hill (TV series) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ludwig Wittgenstein Calvin and Hobbes Sharon Tate Minor characters in Morrowind Franz Boas Avenue Q Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq Scientology beliefs and practices The Raven Education reform Asperger syndrome CPU cache Meditation Political correctness Hide and Q (TNG episode) Philosophy of science Lincoln-Douglas Debate Psychology Linguistics Physics The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.
