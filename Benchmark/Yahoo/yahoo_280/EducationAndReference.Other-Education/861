im going to a new school this year and not sure how to get people to like me i have never changed schools before help me i have changed schools several times usually a school will assign someone to take you to your classes and that person will probably offer to let you have lunch with them if they aren't your scene you might try gravitating towards people who do seem more like you in your classes sit next to them ask their help for something or ask if you can be in their group during a project don't be too bold about your likes dislikes you don't want to put them off just be yourself but a mild version of yourself until you see what they're like once you see that you have something in common with someone you can just be yourself it's just easier not to be too out there until you're a week or so into school Whose Line Is It Anyway?
