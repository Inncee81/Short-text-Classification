for med skool is it really worth goin thru years of school for me its med skool residency im asking this because of financial reasons will i be making enough money to support myself will i see my friends and classmates aready in a career before me i suppose it depends on what medical field you're pursuing but let's face it there are never any guarantee in life you can only do what you can to improve yourself to give yourself the best chances for success and does it matter if your friends have careers before you or not throughout your life you and your friends will each go through different phases of their lives if you're in school they might be working if if you're all working chances are some of you will make more money or work more hours than the other it's very doubtful that all of you will be at the same position in life at the same time i think the real question you should ask yourself is if this is something that you really want to do if you're having such serious doubts even before you even get started then you may not last the years that it takes to finish honestly ask yourself if this is something that you truly want to do before you pursue it further also keep in mind that you will likely make some money during residency even if it's not as much as being a full blown doctor so it's not exactly years without an income Old school hip hop Graduate school Juris Doctor Annuity Single Transferable Vote Spice Girls Theory of conduct Master's degree Extreme Programming Poker jargon The nature of God in Western theology Abortion debate Blackjack Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule Education in the United States Jon Secada Medical school Life insurance Friedrich Schleiermacher Publicly funded medicine Medicine Insurance Money Contract Mediation Physician Avenue Q Sydney Riot of 1879 Ocean's Twelve K' Philosophical skepticism Peer review Elections in the United States Freeters Backgammon Ludwig Wittgenstein Alternative medicine Oral sex Doctorate Ben Johnson (athlete) 401(k) Professor Hyperinflation Migraine Scientology beliefs and practices Personal finance Assassination Divorce United States dollar God Emperor of Dune The Five Doctors Inflation Infantilism Placebo effect Education in Romania Student loan Master (Doctor Who) Ernie Irvan Domestic violence Bill Frist Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Wheel of Fortune Saruman Intelligent design The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Jay-Z Tax Estoppel Battle of the Bulge Steffi Graf Charles Darwin's views on religion 1919 World Series The Amazing Race New York Knicks Sant Thakar Singh Betting (poker) Jeffrey Archer, Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare 2000 Australian Grand Prix Rudolf Hermann Lotze Pittsburgh Steelers Match Game Education in Germany Constitution of Ireland Wyatt Earp W.
