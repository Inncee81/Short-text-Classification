what are some reasons for switching teachers i'll be in an algebra class i'm already bad at math where the teacher is known for having over half her class fail it's not that she's mean she just can't teach even the other algebra teachers will tutor you if they know you have her as a teacher what can i list as a reason for switching teachers they might think i just want to get in a class with my friends i'm in high school i'll be a junior this year tell the truth in fact your guidance counselor should be consulted it is tough to switch teachers in some inferior school districts schools but you have a reasonable argument and have the right to be heard you also have a right to quality education if the teacher is not good at communicating the needed skills and does not offer tutoring well that is really the mark of a poor teacher who shouldn't be in that position so your parent s should help you by backing you up and going to bat for you only if you can't resolve the problem on your own btw how do you know for sure that half the kids fail have you been given the class results for the past few years be prepared to answer such questions raise you issue s as concerns and listen to the answers it could be that one or two of your friends just didn't do their work and blamed this teacher it is possible most of all be mature and responsible in your approaches to this situation as whining will get you nowhere be informed and reasonable Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Tutor Education in Romania Homeschooling Education GED Teacher Education in the People's Republic of China Boston Public Intelligent design movement Education in Taiwan Education reform Philosophy of mathematics Charter school Affirmative action Education in Japan PLATO Mathematics Logic Alexander Technique Tripartite System Independent school (UK) Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of education Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Jaime Escalante Philosophy of language Ethics School choice Avenue Q Past teachings of Prem Rawat Bertrand Russell Call centre Education in Portugal Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Danish Folkeskole Education Theodicy Experiential education Feminism Epistemology Equal Protection Clause Paradox Dyslexia School counselor Teach the Controversy Catechism Hikikomori Great Teacher Onizuka The Princeton Review Bayesian inference A.
