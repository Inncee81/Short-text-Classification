how do u write a paper comparing two plays i need to compare two plays that i was to read school and ultimately determine which tragic figure i sympathize with the most and why considering their personal actions affecting their destinites ne have ne advice on how i can compare plays and talk about who i sympathize with the most plz n ty death of a salesman fences what plays are you comparing did you read them since you didn't give any details on the plays this is the best i can do you need to start out your paper giving a brief summary of each play just the main points of what happened and what the main character tragic figure did explain how what these two characters did affected their lives for example if he or she killed their best friend did they spend the rest of their days regretting their decisions did they go around helping others because they felt so guilty was the person they killed evil and they became a hero that sort of thing what might have they done differently would this have changed the outcome then decide which one of those two guys girls you sympathize agree with their actions the most explain why you feel this way if tragic figure number one killed his best friend but you feel that he was justified to do so say this and explain why usually with a tragic hero they are basically good but because of some character flaw things don't work out happily for example in romeo and juliet romeo was a tragic hero he was a good person and rose above the prejudice of his family because he loved juliet but the intensity of his emotions also caused his down fall when in love he tended to jump in with out looking first so to speak specifically with juliet he did not think about what would happen to his family and friends if he chose juliet over them he was so wrapped up in his all consuming love for her that he forgot everything else then when things went horribly wrong in the end he made another rash decision and ended his life quickly because he felt that death would be better than spending life without juliet whom he thought was dead had he stopped and thought things through before taking the poison he would have discovered she was not dead but because he was tragically flawed those flaws intense emotions leading to rash decisions ultimately caused his death and the death of his lover Romeo and Juliet Juliet Theory of conduct Pitaten Theodicy Sin City Drama Charmed One Tree Hill (TV series) Predestination Kain (Legacy of Kain) Knots Landing Tragedy Darth Vader Ranma __ characters Days of our Lives EastEnders Microeconomics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kill Bill Socrates Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Infantilism Milton H.
