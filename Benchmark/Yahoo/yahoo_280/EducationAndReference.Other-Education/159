if they teach it in school it must be true if my beliefs were based on intelligent design and i were a student in a history or biology based class who was learning about darwin's origin of species and the theory of evolution would i be required to test and answer questions on these subjects would i be able to opt out it's been psychologically proven that testing on a subject even if it is farce can reinforce that farce in the mind as indiscriminable truth if i gave you a workbook that said the earth is flat and explained to you how and why whether it were true or not and then tested you on the theory the next day grading you based on answering the information according to what you read not necessarily what is true it would begin to reinforce that flawed knowledge in your mind as i have stated previously i am not in school i am a married woman with an occupation but i was curious about opinions on this particular subject usually you can opt out either you or your parent should discuss the issue with the principal if the teacher is unreceptive most principals are scared of parents on this or any other issue if you don't feel heard the media or the principal's bosses usually will listen intently if that still doesn't work consider a national group agency that will help you don't have listen to bunk it's your right not to do so Teach the Controversy Intelligent design movement Education Philosophy of language Intelligent design Creation science Evolutionary creationism Psychology Kitzmiller v.
