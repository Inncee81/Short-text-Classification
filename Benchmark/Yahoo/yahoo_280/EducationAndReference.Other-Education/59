how to get better grades when i was younger like in middle school i loved it i liked learning and had staright a's now when i get to high school i'm getting lazy and my grades aren't as good anymore but high school is more important so how can i get my interest for learning back again start by developing better habits you will discover that earning good grades is habit forming students who make a's tend to keep making them but you have to first take the first step to get the habit started i would select one thing from this list and master it over a period of one month then select another to add to the first and continue until you've mastered all of the items from the list set aside a regular time to study at least minutes a day during school and study something even if you don't have a regular homework assignment to complete reading practicing your mathematics researching etc complete all of your homework assignments on time even if you make mistakes be sure you've at least attempted to do every part of every assignment analyze your work on completed and graded assignments and tests attend tutorials or hire a tutor to help you thoroughly understand what mistakes you are making if you are unable to figure out your mistakes by yourself be on time to every class every day and do not be absent except in cases of emergency if you are absent get your assignments before you return to class and begin working on them if you are absent and unable to get the assignments ahead of time give yourself hours after you return to get yourself caught up from your absence prepare for every test spend at least an hour before every test looking over the materials that will be covered on the test perhaps you can work with classmates to form a study group read over the materials practice your mathematics memorize information that you know is going to be on the test and above all else get a good night sleep and eat a good breakfast before each test you will discover that you'll enjoy learning and enjoy school much more when these habits are established so good luck Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Education in the United States Grade (education) Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Romania Education Education in Germany Japanese tea ceremony Narcolepsy SAT Test (student assessment) Education in Taiwan Education in Japan Python programming language Homeschooling Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Hunter College High School No Child Left Behind Act Second language acquisition Extreme Programming College Asperger syndrome One Tree Hill (TV series) Gifted Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Education in Australia Speed reading Boy Scouts of America Explosive material Education in Hong Kong Economics Education in South Korea High school Secondary education in Japan Ravi Shastri Martial art Password Stevens Institute of Technology Singlish Juris Doctor Scientific method Welding Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Lawyer Secondary education in France The Hidden Curriculum Theory of conduct Consensus decision-making Quicksort Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Software engineering Phoebe Halliwell Education in France Moe Berg STS-62 Ludwig Wittgenstein Shaggy dog story Education in Austria Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Philosophy of language Hikaru no Go Humphrey Bogart The Amazing Race Marching band Sydney Riot of 1879 Kender __cole Polytechnique Reading (activity) Open access Marshall McLuhan Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Chess strategy and tactics Education in Portugal Social rule Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Beatmania IIDX Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination USS Ammen (DD-527) Programme for International Student Assessment Species USS Wallace L.
