how to overcome anxiety about highschool so lately i have been feeling very mixed emotions about entering the new school the school i am going to has a lot of 'ghetto' people and people who love to fight and are considered to be ignorant by other people thats not really the issue its just i'm nervous about my teachers i don't know if i will be able to pass because of how nervous i get when forced to work with others and now the subjects are going to be so much harder i'd like to know if someone had some advice about getting through the first few days of high school and maybe some tips you have about taking notes staying organized also i would really like my writing to be discussed more openly with myself and a teacher but i'm not to sure if i should ask for their help in editing my work and getting their view on my stories or if i should just wait until i enter college thanks in advanced rain you probably needn't worry about the other students unless you're planning to spend a lot of time with them outside of school the teachers are interested in the quality of your work and if you're there organization shouldn't be too hard get a spiral notebook for each subject and don't tear out pages for anything or anyone get a legal pad and write assignments to be handed in on it get a five subject pouch and use it to hold handouts that you get in class and to store assignments that you're going to hand in and which are handed back study on your own and in a quiet place if you can't find one let your school know this and they'll help go to every class don't miss a single one ever give your best effort in every non academic activity including gym do every problem in every homework assignment turn everything in on time that's your first priority when they tell you to do something do it if you get stuck work around the bad place and ask for help the next day be completely honest in all your dealings with teachers and others once you get a reputation as a reliable kid you'll be trusted to do more interesting things and you'll always get the benefit of the doubt never miss an opportunity to demonstrate to the authorities that you're a good kid if you get stuck doing some sort of group project make sure you do more than your share of the work you'll learn more and though others might take credit for something you've done you and they will know the truth Education in Romania Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Education in the People's Republic of China Social rule Shaggy dog story GED Current teachings of Prem Rawat Procrastination Tai Chi Chuan Graduate school Education in Japan Philosophical skepticism Past teachings of Prem Rawat A Course In Miracles Empire Burlesque Franklin W.
