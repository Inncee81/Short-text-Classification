should i put my gpa on my internship resume i'm in college applying for cardiac rehab internships and refining my resume my boyfriend advised me to put my gpa on it since it is pretty good i have heard that a gpa isn't necessary i don't think that the internship people are going to care all that much and it just seems like it takes up space on the resume what do you think should i put it or not if you were an employer would you want to see a gpa score since it's an internship and you've done really well i agree with the previous poster that you should include it at any other time though unless they specifically ask for it i wouldn't volunteer the information i've had a number of people tell me never volunteer anything that can potentially be used against you Grade (education) Intern Medical school Education in Germany Physician Walt Disney World College Program Law school Theory of conduct Plame affair National Certificate of Educational Achievement Scientology beliefs and practices Graduate school Laws of cricket Friends R__sum__ Scholarship Social rule Caldwell College Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Sydney Riot of 1879 Affirmative action Intelligence quotient Middle Tennessee State University Montgomery Blair High School Regents of the University of California v.
