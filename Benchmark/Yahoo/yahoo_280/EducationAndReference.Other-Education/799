in a speech inspite having been soo confident i forgot all my lines i got tenced and nervous then started again my friends and my teachers had very much hopes for me and i cant face them my attitude has lost help we all get nervous making speeches it's one of the hardest things to do if you are not a natural entertainer i agree with the other guy use notes i find it best to have a list of key words that lead me through what i want to say that way it doesn't sound like i'm just reading it the best advice i can think of for now is to forget about what other people might think you are who you are and you're probably a wonderful person no body can blame you for being nervous after all you did the best thing you could and that was to compose yourself and start again the best advice for the future is to prepare well for it Social rule 2004 Republican National Convention The Dalek Invasion of Earth Religious Society of Friends Meat Loaf Recurring South Park characters Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Avenue Q Brian Griffin The Ashlee Simpson Show Philipp Melanchthon Hearing impairment Kim Possible Nightmares (Buffy episode) Friends Coming of Age (TNG episode) Shaggy dog story Stuttering Pok__mon Live!
