school club one of the clubs i'm in at my high school recently lost its adviser moved we want to e mail prospective advisers but don't know what to say any ideas we also have a meeting coming up about the situation what should we discuss in the letter to prospective advisors i would just keep it simple tell the name of your club the purpose of your club what you do at meetings any programs or outside school activities you may participate in as part of the club what happened to your old advisors why you need a new advisor what the new advisor will have to do their duties what will happen if you don't have an advisor how much you appreciate everyone taking the time to consider this at your meeting you should write the email or letter that you want to send to the staff prospective advisors discuss who you would really like to be your advisor the letter email or whatever you send should go to all of the staff of the high school but the teachers you and your club really want should be approached personally so decide who you'd really like and pick someone an officer or someone who has a good relationship with the teacher to personally express your interest in having them as an advisor good luck Plame affair Yearbook E-mail Condoleezza Rice Pretty Good Privacy Surveillance Franklin W.
