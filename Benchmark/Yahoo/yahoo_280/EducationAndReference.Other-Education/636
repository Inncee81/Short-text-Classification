year of h ll coming up okay at my high school sophmore year is h ll according to the teachers i am going to be a sophmore in the upcoming school year what are some good study habits i can adapt to help me to get above a gpa first of all its great to hear from a highschooler who's actually concerned about her future and who wants to do something to optimize her possibilities of success that's the first thing you're on the right track here's some ideas that have worked miracles for me they may or may not work for you but you never know 'till you give them a try for studying terms and formulas and anything else that can fit on a x notecard make a colorful yet simple card with whatever information you need to know and place them at various places throughout your house you will see them and absorb the information unconsciously because you're seeing it all the time if necessary during an exam you can even visualize the location of the notecard in your house and it might help you recall the information the other reason why this works is repetition and frequency the more often you're exposed to certain information and knowledge the easier and more thoroughly your brain assimilates it for things requiring diagrams or drawn out explanations get a small poster board draw it out label the things that need to be labeled and post it in your room where you can glance at it from time to time visual aids while not a complete study technique will help solidify the information you're learning in class and studying at home if you haven't already set aside a special place for studying make it cozy comfortable and inviting so that you want to study there an intellectual refuge of sorts make sure you include good lighting and maybe a few items that make you happy or remind you of how important your future is to you teddy bear pennant or bumper sticker from a prospective college you'd like to attend etc discover whether you're the type that learns better in silence or with background noise i personally study better if there's other sounds going on i can't learn worth a darn in complete silence find out what works for you and make it happen for me if i listen to the same song s while studying certain information like concepts definitions and vocabulary type things during test time i can hear the song in my head and instantly recall the information i studied while listening to it most importantly study consistently make a point of dedicating a specific block of time each day to study your various subjects stick to it make it be known to all who may disturb you that those are your studying hours and to contact you when they're over all friends and family who support you in reaching your future goals will support you in this anyone who disregards your wishes is disregarding your concern for your future take breaks and know that the human mind is strained when its asked to concentrate for more than minutes at a time get up stretch get a glass of water something but keep it to about minutes of break time for every hour breaks are just as important to learning as the study time again a rest for the brain gives it a chance to file away the information you just gave it eat right exercise and get plenty of sleep those too are important in keeping your academics in tip top condition make time for fun when your work is done its a reward and motivates you to keep up your good hard work which will pay off immensely good luck to you Second language acquisition Grade (education) MP3 Extreme Programming Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Education in Romania Poker jargon Past teachings of Prem Rawat Consensus decision-making Social psychology Social rule Hearing impairment Logic David Hume John Cage Plame affair Out-of-body experience Cognitive science I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Traumatic incident reduction Doomsday argument Psychology Animal Crossing Shaggy dog story Mnemonic CPU cache Happiness Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban College admissions Stereoscopy Quizbowl Music Dyslexia Supernatural Dream Marching band Internet troll Aikido Autism Surveillance A Course In Miracles Education in Germany Graduate school Memory Education in Japan Time Out of Mind Neopets Avenue Q Education in the People's Republic of China Tai Chi Chuan Gmail Theory of conduct The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Strategic management Ra (board game) Deconstruction Education in the United States Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Randomness Hypnosis Pinball Phaedo Alexander Technique Storytelling Columbine High School massacre The Silence of the Lambs Consciousness Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Socrates Joke Education Pitaten Sleep Final Fantasy magic She Loves You Weight training Electrophysiology Economics Neuro-linguistic programming Current teachings of Prem Rawat Microphone Clinical depression Theodicy High school Game show Coffee Kitchen Tonality Advertising
