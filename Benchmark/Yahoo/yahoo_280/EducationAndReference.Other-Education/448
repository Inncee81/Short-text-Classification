i need some advice and info on culinary school i'm a junior in highschool i need some info on just everything about culinary school can someone that went to culinary school take time to contact me through this give me some advice more than anything you want to make sure you have the aptitude and desire to complete culinary school getting in is easy but finishing is not culinary school costs a lot of money and they usually will get you set up with student loans to finance those loans come due after you finish or quit lots of schools reel students in with promises of success financial aid only to have them wash out after a month or so after having paid high in tuition through student loans the school gets its money and makes its profit while the students wash out and are left in heavy debt student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy which makes it even worse so look before you leap to find a school that is reputable i would first go through the local ads and yellow pages to identify local culinary schools then call the better business bureau to see if any have complaints if a school has more than a couple of complaints cross it off your list once you've narrowed your list then go to a few of the better restaurants in your area and find out where their chefs went to school and if you can talk to the chefs directly find out what they thought of their schools and if they would recommend them ask restaurant managers what schools they typically use for finding new chefs and why once you've done this homework you should have your list down to just a few schools and you can visit ane make your decision based on environment and cost good luck Graduate school Student loan Education in the United States Citigroup Education in the People's Republic of China Monetary policy Unemployment Inflation Bank Education in Romania Economics Deflation (economics) Interest Bond Credit card GED Debt Economy of the United States Personal finance Finance Mortgage Students' union Tuition Mutual fund Corporate finance College admissions Capital accumulation Stock Wal-Mart Predatory lending Fractional-reserve banking Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Schabir Shaik Trial Theory of conduct The Amazing Race Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mergers and acquisitions Asian financial crisis Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Microeconomics High school Babe Ruth Islamic banking Newspaper Great Teacher Onizuka Price discrimination Bankruptcy Islamic economics Recipe Barrister Great Depression Culinary Institute of America University of Pretoria Primerica Financial Services Corporation Appeal Education in New Zealand Expert system Public education Financial markets Education in Hong Kong Financial aid Education in Germany Jamie Oliver George W.
