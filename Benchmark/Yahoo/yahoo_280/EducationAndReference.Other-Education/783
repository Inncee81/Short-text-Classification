yeah so im starting high school tomorrow anyone have any advice or tips or anything all help would definately be appricated d hopefully you know some people from middle school junior high that can help you transition from the different schools however i suggest that you begin by talking to new people in your classes just introduce yourself to the person next to you because they are probably just as nervous as you are ask if you can borrow a pen if nothing else to better help the transition you should also try to find out what clubs and organizations your school has that you might be interested in the more you try out the more likely you are to find long lasting friends most of all just don't worry about everything that goes wrong you will make mistakes and probably embarrass yourself but nobody will remember later rely on the people you can and meet as many new people as possible because it will make your experience so much better Social rule Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Can't Hardly Wait Little Britain Graduate school Good Morning, Vietnam Middle school Piccolo Junior Saga Alcoholics Anonymous Anxiety A Course In Miracles The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Hypnosis The Beatles Friends Hiberno-English Beetle in an Anthill Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Yoko Ono Transsexuality The Lovely Bones She Loves You Extras (sitcom) Carl Barks Donald Rumsfeld Shaggy dog story Psychosis Renaissance The Day After Tomorrow High school Education in the United States Year of the Spider The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Socrates Development of Darwin's theory Saved by the Bell Inception of Darwin's theory Theory of conduct Debate Blood on the Tracks Milton H.
