how do you study does anyone have any study tips notecards are no longer working for me i've returned to school after many years and i've realized that now that i'm older its very difficult for me to retain information especially if i find it boring ex physiology aaaahh how i miss the days when i could just show up to class and everything would just somehow sink in anyways i've tried reading the textbooks and making notecards and that doesnt really help i havent been getting the best grades in my classes and it feels like i m overloading my brain i've never had to study in my life so its a challenge for me please anyone how do you study first of all find an environment that let's you concentrate best some people need to leave their home or they get distracted by t v bed so sleepy less important chores etc being in public forces them to study others get too distracted by studying in public e g oh it's much more interesting to people watch than study right now some like it quiet others like background noise this is is really important work towards your learning style if you're a visual learner try to take notes with a lot of graphs and charts and illustrations if you're an auditory learner you could possibly summarize out loud paragraphs you've read or run a q a with a friend based on the text if you're a kinesthetic learner involves sense of touch and body movement maybe you can work with a physiology model or somehow enact the information you are reading about don't know how that would really work maybe pointing to yourself when memorizing parts of the anatomy of course no one exclusively works within one style of learning but sometimes it's easier for a person to work in one area than another as a teacher whenever i assign reading to students i usually provide key questions to provide focus for a given reading it's important for students to have goals when reading new text because it compels them to look for specific information and develop ideas otherwise they sometimes read without any true active understanding of the text if your instructor hasn't already done so you could ask for him or her to come up with some guideline questions for assigned readings these questions are for your benefit so answer them as you complete your reading also when you're reading write down your own questions and insights keep the reading process active some people work better with a partner if you think you are one of those then do so collaborative learning can be beneficial for both parties even when one person knows more than the other studies have shown that the tutor actually can benefit slightly more from than the tutee because the tutor has to clearly articulate his or her own understanding of the material which provides a kind of mental reinforcement of the tutor's knowledge to make sure your collaborative studying is effective make sure you both come to the table with questions about the reading material obviously this assumes you've already read the material on your own finally students only really absorb material if they believe the subject has relevance in their life so even in a topic like physiology that seems boring to you you must clearly establish in a positive way how the subject matter could be beneficial to you in your life for example so i can pass this class is not much of a motivator but thinking i study physiology so i'll have a better understanding of what goes on in each csi television series might be a better motivator hope that helps GED Motivation Social psychology Second language acquisition Asperger syndrome Dyslexia Education Education in the People's Republic of China Autism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Martial art Neuro-linguistic programming Biology Intelligent design movement Homeschooling Sleep Scientology beliefs and practices Graduate school Expert system Logic Plame affair Hearing impairment Test (student assessment) Educational animation Mathematics Scientific method Cognitive science Psychology Past teachings of Prem Rawat Aristotle Botany Economics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Philosophy of language Education in the United States Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Philosophy of education Hypnosis Sexual orientation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Species Enterprise content management Open access Traumatic incident reduction Metacognition Meditation Strategic management Out-of-body experience Franz Boas Normal distribution Aikido Psychosis Experiential education Aphasia Ethics Tai Chi Chuan No Child Left Behind Act Milton H.
