how do i write a resume cover letter to apply for a graphic design job if i have only college experience help this is always difficult but don't dispair the best thing to do it look at the job offer and list the qualifications skills and anything else the employer is asking for once you have this it is time to write the cover letter try and match yourself as close as possible to each requirement if the say they need computer skills but you have done no computer courses write that you have worked on various computer packages ms word etc in prepairing for you projects at college don't be afraid to say that you do not have specific experiance but always make up for it by saying you have the ability to learn quickly and you are confident that you will be sucessful in all aspects of the position in my experiance companies would rather pay less and get someone with potential they can train with the outcome of having an employee with the skills and paying them less than an experianced person from the start paying them more remember the resume only gets you to the interview stage it is there that you need to be confident and truly beleive you are the right person for the job i always say that if you approch everything with an extremely positive mind and try and suppress the thought of i am not good enough you will succeed chin up and if you get a knock back and you are not offered the job than dont worry because the people interviewing you know what they are looking for always be yourself as the interviewee does not want to be in the position of employing someone they thought was something else if you are not the right person for the job accept that it does not mean you are not good enough rather that you would not fit in that specific work environment Social rule Requirements analysis Software engineering Economic inequality Unemployment Scientology beliefs and practices Steve Jobs Computer Education in Germany Plame affair Graduate school Apprenticeship Milton H.
