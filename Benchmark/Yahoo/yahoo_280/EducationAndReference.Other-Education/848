studying for exams did anyone else get a real buzz from going into an exam without doing any revision i just loved the feeling of going into an exam and blagging my way through opening up your result and having no clue to how you've done it didnt always work out at uni but hey thats what resits are for i dont think we should take anything for granted though yes it may be thrilling for the fact that you've passed with flying colours despite not having sufficient preparation but hey success comes from a good attitude its not just about luck Juris Doctor Grade (education) A-level Junior Certificate Love Hina main characters Higher (Scottish) Steely Dan Hatake Kakashi Atomic Kitten Education in Portugal Lawyer Graduate school IB Diploma Programme Pitaten National Certificate of Educational Achievement Cisco Certified Network Associate Real estate broker The Chemical Brothers Hikikomori Nineteen Eighty-Four Singlish Advanced Placement Program Baccalaur__at Futurama (TV series - season 5) Raymond Chandler Hey Jude Uzumaki Naruto Negima College admissions Education in Romania Aretha Franklin 2000 Australian Grand Prix Regression toward the mean Law school Bat Lash I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue High school SAT Paralegal Jaime Escalante The Buzz on Maggie Certified Public Accountant My Parents are Aliens Another View Philosophy, Politics and Economics Architect Patent attorney Judicial review Prostate cancer Leaving Certificate Cliff Richard Hey Hey It's Saturday Physician Kurt Cobain My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Hey Ya!
