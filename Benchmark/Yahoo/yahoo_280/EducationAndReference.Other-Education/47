how come white people send their kids to private or home schooling brag about it only to get a stupid kid white people brag on private school and home schooling like they are actually doing their kid a favor this just goes to show the ignorance that is socially bred among white culture to believe in hysteria and urban legand rather than cold hard facts people who graduate from private school can't hold a candle to a black or a white kid who went to public school and are usually better in diverse topics of conversation public schools outperform private schools in academics arts and sports every year only a few private schools do well most of which are in england and the american one's that do well pretend that they represent private schools in general when in general private schools and home schooled children are a flop and are far behind their college peers when they enroll when will white people see that their privately schooled children are always the butt of a joke when they go out in public open their mouths and america gets a taste of they learned in school what terry doesn't know is that of course certain magazines will cover a sole story where a few kids did good however if you talk to the college admissions board themselves they will tell you that the majority of home schooled kids unless they are super rich with three private teachers have horrible inadequate education and barely make it into college at the rate of those schooled outside the home and the ones that do sneak by have a hard time in college and can barely keep up you will always have potheads and rejects who don't want to listen to teachers those people will have all kinds of problems in their life most properly raised children don't act like that the school is not the problem they are i think the urban legends may be more prevalent in the public schools im not sure where you got your information but it is almost certainly wrong i know because i attended both public and private schools i went to a private boarding school fro high school but eschewed the ivy league for a public university against everyone's wishes i can tell you that my work in high school was more challenging than my college work there really is no comparison there is also much less of the ignorant racism in private schools my roomate in fact was black he did fine in school sports and socially there were students of all races there all intelligent and we all got along together more or less your opinion is almost entirely unfounded i am really wondering how you develpoed these theories furthermore i am not sure who has 'bragged' to you abotu their kids in private schools perhaps someone has offended you with their racism and you responded by passing it on im not sure homeschool obviously is not standardized can you imagine that it would vary greatly if your parents were authors or nobel prize winners you would have a prized education and certainly many advantages if they were rural ne'er do wells well you could imagine they wouldn't do as well the problem with home schooling from a legislative standpoint is that how do you differentiate do you license parents that wish to homeschool mandate standardized tests textbooks truth is that even the quality of a public education can vary widely depending on the home environment so if someone has bragged to you about their kids in homeschool and you believe them to be 'stupid' you may be entirely correct in your judgement there are certainly ignorant people around every corner and under choice rocks just dont make the logical error of generalizing your experience to all people white people etc the problem is then that you may be the one who appears to be stupid Affirmative action Waldorf Education Education in Japan Intelligent design movement Charter school Cornell University SAT Culture of the United States Education Teach the Controversy Public domain Eugenics Ivy League Columbia University Education in Australia Race and intelligence No Child Left Behind Act Internet troll Education in Malaysia Education in England Social rule Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Criticism of libertarianism College Economics Oregon State University University of Houston Education in Portugal Danish Folkeskole Education Education in Taiwan School choice Graduate school Private school Theory of conduct Anti-intellectualism Equal Protection Clause Asperger syndrome Education in India Kasparov versus The World Brown v.
