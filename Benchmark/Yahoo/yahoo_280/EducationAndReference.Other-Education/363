how many of us adults think some of the questions are from students to lazy to do their own research and homework teachers professors please sound off if some one needing home work help simply out right asked for ideas of searches they could do after hitting a complete blank to do their own researching would you contribute the majority of my posts against the do my homework questions are that your teacher is going to come on and read it and fail you for it it is cheating i think if i end up ever teaching a college course i will definatly look on this site and other answer sites for people asking my question and severily repremand them for it i really find it funny when i can open up and old text book i have and post exact chapter line and word for an answer and i'd be right if students would be interested in doing their own work and not having everyone else do ti for them there would only be questions asking if they are pregnant or someone proving they are a biggot these types of questions serve a purpose but i will make fun when someone wants a synopsis of a book for a report that was due an hour ago GED Theory of conduct Blog Avenue Q Gifted A Course In Miracles Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Professor Test (student assessment) Augustus De Morgan Socrates Education Intelligent design movement Graduate school Education in Romania Current teachings of Prem Rawat Teach the Controversy Scientology beliefs and practices Literacy Meaning of life Koan Classical education Social rule Scholasticism Plame affair Education in the People's Republic of China University of Massachusetts Amherst The Hidden Curriculum Shaggy dog story Halting problem Wheel of Fortune Ludwig Wittgenstein Milton H.
