i made a fake report card and let my parents see it but i feel so wrong ok um im going to th grade and in th grade i didnt do good i made a fake report card showing all as the real one had bs and cs my parents wouldnt like that so they sent the real one to my house and i switched the real one with the fake one my parents saw it and were proud of me my mom gave me for it now i already spent it then suddenly i had to register for another school district and i had to show my report card and get my documents from a different high school and they had a copy of the real report card and my mom looked at it and said this one is wrong but in great relief she thought it was a mistake from the computer so she threw the real copy of the report card away so we arrived at the registration place and they checked everything and including my fake report card so again i got away with it but they made copies of everything and will send them to the high school im going to but im afraid the high school will get the real report card and fake one what should i do do you fear that your mom will just get mad or that she will beat you too hopefully she will just be mad and not abusive if you think your mom will be abusive then you might want to contact another adult that you trust and ask them to be with you but you need to come clean with your mom you might want to think about what a reasonable consequence might be for falsifying your report card and lying to you mom you could then say how sorry you are for doing what you did and describe how it has been eating away at you but you know it was wrong and that it is wrong to continue to withhold the truth ask your mom to forgive you and offer your idea of the consequence you thought of then you have to leave it up to her as to what happens next hopefully your mom will be reasonable and the school will be too however if you are not sincere about knowing it was wrong and repenting for your misdeed then that will show through and it will just be that much worse for you EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Repentance Plame affair Theory of conduct Social rule Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints One Tree Hill (TV series) Killian documents Poker jargon Sin Domestic violence Kodocha Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Internet fraud Piccolo Junior Saga The Adventures of Pete & Pete Springfield Elementary School Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story No Child Left Behind Act Bank fraud Indian nationality law Phishing Knots Landing Garfield Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Homeschooling RuneScape cheats Futurama (TV series - season 2) Cheating in poker George Costanza Infantilism The Fairly OddParents The Daleks' Master Plan Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Fathers' rights Out-of-body experience 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Merit Datalore (TNG episode) The Battle (TNG episode) Classified information Little Britain Determinism Science 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression The Emancipation of Mimi Grade (education) Daredevil 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Autism rights movement Yu-Gi-Oh!
