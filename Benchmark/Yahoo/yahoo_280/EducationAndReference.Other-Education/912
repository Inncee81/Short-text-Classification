broad academic subjects like philosophy politics are a waste of time education should prepare young people for work but some say broad academic subjects like philosophy and politics are a waste of time to what extent do you agree with this statement i don't agree politics isn't a waste of time but people that study it generally are philosophy is probably the only course of study that everyone would benefit from it helps one deal with basic questions like why one's work matters in the first place i'd certainly rather hire a philosophy major than a political science major i think one of the major problems in our society is that there is a deficiency in the area of philosophy it is particularly noticed in our politicians who cannot state a moral principle that they hold the closest they can come is to state one or two firmly held platform positions and a few of those more skilled in politics defend those positions adequately none of them ever seem to even conceive of the question of why this is a moral just correct or wise position it's just their position there's no principle behind it at all if more people were educated in philosophy we might recognize these intellectual lightweights for what they are and stop electing them and put them where they belong behind a fast food counter Objectivist philosophy Philosophy of mathematics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethics Cultural relativism Theory of conduct Western philosophy Philosophy of science Political economy Philosophy Anti-intellectualism Goodness and value theory John Rawls Social justice David Hume Atheism Morality Jewish principles of faith Bernard Williams Supernatural Falsifiability Science Philosophy of business Affirmative action Immanuel Kant Maimonides Logic Intelligent design Jean-Jacques Rousseau Peter Singer Political philosophy Leo Strauss Confucianism Metaphysics Education in the People's Republic of China Religion Homeschooling Philosophy of education Reality Public policy Victor Cousin Friedrich Schleiermacher Causality Property (ownership right) Young Earth creationism Separation of church and state Graduate school Free will Physics Rabbi Coercion Education Libertarianism Postmodernism Left-wing politics Animal rights School of Salamanca Consciousness Professor Bertrand Russell Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Wedge strategy Modern geocentrism Socrates Ernest Gellner Max Stirner Atomism Philosophy of law Jewish philosophy Politics Nicomachean Ethics Cognitive science Philosophy of history Thomas Hill Green Juris Doctor Epistemology Abortion debate Republic Appeal Rudolf Hermann Lotze Religious studies Public domain Lawyer Social sciences Rudolf Steiner Deconstruction Altruism Biblical inerrancy Mathematics Sociocultural evolution Human rights Art
