my third son wants to pay plus accomadation costs to go on a three day motivation course down in london but i think that it is a complete waste of time and money he swears that he has friends who have been on it and claim that it has changed their lives he has always been a bit of a drifter unlike my other three but i made sure that he got through school and so on and what he does now is up to him but he does have a good job and writes too so i can't see the problem he says that he will send me details of this particular course called landmark or somesuch but i am sceptical and wouldn't want him to waste his money does anyone know anything about these courses and what they are all about i am also worried that in his case such a course could actually do harm and he would be better off having a good holiday hello steve no my son has his own place over in hull my youngest boy moved out just over a year ago and i have told all of them that even though they would be welcome back here temorarily in a real emergency i am entitled to my own home these days after bringing four of them on my own up in a two bedroomed house i taught them to stand on their own two feet which is why him talking about this course suprises me i tend to trust the guardian newspaper so have posted you this which you may find helpful http observer guardian co uk uk news story html there is also something on wikipedia if you look up landmark seminars landmark seminars used to be called the est forum my ex husband did several of them at that time and has survived and is also a writer he doesn't do them now it was something though he felt he had to do at the time some people say they are dangerous and a 'cult' and you will find all sorts of alarmist stories on the cult busting websites but they are always one sided and maybe from individuals wanting to blame someone else for their own difficulties i have to warn you though which may explain the 'cult' label that people often tend not to want to stop at one seminar or training and go on to do others my husband did and your son well may if he can afford them there's nothing you can really do about it although it may be difficult for you i think there is still the element of secrecy which will mean that he won't be able to tell you much about what happened there he may also try to get you to do one too my husband did but failed please don't worry i think you just have to be supportive and patient and try not to criticise what he's doing too much i personally don't like the whole thing but we all have to make our own choices good luck to you both Social rule Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Plame affair Shaggy dog story Landmark Education Past teachings of Prem Rawat Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Neuro-linguistic programming The Star Wars Holiday Special Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Internet troll The Skeptical Environmentalist Milton H.
