chemistry advice so i am jumping straight into ap chemistry this coming year without previously taking any even basic chemistry class and i was just wondering if there are any specific things i need to know before starting that i need to like memorize and all i'm already starting to prepare but i just want to make sure i don't miss anything thanks i took ap chemistry this past year and it was very hard i would say to start memorizing different formulas and the periodic table you don't need to memorize the table cause they give you one on the ap test just make sure you know what the symbols stand represent for each element other than that just pay attention and study a lot good luck Chemistry Craps Chemical element Periodic table Chemical formula Education in Germany Science Chris Amon Billboard Hot 100 Volleyball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Group representation Ravi Shastri Elementary arithmetic Legal research Poker jargon Annuity Diving Transformation problem Dog agility Satchel Paige Girls Aloud Current teachings of Prem Rawat Technetium Time Out of Mind Actuarial notation Reservoir Dogs Social rule Baroque chess Ja Rule Aerial (dance move) Education in Portugal Education in the People's Republic of China Piccolo Junior Saga Organic chemistry New York Knicks Transition metal Education in Hong Kong Education in Taiwan Traumatic incident reduction Magic (paranormal) 2000 Australian Grand Prix FC Rostov Randomness Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nigel Mansell Skateboarding trick On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Hydrogen Computational chemistry Oasis (band) Biochemistry Uranium Logic Blackjack Alchemy Explosive material Extreme Programming Lawyer Education in Japan Final Fantasy XI Numerology Pump It Up Atmospheric chemistry Memory Hungarian language Indiana Pacers New York Giants Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Spanish verbs Fast bowling Life insurance Norouz Mnemonic Arabic alphabet Spacecraft propulsion Fischer Random Chess Manganese The Apprentice 2 English plural Star Trek Customizable Card Game The Amazing Race Philosophy of science Billiards Martial art Molecule Abduction Phenomenon Writing system All That BZFlag Education in Romania Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Fire fighting Bulgarian language 24 Hours of Le Mans Go ranks and ratings WilliamsF1 Pysanka History of science
