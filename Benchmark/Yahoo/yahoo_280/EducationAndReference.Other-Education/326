what does an engineer mostly do does an engineer also draw and designs buildings i was just wondering i wanted to make sure what an engineer mostly do an engineer can specialize in almost anything and hence there is a very wide variety of things they do civil engineers usually work on buildings runways roads bridges etc mechanical can do lots of things dynamics fluid flow static etc biomedical usually works on things for the medical field i'm a biomedical engineer who works with orthopedics polymer usually concentrates on polymers and plastics materials computer aero etc check out the links below for more information Civil engineering Science Structural engineering Engineering Medicine Jet engine Materials science Chemical engineering Ceramics Computer Construction Biomedical engineering Fluid dynamics Product Lifecycle Management Stevens Institute of Technology Electrical engineering Datatype STS-50 Spacecraft propulsion Open access Motor oil Light-emitting diode Kingston University Screw Corrosion Computer-aided design Tissue engineering Combat engineering Renato M.
