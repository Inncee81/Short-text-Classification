how could i bring recess back at my school the th th and th graders don't get recess i'm in th and i want to change my school before i leave apperently some kids threw rocks at an old lady like ten years ago but that was years ago i don't know anyone who would do that i might make a small film using my new techniques from my film school how many names would i need on a petition in new jersey do the signers have to be of legal age first you need to come up with some good reasons why recess is important for older students try going online and finding some research on the connection of taking breaks and better learning that follows a break and how exercise is beneficial lack of exercise and obesity in children and how play is beneficial for children social benefits etc i would also work cooperatively and collaborate with others try talking to some teachers counselors principals parents and find some adults who agree with your reasons when concerns come up such as throwing rocks ask the adults what they think can be done to limit this behavior or what sort of consequences could be put in place you could also bring up new ideas what if the older students were to organize games or help out with the younger students or what about service projects planting a garden or working outside to better the school during this down time i don't think storming in with a petition is really going to do anything but it is good to talk to students and take down names of students who would be willing to help make this work then when you talk to the adults you can bring up that x number of students are willing to help and want to see this happen good luck i'm so glad to see someone your age working proactively to make change in the world Education Theory of conduct Aikido Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Experiential education Recess (TV series) Infantilism Motivation Homeschooling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tai Chi Chuan Second language acquisition Pitaten Education in the United States Divorce Bully Age of consent Autism rights movement Education in Japan Criticism of libertarianism Child sexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Piccolo Junior Saga GED Education in the People's Republic of China About a Boy Teachers (film) Economics Charter school Boston Public Theodicy Adolescence Scholarship Current teachings of Prem Rawat Scientology beliefs and practices School choice Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Graduate school College Patent Martial art Quicksort Literacy Link (Legend of Zelda) The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Lawrence v.
