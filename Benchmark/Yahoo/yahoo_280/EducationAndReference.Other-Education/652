amount of reading in biology or chemistry i am deciding between chemistry and biology both ap i was wondering on average how many pages would students have to read each night i normally cannot keep up with the reading biology is definitely more reading than chemistry but chemistry is a lot more of working out problems if your math algebra level no calculus is stronger or faster than reading then chemistry is definitely the way to go it's much more conceptual and math based of course there is still reading involved expect a couple of sections pages a night biology on the other hand involves a lot of facts reading and memorization it's hard to say how much you'd have to read a lot of that depends on your teacher and how much material you're able to cover in class you may find yourself reading pages a night but it depends and you probably wouldn't have to do that every single day Mathematics Physics Advanced Placement Program Education in Taiwan SAT Science Education in the United States Calculus No Child Left Behind Act Chemistry Molecular biology Mnemonic Stuyvesant High School Troy High School Clements High School Dyslexia Graduate school Temperature Secondary education in the United States Computer Theory of conduct Education CPU cache Electrophysiology Massachusetts Institute of Technology Jaime Escalante W.
