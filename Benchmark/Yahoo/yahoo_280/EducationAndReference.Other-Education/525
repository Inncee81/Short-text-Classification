what does your handwritting look like i just want to know i've always thought it was unique how everyone has a different way to write mine is usually wanna be neat i have pretty messy handwritting but i try hard to make it look pretty which is rarely i was never able to get that pretty girly handwritting pando that's kind of like mine i start out neat and hell breaks loose after the first few words wow some of these are really interesting to read i never even heard of some of these style before very cool me neither i just never had a knack for it but that's cool i like my own writing better for me it's kind of a mix of both cursive and regular it actually changes a lot like the way i write my i or t i love adding loops i give light ish pressure small sometimes big and it's fairly scattered but sometimes so together it could make you think i just printed it but it is legible in any case and i've been told i have nice hand writing a lot i like this question it lets me rant about something i hardly ever discuss Cursive Blackletter Optical character recognition W.
