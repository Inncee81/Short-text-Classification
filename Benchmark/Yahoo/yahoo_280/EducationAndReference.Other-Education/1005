how to get my kids interested in reading by themselves we have been faithfully reading to our kids since they were infants they love being read to but when they have some idle time they still choose tv internet shows over books they have not developed an interest on picking up a book and read it on their own i wonder if anyone have any tips on how to get the kids read on their own you don't say how old your kids are but most kids in the u s see far too much tv and games if you have a tv with parental guidance chip program it not to work in certain parts of the day at any rate limit the time the tv is on for them most parents today have no control over the tv would you let your kids just disappear and come home anytime they pleased yet you let their minds be absorbed by the tv set and return when they wish i am convinced the tv is raising a generation of logicless imagination starved idiots who are totally media educated set aside some interesting good books preferably that have subjects each child is interested in tell them that there are rewards for reading the books and penalties for not reading think of some small rewards and something they have to do like pull weeds if they don't assuming you have a yard something really boring set up a chart to show what each child has read and get them in competition set goals for each child by age ask questions about what they have read later verify how well they read reading will become second nature my mother told me that if you can read you can go anywhere in the universe and understand anything the ideas above about alternately reading to them and getting them to read to you is a good idea when i grew up there wasn't much tv i am convinced that one or two programs a day are enough for kids when i was in high school i read the whole world book encyclopedia a to z you're the adult take charge The Giver Education Carl Jung The Catcher in the Rye Theodicy Hide and Q (TNG episode) Humphrey Bogart RISC The Fairly OddParents Quizbowl GED Education in the United States Art Simone Weil Theory of conduct CPU design Autism Justification (theology) Milton H.
