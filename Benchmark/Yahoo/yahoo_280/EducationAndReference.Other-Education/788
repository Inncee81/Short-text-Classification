what is the most important thing in life to a high schooler ten points for best answer i'm currently an eleventh grade honor student however i don't know which is more important a strong academic life which i was taught was more important or a social life in the tenth grade i realized that in order to be in the top of my class i had to buckle down in school and start studying which i never had to before since school was sooooo much easier when i did this i kind of pushed all of my friends away until a time when i had no homework or studying my idea of a bad day was getting below a on a test honestly sometimes i wanted to just quit because i got like an in some classes i got mad if i got below a in the summer like now everyone loves to be around me i'm fun and outgoing but in school i'm almost anti social because of this new fear of b's and below so is there a way i can have a great social and perfect academic life i always thought is was one or the other any good habits i should know about what do you guys do ps i do have a lot of friends i just push them away until the summer yeah i know its kinda rude but i'm working on it you just need to balance them better work hard in school and hang out with your friends and if a time comes that you need to choose between them try to make a compromise with yourself and try to decide which one is really more important at the time if it's a really big test or something you should probably stick to the school work also you can try to make new friends that really care about their grades as well Education in Romania Theory of conduct Pitaten Grade (education) The Ashlee Simpson Show Hunter College High School One Tree Hill (TV series) Teen Girl Squad Graduate school GED High school Humphrey Bogart Education in the People's Republic of China Friends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Homeschooling The Emancipation of Mimi United States Academic Decathlon The Adventures of Pete & Pete Alcoholics Anonymous Education in Japan Education in Portugal Azumanga Daioh The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cliff Richard Kodocha Secondary education in Japan She Loves You Education Education in Germany Full Metal Panic?
