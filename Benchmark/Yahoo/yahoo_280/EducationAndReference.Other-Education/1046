high school grades i am a sophmore this year at school last year my freshman year at the begining i got c's and b's but then the second six weeks and till the end of the year i got a's and b's one c in world geography so i was wondering is there a way to improve my grades i dont study i am not organized i only got sent to the principal times for isabordination one because i was just in a bad mood the other over a dress code and i got in trouble for dress code violations like times i dont pay attention i am very very very social but i can memorize very well if i miss a question on the test and the teacher tell me the correct answer the teacher and i discus the answer with them i will know it for the next test but the fact is the teachers dont go over the test at all and dont give them to us once we finish so what would you say i do to become a better student and get better grades well i tried studying with a friend the only ones i can study with are ones near me like within a few blocks unless we schedule like a week ahead or so and the few friends i have that live within that mile radius the two i get million times better grades then her and the other i have tried studying with and it doesnt work cause he dances around and sings i dont really like studying cause i am not that great at it cause i am distracted very easy i mean its hard if u dont study however i am also disorganized and managed to get straight a's for th and th grades im going into th right now i also got not so amazing grade in th grade but my parents were divorcing so i wasnt in a great mood to do well what i did was just focus on each assignment and test individually and said i am going to get an a on this i did that for every thing and so i ended up with a's as my final grades it was hard to turn off the t v and study but i knew it would be great in the end for colleges to see if ur very social i have many friends but im fine with being alone too maybe do a study group with other kids who want to try and do better grade wise Education in Romania GED Graduate school Boston Public Education in the United States Education Azumanga Daioh Education in the People's Republic of China SAT Adult attention-deficit disorder Grade (education) Education in Germany Saved by the Bell Education in Taiwan No Child Left Behind Act Lynbrook High School Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Secondary education in Japan Code: Lyoko Education in Japan Martial art Student National Certificate of Educational Achievement Advanced Placement Program Jennifer Lopez Standardized testing Extreme Programming One Tree Hill (TV series) Secondary education in France The Hidden Curriculum Affirmative action Test (student assessment) Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Recess (TV series) A-level Education in Portugal Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Marching band Columbine High School massacre A Course In Miracles Charter school Great Teacher Onizuka The Sims 2: University Teachers (film) School choice United States Academic Decathlon Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Avenue Q Beatmania IIDX High school Master's degree Secondary education in the United States Shaggy dog story Franklin W.
