am i enrolled at a college i will be a senior in high school and i am taking a class at the local community college does this mean that i am enrolled in that college the specific question is have i enrolled at a college or university since my high school graduation i'm asking because i've started applying to other colleges they ask if i'm enrolled so does mean i have to check yes or does it mean i'm just enrolled to take one class i'd say to check no application isn't the same thing as enrollment and taking a course at a community college isn't the same as being a student pursuing a degree unless you plan to use that course toward your degree just put no and you'll be fine Community college Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China University of Maryland, College Park University of Central Florida Columbia University Middle Tennessee State University GED Education in Australia Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology College admissions Cornell University Graduate school Professor College North Carolina State University Education in Hong Kong University of Alabama University of Texas at San Antonio City University of New York University of Pennsylvania Education in Taiwan Coeducation American University Trinity College, Dublin Salt Lake Community College University of Michigan Emerson College Hunter College Georgetown University University of Wisconsin-Platteville Pennsylvania State University Education in Japan Dallas Baptist University Medical school Northwestern University Kwantlen University College Education in Malaysia Florida Institute of Technology Miami Dade College York University California Polytechnic State University Gwinnett University Center Florida A&M University Wayne State University Education in Germany The Citadel (Military College) Christian Brothers University Student Smith College University of Wisconsin Western Kentucky University New York State College of Human Ecology American University in Cairo St. John's College, U.
