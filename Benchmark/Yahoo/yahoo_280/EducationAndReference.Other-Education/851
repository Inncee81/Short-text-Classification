what are those subjects considered to be included in general education subjects just wanna know because i frequently hear them say general education subjects but what are those subjects really i may sound an idiot but im just asking i haven't exactly heard the term general education subjects but general education is a very general term and the specifics vary depending on what university college you attend basically they're the general requirements that all the students have to take for example at uc berkeley all students have to take a class to fulfill the american cultures requirement that actually might be a uc requirement in general but i forget at the moment whatever class you might be taking to fulfill american cultures would be considered general education the opposite if that's what you would call it would be courses that you take to fulfill requirements for your major these classes fulfill more specific requirements and not all students have to take them because not all students have the same major right when you think about it general education can be pretty self explanatory i feel like i didn't explain very well but hope i helped at least some and you're not an idiot i have questions about stuff everybody might know all the time if you never ask you'll never know people are effin close minded condescending jerks if they make you feel like an idiot Education in the United States College Graduate school Education in Portugal Education in Sweden Juris Doctor Education in the People's Republic of China Education IB Diploma Programme Education in Hong Kong Music Education in Germany Education in Australia Intelligent design movement Culture of the United States Student Secondary education in the United States American and British English differences Blood on the Tracks Sexual orientation Physician Master's degree Community college Sharon Tate Past teachings of Prem Rawat Grade (education) Student loan Current teachings of Prem Rawat Trinity College, Dublin College and university rankings Lawyer Iggy Pop Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Professor Alexander Technique A Course In Miracles Bah__'__ Faith and Education Social psychology A-level Anti-intellectualism SAT Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Advanced Placement Program National Certificate of Educational Achievement Teacher Green Day Milton H.
