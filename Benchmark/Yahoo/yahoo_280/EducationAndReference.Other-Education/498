please help band booking for a friend i live in chicago illinois small suburban area and friends of mine in a band might be coming down here in january they asked me though if there are any people around here who set up shows or book bands so i was wondering how i could help them do i call local clubs or what i'm so lost i'd really love for them to come out here i would recommend going on myspace and searching for your area and find other bands or a promoter in your area also you could just look for other websites that have local music info the only way they would be able to get into a club without a connection with another band or promoter would be if you brought or sent their press kit to local clubs and try to get them in that way good luck The Smashing Pumpkins The Chemical Brothers MySpace Guns N' Roses Timpani Chicago (band) Joy Division (band) Incubus (band) Music of Illinois Grunge music REO Speedwagon Coldplay Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Quarashi Therion (band) The Inside KMFDM Fall Out Boy Dixieland Chicagoland Marching band Ringo Starr Homewood, Illinois Sex Pistols Sheryl Crow House music Hum (band) Eric Clapton KISS (band) Marilyn Manson Wonderful Town Izzy Stradlin Chicago 'L' Stevie Nicks Rich Mullins Jimmy Eat World AFI (band) Chicago, Illinois Wicked (musical) The Dillinger Escape Plan King Crimson Music of Ireland Muddy Waters Blood on the Tracks Disc jockey Beyond Shadows History of the Beatles Satchel Paige Fleetwood Mac Good Morning, Vietnam The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Interstate 94 Sharon Tate Elgin, Illinois Laci Peterson Wrexham Depeche Mode The Ashlee Simpson Show Derby County F.C.
