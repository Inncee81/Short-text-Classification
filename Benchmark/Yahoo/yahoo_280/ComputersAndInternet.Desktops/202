my computer restarts for no apparent reason my computer restarts for no apparent reason mostly when i try to run some software such as photoshop and other times randomly sometimes when it restarts it will keep going nonstop before windows even starts up it restarts in safe mode and once in a while when it's starting up it gives me a message saying i should insert a cd and press r to fix or something sorry i don't remember the message exactly i received a few errors here are some of them stop x e xc x bf xf d a x stop x e xc x aeb xaa b x x e x f x e f x e ef x stop x e x x x x yeah sounds like corrupted ram the easiest way to experiment with this is if you're using multiple sticks of ram to take out each stick and just try one by itself try different ram slots too as the slot itself can also become corrupted if that fails to work as well just run memtest see source for link it works rather like installing windows xp and can be booted off a floppy or i believe i'm not a blank cd r all in all it sounds like you're just going to have to invest in a new stick or two of ram Blue screen of death Windows 2000 Booting Redundant array of independent disks Linux Commodore 64 Computer virus AmigaOS Atari 8-bit family Floppy disk Apple II family Windows XP Atari ST Software bug Acorn Electron USB flash drive Virtual memory Embedded system Backup Knoppix ZX Spectrum Amiga Nintendo Entertainment System Emacs Ethernet Apple Macintosh Apple IIGS Commodore 128 Debugging IBM PC compatible Microsoft Windows RISC Hard disk Windows Server 2003 Kernel (computer science) Opera (web browser) Slot machine Mach kernel Common Unix Printing System History of Microsoft Windows SAM Coup__ Personal computer MSX IA-32 Modem System 7 (Macintosh) Original Amiga chipset IBM PC DOS Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Freenet DR-DOS A600 System/34 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis BBC Master Architecture of Windows 2000 IPod NeXT Final Fantasy (video game) Library (computer science) Dance Dance Revolution TRS-80 Color Computer Laptop MDAC LiveCD Windows Mobile Federal Standard 1037C Bootable business card Motorola 68000 NX bit Windows 3.x Amstrad CPC Public-key cryptography Monkey Island Computer forensics Sega Dreamcast Blaster worm Apollo Guidance Computer Apple Computer Game programmer PlayStation 3 Btrieve DragonFly BSD Sound Blaster PaX Secure Digital card MS-DOS IMac Cheating in Counter-Strike TRS-80 One-time pad Palm OS Page table Pretty Good Privacy History of the graphical user interface CPU design
