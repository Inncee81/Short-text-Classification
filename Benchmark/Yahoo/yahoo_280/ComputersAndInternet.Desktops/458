reformated and it keeps crashing obviously i'm on a different computer i went to clean my computer with dust cleaner for electronics i removed my ati pro to clean the fan blades i put it back in it wasn't seated correctly i removed it and reseated it the prongs weren't correctly hitting the pci e firmly now my computer reads nothing i managed to get some windows updates but when i go to download service pack and others it just crashes i own registry mechanic i have defragged i took the card out and defaulted to the integrated graphics that came with this my power supply is fine its a enermax i can do some things but it didn't fully restore my gigs of saved stuff tho it saved some of it i can get on the internet but things aren't loading or displaying right my java is fine i run no scripts on firefox this is a new computer it handles oblivion just fine i built it myself it's not old yes it was a full system restore i'm beginning to think i i fried my card but when i revert to the old settings the integrated graphics it still crashes i saved all the updates on disk i went and ran it with just the integrated graphics ati it's still crashing trend micro panda and ad adware have come up with nothing arghhhhhhhhhhhhhh yes it reads the pro as the primary device first off it's possible that you damaged your motherboard by powering up the system when the video card was not seated correctly assuming this isn't the case and your mobo is okay when you went back to the integrated video did you remove the drivers for your ati in the device manager does it detect the correct video card hardware in the display properties does it show the right video hardware and driver software to go with it did you update the driver software that goes with your integrated video i'm thinking there might be a mismatch between the video drivers that are currently loaded on your system and the integrated video on your motherboard try to make sure everything is consistent and i'd remove the old ati drivers just to be certain Windows XP Windows 2000 ATI Technologies Windows Vista Radeon Floppy disk Commodore 64 AmigaOS NVIDIA IBM PC compatible OpenGL X Window System Debugging History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows ZX Spectrum Spyware Nintendo Entertainment System Computer and video games Hard disk Apple IIGS Blue screen of death IPod Computer hardware Redundant array of independent disks GeForce 6 Series 3dfx Atari 8-bit family BIOS Graphics processing unit Knoppix Computer virus Atari ST Architecture of Windows 2000 PlayStation Portable Mac OS X Amiga USB flash drive Computer forensics Server Virtual memory Counter-Strike CPU cache Power Macintosh G3 Sega Dreamcast Computer System 7 (Macintosh) Nintendo GameCube MDAC Sound card Computer bus PlayStation 2 Xbox Kernel (computer science) TRS-80 Color Computer Embedded system TRS-80 Linux kernel Graphics card Device driver Common Unix Printing System Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer security DOS Mouse (computing) File system Screenshot Apple Macintosh Patch (computing) Motherboard ITunes Ethernet CPU design Apple Computer Visual Basic Digital rights management Amstrad CPC Modem Database Java programming language Commodore 128 PlayStation 3 Nintendo Microprocessor Windows registry NX bit Windows Me OpenBSD History of operating systems Computer software Anti-virus software
