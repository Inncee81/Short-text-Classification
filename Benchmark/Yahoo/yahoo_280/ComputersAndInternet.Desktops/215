who invented the computer back in world war ii computer was a job title for people mostly women it turns out who were good with math their job was to do tons of arithmetic that was needed for calculating trajectories for cannons and bombs for coding and decoding secret messages and also for doing simulations of what became the atomic bomb the first mechanical computer might have been the z adder built from spare telephone circuits by a german engineer named conrad zuse it was used to guide glide bombs most early applications of technology not just computers seem to have involved warfare most folks though think the eniac is the real forerunner of what became the modern computer it was built in the s for the u s army and was used mainly to calculate ballistic trajectories the eniac was built by a team including engineer j presper eckert physicist john mauchly u s army captain herman h goldstine and mathematician john von neumann Computer Von Neumann architecture Central processing unit Electrical engineering J.
