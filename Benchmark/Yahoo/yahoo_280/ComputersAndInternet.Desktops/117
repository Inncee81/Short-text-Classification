two pc questions can anyone recommend a quality x agp graphics card how do you know when it's time to upgrade your sound card hello i'll answer the second question first it's time to upgrade your sound card when you hear a funny sound coming from it like i did with mine my cooling fan was shot on my now ancient nvidia tnt video card with a whopping mb vram if you've got a amd based system ati may work better because they're basically owned by amd it's one company now another reason your pc is at the edge of the minimum qualifications for running a game you like i had an older dell dimension and i replaced it with a nividia geforce xt x agp card still not a screaming card by then or now standards but being a decent average user card it had only cost me and breathed new life into my system and extended its' lifespan it was a lot cheaper than buying a new piece of crap pc out of walmart with integrated video and shared ram the first question would depend on the system you currently have but any of nvidia or ati's agp cards in that area would be fine i think the x cards are backward compatible but don't take that as gospel as long as it says it's x compatible you won't be wasting your money my ghz p processor machine was faster than many of the newer bargain basement pc's coming out at twice that speed because of the ram and agp card i had installed the least important of the three things that'll slow a system down is the cpu most important i feel is the video card with it's own video ram http www newegg com product productlist aspx submit ene depa description x agp card by the way that's a link to a very good price on a decent card i hope this helped marcos Radeon 3dfx PlayStation 3 IMac AMD Personal computer GeForce 4 PC motherboard GeForce FX Overclocking Apple Macintosh Atari ST Xbox Graphics processing unit VIA Technologies Windows Vista Doom 3 Windows XP Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore 64 Power Macintosh G3 Graphics card Sega Saturn Timeline of computing 1990-forward Counter-Strike Xbox 360 Computer bus PowerPC DDR2 SDRAM TRS-80 Color Computer History of Microsoft Windows Far Cry Accelerated Graphics Port PowerBook Commodore 128 GeForce 2 Amstrad CPC Computer PlayStation 2 Pentium 4 IBM PC Apple II family Apple IIGS Laptop Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic MSX Sega Dreamcast Windows 2000 NForce2 Mac OS X GeForce 7 Series PCI Express Opteron Microprocessor Computer workstation Windows 3.x Mainframe computer ZX Spectrum Nintendo Northbridge (computing) Nintendo Entertainment System OpenGL Radeon X Series Microsoft Windows Linux Super Nintendo Entertainment System 64-bit GeForce 3 Commodore International Floppy disk Mac mini PC Engine RISC Cyrix Supercomputer MAME Celeron SAM Coup__ Athlon GeForce 256 Wintel TRS-80 In The Groove (game) AMD64 IA-32 Acorn Computers
