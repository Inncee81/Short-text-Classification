how can i fix my parents' pc it's constantly doing cleanup work for hours mostly its in the evening but sometimes afternoon when it's doing it you can hear the hard drive ticking away in what i presume is it's cleanup reorganising proceedure and the system feels slower and it takes a long long time to complete whatever it's doing yet it does it so regularly my pc doesn't do it that frequently during it the task bar doesn't show any unusual processor resources activity cpu usuage can it be altered to do it's reorganising work less often and if so how please although a noisy hdd is sometimes a sign that it is one its way out and its time to back up the symptoms you describe sound more like a program or routine running in the background do you have anti virus and spyware software installed if so see if they are scheduled to run at this time might be doing a low level scan which would not necessarily show as high cpu activity also have a look to see what is running in the start up routine just in case you have something running in background go to start click on run type in msconfig click on the start up tab and have a look at the programs which are ticked if there are any that you do not need to have running all the time quicktime for instance untick them and ok it you will have to re boot to accept the changes when it re boots you will get a warning screen make sure you put a tick in the relevant box to indicate you don't want to see this warning in the future also once you have backed it up try defragging it and finally run error checker on it do this by going to my computer right clicking on the hard drive icon select properties choose the tools tab click check now on error checking i only suggest these two options last as i don't want you to mess with the drive too much until it is backed up if it is already backed up and safe try the last options first Windows XP Computer virus Virtual memory Spyware AmigaOS CPU cache Embedded system Extreme Programming Malware Mach kernel ZX Spectrum Linux Central processing unit Apple Macintosh Computer multitasking Amstrad CPC Apple IIGS Rootkit Computer Gmail Microprogram System/34 Commodore 128 Macromedia Flash Screenshot Software testing DragonFly BSD Atari 8-bit family Redundant array of independent disks NX bit Game programming MIPS architecture Hard disk Mouse (computing) Compiler optimization RISC Microsoft Windows Object Desktop System 7 (Macintosh) Mozilla Firefox Xerox Star Mac OS X IPod Anti-virus software PlayStation Portable PaX MAME Spell checker PDP-11 Data General Nova Digital circuit Knoppix Overclocking Laptop Personal computer PlayStation 3 Objective-C Jumpstart 3rd Grade IA-64 Vector processor Buffer overflow Java programming language Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis International Phonetic Alphabet CDC 6600 Commodore 64 Halting problem Antiretroviral drug Blue screen of death Sinclair ZX81 Master Control Program Kazaa NeXT Compiler The Amazing Race Stopping e-mail abuse Common Unix Printing System Diablo II: Lord of Destruction 64-bit Windows 3.x Garbage collection (computer science) Trusted computing Internet fraud USB flash drive Cache Python programming language Apollo Guidance Computer
