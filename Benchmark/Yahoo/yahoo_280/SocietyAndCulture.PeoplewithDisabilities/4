why do so many people use the disabled parking spaces when they don't need to my dad can't walk far and the spaces are often full of able bodied people my friend has a disabled child who she has to cope with on her own don't these people care that it might be them or one of their family one day did point it out one day to the 'trolley men' who used to tell people misusing them but they don't bother any more i also phoned the store manager asda who promised he would tell the men but nothing changed why can't they put a sticker on their cars asking them not to park there in future just to show them up i wouldn't assume people weren't disabled just because they didn't have a outward sign of disability but lot's of times it so obvious some people might use one and look quite abled but aren't people with early ms can look normal but get tired easily and need to use them so you can't always assume that these people are able bodied those that are abled though are just selfish i have a disabled mum who uses a wheel chair and a lot of the time all the disabled places are taken and we have to wait until one becomes available as she needs the extra space to get into her wheel chair some people just don't realise the inconvenience they are causing to disabled people and their friends and families when they take these spaces i hope my comment makes them think twice in future Social rule About a Boy Shopping cart Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.
