do disabled get hurt when people use words such as mong retard spaz spack ect btw i am not saying i use these words i am just wondering as people use them quite alot i would assume so i know in some cases when you're a close friend with someone it can be a joke between you my friend is totally blind and i call him blindy and he calls me eyes but i'd never let anyone else call him that it's because i know his comfort levels we've been friends our whole lives and he has a good attitude about his disability not everyone does i think people like to be known first and foremost as a person and not as a colour disability religion etc these words dehumanize and put the disability first that's mean Mental retardation Learning disability Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Cephalic disorder Evil Autism Deaf culture Political correctness Disability Social rule Homer Simpson Milton H.
