what if we made all parking lots handicapped accessible i mean able bodied people can use elevators and ramps so why not make all parking spaces big enough for wheelchairs walkers etc there are two types of accessible parking space spaces that are wider and have an access aisle next to them for lift access and wider spaces that are just designated for people with disabilities the problem is that parking lots are all very different and they had to find a rule that fits all best some people need parking that is closer and some people need parking that is wider and some people need both if you made all parking wider it would be fewer parking spaces and less income for the nearby business or for the city collecting parking fees what makes most sense is to make one aisle accessible with the farthest spots in the aisle wider people with power chairs don't need to be closer but they do need to be safe and if there was a specicif aisle with chairs people would know to be mre cautious driving in that aisle but that wouldn't work in tiny parking lots or strip malls and there would be people who use chairs that woud complain no solution please all Stairway Shopping mall Disability rights movement Elevator Parking Wheelchair Urban sprawl Hong Kong International Airport Passenger car Disability Accessibility Pacific, Missouri Hard disk Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Trailer Park Boys Bike lane debate United States House of Representatives New Urbanism Skateboarding trick Revco Street Combine (Half-Life 2) Redundant array of independent disks Don Mills (TTC) Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Universal design School bus Wayne Corporation RISC Train station Rosa Parks Mall of America Rest area Computer Professional wrestling throws Stave church Suburbs of Johannesburg Equine conformation Railroad car Space elevator Chinglish Docklands Light Railway Aberdeen Ocean's Twelve Extreme Programming Ontological argument Wood carving Sport utility vehicle Disneyland Skiing Sento Crane (machine) Bicycle helmet Golf Tennis Star Destroyer Sears Holdings Corporation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Autorack Long Path Recurring South Park characters Cathedral architecture Whistler-Blackcomb Paragliding Yosemite National Park Milton H.
