i am wanting to know a bit more about kenpo and kuk sool won also any personal experiences me and my wife have been looking and trying our best to decide a martial art to join so when our son gets older he can learn an art cause lets face it this world is goin to hell no offence to anybody but still we have a choice between kuk sool won and kenpo we are leaning more towards kenpo but kuk sool won is still a choice for us so any info for personal experience is greatly welcomed firstly it is important to understand that kuk sool won refers to a specific system of korean martial arts that incorporates elements from several traditional korean arts it includes strikes kicks grappling throws weapons joint locks acrobatics and more kenpo kempo is a bit more generic term referring to a wide variety of styles that can range from the very rigid structural composition of karate to the fluid transitional character of some styles of kung fu some styles of kenpo may incorporate grappling throws takedowns pressure points joint locks and weapons while others may not some may employ high kicks while others may not the point is that it is important to identify the style of kenpo and its characteristics before trying to make a decision between kenpo and kuk sool won kuk sool won has a lot to offer as does kenpo both can develop solid self defense methods though i imagine your kenpo school will place a greater emphasis on this visit the schools talk to not just the instructors but students and parents as well be sure to observe both beginners and high ranks to see what they are doing and how they train in the end it often boils down to which school instructor and then style you are most comfortable with p s i love kenpo and think that everyone should study it at some point but that's just me Kenpo Jujutsu Aikido Kuk Sool Won Mixed martial arts Taekwondo Hapkido American Kenpo Eagle Claw Chinese martial arts Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Judo Korean martial arts Eskrima Grappling Kung fu Wing Chun Wushu Kajukenbo Shorinji kenpo Jeet Kune Do Korean swords Professional wrestling holds Goju Ryu Kickboxing Bruce Lee Choy Lee Fut Nunchaku Amateur wrestling Education Royce Gracie Xingyiquan Kalarippayattu Tekken characters Phase (matter) Muay Thai Music Qigong Lightsaber combat Welding Association for Renaissance Martial Arts MapleStory Fist of the North Star A Course In Miracles Genseiryu Steven Barnes McDojo Professional wrestling throws Shaolin (martial arts) Chinese language Economics Capoeira Graduate school Social psychology Kumite Cantonese opera Kata (martial arts) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Hong Kong Kyokushin RuneScape Tide Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Weapon The Book of Five Rings Explosive material Sonata form Parachuting Hung Gar Ed Parker Education in the United States Baguazhang Pump It Up Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Homeschooling Wu style T'ai Chi Ch'uan Natural Selection (computer game) Frank Mir Miyamoto Musashi Dojo Kung Fu Hustle Past teachings of Prem Rawat Uechi Ryu Information warfare Free will Theory of conduct Korean language Black belt (martial arts) Boxing Hong Kong action cinema
