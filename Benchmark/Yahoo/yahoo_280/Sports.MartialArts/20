martial arts types what is the most realistic martial art that could be used as self defense is a real world situation in a nutshell any system or style that teaches with a real world application it'll take some hunting for you to find what you are looking for because no one style that is taught will have the same approach hypothetical example a tkd school in one city will not have the same feel and approach as in another the instructors are different and may apply what they know in a different direction some schools teach for money and sport while other are training for combat it's really up to the instructor i've met some very capable and smart tkd instructors and i've met some pompous and pathetic bjj and mma instructors who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag with a scalpel summary look to the reputation of the school and to the training philosophies of the instructors if they practice real world situations from weapons to empty hand to ground work and deal with multiple attackers and gang mentality then you're on the right track i hope this is helpful for you mabuay ang inayan eskrima Martial art Eskrima Mixed martial arts Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Tai Chi Chuan Chinese martial arts Taekwondo Grappling Jeet Kune Do Krav Maga Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Judo Graduate school Wing Chun Musical Instrument Digital Interface Eagle Claw Kung fu McDojo Kung Fu Hustle Vovinam Bruce Lee AMOK!
