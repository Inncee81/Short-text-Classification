krav maga has anyone does a course in this self defence strategy and if so what was it like im an unfit year old female with an unfit year old partner are we the right candidates for this type of caper i took it for about months if you're unfit it'll make you fit they focus on conditioning as of all martial arts with good instructors they'll push you to your limit and set realistic goals for the individual its more a system of self defense than a combat sport it borrows many techniques from other arts like judo brazilian jiujitsu muay thai boxing etc im not saying that you cant defend yourself with say muay thai on the streets you most definitely can its just krav maga places more emphasis on certain scenarios that you'll encounter on the streets such as someone grabbing you from behind with a choke hold or someone putting you in a bear hug tons of things the goal of krav maga is to get you out of a situation alive using anything from punching kicking grappling to groin kicks eye gouges etc the good thing about many krav maga techniques is that it uses the body's natural reflexes making moves easier to learn when i was in it we did a lot of situps and push ups and worked a lot on focus mitts heavy bag then we'd do some specifically self defense techniques such as weapon disarming and getting out of holds etc the problem with krav maga is that its getting pretty commercialized therefore many people are opening up krav maga gyms in which the training is not so great for a quick profit if you have a good instructor i say go for it i dont think it'll be anything you cant do if you are willing to stick with it after a lil while you should be in good shape Jujutsu Eskrima Aikido Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Judo Chinese martial arts Taekwondo Tai Chi Chuan Grappling Bruce Lee Professional wrestling holds Wing Chun Kickboxing Ultimate Fighting Championship Boxing Wushu Piccolo Junior Saga Kajukenbo Karate Skateboarding trick Self-defense Computer and video game genres Vovinam Shoe Weight training Double Dragon Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Naruto jutsu Professional wrestling match types Royce Gracie Professional wrestling throws Shoot boxing Punch (strike) Baseball Professional wrestling attacks Fuzion Jeet Kune Do Tank Strike (attack) Glossary of climbing terms Star Trek Customizable Card Game Glossary of partner dance terms Table tennis Lightsaber combat Airsoft Kyokugenryu Karate Glossary of American football Fast bowling M16 (rifle) Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Chokehold Vale tudo First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Water polo Norway national football team Chess strategy and tactics Society for Creative Anachronism Characters of Naruto Neuro-linguistic programming Miyamoto Musashi Rugby league Guilty Gear Tenshinhan Trench warfare Rugby union positions Alexander Technique Kung Fu Hustle Theory of conduct Korean martial arts The Contender (television series) Sport Volleyball Xingyiquan Amateur wrestling Strategic management Swingout Welterweight Palmach Kata (martial arts) Batting (cricket) Blitzkrieg Sambo (martial art) Requirements analysis Capoeira Battle of the Bulge Muay Boran Fighting game Professional wrestling Shotgun
