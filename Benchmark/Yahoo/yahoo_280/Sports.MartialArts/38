ohboyyuhm shyissue i joined karate a while back and am like naturaly shy where i can remember all the steps and stuff in the form but they are just not aggressive enough and the yells not loud or powerful how do i get past this practicing any ideas helppp iknow yell louder but how in the world do you practice this you need to commit yourself to it don't think of it as a form that you're doing and don't think about the fact that your in a class with others instead think that you are in a dojo and you are training in a combat art you are learning to defend yourself and damage others everytime you punch in your form make your gi snap everytime you yell let it out with conviction it doesn't have to be long and it doesn't have to make anyone's ears bleed but you can certainly yell and let out the energy that you have you need to essentially just decide that you aren't going to be shy when it comes to your training and your art and give it your all i hope that helps Aikido Martial art The Karate Kid, Part III Sin City YuYu Hakusho Karate Shotokan Punch (strike) Piccolo Junior Saga Yuri Sakazaki Kata (martial arts) Mixed martial arts Son Gohan Vegeta Akuma (Street Fighter) Wing Chun Social rule Theory of conduct Judo Hapkido Lightsaber combat Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Ninja Buddy Guy The Inside Survivor (novel) Kyokushin Kumite Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Invisibles Dog training Jujutsu Ranma __ characters Galactic Civilizations Genseiryu Professional wrestling attacks Kodocha Miyamoto Musashi Fecal incontinence Texas A&M University Tai Chi Chuan Goju Ryu The Karate Kid Nunchaku Force (Star Wars) Robert Garcia Kung Fu Hustle Diving Good Times Dojo One Piece minor characters Russian joke Avenue Q Philosophical skepticism John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Taekwondo Tag Anko Itosu Esperanto as an international language Muay Thai Xiaolin Showdown Shit Theodicy Time Out of Mind Teen Girl Squad Traumatic incident reduction First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Great Teacher Onizuka Montreal Screwjob Chinese martial arts Ryo Sakazaki Takuma Sakazaki Geese Howard Reservoir Dogs Characters in Bleach series Yoga Sutras of Patanjali King Piccolo Saga Stuttering Saved by the Bell Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Fighting Spirit Texas Revolution Eskrima The Marshall Mathers LP Aerial (dance move) First Battle of the Atlantic Tenshinhan Jin Kazama The Star Wars Holiday Special Decibel Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Leon White Michel Henry Greg Valentine Shoot boxing Ultraman Leo Milton H.
