am i the only one who thinks mma is way overated seriously these guys are not pure athletes none of them would make it in any other sport most of them are upper twentys to yr old men who are still trying to prove they are tough the crowds at these events are such white trash they boo every fighter that comes out except in japan every ppv i have seen i never see a good fight im talking about a good high action competetive fight also ive noticed that these fighters dont get paid shit yet they all say they have a lot of boxing experience if that was true wouldnt they box instead this sport to me is an overated bar fight nothing more not to mention it seems that the entire sport is on steroids besides anyone who watch's half naked men wrestle is probably gay what do you guys think is this sport way overated to answer some of your comments dustin b let me add that chuck liddel was paid k for his last fight with rampage he is face of the sport meanwhile ricky hatten will make somewhere around mill his next fight and most americans can give a shit about him see the difference as for steroids well royce gracie mma legend was caught with steroids phil baroni was caught with roids and he was very obviously on roids his entire career and is just now getting caught sherk and the guy he fought for the belt both were caught for roids and thats just within the past few weeks as for athletes go you trying to tell me tim sylvia who ran the hvyweight division is athletic and i dont consider baseball players pure athletes either so are you comparing tim to an offensive lineman first off tim is no athlete and if you are trying to make that arguement you are nuts he just lost to a yr old man too offensive lineman are between and pounds and are going against the most athletic big men in the world so i dont see your comparison as the mma just booming that has nothing to do with fighters pay ufc makes assloads of money and they dont pay their fighters shit most of the guys you see get between to thou a fight as for the steroid thing i mentioned names in mma who are among the top known fighters in the sport and thought of as some of the best if mma seriously tested phil baroni would of been tested positive years ago he has always been on roids should i add wvandlei to that list too of known fighters who roid there is an obvious difference between someone on roids and someone not on roids and yes i do consider men in tights with their legs around each other real gay tone a mma fighter can compete in boxing because in boxing you lose all respect when you quit also boxers dont have the luxary of laying around on the ground which many mma fighters do while they catch their breath plus boxing has one of the best drug testing programs and in boxing you actually have to have to be able to take pain theres no count in mma and if your in a hold you can quit basketball is tougher than mma yawn i've heard all this crap before thanks for putting it all together at once a baseball player would never make it in football does that mean he's not an athlete if you really think gsp isn't an athlete you're kidding youself crowds go to philly and tell me that they're a nice clean crowd no sport has super respecting crowds huerta vs garcia wasn't a high action competitive fight watch pro wrestling if you want more k a fight is shit how much do you make they don't all say they have alot of boxing experience the sport is still growing and no fighter has complained about his salary in the ufc if it's just a bar fight than anyone can do it right then why do some people win more than others steroids huh everyone on the planet is roiding i suppose i've said it before and i'll say it again if you're so immature that you think one guy punching another in the face is gay that's your problem you should try not making things up if you want to be taken seriously Martial art Ultimate Fighting Championship Royce Gracie American football New York Giants Boxing World
