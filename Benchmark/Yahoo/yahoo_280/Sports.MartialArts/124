how is the winner determined in a wushu competition at the olympics china will be holding a wushu tournament and i was wondering how this style of martial arts works i have seen karate taekwondo and judo tournaments but never wushu the performance will be based on three scores a b and c the a score overall performance is points of the b score is quality of movement and is points of the c score is called nandu level of difficulty and involves the artist following a prescribed set of difficult movements mostly jumps and variations of landings though there are others as well each with a set amount oof points depending on whether or not it is followed my a connecting move ex jumping inside cresecent kick to horse stance mabu or into the splits into the splits will give you more points thus is greater nandu when you register for a tournament you send in a form showing the order all of your nandu will be performed in and the possible points each nandu will bring you totalling up to points any more is not nandu points but quality of movement and overall performance and you must follow it or risk large deductions most nandu is between and depending on how you connect moves together not all athletes start with nandu possible i have teammates that start with possible meaning you can't get a perfect but no one ever does anyway even china's all around champion and they work their a and b scores more nandu is very tiring so it's better to keep good form and not risk blowing a jump which can result in up to a fall depending on how badly you blow it and how many nandu points you miss by not performing it these scores are only for longfist changquan and southernfist staff and spear broadsword and straightsword most other open division weapons in wushu are not judged with nanu in fact weapons in general are not usually judged with nandu at this point in the us in the future they may be required to have nandu in all forms generally it's only handforms non weapon that have required nandu whether or not this changes depends very much on what the chinese wushu federation decides to make its international standard i hope this helps it's late and i'm really tired so i'm maybe not as clear as i'd like to be though cheers please enjoy wushu and support them at the beijing games where it will debut as a demo sport Tai Chi Chuan Karate Taekwondo Mixed martial arts Chinese martial arts Jet Li Volleyball Dog agility Judo Football (soccer) Diving Boxing Sumo Aikido Skateboarding trick Yelena Davydova Norway national football team Dressage Table tennis Tennis Summer Olympic Games Nanquan Rugby union Ultimate (sport) Mahjong Quizbowl Sport Quake III Arena Eagle Claw Trampolining Fencing Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Basketball Paintball Society for Creative Anachronism Softball International League Korean martial arts Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Fast bowling Figure skating Xiangqi Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Professional wrestling attacks Playoff Equine conformation Olympic Games Billiards New York Giants Rock, Paper, Scissors Swingout 2004 Summer Olympics Kurt Angle Poker jargon Go ranks and ratings Cheerleading EXpanded MultiPlayer Water polo DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Show jumping Rugby union positions National Football League 1957 World Series Glossary of American football Martial arts film Professional wrestling throws Kyokugenryu Karate Australia national football team 2000 Summer Olympics Competition Asian Cup 2004 Hearts (game) Tag Aerial (dance move) Sudden death Bubble Bobble Snooker National Hockey League All-Star Game CPU cache Chinese language Compiler optimization Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Peter Shilton World Chess Championship $ale of the Century
