is it possible to become good at styles of fighting in months i have a small boxing background now i am trying to incorporate in order first to last tae kwon do aikido ju jitsu mauy thai kali into my arsonal if i train months on each style is it possible to take away what i need from each one then make the transition into training one on one with a mma sparring partner if not how long should i train each one minimum time until i can be good and remember what i learned and know egnough to consider myself rounded in that style with all do respect to all martial systems tae kwon do is not going to help much if you want to fight mixed style mma if you seach around or talk to many fighters in different styles you will find a common opinion that tae kwon do is not for close contact fighting though i repect the art and wish like hell i could spinning kick like some of those guys it won't be much use to you in close quarters fighting it's an art developed to knock riders off of their horses by kicking them during a suprise attack muay thai should be your kicking style add some sanda kicks if you can find someone to teach you similar to mauy thai but faster and not quite aspowerful generally but the muay thai leg is the one to use months in each style is not nearly enough unless you are living and training hours a day for that period even then you will not absorb the system in any real depth i have tried to do exactly what you are hoping to do it doesn't work even when you are living and breathing it new movements take a month at least before they become comfortable and natural and a year before they are second nature i know this varies person to person but i am what i would consider and people i train with and teach as well to be a gifted martial artist months a system is not enough forget aidkido that's against the philosophy of the art the 'do' means it's a system of harmony for study jitsu or jutsu means it's for application juijitsu muay thai and kali or escrima if you can find it will be the three to focus on for ground fighting grappling stand up boxing long range and hand work if you have months do months of each like the guy posting before me said together is better than one after another and then spar and apply with a partner i would even suggest more jiujitsu and mau thai together and a little kali once your foundation in those is laid you will pick it up faster after becoming fluent in jiujitsu's grappling styles especially if you already have some boxing behind you which will help muah thai tremendously i applaud your energy vision and will remember though the focus is what will make you great not a little bit of many styles my teacher and si gung teacher's teacher say this is the problem with westerners they want to do everything si gung says do one thing well and no one will stop you jiayo good luck brother Chinese martial arts Karate Jeet Kune Do Bruce Lee Ultimate Fighting Championship Hapkido Kickboxing Punch (strike) Grappling Tenshinhan Wushu Professional wrestling holds Tai Chi Chuan Piccolo Junior Saga Equine conformation Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Social rule Goju Ryu Royce Gracie Eagle Claw Kung fu Kyokugenryu Karate Wing Chun Eternal Champions Kata (martial arts) Tekken characters Wanderlei Silva Kick Judo A Course In Miracles Massage Xingyiquan Frank Mir Dragon Kung Fu Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Japanese tea ceremony Glossary of partner dance terms Sport Double Dragon Boxing Thai language Vale tudo Music K-1 Akuma (Street Fighter) Blood (computer game) The Star Wars Holiday Special Mobile Fighter G Gundam Breaststroke Professional wrestling attacks Horse Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Lightsaber combat Choy Lee Fut Meditation Ragnarok Online Asperger syndrome Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sub-Zero Theory of conduct The Book of Five Rings Vegeta Wassily Kandinsky The Contender (television series) Jiddu Krishnamurti Aerial (dance move) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Dragon Booster Swingout Negima Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Education in the People's Republic of China Tank Education Butterfly stroke Mao (game) Kalarippayattu Reiki Buddhism in the United States Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Force (Star Wars) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Dog agility
