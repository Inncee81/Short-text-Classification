what is better ninja gaiden for ps halo for xbox or pokemon battle revolution for wii im either gonna get a wii a x box or a ps for my bday what should i get i want these exclusives but what is best when you consider the fact that the ps has very vew exclusives due to the poor sales you can almost be sure that ninja gaiden will find its way to the other consoles one way or the other and since the wii is the cheapest console of them all wish for the xbox you not only have the chance to play halo but try out the other brilliant exclusives like crackdown or dead rising and not to forget gears of war furthermore you will get a console that is able to play mp s from your pc and if you play a game during that time the xbox automatically mutes the game's music but keeps the sound effects and you can play high definition movies from your pc on the xbox without needing to get a hd dvd or blue ray drive and finally although the live gold membership costs money it is the best online multiplayer experience i ever had Action Replay Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen 2000 Summer Olympics GameShark Game Genie Australian rules football Hot Coffee mod History of rugby league Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness GoldenEye 007 Animal Crossing Pok__mon (anime) Sydney Swans New South Wales Rugby League Touch football (rugby league) Pok__mon Missingno.
