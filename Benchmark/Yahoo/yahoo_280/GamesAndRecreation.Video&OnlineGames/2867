simcity snes brownout so i had a brownout on the game for snes and it said i needed to get a new power plant so i deleted my current one but it won't let me get a new one and the block for it is faded on the menu thing how do i get a new one deleting your existing powerplant made the problem worse instead you should have tried building an additional plant i would also assume that the reason you are unable to build another one is because you don't have enough money Homebrew (video games) PlayStation Portable Verizon Wireless Modchip GBA Movie Player Universal Media Disc Nintendo DS GamePark Regional lockout Sega Dreamcast Open Firmware MIPS Magnum Game Boy Advance Game Boy Acorn Electron MSX Rockbox Neuros GP2X Embedded system Copy protection Patch (computing) FairPlay Sound Blaster Creative Nomad Xbox Software testing BIOS Homebrewing Extensible Firmware Interface ITunes Music Store Colecovision Treo 650 Graphics card Preboot Execution Environment Nuon Iriver WRT54G Action Replay New World ROM Read-only memory Peripheral Component Interconnect Easter egg (virtual) History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Steve Howe (guitarist) Phantasy Star Online Samba de Amigo Computer role-playing game Computer hardware Vorbis Amstrad CPC Xbox Live IBM PC compatible Power Mac G5 Old World ROM Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution IPod Colossal Cave Adventure Power Macintosh G3 GD-ROM Motorola RAZR V3 IEEE 802.11i Canon EOS-300D Asteroids Minesweeper (computer game) Sonic Crackers DVD Copy Control Association Over-the-air programming Musical Instrument Digital Interface SAM Coup__ Clan (computer gaming) ZigBee Scrolling shooter PlayStation 2 Interactive fiction Prince of Persia Flash memory Atari 2600 Wipeout (game) File Allocation Table Nintendo GameCube KIM-1 Advanced Audio Coding Console emulator Coded Arms Warcraft II Dance Dance Revolution KONAMIX Scrabble Exidy Sorcerer Microprogram Versions and ports of Doom Configuration management Sid Meier's SimGolf Apple Intel transition Debugging SmartMedia Counter-Strike Steam (content delivery) Creative Zen Intellivision
