death knight wow so i heard you have to do a quest at a certain lvl to become one but is there a required class you have to be ex warrior in order to do the quest i ask because im a lock this is the information i could come up with check source for article q how will the death knight class fit into the game a the death knight combines martial prowess with dark necromantic energies players might be familiar with the death knight from previously released warcraft games most recently in the campaigns for warcraft iii reign of chaos and the frozen throne expansion the former paladin arthas became a death knight and wreaked havoc across azeroth and northrend before fusing with the spirit of ner'zhul to become the lich king the death knight is the first hero class in world of warcraft once certain criteria are met players will unlock the ability to create a new death knight character which will begin play at a high experience level we're currently exploring various options for how the death knight will play and the types of abilities at its disposal and we'll be revealing more information about this new class as we get further along in development q will the death knight have any abilities from previously released warcraft games a the way we portrayed death knights in past warcraft games is certainly a source of inspiration but we are still determining how best to capture that feel within the mechanics of world of warcraft and haven't made any final determinations on specific abilities q what role will the death knight play in groups and raids a in general terms the death knight can be considered a type of class that combines damage dealing and tanking but naturally it will have an array of unique abilities as well q what races will be allowed to play death knights a we haven't yet made a final determination about which races can be death knights however the class will be available to both the alliance and the horde q will there be additional hero classes in the future a yes we do intend to add more hero classes in the future but right now our focus is on the current expansion LOL (Internet slang) Internet slang Website Nintendo Power Pure Pwnage Halo: Combat Evolved The Damned Counter-Strike The Sims Petz Ultima Online Interactive fiction PONG MMORPG America Online Correspondence chess Bbc.co.uk MUD Funfair Neopets Video game controversy Where's Wally?
