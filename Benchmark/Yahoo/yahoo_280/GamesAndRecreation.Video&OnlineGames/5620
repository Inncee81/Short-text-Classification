grand theft auto i have been very dissapointed by liberty and vicecity stories and i am wondering will number be crap shoyuld i buy it gta is looking like it will be the best so far it just sucks it will be delayed but from what i understand they wanted to spend some more time on the new features including better pedestrian interaction and hit detection the problem is you bought liberty city and vice city stories which really arent even real gta titles both games are crappy ports of the original games gta and gta vc just made so they could sell try to sell more psps i have no idea why they ported them back to the ps i don't know how they thought they would get away with selling gimped versions of games that were already out and even if they were as good as the games they copied both have since been outshined by gta sa really there are only games you should be looking at as comparisons gta gta vice city and gta san andreas all of those games were excellent and gta will be better than those you can quote me on that The Sims The Sims 2: University The Sims 2 The Sims 2: Nightlife Normal distribution Urban sprawl Massively multiplayer online game CPU cache Land use forecasting Gaia Online Perfect Dark History of computer and video games Expert system SimCity SimCity 4 Network Switching Subsystem LOL (Internet slang) MMORPG Randomness Global System for Mobile Communications Don Daglow New Urbanism RISC Simulation Bish__jo game Wi-Fi The Sims Bustin' Out Computer RuneScape cheats Reference (computer science) RuneScape Random Events Final Fantasy XI RuneScape skills Simplified Chinese character Non-player character Virtual memory Library (computer science) George Lucas Combat flight simulator Sim Van der Ryn CPU design World of Warcraft Modified Newtonian dynamics The Sims Online Redundant array of independent disks Management information system Subscriber Identity Module Missingno.
