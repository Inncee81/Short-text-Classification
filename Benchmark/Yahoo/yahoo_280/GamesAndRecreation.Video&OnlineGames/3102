to become friends they must mutually add friend codes often obtained through online forums or chatrooms and will be authenticated as friends once both have gone online these measures mutual friend code exchange per game friend codes and the pairing of the friend code and system are said by nintendo to be conscious steps to preserve users' privacy if a ds game is sold but not the system there is no risk of the purchaser impersonating the seller similarly one cannot add a user to their friends list for the sole purpose of antagonizing the user online features enabled by becoming friends can

regular online multiplayer rivals still cannot chat with each other otherwise rivals connect and play like friends can although there is a rivals mode in mario kart ds this does not perform like the above instead the player is matched against players of similar skill level as determined by their progress through the game's single player modes the rivals list makes a return in custom robo arena
