sims seasons and nightlife best answer gets points hey i just got nightlife and i was wondering how do you give your date a gift if your playing with a guy seasons added the option of giving a gift your sim must have something in his inventory to give for example if you want to give your date a painting you must first put the painting in your sims inventory you can do that by clicking the icon that looks like a treasure chest at the bottom of the screen i think it's to the left of the mood bars then pick up the painting and pull it into the inventory screen and click again now when you click on his date there should be an option to give gift a screen will come up asking which item in his inventory you want to give her just click the one you want have fun Pai gow poker Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Prince of Persia Mortal Kombat Platform game Chess Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Shapur I of Persia George II of Great Britain Interactive fiction Ubisoft Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
