is world of warcraft worth to buy my boyfriend got hooked on world of warcraft not too long ago and he told me i should play it partially because he wants to play it with me but i was at the mac store this morning to fix my ipod and i wanted to buy a game for my mac i saw both versions of world of warcraft the burning crusade and the original but i didn't know whether to buy it or not i would buy both if i did so i got sims instead is it worth to buy yes its very much worth it its the only computer game i really like because its differant every time you play there is always something new to do if you buy it the burning crusade is the expansion pack and gives you new types of characters to play you need the base version to get the expansion to work though remember though there is a monthly pay to play charge but it is worth it because it pays to keep the servers up and maintained and very secure its a very fun game with lots of ways to make your charcacter your own just remember to take it in moderation Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen HyperText Transfer Protocol World Wide Web Missingno.
