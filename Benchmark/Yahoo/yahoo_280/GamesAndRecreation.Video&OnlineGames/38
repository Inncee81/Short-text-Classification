is persona really a limited time game okay i was thinking about buying persona i recenly heard a rumor that persona was only going to to be relaesed for a limited time and then once all the copies where gone there gone is this true there's way to answer this yes it is a limited time thing in that after a while they will stop making the game just like all games after so many months after the initial release companies will stop releasing the game because it won't make them any money no it's not a limited time thing in that atlus is only going to release so many copies before it stops making them i don't think atlus has any number in mind for many copies it's going to make it will probably continue to make copies of the game as long as gamers ask for it as a side note atlus don't really release that many copies of its games after a while it can become hard to find any games from atlus on the shelf Atlus Persona (video game) Copy protection Double Dragon Craps Megami Tensei Xbox Time Out of Mind Spice Girls I Want to Hold Your Hand Video game music Technos Japan Corporation Video game publisher Tactical role-playing game Hollywood Squares Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis World of Warcraft Monopoly (game) Computer and video games Grand Theft Auto III SCO-Linux controversies Avril Lavigne Sega 32X ROM image The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Banjo-Kazooie Nintendo Abandonware Jon Secada Betting (poker) Video game crash of 1983 Computer role-playing game Nippon Ichi Yu-Gi-Oh!
