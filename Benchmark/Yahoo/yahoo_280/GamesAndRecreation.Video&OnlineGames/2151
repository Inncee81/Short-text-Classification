should i start playing world of warcraft again i have a lot of spare time is it worth playing wow despite possible negative occurrences negatives would be addiction and neglect of schoolwork studying on a sidenote how many hours do you think you need to play to be considered addicted should you start playing again depends on why you quit in the first place are the reasons you had still relavant if you quit because it was affecting your outside life then you may not want to pick it up again if you quit because you needed to focus on school and you have since graduated then it may be ok as for your sidenote i don't use the term addicted in this case because it is not an addiction some people do play a bit too much for their own good but it is just a matter of getting them to stop there are no withdrawals or negative physical effects you cannot place an specific number of hours playing as being bad you can't say that playing in hour stretches is bad what matters if if the game interferes with the rest of your life if a person can play hours a day and still maintain his job and take care of himself he is fine if a guy plays hours a day and neglects too many other obligations he needs to quit Missingno.
