what is better ps or xbox aswear only if you have played both console ok i have played both i recommend the xbox first the pros for the ps the ps is currently the cheapest blue ray player but if you only want a gaming console and don't have a hd capeable tv disregard this reason the playstation network is currently free with subject to change in the future according to a sony interview thats it the cons of the ps its very expensive at the moment there are very few good games out for the console and due to the poor sales a lot of publishers try to make as few ps exclusives as possible this means a lot of games for ps will be on other consoles as well with the format war between hd dvd and blue ray the customer has fewer rights with his blue ray discs a strict copy protection can practically self destruct your ps if the ps is known to be compromised to read the content of a blueray in an illegal way the ps will play games no problem but according to the blue ray specs the ps must save a ban key in its memory if a disc requests a ban of the player thus preventing it to play future movies and already bought discs now to the xbox pro's graphics on par with the ps faster processing power according to benchmarks made on the link below yes the ps 's cell processor is more powerful in making scientific floating point math but these calculations are very seldom made in a gaming environment the xbox is a great media extender if connected to a network with a windows xp or vista pc you can even play mp s from your pc while you're playing a game the xbox mutes the game's music but you will still hear sound effects togehter with your music the multiplayer experience is the best i ever had on the ps you can only see the players of the game you're currently playing on the xbox you can play game a and your friend comes online playing game b he decides it's more fun to have you in the game and sends you a voice or instant message you can then join him playing in b the xbox has a lot of games to choose from a lot of games are not available on other consoles e g dead rising with the video marketplace you can download high definition movies and tv shows without needing to get a hd dvd or blue ray drive if you want hd discs you can get a hd dvd drive for the xbox this drive can also work on your pc you will not be region locked like on blue ray and hd dvd allows you to copy the film to watch on your handy or pda or other mobile devices it costs less than the ps with the elite or premium models you already get a cable to connect the xbox to a hdtv the cons only has a normal dvd drive multiplayer costs a monthly or yearly fee the hd dvd is also allowed to shut down your hd dvd drive should it become compromised by hackers to allow illegal copies so all in all get the xbox Pok__mon (anime) Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Legendary Pok__mon Jirachi Pok__mon Abilities Celebi Pok__mon Yellow Mewtwo Pok__mon: Jirachi Wishmaker Flygon Pok__mon Crystal Team Rocket Chuang Yi Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon Channel Registeel Kirlia Pok__ Ball Wailord Raichu Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Wailmer Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Pok__mon Colosseum Pok__mon types Pikachu Pichu Latios Max (Pok__mon) Mew (Pok__mon) Charmander Missingno.
