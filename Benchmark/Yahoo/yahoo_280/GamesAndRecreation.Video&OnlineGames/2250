the sims crashed i love the sims when i open it it says application is crashed the application will now terminate what's wrong in it it was very good before and i often to play it i've check the memory and the process but there's nothing wrong is there anyway to get it working again without re install it you could try uninstalling it it wont matter cause when you uninstall it it asks something like would you like to delete the saved stuff okay i dunno what it says but if you say you want to save stuff or not delete it or whatever the families still stay on there for when you reinstall it i hope that makes some sense to you Avatar (virtual reality) Cyberspace Neopets Second Life The Savage Empire Avatar (Ultima) Ultima VII Platform game Earth Girl Arjuna Carniv__le Ultima IV Leo Wyatt Gaia Online Furcadia Avatar: The Last Airbender Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Quake III Arena There Dark Phoenix Saga Adi Da MUD Virtual world Avatar MMORPG Ultima Underworld Ultima Sport Guardian (Ultima) Shit Social rule Star Ocean: The Second Story Stranger (Myst) Alan Moore Snow Crash City of Heroes Other ships (The Matrix) Ultima IX Democratic Underground Furry fandom Football (soccer) Hanuman Ayyavazhi theology Ultima X: Odyssey Lord British Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Amateurism I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Martian Dreams Theology Nephandi Bhakti .hack//Legend of the Twilight Bracelet Ultima VIII Kid Radd George Abbott Player character Virtual Realm Summon magic (Final Fantasy) Spider-Man GunZ The Duel Xbox Live Ayya Vaikundar Avatar (Stargate SG-1) Prayer Anthropomorphism Rail shooter OS-tan Abandonware Sonic the Hedgehog Smith (The Matrix) Chicago Cubs Cthulhu A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum LiveJournal Phoebe Halliwell Ultima VI Rugby union The Culture Wizards (film) Gautama Buddha Football ILOVEYOU Silent protagonist Jon Secada Doug Charmed EXpanded MultiPlayer Extreme Programming Knightmare Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Hip hop rivalries Super Mario 64 Rugrats Seattle Mariners Wipeout (game) 343 Guilty Spark EastEnders Syphon Filter Remix GunBound
