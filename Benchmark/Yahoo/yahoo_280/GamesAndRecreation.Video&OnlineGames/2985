world of warcraft questions how can i level up quicker in world of warcraft other then doing qwest what do talents do and how do they work how do i make money quick how do i get pets like cats can i buy them from a vender or what can i have any other kind of pet other then a cat scenes how i am a human mage i can have a cat even though i am human mage what venders can i buy an animal like a cat fromif i live is westfall i need a closer place then deadmines you could grind mobs or instance grind but doing quests is generally the fastest way to level my suggestion would be to kill everything as you do your quests instance grinding is when you just run instances over and over again ex deadmines and mob grinding is just killing every monster you come across upon reaching level you begin be given talent point for each level if you open up your talent trees for a mage there is arcane fire and frost you can spend these points in the talent areas to increase the benefit of a buff like arcane intellect or of a spell like frostbolt basically its just a way of making yourself more powerful and as you go further into the talent trees you can unlock new abilities like the water elemental in a mage's frost tree money can be made in many ways a pick up everything when you kill a mob take all the loot grey white green blue etc for the grey and white loot sell it to a vendor for green blue and purple you can sell them on a auction house in a major city however during lower leveled times any green gear you may get will be best if you just sell it to a vendor you can also take up enchanting and only level it to disenchant items and sell them on the auction house but leveling enchanting is expensive which leads to professions use your professions to create and sell items again try the auction house for money making i recommend mining and herbalism when lower leveled the items won't sell for much but once you're higher you can make a killing cats do you mean big or small if you play a hunter you can have a pet with you always that helps you in combat etc but if you mean a pet just as a critter to be a cute companion there are vendors everywhere there's the crazy cat lady in elwynn forest who sells cats of different sorts in deadmines theres a chance for a pet parrot and or a pet cat to drop in the wetlands the dragon whelps have a chance to drop a whelping pet same for the oozes but they drop oozlings and if you look around in major cities there's usually a pet vendor there are some quests that also reward pets yes you can have a pet but it'll be a non combat pet just one you purchase from a vendor who just looks cute as i said before remember you can only have pet out at a time if you really a combat pet as a mage if you spend talent points in the frost tree at level you will learn a new ability that will summon a water elemental to help you fight for seconds then he dies but thats as close to a pet as you can get i hope that all helps if you want to know more feel free to e mail me or send me an in game mail i play on the greymane server as alliance named dinah Xbox Wi-Fi Nintendo Xbox 360 Wireless Computer and video games Bluetooth Nintendo GameCube Electronic Arts Universal Serial Bus Xbox Live Voice over IP Hotspot (wifi) Quality of service Counter-Strike Wireless LAN ATI Technologies Game controller PlayStation 2 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Transmission Control Protocol Nintendo Revolution Sega Sega Dreamcast Apple Macintosh Halo (video game series) Monopoly (game) IGN General Post Office (United Kingdom) Modchip Console wars Centrino ZigBee EGovernment NVIDIA Radio Broadband Internet access Rare (video game company) Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Final Fantasy XI FIFA Series Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Video game music WiMAX Handheld game console Game Boy USB flash drive Game Critics Awards Ubisoft Action Replay Star Wars: Battlefront II Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection PlayStation 3 Stormfront Studios United States Postal Service Spam (electronic) Grand Haven, Michigan Grand Theft Auto III Game programming The Elder Scrolls Telephone Yu Suzuki Wireless community network Sweatshop Hyperinflation Remote control High fidelity E-mail Damn Small Linux Wal-Mart Surveillance Microsoft Computer role-playing game Robotech Microeconomics Code division multiple access The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Copyright Phantasy Star Online Dead or Alive (video game) America's Army Blinx: The Time Sweeper Unreal series J.
