is gamefly really good is there other video game rental's gamefly is crap compared to gottaplay com check out http gottaplay info for a free trial heres my review out of all the video game rental companies i reviewed this is the top company for renting games from the internet they have a huge stock of games available to rent and the thing that separates them from the competition is that they have shipping centers while gamefly only has the shipping centers are also spread across the u s so you can get the games easy no matter where you are located in the u s the only bad thing about this company is that they only the best for the u s if you live in the u s this is the company to rent games from if you do not try your luck elsewhere the reason why i was so impressed by this program is that they have the latest releases for playstation x box wii psp gamecube and nintendo ds i do not play all of those systems so there is no need for all of those games but sometimes i rent some games to play at my friend's house because he has a gamecube of all the video game rental companies i have seen this is by far the best rating Blaziken Blastoise Arcanine Charizard Pok__mon Red and Blue Pok__mon Crystal Pok__mon Abilities Mightyena Team Rocket Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Feraligatr Pok__mon Trading Card Game Sceptile Blue (Pok__mon) Legendary Pok__mon Raichu Latios Manectric Pok__mon (video games) Charmander Jynx (Pok__mon) Flareon Mewtwo Pok__mon Yellow Missingno.
