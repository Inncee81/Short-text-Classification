wondering about the pokemonline battle controls well i told you guys a little about the game itself but dont you wanna hear about the most important part poke battles ok so heres how it works you dont take direct control over your pokemon only time you do that is if your riding around like i do on rapidash or a garados in the water you give your pokemon commands and they have a interactive ui basically their own personality so my onix likes to play stealthy and try sneak attacks but my friend has a onix that stays out in the open and takes the frontal attack all pokemon develop different battle personalities they learn new moves as your train battle with them more you can keep one pokemon out of it's pokeball and it'll always follow you around lol this one time a beta tester named omega ron did'nt feed his skarmory and it ran away to find food lol so back to the battle system you give them commands lets say im using my onix my each number on my computer gives him a different order mine tackle burrow cont rockthrow vicegrip steeltail number six is a move he can only do from underground called skylauncher he comes from underground doing a strong tackle attack so you give them commands and they do them they dont just stand still during the fight either they'll be running around ducking behind a tree or a rock and stuff dont be like ask and have your charizard go to sleep on you lol you make the rules for your pokebattle v if you want and stuff if you enter a official tournament hosted by a gm there are certain rules though on friendly servers if you are battling person only you can fight them i like the agressive servers though because anyone can battle with everyone at any time one time i was training my fearow when pokethiefs i did'nt know attacked me my fearow was already tired but i made him do a gust and then got on rapidash and ran lol it's so much fun can't wait till the final game is released i'm still learnin more and more beta testing ftw http answers yahoo com question index ylt apr wrw vbwxhjywqack bsy ix qid aalesrs thats the st topic desribing the game this is even better than before you have got to tell me how i can play this game can you plz tell me how to become a beta tester my e mail is maxnvdm yahoo com Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling throws Contract bridge Burnout 3: Takedown Pools of Darkness Shadow Warrior Quake III Arena GunBound Table tennis Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Mario series enemies Super Mario Bros. 2 Castle of the Winds Animal Crossing Tetris Attack Combine (Half-Life 2) Global Liberation Army Age of Empires Crash test dummy Boss (video games) Final Fantasy magic Doom enemies Super Smash Bros.
