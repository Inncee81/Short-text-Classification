what's the best guild wars game normal nightfall or factions i want to get one of these games but i don't know which one to get please tell me which one i should get which one has more players and better items and overall a better game most folks will recommend either prophecies the first one or nightfall i enjoy factions but it is the shortest of the campaigns if you really enjoy the game you'll want to buy all anyways a lot of effective builds require skills from all campaigns but you can still enjoy the game with only campaign prophecies medievalish european like setting the first game longest nice variety of landscapes core professions factions asian setting shortest extra professions the assassin and ritualist nightfall african setting nice storyline extra professions the dervish and paragon the one thing about nightfall that make folks recommend it is heroes heroes are customizable computer characters that are attached to your character and can accompany you on quests and missions personally i'd start with prophecies my personal preference is always to start at the beginning although i actually bought and played factions first if you have a friend that's already playing then buy the campaign that they own so you can play with them ingame if you have more than game your characters can move freely between the games they all integrate well together into giant world Laptop ATI Technologies Radeon ThinkPad Pentium M PowerPC Mouse (computing) Nintendo Revolution Computer Apple Macintosh Floppy disk Microprocessor Xbox 360 PowerBook Secure Digital card Windows XP Random access memory Musical Instrument Digital Interface Apple Computer Hard disk HTTP cookie Mozilla Firefox Graphics card NVIDIA Texas Instruments Internet GeForce 6 Series Central processing unit Timeline of computing 1990-forward GeForce 4 64-bit Compact audio cassette Graphics processing unit World Wide Web PC Engine Best Buy CPU cache PlayStation Portable WordPerfect CPU design Cosmic Era Mobile Units Pentium 4 Magnetic core memory Battlefield 2 IBM PC compatible PlayStation 3 Athlon 64 Apollo Guidance Computer Python programming language Resource Description Framework BeOS GeForce 7 Series Quakecon Pentium D Notebook Web server Cell (microprocessor) MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Universal Serial Bus VIA Technologies Commodore International Federal Standard 1037C 3dfx Personal computer Server Apple Intel transition Web browser Uniform Resource Locator Sun Microsystems Computer numbering formats HyperText Transfer Protocol Apple II family Real-time strategy Computer role-playing game Unreal Tournament 2004 Kazaa Lithium ion battery Virtual memory PDP-8 Denial-of-service attack Digital Amstrad CPC MSN Messenger Exit number Cyrix Object Desktop IBM PC Mozilla Application Suite Website Stardock Virtual hosting Read-only memory Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 TRS-80 24-hour clock Desknote IP Multimedia Subsystem Retronym
