from the game kingdom hearts who makes a better pairing roxas with namine or roxas with olette why pffft neither p personally if i had to choose i'd say olette though roxas has much more of a connection with namine but many people are considering namine and roxas to be sort of a fake brother and sister p and i think olette is cuter im not gay xddd but i know someone who wouldn't even compare to namine or olette axel i consider them sort of a couple yaoi or not they are extremely close and if you haven't seen the new cutscene of them in kh fm then you should watch it its on youtube PlayStation Portable Handheld game console Game Boy IBM PC compatible Atari 2600 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo DS CPU cache PlayStation 3 Sony Computer Entertainment Nintendo Ink Color theory Traditional animation Mach kernel Objective-C GamePark Sony Battery (electricity) Tenchi Muyo!
