pokemon diamond combee well i no combee is in a tree but how many hours is it to get it please this is my last pokemon as i really want the national dex okay nub so you have to put honey in the tree but i suggest you put it in several trees and remember where you put it now right before you reach the tree you save before you click on it that way if combee doesnt come out then restart and try agian but if you want a female combee then you can do the same processes to find it i suggest that you put it in several trees because sometimes combee dont appear in that area so you can move on to another area that you put honey in a tree the wait is about hrs or you can wait over night for a pokemon to appear in the tree rememeber the larger the shaking the more rare the pokemon of if u have wireless or if you know how to use gts you could also trade for it well this should work good luck i hope you find one i found one overnight on both versions anyways good luck best answer Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
