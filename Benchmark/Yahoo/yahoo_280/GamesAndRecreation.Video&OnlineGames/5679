if i dropped my nintendo ds lite in the washing machine what are the chances it will still work it was in there while the water was filling up don't ask and was taken out before the washing cycle started i took apart as much as i could so it could drain and took out the battery do you think it will still work i've only had it a month and i'm totally sad if it doesnt work than you still have a day warranty when you bought your nintendo ds return your old one and get a new one if you dont have your receipt then mail your nintendo ds to nintendo and they will fix it for you to find the mailing address look on the back of the nintedno ds box Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon (video games) Missingno.
