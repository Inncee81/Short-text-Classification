what are the tokens good for on pogo games i see people with millions of tokens what can you do with them what's the point of getting them why should i want to get more for most of us that you see with those millions and millions of tokens it is more of a status thing and we dont cash them in and just keep collecting them because most don't feel they will win anything anyway but here is some things you can do with them if you like and hope this will answers some of your questions you can win tokens through a number of our games these tokens have no monetary value but can be converted into prize drawing tickets for pogo com's daily weekly or monthly prizes the more tokens you win in our games the more tickets you can enter in the drawings when you cash in if you're a club pogo member you can take your tokens to the mini mall and use them to get cool accessories of all kinds for your pogo mini pogo tokens cannot be used for game subscriptions premium badge albums guest passes or pogo merchandise most of the time when someone thinks too many tokens have been taken on cash in it's due to confusion about the conversion rate when you cash in your tokens each ticket you purchase to enter into the drawing costs tokens for example if you enter tickets into a drawing that will cost you tokens tickets tokens per ticket tokens once tokens are converted to tickets we have no way to retrieve them the tokens you win while playing our games are accumulated into one grand total so if you cash them in anywhere on our site then they are put into whichever drawing in which you entered them once that drawing has taken place the tickets are gone for good unfortunately you cannot transfer tokens between screen names if you have lots of tokens scattered about different accounts there's no way to combine them onto one member name if you're no longer going to use an old account that has tokens on it we suggest cashing in the tokens on the old account and putting them in a drawing that way the tokens will at least give you a chance to win something rather than just sitting there to access tokens on other screennames and cash them into a drawing sign in under the other name we don't disable accounts when you create a new one and enter those tickets into the drawing while you're there make sure your e mail address is correct and then you can switch back to the new name and play away either way you have a chance to win the prize if one of your tickets is entered into the drawing to switch screennames look for 'welcome screenname not screenname sign in' at the top of the pogo home page click the link and enter your old screenname and password Decepticon Starscream Megatron Octane (Transformers) Mini-Con Scorponok Trypticon Transformers: Armada Transformers: The Movie Grimlock Pretender (Transformers) Shockwave (Transformers) Beast Wars Cybertron Ark (Transformers) Autobot City Underbase Transformers (toyline) Unicron Transformers Universes Jetfire Ratbat Skywarp Thundercracker Alternators Galvatron Transformers series Autobot Matrix of Leadership Transformers: Cybertron Dinobots Transformers (comic) Megatron (Armada/Energon) Sideways (Transformers) Devastator (Transformers) Combaticon Soundwave (Transformers) Scourge (Transformers) Smokescreen (Transformers) Omega Supreme Thrust (Transformers) Seekers (Transformers) Nebulon Xiaolin Showdown Ratchet (Transformer) Battle of Autobot City Energon (Power Source) Ravage (Transformers) Transformers Technology Sin City Dirge (Transformers) Transformers: Robots in Disguise Hitman (computer game) Texas hold 'em Nightbeat (Transformers) Shen Gong Wu Thunderwing Dead Milkmen Seacon Fortress Maximus Code: Lyoko New York Giants Dawn of the Dead (2004 film) Star Saber Headmaster (Transformers) Stunticon Alone in the Dark (series) Damn Yankees Optimus Prime Matrix Quest Betting (poker) Blitzball Son Gohan Vegeta Insecticon Draw poker Blood (computer game) Rob Zombie Phranc Conker's Bad Fur Day Banjo-Tooie Rub__n Olivares H__ctor Camacho Megatron (Beast Wars/Beast Machines) Plasma Energy Chamber F-15 Eagle The Inside Ultra Magnus NBA Finals Zombie Cyclonus Leon White Hot Rod (Transformers) Inferno (Transformers) Alpha Trion Maximal (Transformers) The Hive Resident Evil (video game) Powermasters Nemesis (Transformers)
