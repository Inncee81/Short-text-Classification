is it okay to be detected in metal gear solid i'm currently just beginning to play metal gear solid it is my first metal gear game and i am wondering is it okay to be seen like if i get seen for a second then i restart the part from my save because i want to take it as stealthy and cool as i can but if they see me for a second will that alter my score like if i just grab them from behind and hold a knife to their throat technically i'm alerting them and they know i'm there even though i knock them out or am i going about this all wrong if you get seen nothing happens only that the alarm will sound and soldiers will star coming it will not alter your score but you could die in a situation or battle use stealth all you can but at one point you will be spotted and be force to fight i already won the game any questions contact me to my email dosu yahoo com Pok__dex World Wide Web Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen HyperText Transfer Protocol Die Zauberfl__te Pok__mon (video games) Tin whistle Nintendo Power Bulbasaur Pok__mon (anime) Charles Ives Otakon Nintendo 64 Heraldry George III of the United Kingdom UFO conspiracy theory Blazon Provence-Alpes-C__te d'Azur Pok__mon Snap Kraftwerk Fugue Wheel of Fortune Koan Web server Charles II of England HTTP cookie Escape of Charles II Extraterrestrial hypothesis Animal Crossing Tincture (heraldry) Bubble Bobble Internet Uniform Resource Locator Anne of Great Britain Domain Name System Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Tale of Genji Wario Ella Fitzgerald The Nameless Novel Native American flute Celebi The Wotch Duke of Norfolk Viridian City Samus Aran The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap RuneScape Random Events Thousand Oaks, California Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Final Fantasy III Letterboxing The Penultimate Peril William IV of the United Kingdom MIT Mystery Hunt Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom Cluedo Zelda II: The Adventure of Link James I of England Velodrome Dionysus Pok__mon Channel JavaServer Pages Z Hogwarts Domain name Crossword House of Leaves Flute Charles Wheatstone The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Colin Powell Khazar Correspondence Quartermaster Center and School Nightmare (Soul Calibur) Oak Island Zeus Tulsa, Oklahoma Sonic X Link (Legend of Zelda) British monarchy Common Unix Printing System Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart One Tree Hill (TV series) Legend of Zelda series songs French Riviera Oakes Ames NWo Nintendo GameCube Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Siegfried Schtauffen The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening American Football League playoffs Chuck Palahniuk Ecclesiastical Latin Augustus De Morgan Pok__mon Colosseum
