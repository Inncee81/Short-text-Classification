what's better an x box or a playstation i'm leaning toward the but i'm not quite sure why i guess it's just because i've heard more talk about it ok so all of the fanboys are retartds saying the is better and all of this bullshit in my oppinion the ps is the better choice most of the owners think blu ray is useless but its not it can hold hdvd's on one disc now as for games the ps is also going to be better it may not have much now but if you saw e you would see that they are going to have a lot of good games such as killzone and final fantsy xiii and resident evil and the big hitter mgs wich is now only for the ps so all of you owners shove it up your ass also with the it is only backwards conpatible with games yes only xbox games but thats ok because there are only games xbox fanboys want backwards conpatible halo and when the ps is backwards conpatible with all ps and ps games and to add ponto that they are actually still makeing games for the ps so suck it xbox fanboys Nintendo Revolution High-definition television Xbox Nintendo Virtual Boy Console game Television GeForce 7 Series Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Nintendo 64 Mother (video game) Enhanced remake Sega Dreamcast CD-i PowerPC Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Super Nintendo Entertainment System One Piece Nintendo GameCube Launch game ATI Technologies Nintendo Digital television Zbigniew Rybczy__ski Nintendo Entertainment System ATSC Nintendo DS Technos Japan Corporation Video game publisher Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Game Boy Nintendo Power Windows Vista DVD recorder Daigasso!
