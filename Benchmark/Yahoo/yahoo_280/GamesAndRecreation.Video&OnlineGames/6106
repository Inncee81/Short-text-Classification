what is the diff of harvest moon and animal crossing for the ds im going to buy a new game and i want to know what they are about please tell me the point of the games and which do you recommend they are both great games basically i would say if you want a relaxing game to pass the time i would get animal crossing because while the objectives may take awhile to accomplish they are simple and straightforward if you are looking for a more complex and in depth game i would get harvest moon because there are many objectives of the game that require complex actions to accomplish i personally like harvest moon more because there is sooo much more to do in that game and i got tired of animal crossing after a while because it started getting repetitive the main objective of animal crossing is to improve your house and town and become friends with the neighbors the main objective of harvest moon is to rescue the harvest goddess who has been banished to another world by a which princess you accomplish this through daily work and tasks The Sims Harvest Moon series Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town SimCity Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable Will Wright Plantation Sim racing Farm The Sims Online Machinima GxB Agriculture Fish farming Forestry Simulation game Hunting Renai game The Sims 2 Electronic Arts City Building Series SimCity 3000 Game designer Maxis Harvest moon The Sims Bustin' Out Traction engine Enclosure Rise of Nations Dairy farming Racing game Attic calendar Billy Sims Galaxy Angel Colecovision Expansion pack Jack Thompson The Sims 2: University Collective farming Combine harvester Sustainable agriculture Market gardening SimIsle The Sims 2: Nightlife Fishing Combat flight simulator Hal Trosky SimCity 2000 State Farm Insurance Subsistence farming Dim sum Simming Cuba Dark Side of the Moon Player's Choice Hitler Has Only Got One Ball Reforestation SimCity 4 MMORPG Arianne Palouse Apollo 15 Economy of the Soviet Union Utopia (video game) Agricultural machinery SimAnt Apollo 17 Branch Rickey Simlish Aquaculture Simulation Cyrus McCormick Lindy Hop FIFA Series Armageddon Game (DS9 episode) Farm system Pollination Gardening Network Switching Subsystem Video game player Flight simulator Cheapass Games Animal Farm Detroit Lions Autumn Family farm Children of God Soil science Glorantha King of Fighters Deforestation Kellogg Company M.U.L.E.
