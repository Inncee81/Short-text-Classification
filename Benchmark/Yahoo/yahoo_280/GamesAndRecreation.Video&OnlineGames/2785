sims help okay so i was just playing the sims and my adopted daughter had to grow up into a toddler so my sim goes to the cradle and sits there waiting for something i says she still want to help with birthday but she stands there it has been hours in sims time i canceled the action but she still stands there doing nothing i can't get her to do anything and when sims are just wainting they do clapping things and random actions for her she does them but it is sped up even though it is normal time help i don't know what to do she is single and the move objects cheat won't work i tried earlier it might help if you move your sim to do this you must first click shift ctrl c then you must type in the code moveobjects on yes there is no space between move and objects if that doesn't work you may need to download a patch from the internet from sites such as yahoo games or gamespot Groudon Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon (anime) Pok__mon Emerald Missingno.
