xbox or ps poll i'm not going to get either but i'm just seeing what everyone thinks which one and why well it all depends on what type of gamer you are right now i have a ps and i loooove it both are good though but i think the ps is the bigger bang for your buck here is my recommendation if you want a multimedia console that has online gaming movie downloads etc overall focus on intense gaming like mature and teen games and great exclusives ex gears of war halo tenchu z etc then get the xbox some xbox s have hardware problems my friend is on his rd xbox red rings of death which he bought his first one at launch but also my one friend who recieved his last christmas hasn't had any problems microsoft now gives a year warrenty so just incase it does happen your going to be protected for a while if you want a multimedia console that has freee online is well balanced with all types of games good exclusives as well heavenly sword lair ninja gaiden sigma little big planet resistance etc and many other features like web browsing and ps home then get the ps ps doesnt have rumble in the controllers though which is one part i hate about it around christmas rumble controllers will be released though i like the ps because it comes with wifi blue ray gb and rechargeable controllers also if you wanted this same amount of power except for more gigs on your xbox elite it would cost around total for the wifi hd player year of xbox live charge kit this would save you around bucks ps price estimated cost around with hdmi chord plus microsoft only allows the to be compatible with microsoft equipment ex hardrive and headset so if you like wanted to upgrade you ps or buy a mic you could go to ebay and find one really cheap i found a mic for bucks and have found gb hardrives on ebay for around bucks still making it cheaper than the but then again you might not use these extras so you might wanna go for the wii or xbox since of the price difference many people also compare the ps to the xbox and say that the xbox is better based on present facts duhh the has been out a year longer than the ps the ps hasn't even been out for very long to release all these great games and present all of its great features by christmas the ps will have great games along ps home and xbox will only have the overated halo dont get me wrong halo is a great series but it is just overated again like i said it all revolves around what you like and what you can afford if you can afford anyone of the consoles and like anything then i would go for the ps ps also all these next gen systems will be good in the long run they will last for around years so saving up for the ps is the wisest choice the ps will get tons of exclusives around christmas lair warhawk heavenly sword killzone metal gear solid etc and many of these exclusives are new unlike previous exclusives like the metal gear solid series get the ps its better in the long run Atomic Kitten PlayStation 3 Giffen good PE ratio Gross domestic product Publicly funded medicine B3ta Radeon Health insurance LOL (Internet slang) Wal-Mart Xbox Jennifer Lopez Mutual fund Arbitrage PlayStation 2 Thread (computer science) Supply and demand MOS Technology Cost Future energy development Insurance Tariff CPU design The Apprentice 2 Xbox 360 Hydrogen economy Wallpaper Solar power satellite Electronic Arts Economy of the Republic of Ireland Keynesian economics Xbox Live Karaoke Deflation (economics) Black market Montreal Annexation Manifesto Nintendo GameCube United Kingdom corporation tax Digital photography GeForce 3 Urban sprawl Grand Theft Auto III Broadband Internet access Member of the European Parliament Economic shortage Jade Empire Solar cell Food and Drug Administration Floppy disk Microsoft Sport utility vehicle NVIDIA Tina Turner Canadian and American health care systems compared North American Numbering Plan RuneScape quests Divorce Hiroshi Yamauchi Solar power Microeconomics McMansion GeForce FX Second Council of Constantinople Bungie Studios Renewable energy development Bulk vending Inkjet printer School of Salamanca Inflation Rational pricing Democratic Republic of Georgia Coin collecting Mattress Nuclear power L Price discrimination Canadian and American economies compared Game show Oxford English Dictionary Transformation problem Intellivision Employee stock option Page widening Personal rapid transit Law of value Gentrification Dead or Alive (video game) Agricultural policy Goodness and value theory Corn Laws Page replacement algorithms Richard Price Mick Taylor Subsidy Sega Saturn RollerCoaster Tycoon Subud 10cc Plastic
