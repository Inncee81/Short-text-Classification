how to make my computer run games better i recently got splinter cell double agent and installed it i can play it but the game gets a little bit choppy what i notice most is the sound repeating a little to give an example it sort of goes sa sa sa sam y y you need to and so on my computer specs are as follows manufacturer dell inc processor intel r pentium r cpu ghz cpus memory mb ram hard drive gb video card nvidia geforce gs monitor dell e fp sound card sigmatel audio speakers headphones keyboard usb root hub mouse usb root hub mouse surface operating system windows xp home edition build service pack xpsp sp qfe any way to make splinter cell double agent less choppy very often overlooked when it comes to lag is the sound card if it is an embedded sound card it can be processor heavy and lag a lot when loading playing new sounds especially games that have a lot of ambient sound effects a quick way to check is to see if sound is skipping a lot with lag and to see if the lag appears during a new sound being loaded you may want to decrease sound settings to see if it improves the game i have a good new video card but the amount of cache i have for my sound card is horrible and it slows down my games to the point of not playing anymore because it gets 'framey' hope that tip helps another obvious tip is to disable antivirus before playing good luck AmigaOS OpenBSD Cue sheet MAME Common Unix Printing System Disk image BitTorrent Mac OS X System 7 (Macintosh) Unix Wget Windows 2000 VMware Berkeley Software Distribution Macromedia Flash Mouse (computing) Emulator Screenshot Musical Instrument Digital Interface Gmail Warez Windows XP Read-only memory Spyware Knoppix Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Windows 3.x COM file Commodore 64 Microsoft Paint Super Nintendo Entertainment System Stardock Apple Macintosh Kazaa Secure Shell ZX Spectrum Finale notation program Microsoft Windows Anti-virus software Hello world program Forth programming language Crontab IPod Object Desktop Palm OS Mozilla Firefox Windows Vista Xbox 360 Stopping e-mail abuse Preboot Execution Environment DOS Linux distribution Java virtual machine Rootkit Nintendo Revolution Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Domain Name System Console emulator MySQL USB flash drive Windows Installer PlayStation 3 Computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Linspire Apache HTTP Server Dd (Unix) Portable Document Format Ultima Online Symbian OS Daemon (computer software) Java programming language Billiards Launchd ROM hacking ASCII art Web server CPAN MediaMax CD-3 Atari 8-bit family ReactOS Multics Uniform Resource Locator HTTP cookie Option key Minesweeper (computer game) Adobe Photoshop OpenOffice.org ROM image Windows registry Nintendo Entertainment System Cascading Style Sheets Mandriva Linux Amstrad CPC Sinclair ZX81
