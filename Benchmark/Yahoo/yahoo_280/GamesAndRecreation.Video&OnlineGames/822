nidoking or nidoqueen which would you recommend i've never had either one as part of a regular team i'm from the gold silver crystal generation because i've never been able to choose i know that nidoking has slightly higher offensive stats and nidoqueen has slightly higher defensive stats and that there's also a difference in speed and hp but is there anything else about them that would tip the scale one way or the other also what are some good moves or movesets sets for each i was thinking of toxic earthquake megahorn and maybe iron tail edit for the record horn drill is not exclusive to nidoking nidoqueen can learn it as well well using the general formula m f we can conclude that nidoking is indeed the better option Nidoking Nidoqueen Pok__mon Gold and Silver Lairon Slowpoke Volleyball Rhydon Pok__mon types Giovanni (Pok__mon) Deoxys Pok__mon evolution Fuzion Pools of Darkness GURPS RuneScape weapons Fuchsia City RuneScape skills Smeargle Pittsburgh Steelers Golden Sun Sonic Adventure 2 Table tennis Yu-Gi-Oh!
