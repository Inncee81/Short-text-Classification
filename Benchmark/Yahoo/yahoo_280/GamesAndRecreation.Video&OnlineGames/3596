legend of zelda twilight princess need help please i have this game for gamecube when i went to eldin bridge i fought off the twilight monster things but the warp didnt appear so i kept going on in the game but then i found the missing peice in the desert and i couldnt warp back because there was none im at the snowpeak ruins now and all is well but im worried that i might need to restart the game because later on i might get stuck am i glitched and do i need to restart the game i don't know if it is a glitch or not and you may not have to restart your game i don't believe i could handle that because if you are in snowpeak ruins you have already completed over of the game but if you ever want to go back to kakariko village goron mines etc which i think you do have to go back sometimes you will have to take the long way around by either taking the bridge over hyrule lake and through southern hyrule field and kakariko gorge or the southern field below hyrule castle and then through the main southern hyrule field and then kakariko gorge you can restart the game if you want but if it is a glitch the warp point still will not show up so also if you don't remove the part of the bridge in the desert you will not be able to play the cave of ordeals that is under the bridge piece and you can't get all of the remaining poe souls or the great fairy's tears which by the way i think is optional but the fairy's tears are wonderful to have taking on the final bosses E-mail Voice over IP Gmail Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Data retention Charmander Missingno.
