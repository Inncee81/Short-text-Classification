ps or xbox i have a chance to get one of these which is better and why best answers goes to the person that explains the best thanks i think the ps is the best system out of any the three game systems because of a free online which is also improving quite a bit b is somewhat cheaper than the xbox ps xbox gb ps xbox elite hdmi slot free hdmi slot only with elite wifi free wifi rechargeable controllers free recharge kit online free online a year blu ray player free hddv player total total you might not use these accessories so that s why i say the ps is somewhat cheaper c has great exclusives coming out heavenly sword lair eight days warhawk metal gear solid metal gear online killzone grand turismo little big planet getaway driver god of war iii final fantasy xiii final fantasy versus xiii jax and daxter lost frontier motorstorm ninja gaiden sigma ratchet and clank future tools of destruction resistance fall of man socom confrontation tekken uncharted drake s fortune and white knight story that s all the games i can think of over minutes d the ps is superior due to cell technology this allows the ps to produce complex graphics far superior to any other console the ps is equivalent to xbox in processing speed the down side is however that it will be a while until game producers can max its potential but i m not impatient also it is somewhat good too because then sony wont have to make another console as soon but yet nobody knows what technology can come to in years e ps will probably be the better quality as in life span many xbox are already having hardware problems xbox have red rings of death when there has only been a reported faliure chance with the ps ps also has an emergency shut down feature so if you ps overheats it will automatically shutdown until it is out of a dangerous temperature isnt bad but ps is way better for the cost Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon Missingno.
