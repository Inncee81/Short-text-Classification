does the madcatz disc repair kit works i got a bunch of cd's that have skipping problems and i was wondering if it helps reduce the scratches it seems to me like the product is kind of expensive generally nothing from madcatz ever works so no it doesn't i used to be the assistant manager of a gamestop and i would never recommend that disc cleaner on the other hand gamestop itself carries a grainy fluid that repairs discs it also comes with cloths that are smooth to go along with the fluid you pour the fluid on the disc and rub in the direction of the scratch you let it dry filling in the scratch and then you rub in a circular motion until the disc is clean it really works it may take longer than the madcatz disc repair kit but when you are done you'll find that it was worth it because unlike when you are using the madcatz disc repair kit it will actually repair your discs i also got numerous complaints from customers about any cleaning repair kits just a warning Xbox Xbox 360 Nintendo GameCube PlayStation 2 Universal Serial Bus Blue screen of death Nintendo Domain Name System Windows 2000 Nintendo Revolution Warranty Commodore 64 NVIDIA Windows XP Xbox Live ATI Technologies Computer and video games Whois Modchip IBM PC compatible Game programming Gmail PlayStation 3 HyperText Transfer Protocol Game programmer Halo 2 Halo: Combat Evolved Rare (video game company) Console game Mozilla Firefox Computer virus Video game developer The Sims NX bit Open access Galileo spacecraft Uniform Resource Locator Laserdisc PowerPC Electronic commerce Grand Theft Auto III Counter-Strike X86 HTTP cookie MSN Messenger Atari 8-bit family History of video games (Sixth generation era) DVD Amstrad CPC PlayStation Portable Timeline of computing 1990-forward Vorbis Game Boy Advance Sega Dreamcast Game Boy Doom 3 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Video game console GSM services ITunes Music Store Nintendo Entertainment System Mac OS X File Allocation Table DragonFly BSD Sega Saturn Bicycle lighting Files-11 AMD Digital photography High-definition television Dance Dance Revolution Modem C plus plus Final Fantasy XI Nintendo DS History of Microsoft Windows System/34 OpenGL Wireless Application Protocol Halo (video game series) Karaoke Java programming language Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Common Unix Printing System Apple Computer Amiga Electronic Arts CPU cache Filename extension
