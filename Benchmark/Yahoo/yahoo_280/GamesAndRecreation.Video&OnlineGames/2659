what is a good moveset for floatzel i want to know what the best moveset is for floatzel because everyone says its good and i have never used it well floatzel has less special attack than physical attack so waterfall would do more than surf so waterfall is deffinitely a keeper crunch would be good when using a water attack isnt a good idea again crunch is physical so that would do more damage with floatzel because of his high physical attack agaility would also be nice combined with baton pass could make your floatzel a hard hitter and a team player waterfall crunch ice fang agility baton pass i wouldn't put ice beam in there since ice beam is a special attack you may also consider putting in swagger and taking like agility or baton pass out since swagger confuses your target and that could help in battle by the way floatzel doesn't even learn hydro pump so ignore every who says he should learn hydro pump floatzel can't learn earthquake either NTSC Super Nintendo Entertainment System Laws of cricket DVD Copyleft Super Mario Bros. 3 Australian rules football Mario Sex and the City Super Mario 128 SCO-Linux controversies Mario Lemieux GNU General Public License C plus plus Nintendo GameCube Theory of conduct Regional lockout Alex Ferguson Compact disc Super Mario Bros. television series Perl S__CAM Nintendo Entertainment System Coldplay Plame affair Telephone numbering plan Nintendo Power Laserdisc Paper Mario Pointer Jon Secada Toad (Nintendo) Nintendo 64 Nintendo DS ROM image Wicket Error correction and detection Single certification VHS Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Jean-Michel Jarre Objective-C Debugging Religious Society of Friends Postcode The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Denis Law PlayStation 2 DV English grammar AmigaOS North American Numbering Plan Metroid Prime ATSC Striker Pack Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis UK telephone numbering plan Trigun Public domain Super Mario World SIMD MPEG-2 Friends C programming language Closed captioning Federal Communications Commission Player's Choice Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Social rule Morse Code Opus Dei High-definition television Super Mario Bros. 2 JPEG SCO v.
