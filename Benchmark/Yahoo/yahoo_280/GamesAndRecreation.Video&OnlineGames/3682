thinking of downloading a game illegally but wait i have a decent excuse ok it's been more than once that i went out to buy a game only to find out that it runs like crap on my computer i've learned my lesson by now i always try the demo beforehand however not every game has a demo that's when i go to check the system requirements sometimes i am so close to running the game but i might be missing one small thing that might allow me to run it anyway but i can't be sure sometimes i know that i can run the game but i end up having to play it at like a by resolution to get a good framerate well long story short i figured that i could illegally download the games just to test them out then if it turns out that it runs fine i could go out and buy the real thing a few days later only problem is i'm not sure what the chances of getting caught are and if i was caught what would happen i hear that you have to do something stupid to get caught but i could be a stupid guy what do you think sorry if i shouldn't be talking about this you don't have to do something stupid to get caught you simply have to be at the wrong place at the wrong time you can have one game or a hundred there are ways to get things from the web safely and ways to not peer to peer is a 'not' i could go on but that's not the point of the question the odds of you getting caught this one time aren't very high but there will never be a guarantee that you won't the odds will differ depending on what program you are using what protocol and port you are using the internet provider you are using if you are using an anonymous proxy server if the provider keeps logs and if you are using an encrypted connection to the provider so even the filenames and such can't be monitored by isp or anyone else the people that say 'you have to be stupid to get caught' are the same people who simply use torrents or peer to peer neither of which are safe but used because well it's easy unfortunately the question of course boils down to an ethical one and there is no good answer for that besides the one that you are willing to accept i can honestly say i know where you're coming from at least i've been in the same situation where everything on the box makes it seems like the game should be running on my computer so fast that the computer will push me out of the chair and play for me because i can't keep up then i install it and it won't play for beans no pixel shaders i need a new video card f this game anyway think about the security points above be safe and good luck Neopets Jabberwocky Bart the Daredevil Angels in America Kyle Broflovski Digital pet Freddy Fender Collectible card game Role-playing Singlish Eh Viacom Beyond Shadows Productive and unproductive labour Can't Hardly Wait Origin belief Wheel of Fortune Shenandoah (band) Athrun Zala Liam Gallagher The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cultural references Jennifer Lopez Community of Christ Liz Phair Virtual economy Cliff Richard Little Britain Donkey Kong 64 Anya Jenkins Gregg Alexander Hank Williams Christopher Marlowe Phil Collins Anderson Cooper Highway 61 Revisited Pop Art: Pet Shop Boys - The Hits Bart Sells His Soul Ubykh language Cary Grant Shaggy dog story Kodocha Tallulah Bankhead Just In Time Oasis (band) PJ Harvey Furious Angels AFI 100 Years series The O.C.
