xbox is freezing up and ring of death shows occasionally my xbox is having problems the screen just freezes after a couple minutes of gameplay it still freezes after i turn it off and try again then the ring of death shows up sometimes when i try to start it up but when the ring doesn't show it freezes instead what should i do if i send the console in will the new warranty cover it or will i have to pay for repairs first off when did you purchase the xbox i know recently if you have a warranty you can contact xbox n they will repair the error for you another option you can consider is repositioning your xbox in a different place and getting an inter cooler the problem maybe that its collecting dust n too much heat the inter cooler serves to cool the hard drive so that it doesn't fry your system Pok__mon Colosseum Pok__mon: The Movie 2000 Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon Gold and Silver Mewtwo Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Crystal Pok__mon Snap Pok__mon types Articuno Lugia Pok__mon Moltres Pok__mon Chronicles Pok__mon Trading Card Game Zapdos Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Missingno.
