nintendo ds lite i really want a ds lite in pink i played harvest moon and big brain academy on my cousins ds i really liked it i want one but i only have thirty dollars my birthday is in october but i dont think that i can wait how can i get one i looked on ebay and they are still pretty expensive important if i get one used will they already have a pictchat user on them or can i still make up my own name thanks for the help i went to game stop and sold my old gameboy stuff the used ds lite was still i would rather get it new for more do you have anything of equal value is the going rate for a used dslite at gamestop that you could trade on craigslist there's a barter section where you could put up a notice that you want a dslite and are willing to trade the following things for one maybe your parents have got a couple of semi valuable items gathering dust somewhere that they would allow you to barter with get creative someone who was considering trading in an unwanted one at gamestop would be getting less than in credit and you never know what they'd rather have instead if you throw your into the mix you'd be even more likely to put together a trade and that would leave you free to use your birthday money for games accessories hope it works out good luck Xbox PlayStation 3 SCART Xbox 360 High-Definition Multimedia Interface DVD Television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo GameCube Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting PlayStation Portable Atari ST Commodore 64 Digital Visual Interface Console game Sound Blaster Sinclair ZX81 PC Engine Commodore 128 Grand Theft Auto III Sega Saturn Modchip PlayStation 2 Original Amiga chipset Game programmer Apple Macintosh Apple IIGS Counter-Strike Acorn Electron Loudspeaker Nintendo Revolution Rare (video game company) Console wars Computer and video games Mac OS X Game programming Computer display Sega Dreamcast Timeline of computing 1990-forward Video game console BBC Micro 1080p High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection High-definition television Electronic Arts ATI Technologies Super Nintendo Entertainment System Analog-to-digital converter Sega CD Halo 2 Computer role-playing game Karaoke Universal Serial Bus NVIDIA Halo (video game series) Pump It Up Nintendo Entertainment System RCA connector Nintendo Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 History of operating systems Intellivision Home cinema Commodore International Xbox Live Laserdisc IBM PC compatible TurboGrafx 16 Power Macintosh G3 IGN Need for Speed TRS-80 Color Computer Gross domestic product Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Sharp Zaurus IMac Color Graphics Adapter History of computer and video games Windows XP Blu-ray Disc Graphics card Enhanced remake Microsoft AmigaOS Commodore Plus/4 Oscilloscope Final Fantasy (video game) X Window System Desktop computer Atari 7800 In The Groove (game) SAM Coup__ Game Boy Advance SGI Indy
