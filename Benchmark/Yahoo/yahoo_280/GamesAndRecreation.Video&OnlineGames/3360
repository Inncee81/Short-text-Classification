can i gety a kyogre and a gorouodon in pokemon diamond they cannot be got in pkm pearl or diamond and must be traded from emerald in which both of them can be caught its hard to get people to trade them since they are one of a kind but if you tell a friend to switch off his game during a trade with a legendary in his team he may find another one in his pc i have about five kyorge's since im fussy and i wanted the one with the strongest nature look for one with a mild nature its really good if you ever come across a legendary it is essential to save about times before you battle so if you accidentally defeat it you can switch off the game and then on again before the battle started and this is where it gets exciting as every time you do this the legendary that appears again from the saved point has different stats and nature than the one before it and this is how you can come across the ultimate natured legendary Multiplayer Battle.net StarCraft: Ghost Modem Pure Pwnage StarCraft Neverwinter Nights LOL (Internet slang) Lag Gameplay of StarCraft Digital Subscriber Line ATLAS (StarCraft) Lol Coxhill Handheld game console MMORPG Warcraft II Derek Bailey PlayStation 2 Capture the flag Broadband Internet access Internet Steam (content delivery) Null modem Zerg Cerebrate Aiur StarCraft Episode V Quake Massively multiplayer online game Rush (computer gaming) Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Frankie Goes to Hollywood Game.com Counter-Strike Gantz MUD Single player Computer and video games Starcraft StarCraft Episode VI Peter Cook Warcraft III QuakeWorld ITU-T LAN party Cable television Hayes command set Private branch exchange Danielle Bunten Berry Computer and video game genres The Cure Zerg Ultralisk Diplomacy (game) Xbox Live HomePNA StarCraft storyline Leet Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow Zergling Nintendo GameCube Videotex General Mayhem The Vision of Escaflowne Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles History of computer and video games Homeworld Sim racing StarCraft universe Satellite internet Serial port StarCraft: Revelations Tassadar Fenix Terran (StarCraft) StarCraft: Brood War RS-232 Packet radio Internet slang Halo (video game series) ARPANET Cable modem Dial-up access Nintendo Entertainment System Twisted Metal Internet cafe Diablo II Computer network Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME 2 Router Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Prodigy (ISP) Integrated Services Digital Network Dungeon Keeper Isometric projection Superhero Total Annihilation Internet service provider Personal computer game X.25
