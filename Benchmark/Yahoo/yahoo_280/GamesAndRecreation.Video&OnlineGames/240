can i ask for the steps on how to insert game pak in the nintendo ds properly i'll explain in front of the screen there is a note a ds game pak option inserted but when i start the game pokemon diamond version there is'nt a note that says migrate pokemon from version what should i do i blew the yellow line in gameboy cartridge but nothing happened pls help me i want to experience pal park tnx sorry for the grammar if it's saying a ds option pack is inserted then there's a good chance you don't have a gba cartridge inserted of course it could be that you haven't got the national dex yet once you have the national dex unlocked you'll find the option for migrate on the main menu basically turn off your ds plug in your copy of ruby sapphire firered leafgreen or emerald and your copy of diamond or pearl then turn the ds on don't swap it out while the power is on as it won't work Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Game Boy Advance Nintendo DS Game Boy Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Pok__mon Missingno.
