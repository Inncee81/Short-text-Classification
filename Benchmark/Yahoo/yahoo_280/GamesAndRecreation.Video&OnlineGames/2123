lost in blue where do i find the wood to make the spear got this from gamefaqs hope it helps here are the different kinds don't ask me what the numbers mean i have no freaking clue spear bamboo spear bamboo sharpened stone spear bamboo sharpened bone spear stick spear stick sharpened stone spear stick sharpened bone for now you are limited to spears and so that means you need a stick which is not the same as a twig or a piece of bamboo both are sort of hard to find in your immediate surroundings but i'll try and give you directions first the stick head across the river and north follow the wall north and east until you see a bunch of mushrooms and a climbable wall there is either a log up against the wall or a log nearby that you can push up against it i can't remember climb up head north and west on a rectangle of land alone there is a tree that drops twigs and sometimes a stick if you don't see a stick now try shaking the tree or check back in a day or two for the bamboo again go across the river but this time go south and follow the beach east when you hit the wall there should be a tiny square of green that you can climb up there should be a stick of bamboo on that ledge if not there will be in a day or two alternatively if you want to hit the bamboo jackpot there is a sort of tricky way but it has the potential to backfire so save before you try it it's really worth doing especially because skye jacks your first bamboo and makes a basket out of it you have so many better things to do with bamboo than make baskets doesn't she see p anyway on that part of the beach where you just went climbing around looking for bamboo you can go southeast along the rocks and over to another piece of beach the trick is this is only possible when the tide is at its lowest and if you dawdle long enough that the tide goes back up you are stuck on that useless boring side of the beach for hours and hours and hours so go as soon as the tide is low enough and hurry up once you make it to the other side run all the way north you will see some oysters along the beach but don't get distracted they aren't that great and it takes too much time climb the ledge to the west and keep climbing westward until you get to the top area you should find a gazillion pieces of bamboo there don't be enticed by the bamboo shoots to the northwest they aren't particularly useful and digging them up takes precious time once you collect enough bamboo run run run back and cross west to the other side of the beach once you have a stick or bamboo you can create a spear the spear will be even better if you pick up a stone they are scattered all around off the top of my head there is one on each end of the beach south of the cave and one near skye's crashed lifeboat sharpen it and use it as a spearhead stones are pretty common so there is really no reason not to use them you can use the spear to get fishies which are infinitely better to eat than seaweed or whatever else you have found lying around i suggest using the best materials you can find bamboo is better than stick with a sharpened stone is better than without one because you will find better fish and your spear will break less often Naruto jutsu Blaziken Alakazam Aggron Robot Master Items in the Metroid series YuYu Hakusho Metroid Prime Characters of Naruto Toa Tenshinhan Seismic retrofit Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Sceptile Gyarados RuneScape weapons Guilty Gear Gengar Vegeta The Winged Dragon of Ra Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Final Fantasy magic Piccolo Junior Saga Team Rocket Pump It Up Son Gohan Aerial (dance move) Diablo II Protoss R-Type Limit Break Shen Gong Wu Mewtwo Dragonite Charizard Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Milotic Magikarp Metroid Prime 2: Echoes GunBound Power Rangers: SPD Blood (computer game) Super Sonic Waking the Dragons Lightsaber combat Zanpakut__ Team Fortress Classic Professional wrestling match types Ranma __ characters Transformers: Cybertron Yu-Gi-Oh!
