is it possible to finish the sims without any expansions packs being added how and if so what happens i'm just curious about how it would end i'm still on the first disk of the sims also how would i advance to other disks it's an open ended simulation game there is no story mode no ending no objective you will literally play forever and never see an ending the reason for the multiple disks is the amount of data you are acessing all those houses furniture items etc take up a lot of data and needs multiple cds dvd even if you kill off all of your sims you won't recieve a game over the game was designed in mind to have an infinite build your own story objective Rock band Rhythm guitar Europe (band) Foreigner (band) Jimmy Page Surf music Bruce Springsteen The Yardbirds Rock and roll The Stranglers Fleetwood Mac The Libertines Effects pedal Brian May Bad Religion The Police Little Feat Wishbone Ash Stairway to Heaven Nintendo 64 E Street Band Keith Richards Steve Morse Hoobastank Guitar solo Indie rock Dixie Dregs Muse (band) Electric Six The Final Cut (album) The Allman Brothers Band Allan Holdsworth Mike Bloomfield Mick Taylor Clawfinger David Bowie Tommy Math rock Mot__rhead UFO (band) Rollins Band Jam band George Lynch (musician) Def Leppard Rock (music) Steppenwolf (band) Heavy metal music Master of Puppets Scorpions (band) Queens of the Stone Age Gothic rock Petra (band) Progressive rock Art rock Southern rock Steve Howe (guitarist) Aerosmith Metal music Foo Fighters Guns N' Roses Roots revival Beyond J-Rock Dave Matthews Band Industrial rock Guitar Wolf The Tubes Garage rock Metallica Spectrum (band) Catch 22 (band) Waylon Jennings Ratt Mr. Big (band) Pub rock (Australia) Rush (band) Psychedelic music Alice Cooper The Who Jazz fusion Steve Vai Paul Butterfield Eddie Van Halen Death (band) Anthrax (band) Nu metal Cheap Trick Dire Straits Eagles Collective Soul Blur NOFX Jack plug Megadeth Lynyrd Skynyrd Red Hot Chili Peppers Russian rock Horslips W.A.S.P.
