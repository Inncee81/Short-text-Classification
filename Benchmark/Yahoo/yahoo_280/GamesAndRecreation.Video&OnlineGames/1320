how do i start playing diablo ii lod on battlenet i go to battle net but i don't see where to begin play sorry i'm stupid i used to play on bnet years ago but they've changed the site what's the web address how do i start play you have to have the cd the way you put this makes it sound like you are in a internet web browser if you do have the cd and i'm just mistaken click on battle net then when it is finished connecting you choose create new account enter the information it asks for then when you've created it it will let you into a place just like single player except there will be no characters choose create new character choose what type of character you would like to play with then pick a name this may take a while depending on how creative you are because you have to find a name that hasn't already been taken then once you have created the character you can either create or join a game creating a game makes a new world almost identical to every other one and more people can join it joining a game in which someone else created when you join a game there can only be a total of people total in the game by created i do not mean that you have to do any actual creating hope this helps and good luck it took me years to become as rich as i am only to find that the game is rather boring a word of advice don't start playing it Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Diablo II Battle.net Password Neopets Yu-Gi-Oh!
