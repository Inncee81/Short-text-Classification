did you notice differences in last gen and this gen games specifically in fpss when turning or moving i was playing halo the other day on my old xbox i noticed something different when turning around or looking around in xbox games when turning the walls and other textures looked smooth and looked like motion blur e g gears of war in halo the walls just looked blurry when i was looking around does anybody else notice this what could be causing this frame rate there are different effects that can be added now due to the extra power of the newer consoles they can add fancy particle shading and motion blur effects without drop in graphic quality its just a question of having more power and being able to add more effects to make the game prettier you can expect more of the same when halo comes out in case you would like to know even if you play halo on the more powerful you will still not get the motion blur effects because the game was not programed with it halo was developed for a system that could not handle those types of effects original xbox which is not anything bad about the system its just the technology that was available at the time Rome: Total War First Punic War House of Julii Single Transferable Vote Battle of Alesia Pompey Roman Republic Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Julius Caesar Second Punic War Mark Antony American Civil War Spanish-American War Military history of the Roman Empire Memoir '44 Roman Empire Military history of France Franco-Prussian War Timeline of ancient Rome Medieval: Total War Cato the Younger Marius Democratic Party (United States) Seleucid Empire Roman Senate Plurality electoral system Gallic Wars Theory of conduct Roman Kingdom Julia Caesaris Elections in the United States Marcus Licinius Crassus World Series Roman Navy Mexican-American War Cleveland Browns Year of the Four Emperors Western Roman Empire Valens Roman conquest of Britain Attalus I Republican Party (United States) Hannibal History of the United States (1789-1849) Carthage Samnite Wars War of 1812 Risk (game) Pyrrhus of Epirus War of the Pacific Kasparov versus The World Ostrogoth Craps James K.
