test drive unlimited i downloaded the beta closed whatever that means and it says it has expired or something do i need the open one and people have been talking that you need a key to play where do i get that ya i know but since there is no demo for the game i thought this would be the next best thing as far as i know the beta test for the game is over as it has been released a beta test is a sort of pre release test to catch any problems before full release you'll need to buy the game if you want to play it now great game btw LimeWire MAME ROM image Spyware Read-only memory A.S.
