metropolis mania on the game metropolis mania for ps i have a question on level can you evict the cult leader or can he not leave will the cult continue you can't evict the cult leader here's a clip from a strategy guide i posted the address below it has a lot of great tips eventually just about everyone in your city will be in the kult it is unavoidable the kult leaders will brag that they have taken over the city and ask you to build a total of five kult buildings go ahead and approve them because it's the only way to get through this scenario after the five kult buildings are built in your city you will get a phone call from the founder of the kult who will tell you how to get rid of the kult's control over your city it will involve a series of yes and no philosophical and logic questions from each of the five kult leaders which if you answer correctly in succession the kults will lose their hold on the city and things will return to normal in a day or two Pok__mon (video games) Missingno.
