video game if you could pick a game world to live in that was virtual what one would it be why you must state the game if you'd be one of the characters in it plateform that its on ex ps etc etc and pick one other person either below or above you would want to be with in that virtual world with that's a hard one i would probably pick the sims but that's boring well only boring to talk about i would probably still pick it because it can make my own dream house and use the cheat console to get money i would be an adult male there are no characters sense you make your own and sense its a game world i could change my own appearance house cloth and girlfriend plus its easy to get laid in that world this is all stuff you can do in the normal game and it would be for the pc if i were to pick a game besides sims i would need to be a game were i was strong enough to easily defend myself and have access to girls probably final fantasy after leveling up and collecting lots of items your invincible i would be vaan the main character and i would have lots of sex with ash ash may be spelt wrong but ash is a female penelo and the other girl which name i forget final fantasy is on the ps and stghm would be with me because he or she would have some experience with the game so we could give each other tips and could look together online for more nude skins and super large t v downloads i believe you said the person you could bring had to be below or above you if thats not the case i would bring my best friend or a major crush of mine with me but i would be the game master so if i brought the girl i liked i would be the ruler if the other person was my best friend or stghm i would not care if i was the ruler or not as long as we respected each other in game lots Metroid series Samus Aran Metroid Prime: Hunters Metroid Prime Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time Nintendo Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Metroid Fusion Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga Metroid (video game species) Metroid Metroid: Zero Mission Items in the Metroid series Boss (video games) Professor E.
