is there online gaming on the playstaion there is online capability on a few ps titles unfortunately if you are used to playing online with your friends via xbox live you will be very disappointed as it pales in comparison it offers no way to contact friends you want to play or anything else community wise so if you play online on ps currently it's always random matches against strangers some time in the next few months or so sony is supposed to release a firmware release called home which should add elements similar or equal to what you might come to expect from playing xbox live i hear that you will have a sims like avatar to control and there will be an online virtual world to roam and interact with other players instead of using only menus it looks interesting to say the least the downside of this though is the ps 's future is in question by all the pros seeing as they do not have the exclusive games and absolute killer apps that they need in order to topple the firmly entrenched xbox right now and until sometime near the middle of next year the titles are not flowing in full force you may want to be certain that a ps is the right investment for you going into the coming year before making a purchase the offers most of the best tiltes you'll see on the ps right now and in the near future Xbox Live Xbox 360 Computer and video games MMORPG Final Fantasy XI The Sims Counter-Strike Nintendo DS Xbox Halo 2 Nintendo Revolution IPod PlayStation 2 Pump It Up First-person shooter Dead or Alive (video game) PlayStation Portable Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Game controller Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Final Fantasy Microsoft Machinima Massively multiplayer online game PlayStation 3 America's Army Gradius Computer role-playing game Grand Theft Auto III Need for Speed Electronic Arts FIFA Series Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Windows Vista Neopets Wipeout (game) Rare (video game company) Resident Evil DVD Pinball Super Nintendo Entertainment System Game programming Championship Manager Poker jargon MSN Messenger Magic: The Gathering Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Video game controversy Monopoly (game) Spider-Man (games) Modchip City of Heroes Nintendo 64 Console wars Quake III Arena Halo: Combat Evolved Adventure game ITunes Virtual world Resident Evil 4 EXpanded MultiPlayer Pro Evolution Soccer Yu Suzuki The Sims 2: University Virtual economy Legacy of Kain Radeon Star Trek Customizable Card Game Dance Dance Revolution The Sims 2 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Sega Dreamcast Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Wave Race: Blue Storm Ubisoft Steam (content delivery) Unreal series Volleyball Dominoes Sound Blaster Backgammon Diplomacy (game) Los Angeles Kings Game Critics Awards Guild Wars Windows XP Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Grand Prix Legends DualDisc Chrono Trigger GoldenEye 007 Console game Bubble Bobble Player character Sim racing
