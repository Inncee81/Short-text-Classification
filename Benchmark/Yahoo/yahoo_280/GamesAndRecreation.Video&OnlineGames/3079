why do people complain about their xbox s ps s etc breaking why do they complain about them overheating when they play them for hours at a time of course they will overheat that's why you read the manual it says do not play for more than hours at a time and that the person playing should take a break from the television screen every hours i'm sorry but so many people complain and say they've gone through consoles in three months they blame microsoft and sony for their own stupidity i have had my ps since a year after it came out almost six years and it works fine still the only problem i've had with it recently was that the dvd player won't play dvd's anymore unless you clean it before using as i hardly ever used this for dvds that's fine i've only had my for about half a year but that's much more than what a lot of people can say i only play at most for hours at a time and then let it cool down for a while before i use it again usually the next day so stop complaining guys be smart well said i applaud you people don't know how to take care of things RuneScape RuneScape cheats RuneScape gods RuneScape economy Newbie MMORPG Jagex RuneScape Mini-Games RuneScape weapons RuneScape skills RuneScape locations RuneScape quests Craps RuneScape slang and terminology RuneScape Random Events Neopets Philip K.
