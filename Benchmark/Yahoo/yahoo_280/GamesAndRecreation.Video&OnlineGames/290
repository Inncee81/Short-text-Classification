pokemon cloning mew hey i know how to clone a pokemon and all you don't need to post links to videos and tutorials for me and i do have mews right now one is level the other is level and i would like to clone one of them however i have heard that the pokemon you are trying to clone may be totally lost and i really don't want to risk loosing a mew since i know a lot a people would probably want one so besides cloning tutorials warning you that they take no responsibility for loss of pokemon and all that has anyone here ever actually lost a pokemon i mean people clone all the time and i havent seen anyone complain about loosing a pokemon entirely i also have other really rare pokemon but again if i could loose them i would rather not take the risk so what do you guys think if i follow cloning directions closely is there a real chance i could loose my mew shiny dialga to anyone that asks how to clone i learned by searching on youtube and with this site among others http www gamefaqs com portable ds file there was a better site than that i found one time but i dont remember where haha reinardus that definitely sounds sun unfortunately pokemon crystal doesnt have wi fi nor is compatible with pokemon battle revolution so that is cool but doesnt help me out much hmmm i dont think so if you are worried go to a pokemon forum and ask someone who has cloned before which many people have also since when you first enter the gts you save right so your game should still load the data that was not corrupted when you tried restart the game to get a clone so either you get a clone or you dont i have tried cloning myself i have not lost one pokemon yet though i haven't gained another one either i think i keep messing up the times good luck Missingno.
