yoshi from super mario world some inconsistencies some things bother me yoshi seems to gobble everything up from turtles to bullets to fish clearly however he is not gaining any weight nor does he excrete anything whereas he does if you eat too many berries also the berries why aren't they poisoned that's what i'd do if i was bowser does yoshi transform any enemy he eats to an alternate dimension maybe the one where the flying fish come from what about power ups if he eats a shroom for example shouldn't that benefit him instead of mario also if you get hit by an enemy you fall off yoshi whereas you can fly swim and the like without ever losing him how does yoshi know when to throw off mario if he does his turning jump since mario doesn't start turning until he leaves yoshi's back how come that the colored yoshi are stronger but start as babies and the green one is mature when he hatches also as green is a mixture of blue and yellow why doesn't he have the powers of both colours flight and stomp yoshi's power is a bottlemless pit of a stomace and he can turn what he eats into eggs BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Animal Crossing The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Banjo-Kazooie The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items RuneScape locations The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Gaia Online RuneScape quests Homestar Runner Koholint Island Kingdom Hearts GunBound Chocobo Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Avalanche Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Dig Dug Seiken Densetsu 3 Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Halloween (film) The Legend of Zelda series characters The Inside Banjo-Tooie RuneScape Mini-Games Pok__mon (video games) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) One Piece minor characters Rainbow Islands Mario Link (Legend of Zelda) Boktai 2: Solar Boy Django Resident Evil 4 Wario Land 3 Pok__mon Zelda II: The Adventure of Link The Legend of Zelda series enemies Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus Fable: The Lost Chapters Ark of the Covenant 'M Missingno.
