who is better in ssbm who is better at super smash bros melee than all the other characters it really depends on how you fight the bigger characters are slower but can take a beating they are used for getting in the middle of the fight dk is my favorite for this type as he can take a beating and moves fairly quick for a large type he doesn't have any long range attacks though for medium size characters they can fight almost anywhere link is okay but i think he is a little slow i like samus cause of her long medium and short range attacks and she is fairly quick light characters usually fight at the side lines or from a distance i personally like fox for this one he is extremely fast and has many ranged and powerful attacks he cannot take a beating so you got to watch him kirby is also good as he can jump for a distance but he is even lighter then fox hope this helps Pok__mon (video games) Starmie Lugia Pok__mon Emerald Sevii Islands Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Professional wrestling slang Misty (Pok__mon) Cheating in poker RuneScape cheats Pok__mon Abilities EverQuest Heat (professional wrestling) Ninetales Pok__mon (anime) Super Smash Bros.
