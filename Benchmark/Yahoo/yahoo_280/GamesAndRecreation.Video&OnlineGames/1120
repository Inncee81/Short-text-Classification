is it broken i want to play my pokemon emerald but when i switch to on the screen says gameboy but not advanced and it wont play when i use ds the gameboy slot button says ds option pak inserted is there anyway i can fix this cuz this game has all my good pokemon on it it's possible that the cartridge is merely in need of cleaning try taking a somewhat diluted bit of alcohol and rubbing the cartridge contacts with a soft cloth or napkin with a smooth surface do not use cotton swabs they tend to leave behind fuzz on the cart if that doesn't work try removing the cartridge powering up the ds then inserting the cart or try a different gb game in the slot to make sure that the problem is not the ds itself if these suggestions do not work i would go to a local game retailer a specialty store like gamestop or game crazy and ask for help if all that fails you may just have to replace the cart Game Boy Game Boy Advance Nintendo DS Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo 64 Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire N-Gage Drill bit Pok__mon (video games) Floppy disk Sega Saturn PlayStation 2 Nintendo Super Nintendo Entertainment System Screw Cartridge (electronics) Gramophone record Missingno.
