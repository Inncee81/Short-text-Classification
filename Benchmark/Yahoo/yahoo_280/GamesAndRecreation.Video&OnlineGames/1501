i dont get why game roms got to be illegal thats stupid i hurd that game roms for downloading are illegal first off they say that you need to own the original game to download the rom wtf are they retarded why would some one download a game they already have cuz they dont own a copy of the game thats why so its something new to keep and play do they not realize that dumb asses and if there so illegal then why do they let you play thes same so called illegal games on this web site http www games com wtf so its not illegal to play those ones but illegal to download them then play them what a load of shhhiiiiiit if you really think about it it's on the line of piracy the video games companies need to keep track of every single game that's sold to they can continue to make profits it's like how the music industry has to keep track off all the songs downloaded at certain websites if everyone tried to download their songs from pirated sites then there will be any companies for new talent it's like a ripple effect once something disturbs the norm everything gets affected of course i'm being a hypocrite because i download music and games without paying so i'm just as much in the wrong meh go figure Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life Harvest Moon series The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town Aida (musical) Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable The Shining (film) Trapped in the Closet The Drew Carey Show The Penultimate Peril Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Mid-Autumn Festival Porgy and Bess Lumen Gentium The Jazz Singer Avenue Q Ministry of Magic The Tale of Genji The Marriage of Figaro Signs The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sin City Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
