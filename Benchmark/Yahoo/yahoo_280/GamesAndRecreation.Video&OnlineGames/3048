pokemon pearl who should be on my team i've just started with pearl and i chose piplup i want a shinx and a starly on my team but i have no idea what else i should catch or if shinx and starly are even good choices anybody got suggestions shinx and starly are great choices shinx becomes the powerful luxray which learns many great moves like thunderbolt and discharge whereas starly becomes a strong and agile staraptor which can learn close combat and brave bird at higher levels i also suggest a ponyta to become a rapidash so you have something that knows flare blitz and also a roselia or the pre evolved form so you later get a strong and deadly roserade this mistress of death can learn powerful moves like vine whip and giga drain and is great at tormenting enemies with stat changers and effect moves but is also amazing at dishing out great amounts of damage finally i suggest a machop they are simple at first but if you level it up and get the right tms you can teach it moves like drain punch aura sphere and focus blast giving this monster a powerful arsenal of heavy combat moves hope i could help p s george p that was useless besides these pokemon pwn when you put them together and balance them p s s parukia that's a good idea but the fact that each capture is so spread out is a flaw besides she chose piplup why get a buoysel United States Postal Service Post office Internet fraud Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Postage stamp Envelope Mail United Parcel Service Entertainment Software Rating Board ZIP Code Computer and video games Amazon.com Website Postmark Rocket mail Mail carrier Cable television Private Express Statutes Python programming language Back to the Future trilogy Mozilla Firefox Web traffic Post Office box Glossary of American football Ferranti-Packard Google CD and DVD packaging FedEx Corporation Jack Thompson Electronic Arts Final Fantasy VI Online marketing E-mail spam Sega Dreamcast Cardboard Commodore 64 Dennis Rader Virus SUSE Linux Canada Post Pizza delivery Online DVD rental MOS Technology 6502 Kansas Gettysburg Address Search engine optimization USS Barbero (SS-317) Mac OS X The Internet Movie Database Finance Postcode Xbox Steganography Six degrees of separation World Wide Web Computer and video game packaging Particle in a box Tristan da Cunha Chevrolet Camaro Sega Saturn Regional lockout National Weather Service Alien (film) Royal Mail Advertising Copyright The Inside IGN EverQuest Yahoo!
