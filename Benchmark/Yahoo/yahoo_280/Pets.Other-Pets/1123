how good of a pet is a ferrett are farretts are good pets for teenagers yrs are they friendly loyal fun and playful how long do they live for ferrets are very good pets i have two of them two girls that i rescued from a local shelter they are clean and quiet animals nap a lot but always willing to wake up and play depending on the ferret you have you might end up with a cuddly ferret they are highly inquisitive and friendly creatures and very very very entertaining i wish i had enough room to describe some of their antics ferrets live about seven to nine years as far as them being good pets for teenagers i would say that it depends more on your teenager are they responsible because ferret cages require daily cleaning and the ferrets themselves need daily ferret fun time out of the cage and time to bond with their owners as well ferrets should also be bathed no more than every other week to help keep that musky scent less noticeable they are definately better for teenagers then they are young children because ferrets will inevitably play bite especially your feet if they are in socks ferrets also work well together in pairs as they keep each other entertained and company while you are away plus it's really funny to watch two ferrets wrestle and hop after each other good luck keep shiny objects and crinkly papers out of their reach or they will develop a cache of hidden objects under your beds Ferret Pet skunk Fancy rat Hamster Cat Domestic rabbit Dog Pet Have I Got News For You Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Hunting Garfield Rabies Rabbit Ren and Stimpy Spidey Super Stories Microchip implant (animal) Static Shock Professional wrestling match types Sumo Hedgehog Full House Chinchilla Emergency preparedness Social rule SpongeBob SquarePants Housebreaking Professional wrestling slang Animal communication Dragon Booster Working dog Saki Ai Yori Aoshi Fast bowling RuneScape quests Mickie James The Fairly OddParents Skunk Adam West Rabbits in Australia Pinky and the Brain FoxTrot Bat Boy Dilbert Oswald the Lucky Rabbit Salad Fingers Customs and etiquette of Japan American Black Bear Hip hop rivalries Monkey Kodocha Golden Retriever Obedience training Stuffed animal Gaia Online Kim Possible Hermione Granger One Piece minor characters Rais massacre GoldenEye 007 Calvin and Hobbes John Cage Milton H.
