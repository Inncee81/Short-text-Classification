aggressive hamster my brother used to have a hamster when he was a kid i remember they were cudly little things and maybe in its years of life he got bit once or twice i also had one for a few months now we decided to have one as a pet for our girls years old and y o we brought it home and it is very aggressive in the first hour it has already bitten my husband twice my y o is terrified from the screaching sounds it makes i am no longer comfortable to handle it we are thinking of taking it back to exchange it for another with a much softer character i have never seen or heard a hamster do this as much as i know it needs time to get used to us after a day it shows aggressivenes it gets very nervous and stands up on its legs immediately to defend itself i don't want my daughter around it because i don't want her bit is this actually normal maybe we should go for a ferret but those are pretty expensive has anyone seen a hamster that screaches and bites this much we went last week to the pet store and they didn't have any they said during the week so we think this is a small young hamster but my husband isn't so convinced as it is not as small as a baby but not as big he thinks it has been previously handled too he already has a bad impression with it and i doubt we will take the time to train it most likely we want to go with one that is cudly for a small child we want one that will enjoy being handled it might not have been properly handled when younger and isn't used to humans where did you get the hamster there's also a possibility that it's sick so i'd keep an eye on it to make sure it's behaving normally when in the cage hamsters are more likely than other rodents to develop behavioral problems but it's strange for one to behave abnormally on the first day let alone that aggressively if you do decide to get another hamster be sure to handle it first to make sure it reacts normally and doesn't bite Hamster Social rule Ferret The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Shaggy dog story Dog training Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind EastEnders Rabies Pet skunk Butters Stotch Kodocha Neighbours Friends Poker jargon Fancy rat Characters in the Smurfs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stuttering Dog Childbirth Guinea pig Breastfeeding The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Debugging Pitaten Hey Jude The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kim Possible Timmy Turner Humphrey Bogart Salad Fingers Floppy disk Garfield Piccolo Junior Saga The Fairly OddParents The Catcher in the Rye Oasis (band) Cephalic disorder The Adventures of Pete & Pete Sin City Golden Hamster Phoebe Halliwell Joy Division (band) Cat Spidey Super Stories Empire Burlesque Haven (TNG episode) Pet Sounds Vegeta Ranma __ characters W.I.T.C.H.
