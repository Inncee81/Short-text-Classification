how do you trim a pot bellied pigs hooves my gals are due for their first trim and i have made an appointment with our vet however i'm wondering what the usual way to have it done is there is no way that my pigs will let anyone trim on them while they are awake is it normal for a trimmer to sedate a pig before trimming i called a bunch of farriers about this but none will deal with cloven hoof animals what do other pig owners do can you train a pig to be calm when getting trimmed ok you shouldnt sedate a pig just to trim them but the way you do it is to get two or more people because you have to flip them onto their back they'll scream a lot but you have to do it so wear ear plugs if you're not used to the noise if you live anywhere near pennsylvania you could call my aunt for an appointment but if not you could call just for advice i'll leave the website Horseshoe Domestic rabbit Taboo food and drink Guinea pig Pig Sin City Poker jargon Bookbinding Mickey Mouse Animal Farm Bacon Mad Money Betting (poker) Ferret Spirited Away Equine conformation Three Little Pigs RuneScape economy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Charles Darwin Pet skunk Kosher foods Cobra Commander The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Pottery Nu people Stud poker Ford Crown Victoria Extreme Championship Wrestling Foot-and-mouth disease Horse Invader Zim Haircut Cat Coin flipping Unclean animals Pink Floyd Gal__pagos Islands Comanche Ear Microchip implant (animal) Coprophagia Horse gait Livestock Show hunter Texas hold 'em Porky Pig Recurring South Park characters Gag (BDSM) Diving Flight controls The Legend of Zelda series enemies Ford Explorer The Inside Star Trek: The Original Series Insomnia Gramophone record Looney Tunes: Back In Action Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stairway Treehouse of Horror V Garfield Sarmatians Animals (album) Cardiac arrhythmia Warrant Officer Tex Avery Stereoscopy Stoat Some Enchanted Evening (Simpsons episode) Oldsmobile Pitaten Suplex Protective clothing Laminitis Havanese Antipsychotic Ainu people Snooker Computer animation Out-of-body experience Armoured personnel carrier Lisa the Vegetarian Howard Hughes Tiny Toon Adventures Veterans Stadium Diazepam Pig (zodiac) Animal testing Strap-on dildo Scream (film) Oakland Athletics Pet Hearing aid Earring Mooney M20 Book of Isaiah Social rule Housebreaking Mammal
