is my rabbit pregnant my rabbit keeps on resting and growing so i dont know if shes on her growspert or not i thought she was a netherland dwarf but then she's more like a mix of a netherland dwarf and a mini rex please help me the male died a couple days before i thought she was pregnant so i don't know what to do and also she lives in a cage so if she is pregnant tell me what kind of box i should put in the cage oh and this was unexpectablly so i didnt know it was supposed to happen the male was her brother i didnt know when she was pregnant sorry there is something you can do called palpatation or palpating this is when you feel the doe's underside for kits however if you do this incorrectly or too rough strongly you can damage the kits so this is not recommended without practice the surest way to find out if your rabbit is pregnant is to wait days if your rabbit does not deliver within this time she is not pregnant or has reabsorbed her litter one sign that your rabbit might be pregnant is if she carries nesting materials to a certain place and or if she starts pulling her underbelly fur and nesting with that she will be gaining weight of course she will also begin to pluck out her fur and build a warm nest for her babies make sure there's a box or something in her hutch to make sure the babies are suitably warm you might also notice a change in her eating habits and her social manners she might be drinking more water or eating more food than normal she may also change personalities completely a little or even not at all if she's normally nice she might become mean don't hold it against her she's just being maternal and making sure she can protect her babies when they're born a couple weeks after mating put her to the male again under close supervision if she refuses him chances are shes pregnant the most reliable way is to palpate her abdomen this technique is difficult to learn for someone who does not frequently breed a lot of rabbits because it takes practice when it was been days to two weeks past the breeding date i will place the doe on a non slip surface facing me and i will put my right hand over her ears and shoulders then i will place my left hand palm up under the abdomen just in front of the pelvic bones i will gently press upward with my fingers while pressing in from the side with my thumb this will bring the embryos if any into position between my thumb and fingers they feel something like grapes and are about that size or larger having detected the developing kits i will discontinue and return the doe to her cage i will not palpate the rabbit's left side with my right hand because it is too easy to mistake a kidney for a kit on that side you can also check the doe's vent if she is in the early stages of pregnancy her vent is usually small and pale though she may pink up again towards the end of her day pregnancy always check again on the th day after breeding if there is only fetus you may have missed it at weeks or the doe may have re absorbed her litter it is a good idea to leave a nest box with the doe just in case she is pregnant but keeping it a secret Pregnancy Breastfeeding Dog Breech birth Guinea pig Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Urinary incontinence Fancy rat Obstetrics Days of our Lives Fast bowling Harp Platypus Poker jargon Chicken Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Friends Abortion Cephalic disorder Kakapo Elephant Diving Social rule Cat Menstrual cup Aerial (dance move) Boxing M16 (rifle) Ferret Frogman Stuttering Knife Rabbit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Miscarriage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gesture Fertility awareness European Rabbit Knots Landing Psoriasis Fecal incontinence Violin Sexual reproduction Double bass Childbirth Humphrey Bogart Tetrapod Coeliac disease Japanese tea ceremony Spider Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Skateboarding trick Magic (illusion) Tarantula Menstrual cycle Abortion in the United States Trapping Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Oral sex Red Squirrel Milton H.
