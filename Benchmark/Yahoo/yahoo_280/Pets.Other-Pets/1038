gerbil help my dad wants me to wait till school starts to get a gerbil but i want one today ive been doing extra chores and im gonna buy it with my own money my dads at work so how can i convince my mom to take me i have been waiting and a half years for this i have gerbils maybe you should tell your parents some facts like thisinteresting facts about gerbils origins the common pet gerbil originated in mongolia they became so numerous there that the mongolian people could no longer sleep at night because the gerbils were constantly running on their squeaky little exercise wheels taking heed of p t barnum's advice the mongolians shipped all of the gerbils to the united states where gullible consumers bought them as pets mongolia is now one of the richest and quietest countries in the world gnawing like all rodents a gerbil's front teeth are constantly growing so it must chew on things to keep them filed down to sharp points they can chew through metal with ease sort of like if you or i were to chew on a steel girder in fact the word rodent is latin for ouch that must really hurt ecological impact gerbils originally lived in the desert and can cause great harm if released in warm climates california and new mexico have laws against importing gerbils despite these laws some gerbils have escaped into the wild where they have bred like rabbits in the southwestern united states it is now very common to see roving packs of feral gerbils taking down full grown cattle suitable cages since gerbils are so good at chewing care must be taken in selecting an appropriate cage so that your pets will not be able to escape wood and plastic cages will not last very long the best type of cage is a glass aquarium with a tightfitting lid many first time gerbil owners forget to drain the water out of the aquarium and soon discover that gerbils being desert animals are not very good swimmers luckily gerbils are very inexpensive to replace bedding material many pet stores sell cedar and pine shavings for small animal bedding while these may be sufficient for a mere hamster or guinea pig gerbils prefer shredded dollar bills this bedding should be changed daily nesting material gerbils build nests to provide shelter and to keep warm while sleeping many people give their gerbils bits of burlap or cotton fabric which are quickly shredded into a warm fluffy nest however researchers have found that gerbils prefer angora sweaters and silk dresses for nesting material feeding habits pet gerbils are usually fed a mixture of seeds grains and rabbit pellets in the wild however gerbils prefer steak caviar lobster thermidor and p t de foie gras gout is very common among wild gerbils communication gerbils rarely squeak usually you can only hear them if they are fighting or frightened scientists have discovered that gerbils actually communicate quite frequently but since it is ultrasonic we cannot hear it using sophisticated recording instruments these scientists have been able to slow these sounds so that they fall within the normal range of human hearing they have reported that gerbils spend most of their time saying turn me on dead man and i buried paul recreational facilities many gerbil owners provide their pets with playwheels and mistakenly believe that they have satisfied their gerbils' exercise needs nothing could be further from the truth an adult gerbil requires a bare minimum of a treadmill stair climber exercise bike and free weights an occasional round of golf is also quite beneficial Cat Chinchilla Textile manufacturing Dog Mattress Foie gras Livestock Plastic Meriones unguiculatus Ferret Recurring South Park characters Tooth Falconry Animal communication House Mouse Milk Pet skunk Futurama (TV series - season 5) Gramophone record Energy development Illegal drug trade Terminal ballistics Capercaillie Welding Drill bit Seabird Japanese tea ceremony Chicken Shaggy dog story Horse Tyrannosaurus rex Domestication Mouse (computing) Gray Wolf Dog training Taboo food and drink Rabbit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) STS-62 Gerbil Agriculture Poker jargon Organic farming Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Professional wrestling match types Strap-on dildo Internal ballistics Rodent The Amber Spyglass Calvin and Hobbes Introduced species Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Breastfeeding European Rabbit Kim Possible Jute Fish farming Vermicompost Kangaroo Fishing Alcoholic beverage Explosive material Bulk vending Kosher foods Money Biodiversity Mojave people Infantilism Undergarment Coffee RuneScape quests Conker's Bad Fur Day Olduwan Shrimp farm Thermoregulation Capitalism Tarantula Tobacco Autonomous building Bird Sento Casting Tooth enamel Stock car (rail) Brown Rat Goldfish Nuclear reactor E85 Trapping
