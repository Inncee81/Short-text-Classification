about the movie flicka ive heard alot of rumor from multiple people that a or horses were worked to death playing flicka it sounds like a stupid rumor but does anyone kknow if this is true years ago movie standards regarding cruelty to animals were non existant several 'big' movies that featured real animal deaths called this problem to light and the current standards were set in place some of these titles were tom horn a horse is tripped into a full somersault while galloping and breaks its neck patton a bridge is blown up and mules fall over the side the mules were shot and their bodies used for effect apocalypse now a water buffalo is hacked to death with a machete to illustrate a native ritual modern movies must pass the standards set by the aspca and the aha that's why you see so many horses used to play one role they used to play cisco in dances with wolves one of those horses is retired and lives at a tourist attraction called 's town in south dakota the flicka incident was investigated and found to be terrible accidents the 'mis step' by the one horse was kind of like the bad step that barbaro took in the preakness stakes and was unforseeable i suppose the people who allowed the leadline to trip the other horse were being negligent but it was proven not to be intentional i despise any form of animal cruelty for entertainment and do my own investigating when i hear about it so i did look into this but rest assured the standards set for movies these days are sooooo much better than what used to happen now for laughs check out this old and famous clip http www youtube com watch v rkpgs vwm this is a trained 'falling horse ' play it again and watch the rider cue the horse by tugging the rein it's amazing what you can accomplish with animals when you train them properly and have a little consideration ps blazing saddles this movie was given an a ok rating by the aspca this movie features dozens of horses and not one was harmed including this fellow that got 'punched out' lol Horse Equine conformation Horse gait Western (genre) Bullfighting Fox hunting Professional wrestling throws Cowboy Crazy Horse Martial art GunZ The Duel Paul Is Dead Life insurance AFI 100 Years series The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Unicorn Iditarod Whose Line Is It Anyway?
