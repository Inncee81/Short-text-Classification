should i trust korean grass enough to feed it to my rabbit this isn't anything racist as i'm half korean myself but my rabbit ran out of food and it'll take about an hour to get to the mall to buy her some food driving distance and i don't have a drivers license yet anyhow most apartment buildings i've moved in had pesticides or something to kill off the bugs on the grass which is harmful for my rabbit well recently i just moved into an apartment in a rural area should i trust the grass anyway probably not i say this because you mentioned people use a lot of pesticides where you live you could go up to a neighbor's home and ask if you can cut some grass for your rabbit don't just take it you would then be reasonably sure there is no poison on it make sure you ask the neighbor about poison though first there is most likely even more poison if there are farms around be careful this is a good question by the way i wonder if others who own bunnies and give them grass ever think about this in my apartments they just put pesticides everywhere have a nice day Rabbit Foodborne illness Who Framed Roger Rabbit Lawn Domestic rabbit Pesticide Fox hunting Bugs Bunny Gypsy moth Urban sprawl Pesticide misuse Poker jargon Poison Theory of conduct Guinea pig Famine Golf Chicken Livestock Mosquito Vegetarianism DDT Pok__mon types Avenue Q Pok__mon Abilities Factory farming Diseases of the honeybee Mid-Autumn Festival Taikyoku shogi Falconry Atlanta metropolitan area Newark, New Jersey Bedbug Pacific, Missouri Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hunting Kevin and Kell Agriculture Green Revolution Urbanization Taboo food and drink Richard Chase Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Tiny Toon Adventures Kangaroo Pesticide toxicity to bees Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Food Hare Lechaina Steven Wright Pollinator decline Johnny the Homicidal Maniac RuneScape skills Alcohol fuel Social rule Beatrix Potter The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Paiute Sluggy Freelance Baseball Have I Got News For You Biological pest control Shaggy dog story Atlanta child murders Elis Prefecture All in the Family Downtown Cleveland Milwaukee, Wisconsin RuneScape Random Events Surveillance Weed Agricultural policy Agricultural machinery Mark Guglielmo Insect Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan Hay Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Albuquerque, New Mexico Genetic engineering Reliant Astrodome Current teachings of Prem Rawat Firefighter Chinese calendar Wall Street Vermicompost Humphrey Bogart Helen and Scott Nearing Kennywood Taxi Driver Pulp Fiction Manhunt (video game) Dioxin WFOR-TV Reservoir Dogs Sampling (music) Hartford, Connecticut Ultima Online
