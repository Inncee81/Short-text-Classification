my ferret is about now hes eating and drinking ok but he keeps falling over to one side hes been like this for about weeks now ive cleaned his ears out i think he might of had ear mites but he still falls over mainly to his left side falling over to one side reflects a poor balance we refer to it as vestibular disease the organ responsible for the balance is the middle ear therefore taking into consideration the fact that your ferret has had ear mites recently i think it is very likely he is suffering from a middle ear infection i recommend to stop using any liquid formulation into the ears which will make matter worse and consult a vet Ear Guinea pig Balance disorder M__ni__re___s disease Ferret Allergy Diseases of the honeybee Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Rabies Vestibular system Spatial disorientation Cerebellum Hearing impairment Pet skunk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scabies Labyrinthitis Body piercing Nutrition Sensation Heartworm Hyperglycemia Diarrhea Otitis externa Urinary incontinence Common cold Otitis media Influenza Prostate cancer Psoriasis Mange Hedgehog Charles Ives Fiddler on the Roof Rocky Mountain spotted fever Stomach cancer Dog Biological pest control Asthma Congenital disorder Water Breastfeeding Folic acid Alcoholism Dieting Brain Omega-3 fatty acid Violin Rosacea Hypoglycemia Traumatic brain injury International Monetary Fund Paget's disease of bone Alcoholics Anonymous Medicine Cancer Veterinarian Tattoo Breast cancer Fecal incontinence Neurofibromatosis type II Chronic fatigue syndrome Domestic rabbit Keynesian economics Chicken Sin City Multiple sclerosis Democracy Al-Razi Book of Isaiah Carbon dioxide Chemotherapy Docking Hearing aid Myxobolus cerebralis Parasitology Eye Dog agility Virus Anorexia nervosa Honeybee Methamphetamine Marathon (sport) The Time Machine Ataxia telangiectasia Tick Poliomyelitis Robert B__r__ny Escherichia coli O157:H7 Schistosomiasis Coeliac disease Cat Antidepressant Kakapo Diving Precautionary principle Hepatitis C Killian documents
