rabbits considerion im considering getting a rabbit how big of a cage do i need how can i exsrise my rabbit what is a good diet for my rabbit i have a herd of healthy and happy rabbits some are pets others are breeding and show rabbits this is what i do all of my rabbits are in wire cages some people will tell you these are bad but as long as the wire is properly sized and in good shape it will not do any harm to the rabbit you always want to get the absolute largest cage you can afford for a small medium rabbit it should be a minimum of inches long and inches wide and tall enough for the rabbit to stand on it's hind legs without hitting it's head about there are other cage options out there that you can explore check out nic cages do a google search as a neat alternative for an indoor cage i prefer the wire cages because they are economical easy to find easy to keep clean comfortable and provide excellent ventillation very important for bunny health exercise can be provided several ways toys for the rabbit to play with in and out of it's cage are a good start as is some out of cage time to run around a room in the house you want to 'bunny proof' the room which is much like puppy or baby proofing it no spaces to get behind furniture no dangerous chemicals or plants no wires because rabbits will chew them some rabbits even take to being walked on a harness so you can stroll around the yard with them there is a lot of debate on diet rabbits do not need veggies as part of their diet as some people will claim but that is one way you can feed them this is what has worked with my herd for years unlimited fresh clean and cool water daily grass hay timothy sudan bermuda etc no alfalfa hay alfalfa based pellets ounce per pound of weight a four pound rabbit gets ounces of pellets daily i also give mine an occasional slice of apple or banana as a treat they love it as a side note i encourage you not to get a rabbit from a pet store instead try to find a breeder or rescue local to you you can visit http www arba net photo htm to see breeds of rabbits and learn more about them by clicking on the picture Fancy rat Ferret Dog Chinchilla Livestock Dairy Rabbit Alfalfa Strap-on dildo Cat Organic farming RuneScape quests Chair Hamburger Breastfeeding Mattress Champagne (beverage) Canary McDonald's Chicken Shotgun Animal testing Hydrogen economy Dog training Falconry Working dog Horse German Shepherd Dog Pet skunk Coffee Care Bears Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Domestic goat Energy development Peanut Horse gait Fire fighting Trapping Textile manufacturing Quake III Arena Agriculture Asthma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Dobermann Laws of cricket Kevin and Kell Marching band Potato Mealy Parrot Hay fever U.S. customary units Goldfish Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Broomball Illegal drug trade Bread Sento Mixed martial arts Bonsai Dieting Siberian Husky Fish farming United States Postal Service Super Size Me Bass guitar Organic food Alcoholic beverage Carbon dioxide Cannabis cultivation Menstrual cup Swimming pool Australian Cattle Dog IPod Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Open access Bugs Bunny Kangaroo Dog agility Volleyball Sesame Street Vegetarianism Discus (fish) Fugu Fusion power Explosive material Prostate cancer Welding
