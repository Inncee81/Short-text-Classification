animal cruelty these bastards that do it my daughter just showed me a clip on youtube of a pony with very neglected hooves the people who do this just get a fine and a ban on keeping animals what would you do to them i would lock them in a grotty stable and leave them standing in their own mess for a few months i know that is not going to happen but it really upset me seeing that animal horse owner i work for the rspca and we try to bring all perpetrators to justice the law changed in april and was enforced march that gives us greater power to step in before an animal is dying we have had a percent success rate last year in prosecutions against people who inflict cruelty on animals and percent were sentenced to spend time in prison when some one abuses an animal they don't think about what they are doing they take away an animals rights dignity and well being because a animal cant talk back they think its ok to abuse them because they are a lesser being in my eyes an animal has equal rights if i had my way all perpetrators would have the same done to them as they did to a defenceless animal we see horrific sights cats drowned in rivers dogs with fireworks that have been tied to them that go off half killing the animal or even killing it horses and ponies so starved they have to be put down rats and hamsters flung out to fend for them selves in the wild we need government funding to help our society and then more action can be taken against these people who make animals lives hell prison is not good enough they do time then get released if we inflicted the pain on these people then they would think twice about hurting another animal and would know how it feels to be tortured scared and in pain Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Capital punishment Animal rights Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Torture Rape Cruelty to animals People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Fox hunting Animal Liberation Front Zoophilia EastEnders Fathers' rights Sin City Spanking Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Horse Domestic violence Theory of conduct Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Corporal punishment Divorce Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Equine conformation The Death Gate Cycle Satanic ritual abuse New Order (Indonesia) Charles Graner Uses of torture in recent times Arguments for and against drug prohibition Karla Homolka Human rights in the United States Pitaten Caligula Peter Singer Animal welfare Nigeria Cat YuYu Hakusho Speciesism The Holocaust Social rule Abortion debate Breaker Morant Kodocha Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Days of our Lives Weathermen Utilitarianism Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Social justice Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Babylonian law Serial killer Knife Nuanced voices on the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Polygamy Professional wrestling holds Animal Farm Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Status of religious freedom in Iran Simone Weil Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Camp Delta Project MKULTRA Columbine High School massacre Animal liberation movement Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Consensual crime The Shining (film) Feral cat Vietnam Veterans Against the War Abu Ghraib prison True Crime: Streets of LA History of South Africa in the apartheid era Palestinian National Authority Lynching in the United States Terri Schiavo Slavery Toledo Strip Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Cockfight Kangaroo Texas Ranger Division Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Hamster Amnesty International Bill Clinton
