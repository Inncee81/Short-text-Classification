pet raccoon names my best friend is going to get two raccoons one for her and one for her sister they've been looking for names for them they don't yet know the gender but any suggestions they've been doing research and according to them it's legal here raccoons do not make good pets they are 'cute' as babies but they are not domesticated selectively bred over many generations for traits that allow them to live with humans they will instinctively want to breed the vast majority will get mean even if neutered and most will get grossly obese even if not neutered in my experience as a wildlife and exotic veterinarian most of these animals end up in small cages outside after the first couple of years and have poor quality of life always gotten with the best intentions but a horrible end oh and did i mention that they smell read 'reek' when they reach adulthood worse if not neutered very attractive to racoons of the opposite sex but not to human noses think tomcat urine spray smell and one last small 'fun' fact is if they ever bite nip anyone even their owners they will have to be euthanized and have their brains submitted for rabies testing there is not an approved quarantine period or approved vaccines for pet raccoon all raccoons that bite people wild or pet must be tested Pet skunk Dog Cat Rabies Ferret Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Spotted Skunk Feral cat Raccoon Fancy rat Garfield Kitten Transsexuality Monkey Bat Human sexual behavior Hamster Infantilism Cuteness Pit bull Physical attractiveness Friends Veterinarian Domestication Housebreaking Microchip implant (animal) Animal communication Animal testing Biology and sexual orientation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Animal euthanasia Artificial selection The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Rabbit Docking Rat Dog breed Trademark Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Puma Zoo Pig Gender Bulgarian language Castration West Nile virus Chagas disease H5N1 Livestock Pneumonia Animal shelter The Beach Boys Genetically modified food Exotic pet Spanish nouns House Mouse Gender identity Plant breeding The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Animal rights European Rabbit Socialization Human Sterilization (surgical procedure) Gender role Gerald Durrell Gray Wolf Ebola German Shepherd Dog Minor Harry Potter Beasts Domestication of the horse Controversies in autism Motivation Tuberculosis Guns, Germs, and Steel Working dog Island Fox Pet store Intelligence quotient Sin City Pet Sounds Labrador Retriever Greyhound Azumanga Daioh Biodiversity Axolotl Canary Kevin and Kell Maine Coon Kender Care Bears Domestic goat Bish__jo game Quarantine Dog show
