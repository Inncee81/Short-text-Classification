what could possibly be killing my chickens ok first off i live in north western missouri near kansas city i live in the country and i own chickens this week i have lost one rooster and two chickens but i am not sure what could possibly be killing them i have found all three headless but not eaten lying in the chicken coop the one that died last night her head was still near the body what kind of crazy evil animal would just kill for the fun of it we have coyotes that run the back part of my acreage but they would eat the whole chicken right and possibly more than one at a time i am stumped i do have my chickens locked up at night very securely but theses last times my chickens were killed my kids forgot to latch but they did shut the door what do you think it is trust me i will double triple check the coop everynight but i just want to know who the culprit may possibly be i would really like to eliminate them please any suggestions my friend what you have is an owl that is attacking your chickens that is their calling card they leave their prey headless they also attack ducks and geese and any other fowl life that you may have in your barnyard the reason owls take the head is for the brain its rich in vitamins i know how you feel i had an owl problem my self i scared him off by going outside into the barnyard at am in my nightgown don't know who was more frightened him or me good luck Chicken Trapping Mike the Headless Chicken Goosebumps Mickey Mouse U.S. Acres Tyrannosaurus rex The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Shining (film) Bird YuYu Hakusho Phoebe Buffay's songs The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Glen Jacobs Cat Megas XLR Joke The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe M.A.U.R.I.C.E.
