parakeet nesting box i bought a nest box for my parakeets and i dont know if its any good it looks like the one in the link http www smarter com bird bedding product review pr ci pi html the problem is my birds always go on top of it and try to carve it out they never try to go inside of it i was wondering if the box should have a perch on the outside or inside because my parakeets box has a perch in the inside and why they keep on trying to carve it out do you think i should add soft material on the bottom i did not look at the box you have posted from experience though a perch outside is a good thing the female or the male will sit outside and feed the other adult inside from the perch and also sing to it inside the box the bottom of the box should have a small cavity carved out of it and things for the babies to grab onto with their feet when they hatch wire grating works just make sure there are no sharp edges otherwise they will get 'splay legged' and will not be able to walk or sit on a perch Drill bit Wood carving Hamster Perch Dinosaur Monk Parakeet Mattress The Time Machine Woodworking Trapping Kakapo Seabird Wood Duck Falconry Cascading Style Sheets Chicken HyperText Transfer Protocol Professional wrestling aerial techniques Auk Quotation mark Roxette Casting Knife World Wide Web Poker jargon Swingout Kylie Minogue Punt (boat) Budgerigar HTML element Snowboard Ostrich Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Domestic rabbit Barbed wire Peregrine Falcon Leatherback Sea Turtle Rose-ringed Parakeet Musk Duck Ant Vermicompost Glossary of climbing terms Tyrannosaurus rex Long Path Sea-Monkey Professional wrestling match types Anne Murray Netsuke RuneScape quests Peafowl The Empty Child Reptile African Fish Eagle Textile manufacturing Futurama (TV series - season 5) European Nightjar Platypus Sesame Street Japanese tea ceremony Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling holds Cock (chicken) Nile crocodile Red-cockaded Woodpecker Slashdot trolling phenomena Equine conformation American Kestrel The Inside Passerine Mealy Parrot Alexandrine Parakeet Jennifer Lopez Scarlet's Walk Diseases of the honeybee Richard Bowdler Sharpe Skateboarding trick Nighthawk U2 (band) Chair Plum-headed Parakeet Electrophysiology Dairy Northern Mockingbird Roswell UFO incident Shaggy dog story Violin Sleep Diving Cello Pumpkinseed Emu Strap-on dildo Comanche The Star Wars Holiday Special Diving suit Loudspeaker Saw II Golden Perch Parrot
