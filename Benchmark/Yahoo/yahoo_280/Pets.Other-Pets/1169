how cheap is to cheap for a horse me and friends are going to open a ranch and to start out we are going to gvie trail rides and breed horses sooo the q is how cheap is to cheap for our first horses please only ppl with horse buying expirence or who own ranches i do have mill so that covers the money issue and i have been doing reserch since i was a child i know alll the finacal cost and also what are some of the best breeds to have p s i love horses and im not in this just for money i have a very good friend that's in the horse business he's a true professional he makes a living doing this it takes hard work and knowledge he buys horses everywhere horses that people can't keep anymore or afford auction horses even some are given to him at auction he usually buys a large trailer load of horses that people bring to auction off because they can't handle them can't afford them they're off the track horses are too old no one can ride them sick and lame horses horses that are incorrigible and mean dangerous horses or afford the vet bills etc he has hispanic cowboys ride the better horses to test their ability to be ridden trained and or resold the old sick incorrigible broken down horses go to slaughter for meat he used to rent horses out but the liability insurance was exorbitantly high he got sued because someone got hurt and that was it he quit renting horses out having rental horses is a huge responsibility and liability think twice there are people out there that will give older horses away to a good home most have leg or foot problems and come with huge vet bills for maintenance also you have to factor in the farrier horse shoer costs every weeks and averages and up x's the number of horses not cheap anymore call some farriers in your area and find out the cost for trims shoes on just the front or all around there are ranch prices if you have several horses and they are on the same weekly schedule plus vaccines every months routine wormings weeks supplements each horse needs tack and maintenance costs grooming supplies and equipment cleaning and feeding costs etc you must do you homework if you are going to get into this make your list and find out the costs involved each horse will have to be fed flakes of hay a day every hours a must bales of hay come with anywhere from flakes figure the cost of hay in your area feeding flakes a day average some will need more and add up x's the number of horses some horses can't tolerate alfalfa hay some will need oat or grass hay oat hay is more expensive horses off the track can be purchased rather inexpensively also there are rescues that have horses that need homes you can find them on the web in your area the rescues will know if a horse is green ranch broke trained for disciplines etc this is probably your best option they don't ask a lot of money for these horses unless they come with papers etc then they are very reasonable the bureau of land management has mustangs for adoption for you must keep them one year and sign a contract some are well broke they know which ones geldings are the best for trail riding safely although no horse is safe they are a large animal and can easily hurt injure or kill someone local animal shelters seize horses as well as the spca they ask nominal fees for adoption all come with the above costs involved in keeping horses you will never make money breeding horses unless you have awesome bloodlines that everyone wants race horses and arabs have some of the most expensive bloodlines stud fees can also be steep you have to show to get a name for yourself and your horse also expensive the vet bills for the mare and foal are very expensive if something goes wrong it can cost you a fortune in lay up costs rehab surgery etc one million won't be enough i can guarantee you that better stick with one horse hope this helps if you decide to go forward all i can say is good luck Livestock Equine conformation Cowboy Insurance Domestic
