how do i prevent my bunny from escaping into next door's garden i have two rabbits but one of them kept digging her way into next door's garden therefore i got some pieces of wood and fitted them below the fence line to prevent her from digging but she has figured out how to jump over the fence now it is only about foot high does anybody have any suggestions on how to prevent her from jumping over the fence other then building a bigger fence i don't believe in keeping rabbits in small enclosed spaces for long periods of the day thus a run is out of the question i don't know why she keeps escaping she is well cared for and my other rabbit does not try to escape are your bunnies spayed only reason i'm asking is i have does who do exactly the same thing and have a very similar set up mine are due to be spayed to stop alot of the escaping tendancies and also the free love of them is a escapologist the other just nests build i bet your does also give lots of love to each other and the one that is the main culprit for escaping is the who gives the most love i dug down ft and laid in chicken wire and also attatched it along the fence and then i got reed screening cheap from argos and i stapled it along the fence therefore making it ft high i also just stopped giving them a cage they now have the entire garage and garden lol they are looked after by their pet dogs who love them lots this has sorted it for my bunnies unless of course i leave something against the fence then thery're off again not ideal but it stops them getting stir crazy in a run Domestic rabbit Rabbit Guinea pig Trapping Hamster RuneScape quests Door Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Ferret Barbed wire European Rabbit Poker jargon Livestock Taikyoku shogi Equine conformation Dog Fancy rat Chicken Elevator Volleyball Fencing The Brady Bunch Fox hunting Spidey Super Stories Magic (illusion) Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Steel Cage Match Opportunity rover Stairway Eventing Garfield Shaggy dog story Gaia Online Wa shogi Escapology RuneScape economy Theory of conduct EastEnders Parkour Cat Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Falconry One Piece minor characters Fence Burning Man Israeli West Bank barrier Tag G-Man (Half-Life) Age of Mythology Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mobile Fighter G Gundam Seismic retrofit Pet skunk Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Amber Spyglass Agricultural fencing Justice (TNG episode) Easter Bunny The Dalek Invasion of Earth Science fiction on television Invader Zim Floppy disk Codename: Kids Next Door Sluggy Freelance Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Alaskan Malamute Mickey Mouse Table saw Baroque chess Guns N' Roses Bamboo Bunnie Rabbot Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Capercaillie Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Baseball Toronto Subway and RT Tai shogi Humphrey Bogart The Death Gate Cycle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Textile manufacturing Billiards Naval mine Meat Loaf Housebreaking Transformer KaBlam!
