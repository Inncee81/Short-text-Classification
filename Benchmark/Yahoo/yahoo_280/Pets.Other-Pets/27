why does it cost so much for the average joe to go into space i would imagine because it would be an pleasure trip instead of a business one space missons are mostly conducted for scientific expeditions currently there really is no profit in it for someone to randomly pay for space travel and burial in space is often just as pricey as far as i understand maybe when there is a reason to visit space more often like extraterrestrials or interplanetary colonization i don't see a person being able to get past the aeronatics administration much less the upper atmosphere aside from that it's not cost effective even if there is a purpose currently it still takes billions of dollars and years of planning and research for space exploration besides a flight to space is extremely stressful on the body it takes top condition and specialized training before and after the launch for astronauts and aeronautic engineers even when they are in zero g they have a specialize workout routine now if you're talking about those plane rides where they visit the ozone layer they aren't technically space flights since they never leave the atmosphere of the earth what they do is fly up high then free fall causing a sense of zero g not the actual removal of gravity just the effect of it they are very expensive because it takes specialized planning an inherent risk to be had i think they make you sign a waiver and they haven't really paid off the specialized plane they built just for the trip if you ask me i don't think this generation will see many stars beyond what you can view laying in your yard at night a sad fact for us all National Aeronautics and Space Administration Crew Exploration Vehicle Space exploration STS-62 Space Shuttle program International Space Station Terraforming Space colonization Space Race Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Gravity European Space Agency Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Colonization of the Moon Space elevator Ozone depletion Solar system Moon Jupiter Saturn V Hubble Space Telescope Ozone hole Weightlessness Cassini-Huygens Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Aircraft Space burial Scientology beliefs and practices Fermi paradox Mars Earth's atmosphere Unidentified flying object Space tourism Spacecraft propulsion Gliding National Weather Service Theory of conduct Apollo 15 Tide Project Orion Human adaptation to space Mir Flood geology Sun Solar power satellite Tier One Earth Venus Plame affair Exploration of Mars STS-107 Michael Griffin Planetary habitability Rocket Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Avalanche Scramjet Extraterrestrial life Insurance Galileo spacecraft Ozone layer Interplanetary travel Opportunity rover Broadband Internet access Life insurance Ionosphere Mercury (planet) Apollo 8 Cyberspace Helicopter Vulcan (Star Trek) Boeing X-43 STS-41 Causality Purdue University Global Positioning System STS-51-L STS-87 Space opera in Scientology doctrine Nuclear power Carl Sagan Science fiction film Model aircraft Public transport Solar variation Planet Mars Exploration Rover Car handling National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Robert Zubrin Decompression sickness David Leestma
