can guinea pig lice live on humans and rabbits i've just discovered my guinea pig has lice i inherited him a week ago and he's full grown but had been a bit unloved i thought his skin was flaky so took him to the vets last week the vet said he was fine and not to worry but i was stroking him today in an attempt to tame him and i can definitely see lice and have discovered a few bloody scabs i've made an appointment to go back to the vets tomorrow but in the meantime i'm wondering if i could get attacked by the lice from handling him or worse if i could transfer the lice from the guinea pig onto my rabbit as the rabbit lives indoors and the piggy outdoors he couldn't catch them directly just wondering if it's safe to handle my bunny tonight yes i agree the vet should have seen the lice but all that will happen to humans is the lice will bit you then jump off as they dont live on anything other than animales Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Fiddler on the Roof Daffy Duck Invader Zim Ferret Fancy rat Animal testing Garfield Rabbit Livestock A Simple Plan Taboo food and drink DDT Bugs Bunny Volleyball EastEnders Whaling Coprophagia Head louse Unreal The Amber Spyglass Crab louse The Golden Age of Hollywood animation Australasia ecozone Microchip implant (animal) Clancy Wiggum Bat Boy Pet skunk Tiny Toon Adventures Housebreaking Domestication Cat Hamster Mickey Mouse Lou Reed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Death Gate Cycle Johnny 5 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ben Johnson (athlete) Fox hunting Moe Berg God Emperor of Dune Rabies Psychedelic music The Shining (film) Roswell UFO incident Kevin and Kell Beatrix Potter Veterinarian Piccolo Junior Saga Chinese astrology Piccolo (Dragon Ball) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Taken Pok__mon Live!
