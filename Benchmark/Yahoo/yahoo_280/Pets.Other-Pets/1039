i need support advice please well while driving by i saw a near by vet clinic is looking for volunteers to work there i have horrible people skills but i really want to do this just nervous because i've never done anything outside a school related activity i'm so meh say i have a sheltered life so my questions are should i call them or just walk in and ask about volunteering what do i say exactly is this a good idea what do you think will be expected of me do i ask about it today or is there like a special day that's better for asking about this stuff like it's better to do it on weekends i know that just sounded silly but i want to know it is a great idea i would say definitely go for it i had horrible people skills as a teenager myself but what helped me was being put in situations where i had to deal with people such as working and volunteering during the week is probably better to ask about being a volunteer since there are probably more people there that can answer your questions and let you know what exactly you will be doing what i would do is call first and ask them and if they do have a need for volunteers ask them when a good time would be to stop in most organizations i have found are very grateful to have volunteers and are very flexible in regards to things like scheduling how many hours you want and if you need a day off here and there even though you are only it is most likely something that will look good toward your future whether or not you choose to pursue the veterinary field it looks good to put volunteer work on a college application a resume etc job duties could include anything maybe they need someone to take the dogs who are boarding there outside to use the bathroom it could be office duties like stuffing envelopes and such it could possibly be cleaning up these are questions i would ask the clinic Pet skunk George W.
