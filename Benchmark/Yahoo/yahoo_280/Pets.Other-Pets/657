if animals can't shed tears do they have no way of releasing their emotions i know animals can make sounds of wailing but that isn't beneficial like crying is i know some might say some animals do cry but that happens very rarely and i personally haven't seen it are depressed animals like cats and dogs just stuck with all those feelings inside them to dog lover ally i didnt say that animals didnt have feelings rather i greatly believe that they do you can't judge animals ways of releasing emotion by human standards they have the same emotions but they are processed in a way that's appropriate for them the comment wailing isn't beneficial like crying is isn't logical they can't miss what they've never known cats have never cried in all of evolution they don't cry so how could crying like a human benefit them it makes no sense they process emotion in their own ways they don't hold it in they respond in the moment to the situation depressed animals immediately perk up when their needs are met you just have to know what's wrong to help them Shaggy dog story Dog Emotions (album) Friends Theory of conduct Pitaten Stroke The Amber Spyglass Cat The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Galaxy Angel Goodness and value theory Jon Secada Alexander Technique Fruits Basket Utilitarianism Emotion Religion The Catcher in the Rye YuYu Hakusho Procrastination Social rule Peter Singer Zoophilia Mickey Mouse The Death Gate Cycle Ranma __ characters Miss Saigon Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe God Emperor of Dune Phoebe Buffay's songs Ex-gay Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Blonde on Blonde Objectivist philosophy I Don't Wanna Cry James Dobson Theodicy Yami no Matsuei Evolution Happiness Ferret The Smoking Room Current teachings of Prem Rawat Phoebe Buffay Asperger syndrome Speciesism Animism Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Drama Dualism (philosophy of mind) Empathy Tears Eugenics Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Sex and the City Thor (Marvel Comics) Neuro-linguistic programming Xenomorph Kodocha Derek Parfit Abortion debate Philosophical skepticism Animal rights Anarcho-primitivism Narcissism Animal communication Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Capitalism Therianthropy Darwin from Insectivorous plants to Worms Decision making Fox Aristotle Patriotism Democracy Pump It Up Gramophone record Transactional analysis Alignment (role-playing games) Quotation mark Chronic fatigue syndrome People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Simone Weil Traumatic brain injury Artificial consciousness Clinical lycanthropy Cyberspace Firefighter Motivation Jade Emperor Bernard Williams Poker jargon Reservoir Dogs Ren and Stimpy Animal testing EastEnders Breastfeeding Remix
