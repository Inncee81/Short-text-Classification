how much does it cost to have a pet euthanized dont criticize this has been one of the hardest decisions i have ever had to make my cat is very sick and is skin bones it looks like one of those poor animals you see on the the aspca animal cops shows this is the sweetest cat my husband and i have ever owned and it really bothers us he has a tumor the size of a lemon in his stomach martinamagrace its a male years old and like i said he has a tumor it can be fixed for and they said that theres a very big chance he could pass during surgery also they said that after the surgery he would probably only live to months oh and its name is clouds why does it bother you that i didnt mention that jordan s he has a tumor he has no room for food he trys to eat but cannot keep it down dont be rude unless you know the whole situation do you think that i would just let him starve without taking him to the vet to see whats wrong oh and they suggested it thank you the cost wouldn't be more than cdollars now this may sound foolish and childish but it helps me its a poem about where animals go when its time for the final goodbye just this side of heaven is a place called rainbow bridge when an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here that pet goes to rainbow bridge there are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together there is plenty of food water and sunshine and our friends are warm and comfortable all the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by the animals are happy and content except for one small thing they each miss someone very special to them who had to be left behind they all run and play together but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance his bright eyes are intent his eager body quivers suddenly he begins to run from the group flying over the green grass his legs carrying him faster and faster you have been spotted and when you and your special friend finally meet you cling together in joyous reunion never to be parted again the happy kisses rain upon your face your hands again caress the beloved head and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart then you cross rainbow bridge together Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sin City Cat Dog Care Bears Pitaten Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Fancy rat Ferret Shaggy dog story Salad Fingers Prostate cancer Doris Day Piccolo Junior Saga Aerial (dance move) The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Garfield Cliff Richard Friends W.I.T.C.H.
