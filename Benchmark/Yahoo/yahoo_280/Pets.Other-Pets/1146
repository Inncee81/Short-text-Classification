what kind of pet should i get i've been looking for a new pet recently i can't afford another dog or cat and as much as i'd like it i can't get a snake or a rat i'd like a pet that isn't terribly expensive including cages and supplies and doesn't take up a lot of room maybe something with low maintanence i've considered a frog or a turantula but i'm still looking for more i don't really want a rodent besides maybe a rabbit for what it's worth i didn't say i wanted a no maintanence pet so don't ride me about that i know that all pets take time and work and i'm willing to do that but i'm looking for something that isn't high maintanence like a dog or a cat would be you should get a hand fed bird like a cockatiel or budgie i have a cockatiel and they're so sweet and they don't stink or anything the only downfall about having a bird is that you have to refill their food and water everyday whereas i only have to feed my snake about once a week and to be honest they're not very low maintanence but they make up for it in personality you can teach then to whistle songs and budgies can learn to talk Pet Hamster Cockatiel Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Ferret Garfield RuneScape quests Shaggy dog story Skunk Taboo food and drink The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Guinea pig Flea Mickey Mouse Kim Possible Socialization Dog Pet skunk Chicken Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Ron Weasley Fauna of Australia Carnivore Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Animal communication Meat Seabird Theory of conduct Budgerigar Bat The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Rabbit The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Phoebe Buffay's songs Chinchilla Burmese python Animal Characters of Naruto Feral cat Legend of Zelda series songs Canary Frog Pitaten Dog training Pet store Onomatopoeia Microchip implant (animal) Toilet humour Hunting Neopets Falconry Chinese astrology Snake Camp Lazlo Lisa the Vegetarian Brown Rat American Alligator Dilbert Tetrapod Tai shogi Trapping House Mouse The Emancipation of Mimi Taikyoku shogi Livestock Real Love (song) Rocko's Modern Life Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Squirrel Treehouse of Horror IX Azumanga Daioh W.
