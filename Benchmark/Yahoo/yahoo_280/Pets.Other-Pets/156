what will my rabbit do with her older babies my rabbit had a litter of six on th of july my rabbits are in a shed i let my female rabbit out of her cage in the shed for a run round but the other day the male broke out of his cage and they were mating when i found them im really worried that bunny may now be pregnant if she is what will she do with her other babies when she has new ones i dont want to take the st litter away from her to soon does anyone know what age they can leave thier mum and what age can they be held also does anyone know if bunny will harm her oldest babies when the new ones are born if she is pregnant if anone has any advice please help im worried wow how irresponsible well to answer your question the mother will push the kits to wean earlier due to the strain on her body from the nursing kits and the pregnancy depending on the breed of rabbit some can wean as early as weeks but just because you see babes eating and drinking does not mean they are weaned so make sure you are certain they are fully weaned before moving them they should be fine to stay with mom when she starts nesting she will kick them out of the nest box and most likely keep them out and away from it does are pregnant for days so as that date gets closer start keeping an eye on mom and how she is acting towards her older kits rabbits are social creatures and should not harm her older kits but will push them away to some degree as the time draws near mom will need to be well fed and would be a good idea to get suppliments to add to her water for extra vitamins minerals etc due to the extreme strain of having nursing kits and supporting a pregnancy rabbits are reflex ovulators so chances are she is in fact pregnant i would strongly recommend getting her fixed after she kindles births so no further accidents happen as well as getting your buck fixed something else to keep in mind is that those babies will need to be seperated by sex at months old to prevent inbreeding between siblings to sex the kits grab the kit by the scruff of the neck and gently support the rump on a table hold the tail between your index and middle fingers and gently press down on the front part farthest from the tail of the genital mound you will see either a round hole or a pole in the male and a slit in the female aslo by three months most breeds of rabbit will start to drop their testicles which will appear as small hairless bumps on either side of the genital mound hopefully you are able to find a home for all these babies and are more careful in the future Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Guinea pig Hamster Dog Cat Elephant House Mouse EastEnders Ferret Rabbit Chicken Condom Abortion debate Pregnancy Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Red Squirrel Poker jargon Herpes simplex virus Characters of Lost Pet skunk Kitten Cephalic disorder Menstrual cycle RuneScape quests Strap-on dildo Platypus Horse Professional wrestling holds Red Fox Prostate cancer Social rule Childbirth Oral sex Friends Professional wrestling throws Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gray Wolf Kangaroo European Rabbit Folic acid Knots Landing Fox hunting Melanie Wilkes Manx (cat) Cytomegalovirus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tigon Child sexuality Tocopherol Chinchilla Capercaillie Spina bifida Obstetrics Sea-Monkey Humpback Whale Psoriasis Violin Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Kevin and Kell Hazing Oral contraceptive Dairy Aye-aye Days of our Lives Cheetah Transsexuality Menstrual cup Sexual orientation Birth control Koala Premature birth Humphrey Bogart Masturbation Carpal tunnel syndrome M16 (rifle) Fecal incontinence Richard Chase Fasting Vitamin C Rigging Nerpa Backstroke American lobster Toxoplasmosis Mountain Gorilla Happy Tree Friends Vampire Glossary of American football Sin City Giant Panda Tasmanian Devil
