can u give rats city or distilled water wich is better well i have been giving my rats city water but people tell me give them distilled water what bshould i do distilled water is stripped of nutrients and minerals it's not good for anyone or anything to drink it's usually used for things like steam irons so that the water doesn't leave behind any calcium deposits or other minerals many health fanatics are surprised to hear me say that drinking distilled water on a regular daily basis is potentially dangerous paavo airola wrote about the dangers of distilled water in the 's when it first became a fad with the health food crowd distillation is the process in which water is boiled evaporated and the vapour condensed distilled water is free of dissolved minerals and because of this has the special property of being able to actively absorb toxic substances from the body and eliminate them studies validate the benefits of drinking distilled water when one is seeking to cleanse or detoxify the system for short periods of time a few weeks at a time fasting using distilled water can be dangerous because of the rapid loss of electrolytes sodium potassium chloride and trace minerals like magnesium deficiencies of which can cause heart beat irregularities and high blood pressure cooking foods in distilled water pulls the minerals out of them and lowers their nutrient value distilled water is an active absorber and when it comes into contact with air it absorbs carbon dioxide making it acidic the more distilled water a person drinks the higher the body acidity becomes according to the u s environmental protection agency distilled water being essentially mineral free is very aggressive in that it tends to dissolve substances with which it is in contact notably carbon dioxide from the air is rapidly absorbed making the water acidic and even more aggressive many metals are dissolved by distilled water Carbon dioxide Edible salt Water purification Ammonia Sulfuric acid Acetic acid Titanium Water (molecule) Alcohol Carbon Mineral Hydrochloric acid Chlorine Soil pH Hard water Magnesium Water Phosphorus Sulfur Veganism Electrolyte Hydrogen peroxide Salt Aluminium Iron Explosive material Weathering Alum Manganese Nuclear power Alcoholic beverage Milk Lithium Folic acid Nutrient Carbon dioxide sink Corrosion Hydrogen Carnivorous plant Alcohol fuel Distillation Alkane Zinc Benzene Coffee Vitamin C Sodium carbonate Strontium Fluoride Nitrogen Tocopherol Fire extinguisher Omega-3 fatty acid Sewage treatment Rebreather Heat exchanger Blood Cyanide Solvent Haloalkane Microwave oven Ecology Welding Aspartame Iodine Chromium Tooth Creating chemical solutions Uranium Beryllium Motor oil Tofu Ocean thermal energy conversion Acid Vitamin Coal Dry cleaning Potassium chloride Desert Protein Copper extraction Hydrogen chloride Calcium Ultraviolet Water vapor Poison Base (chemistry) Plastic Ethanol Gas metal arc welding Industrial process Insulin Photosynthesis
