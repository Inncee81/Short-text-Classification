small animal advice i want a hamster and my dad already said yes but my mom said no because she wants me to get a bunny i can get either so which one is nicer and how much do they cost for the pet and the supplies starting off thanx rabbits can be timid if you don't hold them and play with them frequently they require a bigger cage and more frequent changes of bedding simply because they are larger and therefore produce more waste on a regular basis however hamsters can sometimes become aggressive and territorial after a period of time and become biters the most lovable hamster i have found are dwarf hamsters they don't get much bigger than across so they require only a small amount of space and they're precious i had one until i had to move and i gave her to my friend and she was and still is as sweet as can be however a friend of mine got a different breed of hamster teddy bear i think and that thing is so aggressive in its cage it'll bite and draw blood if you're not careful as far as cost is concerned i think a hamster is the least expensive of the two but if you give a bunny enough love and attention i think you'd be happier with your choice simply because they're a lot bigger more cuddle able and more entertaining Hamster Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Fancy rat The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Pet skunk Ferret Care Bears Canary Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Golden Hamster Calvin and Hobbes Bugs Bunny Animal testing Physical intimacy Poker jargon RuneScape quests Unreal Rabbit Nuclear power Rabbit (zodiac) Monster Rancher monsters Garfield Cat Livestock The Adventures of Pete & Pete Waste management Minor Harry Potter Beasts Pet store Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography RISC Phoebe Buffay's songs The Young Ones (TV series) Kodocha KaBlam!
