are bunnys great pets my dad says no so we cant git one but i say yes what do you say it depends on what type of pet you're looking for rabbits shed a ton the cage will smell no matter how many times you clean it and as soon as it's clean there will be fifty more turds in it they love to gnaw on things so if you let it loose in the house you're gonna have some major probs until it's trained realllllly well i had a rabbit for ten yrs we got him when i was four yrs old my brother was seven and my sister three we have around cousins the rabbit was our only pet when we were younger now imagine what that poor rabbit went through when we had family parties at our house yeah poor clover he really was incredibly patient with us and allowed us to carry him all around passed from one little kid to the next the thing i think was good though is he wasn't afraid to bite if we crossed a limit he'd simply bite i've still got a scar on my hand worst animal bite i've ever experienced and that's saying something but looking back it was good for us to have a pet that would defend itself if we went too far now clover is the only rabbit i ever had he lived ten long yrs the vet was shocked when we brought him in he was like this rabbit isn't neutered i'm surprised at how calm he is i give him an 'a' in behavior this rabbit has cataracts i've never seen a rabbit with cataracts i've never seen a rabbit this old lol then he had some fellow nurses and such come in to pet and oogle at our old bun bun wistful sigh sadly old age took its toll and six months later we put clovey down rabbits generally like to wander around they won't play with you like cats or dogs do they each have unique attitudes take some of clover's we'd try to pet or pick him up and he'd kick and wiggle away from us after we'd give up and leave him alone he'd hop over and nudge our hands insistently demanding to be petted crazy rabbit as a household pet things can get messy he liked to hide behind the couch and chew the carpet chewed anything he could reach we usually only let him run around outside the smell and shedding are in my opinion the major downsides to rabbits respect your dad's decision if you can't sway him otherwise it's his house i can understand his view of not wanting rabbit hair all over the house Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Cat Fancy rat Hamster Shaggy dog story Ferret Garfield Dog training Ranma __ characters Care Bears One Piece minor characters Pet skunk KaBlam!
