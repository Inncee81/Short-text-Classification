filing goat horns when we bought our pygmy goat from a petting zoo six months ago the man in charge said the horns could be filed down is this true and what is the process involved i had no interest in de horning our goat but i'm about ready to get a companion for her who is de horned and i don't want to risk injury to the new goat you can file the horns down but you cannot completely remove the horns by filing horns have nerves and a good blood supply so you have to be really careful doing it you can only file about a quarter to a half inch at a time make sure to have some blood stop powder or wonder dust on hand in case you go too far leave it alone for a few weeks and then file a little more i've seen people get them filed down to about half size by doing it that way i personally prefer leaving the horns on any of my goats that were not disbudded as babies i have horned polled and disbudded goats together with no problems if they use their horns too much they can be taught not to use them by taping something to the end of them for a while section of hose tennis ball with a hole in it etc don't leave anything on too long or it will cause the horn to get soft underneath Goat Minor Harry Potter Beasts Floppy disk Gramophone record Breastfeeding Drill bit Money Traumatic brain injury Violin Hard disk Volleyball Internal ballistics Terminal ballistics Equine conformation Childbirth Dairy Firearm Baseball Satyr Corran Horn Urinary incontinence Penis Domestic rabbit Captain Thunderbolt Textile manufacturing terminology Livestock Textile manufacturing Carbon dioxide Siegfried & Roy Prostate cancer American football strategy Typewriter Terri Schiavo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Table tennis Pet Sounds Dobermann 2001 anthrax attacks Asbestos Cephalic disorder Plastic Ammunition Stopping power Thermal power station Doom enemies Mouse (computing) Milk ROC presidential election, 2004 Stroke Knots Landing Monty Hall problem Irrigation Tourniquet Bong Fast bowling Hamster Pain Social rule Casting Mattress Horse Stem cell Anal sex Hubble Space Telescope Young adult literature Medical prescription American football Snooker Shark Cartridge (firearms) Shoe Triage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Toilet humour Cheese The Mountain Goats 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Domestic goat Stomach cancer Plame affair Female genital cutting Fecal incontinence Clarinet Slow Train Coming Microeconomics Texas Longhorn Athletics Aortic dissection 1957 World Series Myocardial infarction Paradox Patch (computing) Menstrual cup Decompression sickness Basic English File system Explosive material Mount St. Helens
