living outdoors why are cats better at this than dogs i see stray cats all the time rarey do i see stray dogs and when i do see a dog it's always hungry and in very poor health almost every stray cat i've run across looks healthy so are cats better at living outdoors because they are smaller and eat mice rats which are easy to find i considered this for a while though dogs are pack animals they are also successful hunters on their own if given the opportunity i think many of the strays were once owned by people and therefore stray dogs rely on people as their pack and are thusly not well fed when they're ignored on the streets cats tend not to rely on people though they will come and return if a particular person feeds them on a regular basis most dogs are larger and require more food than cats so as per food cats are more successful both dogs and cats can look much heavier or even much skinnier than they really are it is possible the cats are just as unhealthy as the dogs but their fur is covering this helpful for this is the fact that in my experience cats clean themselves more than dogs i think more people are more apt to feed cats than dogs because they more often view dogs as vicious especially street dogs and when the mutts look less healthy people are even less likely to give them food Cat Hamster Domestic rabbit Dog Fancy rat Taboo food and drink Gray Wolf Kangaroo Hunting Guinea pig Rat Nutrition Garfield Raw food diet Obesity Mickey Mouse Rabies Animal rights Leopard Organic farming Russian space dogs Livestock Lady and the Tramp Breastfeeding Chocolate Feral cat Feral Fur Dairy People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Kashrut Veganism Animal testing Kakapo Alaskan Malamute Pet skunk Brown Rat Health insurance House Mouse Tyrannosaurus rex Brown Bear Kitten Ferret Internet troll Lion Manx (cat) Felis sapiens Pekingese Tobacco smoking Chicken Genetically modified food Island restoration The Secret of NIMH Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Laika Coyote Vitamin C Bat Atkins Nutritional Approach RuneScape quests Mid-levels Tooth enamel Pig Ren and Stimpy KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1982 Alley Cat Puma Toxoplasmosis Dog (zodiac) Animal Trailer Park Boys Omega-3 fatty acid Island Fox German Shepherd Dog Gal__pagos Islands Neighbours Spider Tick Mutts Unreal Tooth Socialization Trapping KaBlam!
