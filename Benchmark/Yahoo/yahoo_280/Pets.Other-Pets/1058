is it normal for people to talk to their animals and in this case try to bark meow to them because i'm thinking not i think she's completely serious but the person does it when the animal isn't even around just like instead of humming or wistling they'll just meowing btw everyone i'm not talking about me haha if i'm having a problem teaching a dog to speak bark i'll bark at them so they get the idea and it works i'll meow at a dog to get a head tilt for photo shoots or film work but if people really think they are talking dog cat it's time for the men in the white jackets i really don't know anyone that thinks they can speak dog cat and i'm happy about that so what you're thinking is correct all the best Cat The Boy Who Knew Too Much Carl Barks Onomatopoeia Polymorphism in object-oriented programming Garfield Theory of conduct Morphology (linguistics) Philosophy of language The Strangerhood Shaggy dog story Social rule Dog The Shining (film) SpongeBob SquarePants English grammar Leopard The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Political correctness Russian joke Housebreaking Obedience training Traumatic incident reduction Pitaten Cats Don't Dance Lady and the Tramp Beagle Shit Lauren Bacall Police dog RuneScape quests Donald Duck Felix the Cat Bill Clinton The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Smoking Room Correspondence theory of truth Ren and Stimpy Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kirsten Dunst Ferret Reservoir Dogs Abstraction Humphrey Bogart Brian Griffin Dog agility Internet phenomenon The Inside Border Terrier Trailer Park Boys Tom Waits They Might Be Giants Ralston Purina Company Montgomery Burns Texas A&M University Manx (cat) Koan Sinfest The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Scrooge McDuck The Itchy & Scratchy Show Keeshond Lycanthropy The Pet Sounds Sessions Drama 101 Dalmatians: The Series Dream Weebl and Bob Hayer affidavits Aphasia Corneil and Bernie German Shepherd Dog Selective breeding Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Fox Mahoraba Dog training Life expectancy Ken Chu Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The nature of God in Western theology Alaskan Malamute Socialization Ed, Edd n Eddy Pekingese Working dog Avenue Q The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Feral child Gaspode The Truth About Cats & Dogs Non-native pronunciations of English Randomness Animal rights Shetland Sheepdog CatDog Coyote Kangaroo Happy Gilmore Inception of Darwin's theory
