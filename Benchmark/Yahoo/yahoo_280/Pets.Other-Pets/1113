adoption of a puppy well i am getting a dog or puppy depending on what's available when i get one and i was taking a bike ride today and my neighbor has week old puppies that he's fostering until they're weeks old for out local shelter why is it that they have to be weeks before adoptable and also what are some things i can expect from a puppy i know most i was just seeing if theres anything i don't thanks in advance weeks is usually the minimum age that a young pup should be able to be taken away from mum in cases where pups are abandoned and for some reason may not have mum i am pretty sure that not allowing them to go to homes before weeks allows for them to have their first shots worming etc puppies are more work initially as they have a habit of getting into everything and chewing anything they can find puppies dont come trained so you have to teach everything from scratch which can sometimes be better as you know exactly how the dog has been trained techniques hand signals commands etc adults often come already trained in basic commands posibly already house trained both are equally in need of homes hope all goes well with your adoption Dog training Dog Housebreaking Socialization 101 Dalmatians: The Series Beethoven (film) Golden Retriever Obedience training Hamster James Bulger Puppy mill Docking Dog agility Vehicular cycling Modem Skinny Puppy Fair use Education in the People's Republic of China The Realm of the Elderlings/Characters Majin Buu Saga Chinese martial arts Guinea pig About a Boy Labrador Retriever Social rule Social work Pet skunk Alexander Technique Mixed-breed dog Nintendogs Crate training Gun dog American Eskimo Dog Graduate school Sick Puppy Livestock Ron and Fez Animal shelter Juris Doctor Education in Japan Coyote Infantilism Bike lane debate Guide dog Trigonometric function Blackjack Football (soccer) Fancy rat Korea Jindo Dog Heartworm Martial art Double Dragon Animal Farm EastEnders Bill Clinton Jennifer Lopez Scooby-Doo Professor American Pit Bull Terrier Theory of conduct Prisoner (TV series) Younger versions of cartoon characters Gray Wolf Pete the Pup Human animal roleplay (BDSM) 2005 Iditarod Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Laserdisc Maison Ikkoku Gerald Durrell Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Our Gang Taikyoku shogi Compact audio cassette Ranma __ characters Adoption Marilyn Monroe Structure of the British Army Contract Animal testing The Fairly OddParents Pet store Contract bridge Paranoia Agent Domestic rabbit Altruism Garfield Boy Scouts of America Education in Germany Stolen Generation Hip dysplasia Eddie Guerrero Special Air Service Recruit training Milton H.
