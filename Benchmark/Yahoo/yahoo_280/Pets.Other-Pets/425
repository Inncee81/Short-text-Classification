animal testing labs i hate that animals have to be tested on but i feel that it is for the best to help fight disease processes in humans but i have a question does anyone know for a fact how these animals in the testing labs are treated do testing labs have anyone who just loves on the animals there are things in this life that are not fair animal testing is one of them i am also concerned about those who are employed to care for the animals that are used in tests i imagine they start this job wanting to be as kind as possible but become calloused to the pain and suffering they see as a mechanism to survive what they have to do because they have bills to pay and family that depends on them for food shelter etc god help any sensitive person that gets stuck in this job as it kills your soul i would feel safe in saying that no there is no one in the lab there for the main purpose of loving on the animals some of them become vicious as the pain becomes more unbearable and would pose a threat to human health with some of the diseases they are purposely infected with we live in an imperfect sometimes cruel world and the sooner you can face that fact and learn to live with it the better i mainly have a problem with animal testing when it used for developing cosmetic products hair dye makeup skin creams etc these things have nothing to do with health just appearance and vanity Animal testing Prostate cancer Theodicy Medicine Drug test Animal rights Dairy Tattoo Anthrax Stomach cancer Crash test dummy Livestock YuYu Hakusho Pneumonia Guinea pig Aspartame Abortion debate Consciousness Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Acne Simone Weil Human sexual behavior Malaria Goodness and value theory Gelatin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bob and George God Emperor of Dune Dog HIV test Domestic rabbit Addiction Kashrut The Amber Spyglass Methamphetamine Psoriasis Breastfeeding Traditional Chinese medicine Professor X John Howard Yoder Rabies Veganism Meaning of life Hepatitis C Tocopherol AIDS reappraisal H5N1 People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Happiness Tuberculosis Homeopathy Insulin Food and Drug Administration Aristotle Chronic fatigue syndrome Nutrition Summa Theologiae Psychology Church of Christ, Scientist American Psycho Traumatic brain injury Clinical depression Cat Lyme disease Zoophilia Pitaten Pharmaceutical company Allergy Diabetes mellitus Vegetarianism Rei Ayanami Overpopulation Anorexia nervosa Skin Autism Soul Fecal incontinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ultraviolet Socrates Scientology beliefs and practices Pet skunk The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex W.I.T.C.H.
