fleas on my pets okay i have three cats and a dog that all stay in the house well we let the dog out i just found fleas on my cat because her belly is pink so i could see them what is the best way to get rid of fleas and keep them gone because of course we still have to let the dog out you need something like frontlineplus good source and cheaper than the vets is petshed com i use it so i know it works a flea comb with a cup of hot water a little dish liquid to dip the comb in when you comb your dog cat lots of vac bags and vac everyday and remove the bag and tie it in a shopping bag and take out of the house this will work and you should see improvements within two months don't use sprays powders house bombs flea collars and over the counter products they are dangerous and are full of pesticides and can harm you and your pet cycle of the flea they hatch from a cocoon like a butterfly in one week they are an adult as a adult they lay a egg every hour of their lives up to years they live the eggs hatch into a larva in about two weeks they spend three weeks as a larva and then they wrap themselves into a cocoon in the cocoon stage you can't kill them unless you plan on burning down your house fire is the only way to kill them in this stage what makes them hatch from a cocoon is vibration heat and all sorts of things they need a host to feed on within one week or they will die problem being is the cocoons can take up to five months to hatch and they all hatch at different rates wow that is a lot of fleas frontlineplus uses two ways to kill the fleas they first have an ingredient that paralyzes the flea so it can't feed and it dies it does this for two weeks the following two weeks it just inhibits the flea eggs of the fleas that feed on them and eggs don't hatch this is why it takes a few months but it does work btw flea baths don't work either and will make it so the frontlineplus won't work Flea Biological pest control Red Hot Chili Peppers Gypsy moth Tick Insect Mosquito Chicken Cat Minor Harry Potter Beasts Beetle Coffee Bedbug Heartworm Plastic Milk Spider Xenomorph Dracunculiasis Fancy rat Kakapo Bee Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Zerg Egg (food) Cantonese cuisine Saturniidae Crab louse Ant Pet skunk Brood (honeybee) Hamster Tofu Livestock Myiasis Cheating in Counter-Strike Baylisascaris Hookworm Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Ascariasis The Fairly OddParents Hornet Leatherback Sea Turtle Customs and etiquette of Japan Honeybee Krill Explosive material Seabird Honeybee life cycle Thermal power station Richard Chase Hyperthermia Rocky Mountain spotted fever Fire fighting Dairy Salmon Socialization Sulfur Cracking (chemistry) Coconut crab Sonic Adventure Cocaine Brewery Swimming Billboard Hot 100 Rebreather American Alligator Korean cuisine Dog training Tungiasis Bacon Clownfish Spruce Budworm Cockchafer Chocolate Mercury Atlas 6 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Queen bee Solar power Mercury 4 Digenea Feral cat Caffeine Dilbert Shrimp farm Schistosomiasis
