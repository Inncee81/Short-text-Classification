why isnt my sugar glider drinking water ive had a glider for days but it doesnt drink its water or gliderade unless i hold the bottle up to it then it drinks alot hey there mine do the same thing they get the majority of their water from their food so i rarely get to see them drink out of their water bottle but when i make them gliderade or have pedialyte they will keep drinking for as long as i keep giving it to them so it shouldn't be anything to worry about but if you can handle your glider pinch the skin at the nape of the neck like the scruff of a puppy or kitten if it stays tented up where you pinched it for more than a second or two then your glider is dehydrated and needs fluids asap if he she'll only drink when you hold it up to them keep doing so until you can get it to a vet to get sub q fluids injected if the skin goes back to normal quickly after being pinched they're well hydrated and just like being served by their well trained slave hth Dehydration Hyperthermia Champagne (beverage) Dog training Intravenous therapy Soft drink Gliding Urinary incontinence 1957 World Series Guinea pig Hiking Diarrhea Fecal incontinence Drink Rehydration Drinking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Drowning Alcohol Backpacking (wilderness) First aid Paragliding Breastfeeding Urine Embalming Social rule Ethylene glycol Mountain Dew Tea Decompression sickness Bottle Fancy rat Coca-Cola Electrolyte Sulfuric acid Socialization Bong Siphon Domestic rabbit The Coca-Cola Company Pepsi-Cola The Marshall Mathers LP Nalgene Glycerin Alcoholic beverage Ferret Diabetes insipidus Gout Vampire Wine Garfield Escape from New York Rum Messerschmitt Me 163 Milk Jonestown Chocolate Bottled water RuneScape quests Beer Port wine Coffee Diabetic ketoacidosis Hangover Atomic Kitten Battle of Crete Microchip implant (animal) Tattoo Delta-glider Tooth enamel Hamster Conker's Bad Fur Day Lumbar puncture Hong Kong-style milk tea Equine conformation Housebreaking Cat 613 mitzvot Hypoglycemia Tang (drink) Food preservation Hypothermia Wine making Marathon (sport) Disinfection Saint Patrick's Day Carbon dioxide Sugar Glider Operation Market Garden Giraffe Dumpling 7-Eleven Nestl__ International response to Hurricane Katrina Molotov cocktail Acetic acid Tequila
