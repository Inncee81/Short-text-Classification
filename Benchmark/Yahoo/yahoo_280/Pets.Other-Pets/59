chinchilla cage location question i just bought a chinchilla last week and right now his cage is in my bedroom which isn't frequented by people except for myself at night i was wondering if i should move him to a more central location like the family room i have two dogs that bark a lot that are always in the family room so i'm not sure if this would scare the chinchilla thanks i let him out during the day and go in and hold him but i'm not sure if i should put him in a central location where people are around a lot talking etc i was reading that if they're in a place with a lot of noise that you need to cover them with a sheet during the day so they can rest this all depends on how old your chinchilla is if your chinchilla is still a baby i would sugest leaving in your room once it becomes old enough chinchillas usually like to see whats going on and they love to meet new people i also have two dogs who bark alot and my chinchilla barely notices them nothing really scares chinchillas also this is very important you have to remember to pay attention to the chinchilla makee sure that it has time to run and jump around when we first had our chinchilla we kida forgot about him so he became mean but he was still young so we trained him to olve us again i hope that answered your question Chinchilla Social rule Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Apprentice 2 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo Junior Saga The Curse of Fenric Shaggy dog story Rent (musical) The Champions She Loves You StarCraft: Uprising The Inside The Shining (film) Billboard Hot 100 Rich Mullins John Cage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
