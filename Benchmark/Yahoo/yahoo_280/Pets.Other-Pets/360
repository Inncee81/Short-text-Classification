pet allergies i just got a bichon and i read on the internet that they have hair not fur so people won't be allergic to them but ever since we brought her home my allergies have been bad has anyone else have had problems with their bichons this following is available in the internet the bichon frise is often recommended as a breed for families with allergies it is important to discuss this with your allergist before making a decision to buy any pet experience shows that those with mild allergies may be able to share a home with a bichon the person with severe allergies may be at risk for a severe attack when exposed to these dogs others will fall between those parameters it is important that you find out before making a purchase that your allergies will not be affected or how severely the best way to find out how you will react is to spend time in the presence of a bichon this should be done in a place where no other animals are present to avoid exposure to other allergens the minimum amount of time would be hours and repeated exposure is recommended how can you arrange this find a friend with a bichon or contact a breeder who will allow your family to visit for an extended time have each allergic person hold the animal and be in the room throughout the exposure time any allergic adults should be a part of this exposure even if you are buying the puppy as a child s pet if you do decide to buy the bichon realize that adult coats are different from puppy coats so allergic individual should be exposed to both also make sure that the puppy can be returned if this does not work out responsible breeders ask you to sign a contract that offers certain guarantees and you can expect to include your own agreed upon conditions before signing another consideration before buying is that pets will spend some time outdoors and may bring outside allergens in on the feet and coat he and you will be better off if he spends most of his time inside you would be advised to find an area where he can relieve himself on concrete and then you should be a responsible dog owner by cleaning up after him realize that he may also bring in dander from other animals every time he goes to the groomer or to the vet s office so his coat care may be up to you grooming products may contain perfumes now that you have looked at the allergy factor be sure to read before you buy your puppy to find out about other considerations before you make up your mind that the bichon or any pet is a part of your future Hay fever Allergy Asthma Havanese Dog Domestic rabbit Cat Guinea pig Bichon Fris__ Eczema Food allergy Maltese (dog) Chronic fatigue syndrome German Shepherd Dog Multiple chemical sensitivity Housebreaking Shetland Sheepdog Life insurance Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Conjunctivitis First aid Angioedema Tattoo Peanut Labrador Retriever Zoophilia Hypoglycemia Breastfeeding Psoriasis Hamster Nuclear power Common cold Toy dog Latex allergy Golden Retriever Tooth enamel Pet skunk Food Pet store Tarantula Decompression sickness Plame affair Mixed-breed dog Multiple sclerosis Rabies Infantilism Urinary incontinence Motion picture rating system Annuity American Eskimo Dog Dog training Acne Socialization Protein Urticaria One Tree Hill (TV series) Pekingese Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Perfume Anorexia nervosa Microeconomics Airedale Terrier Tobacco smoking Insomnia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pneumonia Cyprus dispute Second language acquisition Microchip implant (animal) Docking Poodle Cancer Contract Health insurance Body piercing Antihistamine Obstetrics Estoppel Capitalism Dog show 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Crohn's disease Skinny Puppy English Springer Spaniel Prostate cancer Alcoholics Anonymous Portuguese Water Dog
