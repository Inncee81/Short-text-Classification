how to properly hold a bunny does anyone know how to properly hold a bunny i hold it with both my hands around its stomach sometimes but i am not sure if that is the right way i've owned a bunny for almost years now i hold my bunny in my lap while i'm sitting so all of her feet are on a solid surface if i have to stand up and hold her i put all feet on my chest and hold her with my hand under her butt so she feels really really secure if you hold her around the stomach you can accidentally squeeze her and hurt her or she could twist really hard and jump out of your hands and fall to the floor getting hurt a worse case would be that she leaps or twists out of your hands and breaks her spine just make sure the bunny is always supported whenyou hold them Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling aerial techniques Professional wrestling throws Diving Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Spanking Volleyball Equine conformation Mattress Jackass: The Movie Swingout Drill bit 2000 Australian Grand Prix Suplex Drowning DDT (professional wrestling) Crash test dummy Casualty lifting Neckbreaker Skateboarding trick Strap-on dildo Billiards Breaststroke Glossary of climbing terms Professional wrestling match types Wood carving Menstrual cup Gymnastics Horse Rabbit Conspiracy (TNG episode) Motorcycle Asana Trapping Piledriver (professional wrestling) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dairy Domestic rabbit Diver rescue Anatomical terms of location Backbreaker Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hazing Bookbinding Horse tack Recovery position Cheerleading 1957 World Series Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Fast bowling Dropkick Fecal incontinence Kimi R__ikk__nen Archery Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Woodworking Fathers' rights Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Leap year M16 (rifle) Textile manufacturing Internal ballistics Condom Salute Montgomery Burns Seismic retrofit Indianapolis 500 Suicide methods Lindy Basic Tai Chi Chuan 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Sea star Human anatomy Dialysis Sperm Whale In The Groove (game) Chopsticks Pump It Up Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Mixed martial arts Diving suit John F.
