where can i buy a bunny i live in texarkana tx and our petsmart doesn't sell rabbits most petsmart stores don't sell rabbits for the same reason they don't sell dogs or cats all three species suffer from a serious overpopulation problem too many people buy rabbits without realizing how much time work and money are required for their care then dump them at animal shelters after a year or two in most parts of the country it's easy to adopt from a rabbit rescue group cities such as houston austin and little rock have rabbit rescue groups unfortunately as far as i can tell texarkana doesn't have one unwanted rabbits are probably taken to either the texarkana animal shelter or the texarkana humane society as far as i know neither the animal shelter nor the humane society has rabbits available right now but if you call and tell them you'd like to adopt a rabbit they may be able to put your name on a waiting list so that you would be contacted as soon as a rabbit became available by the way if you want to learn more about rabbits in preparation for adopting one a great list of articles is available at http www rabbit org care index html Domestic rabbit Rabbit Rabies Livestock Dog Cat Microchip implant (animal) Guinea pig Domain Name System Kevin and Kell Animal testing Rescue group Feral cat Bugs Bunny Poker jargon Animal rights World Wide Web Animal shelter People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Overpopulation Who Framed Roger Rabbit Texarkana, Texas Hunting Introduced species Ferret Domestication Adoption Pet skunk Theory of conduct Animal euthanasia Fox hunting Hamster Cross site scripting Dairy A Canticle for Leibowitz HyperText Transfer Protocol Rabbits in Australia Gaia Online Pet Genealogy Economics Wal-Mart Mozilla Firefox Monster Rancher monsters Anthropomorphism Emergency preparedness Stone Age Sustainability European Rabbit Poverty Surveillance Socialization Warez Daffy Duck The Amazing Race Veterinarian Windows XP Cruelty to animals Grammatical mood Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Animal Crossing Apollo 8 Neolithic Revolution Pitaten Monkey (zodiac) Philosophy of language Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Capitalism Chinese astrology Uniform Resource Locator Internet fraud Mammal Fancy rat International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Condom The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Critic Firefighter Indigenous peoples Wget Usagi Tsukino Jefferson Airplane D.N.
