looking for hands on experience with raising a baby raccoon found a nest that had fallen and a male coon was eating the babies and we managed to get the last one before he did he is aprx weeks old i have read all the web sites so i am looking for ppl with hands on self experience with raising them so if you have not raised one please don't post links thanks i realize they are wild and illegal in most states we did not bring him home to make him a pet we saved his life but he is too young to be on his own any info you can offer would be much appreciated like when to wean a male off the bottle when to introduce solid foods if he needs bathing and what to use because he is a bit stinky lol releasing versus keeping him if my pets would be in danger when he gets older stuff like that thanks in advance you should contact your local animal control or wildlife park ranger there are people who have special licences and training to rehabilitate wildlife they would know the proper way to raise and care for the baby and then release it when its old enough Pet skunk Hamster Raccoon Domestic rabbit Elephant Cat Giant Panda Dog Fancy rat The Sims Falconry American Alligator Mountain Gorilla Tarantula Canary Ferret Care Bears Hunting Kitten Guinea pig Spotted Skunk Nerpa The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Neopets Goblin Valley State Park KaBlam!
