considering a self scooping litter box it's my boyfriend's job to scoop the litter box and i thought it would be nice to buy one of those electric self scooping ones so he wouldn't have to do it do they work or are they just a waste of money i know that they can be quite expensive and i don't want to drop just to be disappointed thanks in advance nice of you to think of your boyfriend like that you must be quite a nice person the electric pooper scoopers are fine if you only have one cat because then the litter clumps can be easily scooped unfortunately if you have more than one cat like i do then the litter tends to crumble while being scooped up i guess from multiple scratching and soaking and if your cat has diarrhea well needless to say it gets messy because that doesn't clump well at all the machines have a storage area and you have to buy extra pans for it as well a little pricey i took mine back to the store for a refund in canada it retails for more than i've talked to a few folks who just love them but i don't too bad could have saved me lots of time in scooping Avenue Q Cat litter Poker jargon System/34 Friends Little Britain Theory of conduct The Pet Sounds Sessions Badly Drawn Kitties Litter The Smoking Room Cat Bulk vending Conker's Bad Fur Day Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pet Sounds System/36 Social rule Invader Zim Knots Landing Blonde on Blonde Great Teacher Onizuka Nuclear power Jumpstart 3rd Grade Pinball Make money fast Linked list Time Out of Mind CPU cache Seinfeld Saga (band) Ocean's Twelve Characters in the Smurfs DVD Energy development Toilet humour 2000 Australian Grand Prix Computer George Costanza Gramophone record The Inside Wind turbine Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 Delta Goodrem Trailer Park Boys EFTPOS Rose (Doctor Who) Plastic Domestic rabbit Gold as an investment Plastic bag Microeconomics Stage lighting Textile manufacturing The Apprentice 2 RuneScape quests Dairy Steven Wright Ron and Fez Treehouse of Horror IX Floppy disk Pip (South Park episode) Philatelic investment W.
