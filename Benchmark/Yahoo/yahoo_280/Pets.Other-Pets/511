what's up with my hermit crabs okay i have two hermit crabs and one is smaller than the other i woke up last night to hear the smaller one making a very eri chirp that sound like it was saying back off jerk and the bigger one had rolled the smaller one over and was sticking his legs in the shell acting like he was atacking it any idea what happened is it a male vs male thing the habitate they're in is about ft by ft i'm hoping it's not a competition for a shell which i am now thinking it is because i have shells and the smaller crab is inside the bigger crab's old shell and she doesn't seem to want to give it up and the bigger crab's shell is a little small for him and he doesn't seem to be interested in the others i put in the cage for him no they were most likely mating that or its a terriorial thing if the cage isnt that big than its territorial if its big they were doin the do Coconut crab Crab John Cage Hermit crab The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Professional wrestling holds Marching band Combine (Half-Life 2) Horseshoe crab Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Creatures in Bionicle Futurama (TV series - season 5) Blood on the Tracks Salad Fingers Hamster Boston crab Empire Burlesque Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breath of Fire III Friends Hansel und Gretel The Isley Brothers Spider Chinchilla American lobster Tigon Professional wrestling match types It's All Gone Pete Tong Katamari Damacy Pok__mon Live!
