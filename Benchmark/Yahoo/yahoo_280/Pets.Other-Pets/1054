have you ever been saved by an animal or pet i was flying a tiny polystyrene remote control helicopter in the garden one of the local feral cats fancied it and pounced when it crashed it had done this a couple of times but i had been nearer on this occasion another cat was enjoying the flying display and saw the feral cat attack it pounced on or pounced at the feral cat and saved the polystyrene helicopter from a sure fate of talons i was really shocked i had only fed this cat once from a barbeque and i hadn't realised any could be this good a friend yes it was trivial compared to some of these answers but it was more of a kitten and the feral ones can be so aggressive toward pets including that one i was impressed so much by that my german shephard starr saved me from a group of lads when she was a pup i thought i was going to be beaten black and blue just for walking out of a shop wrong place wrong time kind of thing anyway as i untied my dog from outside the shop she got between me and the lads ive never seen her like that since even i was scared of her she's my little angel and i know im safe when shes about Cat Feral cat Feral Dog Domestication Garfield Socialization Kakapo Hamster Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Azumanga Daioh Ranma __ characters The Subtle Knife Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Fancy rat G-Man (Half-Life) Shark Introduced species Xiaolin Showdown Feral cat colony Eric Cartman Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pet store Puma Hunting Domestic rabbit Helicopter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Taboo food and drink Horse Trailer Park Boys RuneScape quests Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Island restoration Sly Cooper Ferret Feral child One Piece minor characters Humphrey Bogart Phoebe Buffay's songs KaBlam!
