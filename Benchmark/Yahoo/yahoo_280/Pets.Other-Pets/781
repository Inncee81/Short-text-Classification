is my rabbit mourning sadly one of my rabbits died yesterday morning now the one i have penelope who is usually pretty hyper and active just goes to sit in spots where my other rabbit used to stay a lot when i went to find her she was in her cage and sitting where his body was she usually sits in the opposite corner and then later she went to go just stay in a corner next to a tv where my other one always stayed she just sits there with a blank look when i call her she ignores me sometimes but then other times she hops over is she just mourning because i heard rabbits do that when they lose a companion or is something else wrong i just don't want to take any risks and lose her too oh and could anyone help me identify what breed of rabbit she is http s photobucket com albums q rixilol action view current pene jpg http i photobucket com albums q rixilol f d jpg http s photobucket com albums q rixilol action view current bunnay jpg they're kinda bad pictures she's camera shy yes rabbits like other animals can mourn i've seen cattle and dogs do it if they can rabbits can as far as the breed it looks like the broken variety of rex or mini rex a mini rex looks just like a rex except that it is smaller the coloring on the fur and the shape of the head makes me think it is a rex or mini rex or at least has one of those two breeds in the ancestry it may however be a mixed breed the fur does look a little on the long side for a rex or mini rex rex and mini rex fur is shorter than normal rabbit fur and has almost a velvelt feel when you run your hand over it the rabbit looks like it is pretty young from the pictures when rabbits are young many of them have a coat of fur that looks cottony the fur on your rabbit looks cottony some other people mentioned dwarfs and dutch it definitely is not a dutch neither is it a dwarf the term dwarf is normally used to refer to a netherland dwarf netherland dwarfs have a completely different shape of head and body many pet shops wrongly call almost any small rabbit a dwarf that is because the pet shops often know little to nothing about rabbits Domestic rabbit Dog Ferret European Rabbit Rabbit Guinea pig Cat Fancy rat Cornish Rex Fur Border Collie Havanese Monster Rancher monsters German Shepherd Dog Chinchilla My Little Pony Mixed-breed dog Stoat Drill bit Obedience training Cat coat genetics Working dog Kodocha Equine conformation Hamster Livestock Tyrannosaurus rex Gray Wolf Cheetah Basset Hound Traditional animation Poodle Keeshond Manx (cat) Who Framed Roger Rabbit RuneScape Random Events Goatse.cx Australian Cattle Dog Dachshund Oasis (band) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Coat (dog) Island Fox The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Alaskan husky Black panther Falconry KaBlam!
