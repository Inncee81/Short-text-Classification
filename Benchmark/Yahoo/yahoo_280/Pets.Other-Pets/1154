ive got a problem with handling my rabbits anyone got ideas when i pick them up they wont have it yet when ive got them they dont want me to put them down again has anyone got any help they could give me i handle then enough but they never seem to get used to be handled during the day whereas when its dark its fine i think they're all a bit like that they don't think they want to be picked up but they're happy once they are they prefer to sit next to people rather than on them so our rabbit has her own cushion and lies on it next to us and they're probably too hot at the moment during the day anyway persevere they really do like being cuddled they just don't realise it Happy Tree Friends Atomic Kitten Charles Ives Social rule Car handling The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe She Loves You The Amber Spyglass Strap-on dildo Domestic rabbit Theory of conduct Physical intimacy Mattress Anne of the Thousand Days Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog training Aerial (dance move) Avenue Q Pysanka Tularemia Milton H.
