how long do you wait until you stop using flea medicine i used about two months worth of flea medicine on my kitty which left me a lot of time to get rid of the fleas in my house so can i stop using the medicine or do i have to continue getting more i need to know asap because school is starting and i have to know how to manage my money thanks it depends on if your cat is indoor or outdoor if it's an indoor cat it's chances of getting fleas aren't as high but it can still happen especially if you still have fleas in your house the only way to guarantee you won't have flea problems is to use flea treatments however i had cats for about ten years and never used expensive flea medicines i bought special flea bath shampoo and gave them each a flea bath once or twice a month it worked well and you can get a bottle of the stuff for ten or twenty bucks if you only have one cat one bottle would probably last you a while Flea Red Hot Chili Peppers Livestock Flea market Domestic rabbit Shampoo Swimming pool Poker jargon Social rule $ale of the Century Housebreaking Illegal drug trade Linked list Feral cat Publicly funded medicine John Frusciante Sento Okashina Okashi Hearts (game) Heartworm Jade Emperor Badly Drawn Kitties Stomach cancer Computed tomography The Joker's Wild Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Quackery 2005 World Series Paintball University of Bath Medicine Chronic fatigue syndrome Michael Balzary Plagues of Egypt Shaggy dog story Ultimate (sport) Piccolo Junior Saga Chinchilla Mutual fund Ben Johnson (athlete) Mid-levels Fancy rat Bubonic plague Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway Pitaten Education in the United States Garfield Black Books Health insurance Sheepshead RKO Pictures Breastfeeding Sprint (race) Volleyball Graduate school Winning Streak Diwali Grand Forks, North Dakota American football 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics Annuity Bill Frist Second Battle of the Atlantic Athletics Stroke Warren Buffett Hamster Saga (band) Education in Portugal Cranford, New Jersey Make money fast Game show CPU cache Alternative medicine Kakapo Prostate cancer Tiny Toon Adventures Decompression sickness Maneki Neko 2000 Australian Grand Prix Light-emitting diode Reading and Leeds Festivals Blood Sugar Sex Magik The Apprentice 1 Lacrosse The Book of Five Rings University of Arizona Andr__s Galarraga Patent medicine National Football League Lore Ferret Diabetes mellitus Sears Holdings Corporation Toronto Blue Jays The Contender (television series) Single malt Scotch
