how can i get over my fear of riding horses i own and the biggest one im freaked to ride ive fallen off him many times and even broke on of my legs i want to be able to ride him again but im scared something worse might happen i really need some help and yes i have been taking lessons taking lessons on a safe school horse is really the first step it may take time to find an instructor who understands your fears and is able to work with you and it's my experience that few instructors have this ability so it may take some searching i would also have all three of your horses' evaluated by a trainer to decide if these horses fit your riding and skill level if not as hard as it may be you may need to look at selling them and finding someone who is a better match rebuilding your love of riding is going to take time and many good rides to replace the bad memory learning more about centered riding sally swift and tai chi for equestrians james shaw can help improve your position and relax your body from it's tense fear state good luck Tai Chi Chuan Martial art Eventing Equine conformation Dressage Gliding Shen Gong Wu Milton H.
