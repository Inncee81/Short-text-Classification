rabbit how to litter box train how to tell if it 's a boy or girl how to disipline we have a rabbit that is about months old now how do you go about litter box training or whatever you call it so that he can freely run around the house i hate locking him up all the time but i hate following him to pick up poop all the time also how can you tell if it's a boy or a girl and what do you do to discipline them when they bite or are chewing on something they shouldn't be the last thing i was wondering was can you train a rabbit to come by name also are you supposed to clip their toenails in his cage put a box with litter in it in the spot that he usually relieves himself in when a rabbit is mature the males usually have very noticeable testicles you can't miss them when they bite or chew pull them away and say no in a firm voice as you would with a cat or dog they may or may not learn to recognize their name it depends on the rabbit clip their toenails often otherwise walking on curved nails could be painful for them Dog training The Inside Ferret Hamster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fancy rat Garfield Milton H.
