donkey training i am going to oregon to help train mini donkeys i am going to try putting a bit into their mouth this would be their first time with a bet any ideas on how to go about this if so what can you explain the donkeys are going to be trained how to drive a cart the owner cannot do much so it would be nice if she could drive them well before i can answer your question what kind of training do they have on them right now have they been thoroughly gentled especially around their face and what are you planning to use them for cart pulling edit if they're good about being handled around their face try to stand near them and insert your fingers into the bars of their mouth to get them used to the sensation of a bit being there if they handle this well massage their gums for about seconds then take your fingers out and move onto something else like grooming them after grooming for a while do it again repeat this process over a few days so that they become comfortable with you handling their mouths be sure to mess with their ears a lot as well and make sure they're not head shy otherwise you could be up for some opposition when it's time to slip the headstall over their ears Social rule Dog training Breastfeeding Horse tack Donkey Shaggy dog story Ferret Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
