blue heeler ate a betta so i thought my blue heeler was diciplined enough to be left alone for about an hour while i did some running around in town when i got back he'd torn up my room and ate my betta fish i know these dogs are energetic and it's not his fault really but i guess what i'm asking is will the fish harm him or his system oh that poor fish i would say your heeler will be fine but the fish well thats another story if in the future you get more fish i suggest you heeler proof their tank lol but him tearing up your room you may want to address that situation left alone it could become a real problem perhaps a nice seafood dinner is all he wanted Blue Heelers Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Cantonese cuisine Boom Town (Doctor Who) Logie Awards of 2002 Cuisine of Denmark Dog Seafood Peacekeeping Logie Awards of 2005 Shaggy dog story Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Finding Nemo Australian Cattle Dog Vegetarianism Hip hop collaborations Shark Sashimi Jewish cuisine Tasma Walton Fancy Crane Aquarium Characters in the Smurfs William McInnes Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Safety engineering Logie Awards of 1999 Hydrogen economy Fish Logie Awards of 1997 Logie Awards of 1998 Omega-3 fatty acid 613 mitzvot Logie Awards of 2000 Invader Zim The Brady Bunch Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
