why does my ferret only bite me i've just got a ferret about weeks ago she is weeks old when i first got her she bit anyone so me and my partner punished her the way we were told by scruffing saying no and pushing our finger in her mouth we both done it the same way now if my partner picks her up she is fine but when i do she attacks me and i'm desperate to get her to like me can u help contrary to what you and many others who've replied here are thinking your ferret may not be biting you because she doesn't like you but rather because she likes you best when ferrets play with each other they bite this is normal it's they way they interact with each other your ferrets biting may be her way of telling you that she accepts you as one of her own kind and wants to play with you as such personally i would and do when it happens with mine take this as a compliment from my experience the best way to deal with this kind of biting is to play back when she bites you gently flip her on her back and tickle the snot out of her when she starts to bite again stop tickling and hold perfectly still pulling away will only entice her to bite more and issue a command such as uh uh do easy if she doesn't ease up after giving the command twice get up and walk away from her give her a few moments then go back and try again eventually she will get the idea that you do want to play with her which is what she really wants but not if she's too rough with you it shouldn't take long for her to get the message it never has with any of mine well except for my darla who isn't quite right in the head lol stay calm and try to understand the messages your ferret gives you don't try to understand her from a human point of view you need to think like a ferret to understand a ferret oh and please pay no attention to the response you've received here from bill h who is clearly demented shaking head Dog training Ferret Milton H.
