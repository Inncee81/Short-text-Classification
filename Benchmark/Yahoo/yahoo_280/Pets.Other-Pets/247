what do people do with their pets when they are at work i wnat to get a dog or a cat but i am thinking about what they will do when i am not there how do pets entertain themselves can i just leave them in the yard i willd definitely get two so they can have each other for company please don't leave your pets outside alone all day people can be cruel and you do not know what they will do if they see your pet alone or they may just steal it you can either take them to a boarding kennel if you can afford it or maybe hire a pet sitter or take them to a family members house if they have nothing else to do personally my dogs just stay in the house until i get home i give them food and water in the morning before work and i walk them then on my lunch hour i come home and walk them again be sure to give them toys to keep them from being bored if you like you can leave the television on for them for background noise but definitly make sure they cant get into your trash if its over flowing take it out thats happen to me before heh and keep your bathroom door closed or they could play with the toilet paper or jump in the toilet and if you dont want them eating your shoes keep your closet or bedroom door closed when you are gone hope this helps Toilet humour Shaggy dog story Spidey Super Stories The Brady Bunch Toilet Sears Holdings Corporation Fancy rat Working dog Dog training Customs and etiquette of Japan Dog Cat Obedience training Richard Chase Teacher's Pet (Disney) Emergency preparedness Dog agility Salad Fingers The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Shining (film) Fecal incontinence Japanese toilet Saki Flush toilet Dilbert German Shepherd Dog Trapped in the Closet 1957 World Series The Marriage of Figaro Bathroom Housebreaking Dead Like Me The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Our Gang Nintendogs Saturday Night Live commercial Japanese tea ceremony Pet Pet skunk Rosa Parks RuneScape quests Socialization Taikyoku shogi Philip J.
