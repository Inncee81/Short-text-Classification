hamster and mouse together one thing that has bothered me for a while now is i have a hamster which murdered his friend not nice but they did come from pets at home and a mouse who's friend died around a month ago they come out and play in their own roll around balls and often smash into each other sniffing each other as they do so i feel it is a real shame they could never occupy the same cage anyone else have such odd thoughts on matters like this one it may be tempting to try and get them in the same cage they may seem lonely but considering its a mouse and a hamster i see chaos they would most likely fight i mean there have been those weird coincidences where the strangest of animals have become best friends snakes and mice cats and mice cats and deer but i just don't know if i'd take the chance you can try it just be ready to grab one if they start to fight maybe you could try getting another mouse friend for it and another hamster friend for your hamster good luck Shaggy dog story House Mouse The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Garfield Saga (band) Internet phenomenon Pet 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ferret RuneScape quests Characters of Naruto Cat Sub-Zero Pet store The Amber Spyglass Pok__mon Live!
