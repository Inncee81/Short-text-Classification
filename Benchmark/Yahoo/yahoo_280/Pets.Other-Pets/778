if a bigger animal is 'bullying' you what is your response i am thinking in particular of a certain horse that i have she was abused and is very senstive but she is also very stubborn she will try biting pushing me into fences kicking etc if i raise my voice she gets very nervous and upset i would like a new way to let her know that she cannot push me around and yet keep everything calm and quiet at the same time any tips she fears you will bring her more misery try catering to her be nice selfless and gentle but stern she needs to know that she doesn't have to push you away Horse breaking Milton H.
