how do you know if a raccoon has rabies there is a raccoon that comes to our backyard almost every night and eats all the leftovers from my cat's food we don't mind it because it's so cute but it eats straight from my cat's bowl and im worried that it might have rabies and contaminate the bowl how do you know if a raccoon has rabies or not and should i clean the bowl every time the raccoon eats from it the only definitive test for rabies involves a sampling of the animals brain tissue the animal has to be dead for that to occur some symptoms are a distinct and sudden change in behavior vicious animals become tamer and vice versa neurological symtoms such as staggering salivating or seeming to not know where one's feet limbs are prolapsed third eyelids you should not get close enough to any animal suspect of rabies to find this out and changes in sleep wake cycles nocturnal animals being active during the day i would not suggest continueing to feed this animal cat food is very high in taurine and giving it to an animal which may not need it may decrease the life of the animal and cause kidney failure having or encouraging this animal to stay can also cause your animals and you to have worms treatment is not pleasant and raccoons tend to harbor a lot of disease which could kill your cat and could make you sick if you are not afraid of the little microscopic germ consider what would happen to kitty if ever a turf war would occur between the two kitty would be in shreds raccoons have been known to be able to kill large dogs if you encourage this raccoon to stay around it may start up a family and invite more germs and more chances of killing your pet i highly suggest cutting off this animals food supply and have it move on away from you if you think the animal is cute go to the library and read books about them Rabies Cat Pet skunk Dog Raccoon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Bat Stroke Hypoglycemia Chronic fatigue syndrome Sleep Urinary incontinence Ferret Cancer First aid Chagas disease Myxobolus cerebralis Vampire Decompression sickness Guinea pig Leptospirosis Heartworm Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Thermoregulation Stomach cancer Animal Hamster Fancy rat Toxoplasmosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Narcolepsy Virginia Opossum Common cold Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Diabetes mellitus Skunk Domestic rabbit Aortic dissection Resident Evil: Apocalypse Malignant melanoma Biological warfare Atherosclerosis Epilepsy Paget's disease of bone Schizophrenia Snake Vitamin C Kakapo Addiction Terri Schiavo Coeliac disease Kitten Taboo food and drink Cirrhosis Schistosomiasis Gray Wolf Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hematophagy Paracetamol Cephalic disorder Medicine Tasmanian Devil Tuberculosis Obesity Whale Multiple sclerosis Anorexia nervosa Fecal incontinence Maine Coon Brown Bear Animal testing Folic acid Tocopherol Nutrition Livestock Foodborne illness Diseases of the honeybee Glycogen storage disease type I Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kashrut Crohn's disease H5N1 Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Spanish flu Louis Pasteur Group A streptococcal infection Excel Saga Mesothelioma Milton H.
