hamster meets dog we inherited a hamster last night my dog was immediately obsessed with it and while i was in the shower the dog knocked the hamster and cage off of a dresser when i got there the dog was laying on my roommate's bed and the hamster was next to her soaking wet eyes closed and not moving we noticed that it's poor little heart was still beating and it was breathing it started moving around in the next minutes or so and now a couple hours later it seems to be okay my question is do you think the dog swallowed and then spit up the hamster or the hamster was licked neurotically there was no sign of trauma other than unconsciousness and being very wet needless to say the hamster is now in a room with a dog gate the dog is a shepherd who indeed has high prey drive however at her rescue home she was known to lick baby kittens while supervised maybe the dog thought the hamster was dirty and decided to give it a bath Cat The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Sin City Hyperthermia Dog Milton H.
