how does moving pets overseas work i don't envisage living in australia my whole life but more importantly i don't envisage ever leaving any of my pets i expect specifically my dog and bird cockatiel to live at least another years so i just thought i'd ask in general how it works moving pets overseas i know they have to go into some kind of quarantine what does that actually mean do they take your dog away from you or something or is it more like he can't leave the house for a while before you leave or something for a long plane journey how are dogs and birds transported are they sedated or anything is that dangerous especially for birds is it dangerous to move a small bird like a cockatiel also what about that bird flu thing if they had it in a country would you be allowed to bring the bird back to australia again quarantine is a government run process in which your animal is basically put in a shelter of types and sits there for a few weeks to a few months depending on the animal's type and the country it came from you can visit your pet if you like but you cannot take it home until the quarantine is up workers there will feed and water the animal for you and give it a bit of exercise for plane transportation it all depends some people worry that their pet won't be able to take the flight well so they have a veterinarian sedate them prior to the journey usually the animals are put in the lower part of the plane along with the baggage luggage sometimes you can have a pet as carry on but it is hard to reserve such a seat and the animal's crate and size must meet certain regulations Hamster Pet Cockatiel Dog training Quarantine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dog Domestic rabbit USS Wasp (CV-18) Rabies H5N1 Microchip implant (animal) Hal Colebatch Fancy rat Veterinarian Feral cat Ferret House Livestock Cat Dobermann Dairy Greyhound Tooth enamel Characters of Lost Agriculture in Australia Bird migration Spanish flu Tick Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Airline Gerald Durrell Organic farming USS Taussig (DD-746) USS Waters (DD-115) British nationality law USS Alamo Housebreaking Hunting American Alligator Working dog USS Willard Keith (DD-775) Introduced species Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Taboo food and drink Governor-General of Australia Theory of conduct Australian constitutional law Utility cycling Insurance Guinea pig Paragliding History of British nationality law USS Enterprise (CVN-65) Appeal Obedience training USS Wright (AV-1) House of Lords Pet store Unclean animals John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Donald Rumsfeld Trade union Airport security USS Abbot (DD-629) Customs and etiquette of Japan RuneScape quests London Congestion Charge USS Sea Dog (SS-401) USS Yorktown (CV-10) Dog agility Mutts Spider USS Philip (DD-498) Shaggy dog story Gliding Kodocha USS Walke (DD-723) Animal euthanasia New Zealand elections Heartworm Animal rights Parrot Working animal Patent application Marine aquarium Canadian House of Commons Greyhound racing Bicycle USS Allen M.
