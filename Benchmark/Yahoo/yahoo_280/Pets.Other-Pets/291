hamster help ok well i have had hamsters in the past and i have done everything the interent tells me to do with them so as you can lift them out and pet them but no matter what hamster i get they always bite everyone and you couldnt out your fingers anywhere near them i have another hamster a little ginger coloured syrian hamster and it is the exact same i cant go near him or he will bite me has anyone go any ideas that might help me tame my hamster now i have already had him about half a year so or any future hamsters i get i could still use some help anyone got any ideas what i can do next hamster i get what hamster do you think i should get i would like one that is easy to handle and easy to tame i take it syrians are not the best what is your opinion on syrians for handling and what hamsters are best for handling you definetely want to make sure that they are completely awake before trying to get them out of their cage they get grumpy you say you've had these hamsters for a year yet it sounds like you only had them for a day you haven't been able to take your hamsters out because they are mean however by not taking them out they are only getting meaner they need a lot of attention you should try letting them run loose in a bathtub while you sit with them make sure the drain is clogged this gives an opportunity for you to be more active with them you really need to try to get them out of their cage to be played with they are probably going to nibble and bite until they get used to your scent it's just the way they are the more they are handled the more they get used to it if you are planning on getting another hamster i would wait until yours goes to the other side it is hard to introduce new hamsters to old ones because they are territorial however in the future i would suggest trying a teddy bear hamster or a black bear hamster these guys were bread for their temperment so they are a little bit easier to tame if you want to try a different type of hamster you could go with the dwarf winter white hamsters working at a petstore i can tell you that out of all the hamsters i had to handle the winter whites bit me the least but as with all hamsters they need lots of handling to be happy Golden Hamster Ferret The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Time Out of Mind John Cage Dog training The Taming of the Shrew Pet skunk Knife Care Bears Textile manufacturing Volleyball Milton H.
