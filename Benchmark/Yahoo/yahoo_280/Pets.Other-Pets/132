week almost week old bunny today i was out with the rabbits and i saw one of the female bunnies sniffing the grey bunnies ass about hours later i went out and the grey one attacked me none of the other bunnies did and im worried she might be pregnant we took them to the vets about days ago and the vets think that there is one boy the boy is going tomorrow is it possible that he could have made the grey bunny pregnant absolutely bunnies multiply well like rabbits they don't have to be very old and it only takes one male one minute and you will be the mom to a few kits you need to watch your young bunny take her to the vet or ask the vet if she is old enough or if it will cause her any problems she may eat the young bunnies if she is too young when they are born or they may be stillborn but bunnies do it so well you may end up with healthy bunnies if so you need to find homes for them right away or you will end up with a house full of rabbits again Rabbit Bugs Bunny Guinea pig Baby Blues Domestic rabbit Housebreaking Kangaroo Ferret Tiny Toon Adventures Sluggy Freelance Babs and Buster Bunny Goatse.cx Jean Grey Shaggy dog story The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Family from One End Street Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Red Squirrel House Mouse Wile E.
