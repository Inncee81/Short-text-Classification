i have a lopped eared rabbit but her ears havnt dropped any ideas why the ability of lops to 'lop' is based on the base of the ears and top of the head referred to as the 'crown' in younger rabbits because they're so small the crown is fairly narrow and the weight of the ears is very little usually they will have 'helicopter ears' where the ears are horizontal or held at an odd angle sometimes their ears may even stick straight up usually as they age about months old the crown will have widened and the ears thickened and the ears will drop and lay naturally sometimes lops who have not been bred to be show quality never lop if the parents weren't selected for desirable traits your rabbit's crown may be too narrow to allow the ears to lop as they should if that's the case there's not much you can do but enjoy her unique ear carriage Dog Equine conformation Domestic rabbit Rabbit Mixed-breed dog Gray Wolf Aerial (dance move) Internal ballistics Species Temporal bone Guinea pig Earring Carburetor Ear Hearing aid Anchor Horse Wood Cincinnati Bengals Car handling Spatial disorientation Professional wrestling throws Fancy rat Poker jargon Gobi Desert Docking Diamond Dog show Gramophone record Professional wrestling attacks Flight controls Farthing (coin) Television Strap-on dildo Labrador Retriever Prosopis cineraria Selective breeding European Rabbit Hat Billiards Platypus Knife Professional wrestling holds Otitis externa Scapula Genetic drift Mandible Super Mario 64 DS Colours, standards and guidons Manx (cat) Precession Continued fraction Who Framed Roger Rabbit GunZ The Duel Diamond cut Stereoscopy Thailand Artificial selection Sonic X History of the halfpenny German Shepherd Dog Radar Haircut Plant breeding Arabian horse Parachuting Spaniel Pachypodium bicolor Tank Aberration in optical systems Sniper Whitewater Knitting Cat Artillery Reel-to-reel audio tape recording Minor Harry Potter Beasts Skateboarding trick Diving Phil Collins Sound localization Helicopter Table saw Charge (heraldry) Bicycle English Cocker Spaniel Egyptian pyramids Microphone Elevator M__ni__re___s disease Strategic management Radio controlled airplane Balance disorder Diablo II Francis Galton Boxing International Phonetic Alphabet Worms weapons and tools Kevin and Kell Monty Python
