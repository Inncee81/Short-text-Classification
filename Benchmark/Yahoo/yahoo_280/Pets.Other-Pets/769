what would happen if you fed your dog or cat a small amount of magic mushrooms or acid would they trip about bones and digging or chasing other animals jesus christ im not gonna do it chill the fcuk out i was just wondering what effect it would have on them i'm not sure what would happen and of course i assume you would never do it but i would think if they had a small amount they would react like we do i mean if you think about it there are mushrooms and other substances wild animals can come across in their habitat and possibly eat which would not be healthy for them someone once told me that the trip is supposed freak you out and make you never want to touch that particular substance again but of course people are different from animals and use the trip to their advantage so i think something similar would happen to the animal but since they're mainly concerned with staying alive and healthy they wouldn't enjoy it and would never eat it again p s i can understand people wanting to be protective of animals but it's not like it's horrible to only discuss these things come on who are these people the thought police i honestly don't think you are the first person to ever have this thought and anyone who would be sick enough to actually do it doesn't need to look at yahoo answers to get ideas about how to be cruel to animals Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog Psychedelic mushroom The nature of God in Western theology Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Cat One Piece minor characters Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theodicy Predestination Gray Wolf Lycanthropy Psilocybin Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hamster Sesshomaru Cyberspace Health insurance Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Soul Negima A Course In Miracles Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Guinea pig Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Veganism Biology Tiger Tooth enamel Trailer Park Boys Supernatural Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Fancy rat Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Pok__mon Live!
