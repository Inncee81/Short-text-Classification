why do my horses have bumps my horses that stay in stalls during the day and get turn out at night have bumps they get fed scoops of sweet feed and flakes of alfalfa every day the bumps are on my show horses and i cant show them with the bumps what are they and what can i do depends what you mean by bumps do they share equipment or brushes with anyone if it's a fungus get some mtg and put on it my suspicion though is it's bug bites being out at night mosquitos and other bugs can leave bumps get a good fly spray like absorbine supershield and apply nightly before turn out also you might get a netting blanket or light sheet to put on them at night sounds like a lot of sweet feed tho' unless they're reining or other working horses Mosquito Alfalfa Anopheles Equine conformation Cowboy Bedbug Biological pest control Professional wrestling throws Malaria R.
