becoming an animal foster 'parent' so i have been thinking i would love to become a foster 'parent' for animals i would love to help take them in teach them and nurse them and all the ups and downs that go along with that however i have no idea where i would even start and whether or not it is a long process such as i would have to start small like volunteering and then work my way up after many years or if i can just jump right in after being approved and start fostering animals i would love appreciate any advice or answers any of you have on these subjects thanks so much keeping in mind i would rather do this for cats over any other animals go to your local humane society and start there talk to someone there about what you want to do and they can lead you in the right direction you can start out volunteering there talking to other fosters learning about different rescue and fostering groups in your area and getting to know more fostering can be tricky if you have other animals in the house already not everyone always gets along but seeing an animal respond to you and grow and become available to go to a great home is very very rewarding even if it is hard to see them go sometimes Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Behaviorism Charles Darwin Milton H.
