aggresive shih tzu ok so i have this shih tzu named puffy who is so cute but she bites me sister's fingers i tell her no and she leaves them alone but when i turn around she starts biting them again not only does she bite a lot but she also barks like crazy she barks all day and all night we used to be really nice to her when we barely got her she sleeped in my room we played with her whenever she pleased we pampered her like crazy but then she became aggresive and now she finds herself sleeping in the bathroom and isn't allowed to get out except for when she has to poop or eat and we only play with her outside after she poops for like minutes are we punishing her too harshly am i being too mean to her for biting and hurting my sisters should i get her a trainer you should not punish her it is truly not her fault it is simply the way you raised her pampering is not always a good thing she wants attention all the time and to show her anger she bites and barks to get attention in order for her to change so do you start off with letting her out of the bathroom your dog is barking because you trained her to do it she speaks and you obey woof and you open the door to let puppy out woof and you open it again to let her in woof and she gets a treat woof for a tummy rub you get the picture she has learned to get attention through barking and does this because she is unhappy bored or upset it is easy to fall into this trap because the very nature of barking gets your attention for the same reason it is easy to forget to praise and reward your dog when she is not barking to train her out of this habit do not yell in the wild wolves howl as a community which makes the dog want to join in when you yell you are going to teach her to stop by firmly saying quiet when she starts to bark hold up a treat under her nose she will stop and try to eat the treat move it away and say quiet she will be watching the treat if she stops barking give her the treat and praise her she will most likely start barking again but with practice she will understand that she will only get treats if she is quiet to stop biting throw the dog off if you are on the couch and she jumps up and starts biting you push her off and ignore her she may keep trying keep jumping up but keep at it if she jumps up and does not bite praise her calmly but do not touch her as soon as she tries to bite throw her off if you are on the floor and she bites put her in her crate or bed if she is trained to go to her bed then send her there like a time out if she does not have basic training you should give that to her i would recomend getting a trainer becuase this can become difficult and frusterating to owners if these tatics don't work Housebreaking Obedience training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.
