has anyone had experience with cremation of their pets we have always buried our dead pets but the vet recommended cremation and i'd like to know if anyone has had that done i am sorry to hear of your loss i have had my pets cremated individually where you get a private crematory you chose a box and the crematory cremates your animal individually and you get the ashes back in the box some of the box's are really nice some have a spot for the pet's photo tag collar whatever you want i display mine there are plenty of these crematories around if you can't find a crematory near you try a small animal teaching university as they also have individual cremation the vets sometimes offer the individual cremation and some vets worked with outside crematories but most vets offer a mass cremation where all of the deceased animals get burned together but you don't get anything back personally i like to either bury my pets burying pets is not legal or have them individually cremated so i can have them home with me also available and popular are pet cemeteries Cremation Funeral Coffin Cemetery Space burial Microchip implant (animal) The Pet Sounds Sessions Burial at sea Terri Schiavo Death Pet Sounds Pet Sematary Jewish bereavement Japanese funeral Ferret Hitler's death Urnfield Embalming Fancy rat Pet skunk Chinese in Singapore Prehistoric Britain Culture of the United States Cryonics The Ashes Socialization Phoebe Buffay's songs Pet Shop Boys Hamster Hell Grief World of Warcraft Education in Australia RuneScape Random Events Rabies Housebreaking Guinea pig Colma, California The Beach Boys Domestic rabbit Dog training Human sacrifice Collar Dead Like Me Villanovan culture Bat Boy Teacher's Pet (Disney) Chicken Ann Sheridan NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery Veterans Stadium Animal Farm Animal communication Animal shelter Dog Sati (practice) English cricket team RuneScape quests Green-Wood Cemetery Monkey United States Postal Service ITunes Punk ideology Past teachings of Prem Rawat Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Funeral home Kishore Kumar Harold Shipman Microeconomics Mattress Cable television Oliver and Company Ocean's Twelve Tooth enamel Animal euthanasia Lynyrd Skynyrd Professional wrestling match types RuneScape locations Current teachings of Prem Rawat Forensic anthropology Punt (boat) Apprenticeship Harishchandra Linear Pottery culture Captain Thunderbolt Maria Korp Gaia Online Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Australian Qualifications Framework Shot of Love Anchor Plame affair Convair B-36 Pet Commodore PET Doris Day
