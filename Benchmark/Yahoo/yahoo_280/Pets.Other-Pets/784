my parents are contemplating giving my rabbits away help nobody is willing to take them in so they'll be caged for the rest of their lives i dont lock them up in a cage should i euthanize them instead my parents are planning to put them in this garden where they will be caged for the rest of their lives i dun want that to happen i am not selfish i'm just worried that someone else might abuse them i love them to death well why don't you compromise get them a large safe cage and just let them out for exercise every day maybe your parents don't like the rabbits running loose and damaging things what is the reason rabbits may not do well outside if exposed to hot temperature or other animals that could hurt them and vets do not euthanize rabbits that way as stated above that is horrible at our hospital rabbits are anesthetized first which is gentle and fast then they are given an injection that only takes a few seconds to work they are asleep and never knew what happened Animal euthanasia Euthanasia Rabbit Jon Secada John Cage Electrophysiology People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Lethal injection Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Rabies Thermoregulation Guinea pig Ferret Russian space dogs 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social rule Infantilism Anorexia nervosa Magic (illusion) Childbirth Fruits Basket Pitaten Carpal tunnel syndrome Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban StarCraft: Uprising Trapping Garfield Angel Sanctuary The Amber Spyglass Sleep Rabbit (zodiac) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) 1925 serum run to Nome Liquid breathing Sin City EastEnders Rabbits in Australia KaBlam!
