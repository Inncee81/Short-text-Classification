when is it time to put your dog to sleep i have a year old black lab mix who has a hard time getting up and around he has had many accidents in the house the vet has him on the strongiest pain medicine there is he cannot run around and chase squirrels anymore one day he will sleep all day and the next he is pacing stumbling around he has a good appetite but he has a hard time standing up to eat his food he will walk himself into corners that he can't get out of several times i have come home and found him in situations where i don't know how he got into and he has urinated all over himself i love him very much and it is very hard to see him this way i don't have any kids so he is like my child what do i do i feel your pain my dog was in very much the same state before i made the decision to put her to rest it was unfair to her keeping her alive in the state she was in just as it is unfair to your dog it was a very hard decision to make but i knew that when i had to literally carry her outside and hold her up to go to the bathroom and when i had to feed her food because she couldn't stand up to eat it herself when i had to pull her out from underneath tables and chair in which she got tangled up her time was much overdue can you imagine what it must be like for your dog living like this putting my pup to sleep was a very hard decision but i knew it was the best decision for her even though i didn't feel it was the right one for me i knew i wasn't ready for it but i also knew that she was i scheduled the appointment the day before and spent the entire night sleeping next to her in the morning as if she knew it was her last morning with me she had a burst of energy second wind as they call it she managed to stand up and run around as if she were a puppy again it broke my heart how could i put her down now when she was running around happy wagging her tail but i knew it wouldn't last long while she lived out her second wind i took her on our last walk before getting in the car to take her to the vet tears rolled down my face the entire drive as they do now she was so peaceful waiting at the vet to be taken out of my arms she seemed thankful thankful that she wouldn't have to suffer any longer thankful that she had her second wind and got to enjoy one last day with me it was hard leaving the vet office with a collar and leash but no dog i must've sat outside on the curb and cried for an hour but i knew it was the best thing i could've done for her from what you've described it seems to me that it's time for you to make the same decision make the decision for your dog to ease his pain and suffering not for yourself because you don't want to let go you can't be selfish any longer it's time for you little buddy to rest peacefully believe me you'll be glad you did it sometimes i regret not having done it sooner so that i may have spared my dear pup the misery of her last few weeks but i was selfish i wanted to keep her for myself a little longer despite the pain and suffering she was in i know it's hard but you're the only one who can decide unfortunately our four legged friends can't tell us their wishes nor can they execute them themselves we need to act in their best interest i hope this helps remember the wonderful memories you've had and don't make any more memories of your dog's final days it's unfair to you both Shaggy dog story Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Blood on the Tracks The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Guinea pig The Contender (television series) Pitaten Sin City 2004 Republican National Convention Hal Trosky W.I.T.C.H.
