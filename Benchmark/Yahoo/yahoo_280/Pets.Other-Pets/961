can anyone give signifigant evidence as to chickens being able to fly i'm wondering if chickens can fly or not i believe i have seen video on tv of chickens flying up a small distance when startled but i don't know if they are flying or rather jumping if anyone has a website that can give evidence that would be great thanks sorry no websites just my own chickens different breed types of chicken fly or don't fly some are okay flyers and fly up to roost in trees at night one of mine roosted in a tall standard rose tree she was such an avid flyer that clipping her wings didn't even stop her i swear i do know how to clip wings others are even better flyers and can go a good distance for a chicken to get away from predators or frustrated owners lol i would think that the closer they are in body type to wild chickens the better their abilty to fly we are just so used to seeing heavy bodied chickens that we forget there are many other types oh and turkies too they are excellent fliers we have tons and tons of wild turkeys were i live Chicken Taikyoku shogi Capercaillie Bat Falconry Satchel Paige Fixed-wing aircraft Aerial (dance move) Wild Turkey Bird migration Kakapo The Ashlee Simpson Show Equine conformation Domesticated turkey Radio controlled airplane Frequent flyer program Wright brothers Insect The Cure ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity Yu-Gi-Oh!
