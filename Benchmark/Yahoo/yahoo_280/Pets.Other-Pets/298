would a x x ferret cage be okay for a guinea pig there is only one level so the living space is basically 'x ' but i will leave the wire part on because the pan is only like inches deep and so a piggy would be able to climb out i will buy lots of toys and an igloo and food bowl and stuff and it already has a water bottle my ferret is too energetic for the cage now that the second level ledge broke he just sleeps all day if i keep him in it which i only do if i have to be out all day which is rare otherwise he plays in my room all day from am to pm i am wanting a guinea pig and was wondering if i could recycle sonny's cage when i buy him a new level one or if i would have to get a new one too small one guinea pig needs to a x cage more if possible http guineapigcages com Hamster Chinchilla Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Professional wrestling match types Invader Zim Pig Champagne (beverage) Livestock Opportunity rover Magic (illusion) Whaling Pet skunk The Sims Plastic Stanley Cup Chicken Mattress RuneScape quests Mealy Parrot The Ersatz Elevator Tesla coil Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Australasia ecozone Garfield Mount Everest Fish farming Recycling Drawn Together Mad Money Ford Falcon Buddy Guy Lisa the Vegetarian Sea-Monkey Johnny Cage The Muppet Show Coconut crab Canary Skateboarding trick Steel Cage Match Cuisine of the Philippines Trapping Pet Japanese tea ceremony Papua New Guinea RuneScape locations Animals (album) Lord of the Flies Pigs is Pigs (1937) Ramen Peruvian cuisine Conker's Bad Fur Day And All That Could Have Been Waste management Barbecue Power Rangers: Ninja Storm Gramophone record Pink Floyd pigs Mike Piazza Geography of Africa GIR (Invader Zim) Tribble Brewery Bong John Cage Pacific Ocean Vitamin C Factory farming Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Neopets Faraday cage Steel Animal Liberation Front Barbed wire Castle of the Winds The Golden Age of Hollywood animation The Downward Spiral Big Brother UK series 6 Ferret armoured car Fast bowling Twisted Metal Star Trek: First Contact The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe W.
