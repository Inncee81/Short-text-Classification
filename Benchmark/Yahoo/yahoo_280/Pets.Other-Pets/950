how can i tell if my bunny likes me do they make a noise or wut he likes you if he comes up to you while you're just sitting or laying on the floor doing your own thing don't reach for him or try to pick him up and he'll be more comfortable and will probably start hopping all over you and may nudge you with his nose if he likes to be petted he may make a soft purring sound with his teeth when you pet him and that means he's really happy not all of them do this though if he grunts or growls he's telling you he doesn't like something if he scratches or even bites when you try to pick him up or reach into the cage it doesn't really mean he doesn't like you it has more to do with a fear of being picked up or not wanting his cage invaded the link below is a neat site that tells all about bunny language and what it means when bunnies do certain things Cat Guinea pig Dog training Salad Fingers Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Hamster RuneScape quests Kender Domestic rabbit Milton H.
