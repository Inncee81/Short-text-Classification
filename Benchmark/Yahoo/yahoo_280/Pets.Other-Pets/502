cats vs dogs what's your say it depends on your personal preference and your home and lifestyle if you have a small home or apartment and spend most of your day at work cats are the way to go they require little maitenance and care and are ok with living in small apartments they also won't make much noise so your neighbours won't even notice you have a pet for the most part they do not mind being alone for most of the day dogs on the other hand require a lot more attention they are active busy and loud they're good for active people with larger homes that have a yard so they can excersize you have to have enough time in your day to at least walk them once a day if they are alone for too long they will chew things whine and become pretty upset i suppose you could have a small dog in an apartment but they still bark a lot and disturb neighbours just my opinion i love both animals though Housebreaking Garfield Hamster Fancy rat Obedience training Dog Theory of conduct Ferret Philip J.
