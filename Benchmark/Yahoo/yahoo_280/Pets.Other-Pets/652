my dog died i was wondering if i could have him stuffed so he could stay with me forever and if so where can i get it done and how much does it cost im willing to do it myself if i have to if anyone knows how to do it yes this can be done it is on the expensive side of things around dollars i personally see no reason to do this as it isn't the dog but just a shell of the dog maybe a grave site would be a better choice then you can visit it and lay flowers Manos: The Hands of Fate Japanese funeral Care Bears Make money fast The Amber Spyglass Search engine optimization Insurance Paul Is Dead Kodocha The Apprentice 2 Christian eschatology The Critic Bicycle frame Obedience training Burial Laserdisc Dog training My All Super Mario Bros.
