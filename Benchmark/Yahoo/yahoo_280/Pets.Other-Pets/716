is it bad for a rabbit to give it granola bars an elderly neighbor has been gone for a few days and had asked me to look in on her rabbit the rabbit is housed comfortably in an outdoor hutch with plenty of room to scamper about the only care required is to feed and water it looking at the rabbit's food i was rather nonplussed it looks like green pellets and has a strong smell i thought that the rabbit must get tired of eating this and wanted to give it a treat so i gave it a granola bar which it promptly consumed since it seemed to enjoy it so much i went and retrieved another and gave it to it my girlfriend noticed me going back and forth and inquired if all was well with the rabbit when i told her i was giving it granola bars she said that was a stupid thing to do that i probably had made it sick and should tell our neighbor when she returns as well as apologize i wasn't trying to hurt the rabbit just give it a treat are granola bars really harmful for rabbits should i apologize no matter how natural a granola bar might seem they're still processed and contain more sugar and sweeteners than a rabbit should have as boring as a rabbit's diet might be their pellets and hay contain all the nutrients they would need and are fortified with vitamins it's probably not going to hurt him unless that's all you've been feeding him lately but at the very least you should let the neighbor know just in case if you really want to spoil him share a piece of apple or go and guy him some wooden chew toys or goodie basket from the pet supply place Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Hamster Fancy rat Nutrition Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Breastfeeding Chocolate Tea Tlingit Tocopherol Folic acid Rabbit Tooth Dog Cat Vitamin Japanese tea ceremony Sugar substitute One Piece minor characters Raw food diet Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mealy Parrot Little Britain Granola Nutrient Honey Sea-Monkey Egg (food) Rice Food Garfield Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Chicken Vitamin C Milk Bread Dairy Snack food Cyanocobalamin Kevin and Kell One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Dietary fiber Microeconomics Care Bears Quaker Oats Company Alzheimer's disease Kodocha Ferret Organic farming The Inside Tofu Sin City Moe Szyslak Breakfast cereal Vegetarianism Fecal incontinence Natt__ Two Treatises of Government The Catcher in the Rye Tenshinhan Beavis and Butt-head Livestock Food preservation Foodborne illness Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Garlic The Shining (film) Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Omega-3 fatty acid Unreal Homer Simpson The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Foie gras W.I.T.C.H.
