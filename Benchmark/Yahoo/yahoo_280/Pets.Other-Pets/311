horses help i need some info on what to do hey i have a thoroughbred gelding hh years old he was in riding very well and all and then he went lame so he was off riding for two months when he was completly cured i rode him and like an idiot i didnt lunge him or anything prior to riding him again and he bucked well obviously i know hes not to blame so im on a one month holiday and he doesnt allow anyone else to ride him he bucks and goes crazy this was even when he was not lame like he is only attched to one person so itys a pain cuz i have to go on this trip cuz my best friend is in hospital so i am left choiceless i have asked the grooms to lunge him once a day not more because i live in dubai and daytime temps get up to degrees celcius i dont know that in farinheite but its a hell of a lot um i just need some advice on like when i come back after a month how i should ride him what i should do thanks a lot he is a bit of a bucker thanks a lot xx first off unless he's a really active horse i wouldn't reccomend longeing him every single day try every other day so he still gets work but doesn't get tired of the routine turn him out often if you can so he can run and play at his discretion plus he won't get bored and turn to causing havoc as a source of entertainment when you get back spend some time on groundwork with him that way he'll have time to remember who you are bond with you again and it'll give you some time to test how his ground manners are these are a great indication of how he'll behave under saddle then longe him for a little with the saddle on this will help him relax and again you can see just how good he'll be when you get back on him if he is a little buck y he'll have some time to get the kinks out finally get on him but don't work hard for the first few days do walk trot and maybe a little canter that way you can work on his responsiveness without giving him much opportunity to buck go crazy you should also spend a lot of time working on patterns and transistions walk halt halt trot walk canter trot halt to name a few do some serpentines and figure eights and any other shapes you can come up with these can help you see how his responsiveness is limber him up from not being ridden for a month and will keep his mind occupied so he's less likely to buck good luck Horse Equine conformation Seabiscuit Horse tack Battles of Lexington and Concord Jack Buck Eventing Equitation Social rule The Catcher in the Rye Show hunter Jon Secada 2004 World Series Humphrey Bogart The Invisibles Tennessee Walker $ale of the Century Knots Landing Theory of conduct The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Breaker Morant Captain Thunderbolt Blood on the Tracks Pump It Up 1957 World Series Major League Baseball television contracts Hunt seat Dog training Little Britain Hey Jude Cliff Richard Charles Darwin's illness Sydney Riot of 1879 Atomic Kitten Charmed Disneyland Tenshinhan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) FoxTrot The Marshall Mathers LP Thoroughbred 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Shaggy dog story Frankie Laine Ty Cobb Hip hop collaborations 2004 American League Championship Series Married... with Children Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Chicago White Sox Causality Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kim Possible Can't Hardly Wait Paragliding Meditation She Loves You 2000 Australian Grand Prix Satchel Paige Stomach cancer Year of the Spider Battle of the Bulge Tire Steven Wright Pneumonia Francis Bacon (painter) Horse breaking EastEnders Garfield Piccolo Junior Saga Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Harness racing Boston Red Sox Horse racing New York Knicks Pitaten Japan Cup The Kinks Game show Urinary incontinence Beatles for Sale Lee Harvey Oswald Trot (horse gait) Customs and etiquette of Japan History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Three Stooges Eddie Guerrero Ben Johnson (athlete) Figure skating Obedience training Jeopardy! in culture
