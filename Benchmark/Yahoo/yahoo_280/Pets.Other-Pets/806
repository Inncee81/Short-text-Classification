what do to you do to 'punish' a horse i don't like the word 'punish' because it sounds controlling but when you have a horse that is pushing you around physically into fences or just to be rude biting you kicking you or just refusing to let you near it's feet to clean it or totally refusing to let you get the saddle blanket on i giver her lots of positive re enforcement but what to do when she is rude and a bully to me other horse 'punish' each other by pushing back by biting or kicking back obviously i won't do that i won't hit her or yell that would get her very upset as she was abused she is not always like this but she has her days how would you handle it she is not like the other horses i have had she is sensitive to me but won't give in she gets upset easily i understand your horse was abused but she's obviously past that stage now if she can get up the nerve to be bratty and enter into your space even bite and kick you she needs some serious discipline i'm no trainer so i can't tell you how to handle such a horse correctly but i'd say a lot of lunging and backing practice on her part when she gets in your space slap her if she has the nerve to bite you yes slap her if she can be rude enough to bite you you can be rude enough to bite her back a lot of yielding exercises for your safety for the most part though if you feel you cannot handle this i would get a trainer Horse tack Equine conformation Spanking Dog training Horse Milton H.
