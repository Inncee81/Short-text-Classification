on the pga tour how are tee times determined for the first two days first understand that pairings for the first two rounds for most events are created by a computer program that uses various categories for them one category might be former tour winners with full exempt status while another might be former tour winners playing on past champion status another is non winner with full exempt status yet another groups nationwide tour grads q school grads and monday qualifiers together and categories will overlap since there is never a perfect number of each to fill out a tournament i've never seen an actual listing of all the categories but i've read enough about it and studied it enough to feel confident that my response here is relatively on target the tour doesn't publicize these categories a few reasons a couple of which include the fact that sponsors and tour organizers have liberties with which to play in promoting certain pairings i e grouping tiger woods and rory sabbatini if they wish allowed and for the most part the general public really doesn't care how the pairings are configured events like the pga championship traditionally group the winners of the masters u s open and british open if indeed they are unique which it did again this week now regarding tee times golfers with better status get better tee times you'll never see woods tee off in the first or last group in short he's earned the plumb read mid morning early afternoon start times then tour organizers will follow a template to spread the most popular golfers around the course to maintain optimum traffic flow among the spectators so while woods might be teeing off on the first hole at am phil mickelson might start at am on by the time woods reaches the th mickelson will be long gone as will his gallery again this isn't the formula for all events variances will apply and occur what's most interesting to me is that while television networks funnel enormous dollars at the tour they have zero say in who tees off when currently the tour maintains complete control over that dynamic and for good reason as no one golfer should have any more advantage over another beyond what he has already earned via status Golf The Open Championship PGA Championship Jack Nicklaus Vijay Singh U.S. Open (golf) Official World Golf Rankings Phil Mickelson Michelle Wie Gary Player Greg Norman Michael Campbell Tom Watson (golfer) Professional golf tours Nick Faldo WGC-NEC Invitational Majors Dog agility National Football League The Golf Channel Graduate school Lee Trevino Senior majors Baltusrol Golf Club August 2005 in sports Ernie Els John Daly (golfer) Hale Irwin THE TOUR Championship June 2004 in sports PGA Grand Slam of Golf Golf glossary ELO rating system Bob Charles (golfer) Playoff Hazeltine National Golf Club The Big Break The Championships, Wimbledon Caddy Women's majors ITV U.S. Amateur Championship Mercedes Championships Tour de France Sport in the United Kingdom LPGA Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Indianapolis 500 Annika S__renstam Sudden death Ian Woosnam Severiano Ballesteros Jeopardy!
