whats dancica patricks problem danica is an above average racer she will be a good driver win she actually wins one make no mistake im not putting her down im sick and tired of her throwing temper tandrums about other drivers driving she is shoving men knowing no respectable man would hit her but if she were a man they would throw punces and also is always talking trash that other drivers should move out of her way when shes got a chance to win its a race shit happens and its competitive its good to be competitve but to act and behave like she is is just trashy she needs to have better sportsmanship what do you think and should another drivers wife kick her a she thinks she is all that she was given that ride to get the attention for being the only female in irl she in my opinion get more attention than she has earned when she starts winning maybe then she will have the right to critisize others but she to the best of my knowledge has never won an irl race so shut up and drive nothing turns me off from a driver than listening to them bad mouth others or place blame etc Indianapolis 500 Danica Patrick Indy Racing League Tony Stewart Penske Racing Teen Girl Squad Michael Schumacher Shaggy dog story Jacky Ickx Drifting (motorsport) Scott Dixon Riccardo Patrese Jacques Villeneuve 24 Hours of Le Mans Auto racing 1957 World Series 2005 Belgian Grand Prix American Championship Car Racing Scuderia Ferrari Toranosuke Takagi Indianapolis Motor Speedway Audi Ernie Irvan Champ Car Formula One Dan Gurney Fernando Alonso Super Mario Kart Formula One regulations Jordan Grand Prix Ayrton Senna Renault F1 Roush Racing Cleveland Browns Hendrick Motorsports WilliamsF1 Oasis (band) Sydney Riot of 1879 Kart racing The Marshall Mathers LP True Crime: Streets of LA Derrike Cope A.
