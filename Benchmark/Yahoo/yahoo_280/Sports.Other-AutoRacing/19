the cars body design of f indy and champ car looks the same is it meant suppose to be that way the body design looks so much alike i can't tell the differences is there a difference in the body design if so please tell me okay thanks thanks for hte information so far but more information please while they look similar from afar they are all very different from each other for starters f cars are about lbs lighter than champ and irl cars second f cars are much more aerodynamically dependent than the american cars especially irl the f cars also have grooved tyres and are designed solely for road street racing champ and irl cars are designed for both oval and road street racing although champ has abandoned ovals their new dp chassis is designed to do them should that change and have racing slick tires lastly the irl and f cars have the big air intake above the driver's head because they're naturally aspirated engines need the airflow champ cars lack this as they are turbo charged engines under the hood champ car and f have much smaller v 's that produce horse power each irl runs a larger v that only produces horse power overall an f car costs about x what an irl car does and even more than that compared to champ after they released their new cheaper chassis this season but the result is that an f car is usually a tad bit faster than the americans so they look the same at first but are really very different Champ Car Indy Racing League Indianapolis 500 Formula One American Championship Car Racing Drag racing 24 Hours of Le Mans Stock car racing Porsche 911 Auto racing Truck Turbocharger History of Formula One Formula 3000 Fuel injection Radio controlled car Formula One regulations Motorcycle Formula One cars NASCAR Chevrolet Corvette Drifting (motorsport) Ford Thunderbird Honda CanAm Automobile V8 Hybrid vehicle Tire Car handling Open wheel car Team McLaren Toyota MR2 Mazda Miata Sports car racing Imperial (automobile) Indianapolis Motor Speedway Mercury Cougar Dodge Neon Honda Prelude Chevrolet Camaro Mazda RX-7 Toyota Atlantic Championship Mitsubishi 3000GT Future of Formula One Tony George Dodge Charger Wankel engine Supercharger Osella Toyota Celica Acura Integra (North America) De Lorean DMC-12 Sport utility vehicle Mercedes-Benz Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Scuderia Ferrari Eagle Talon Nissan Skyline Pontiac Ford Mustang Downforce Fuel efficiency Sports car Watkins Glen International Lamborghini Diablo Fixed-wing aircraft Porsche 959 Pickup truck V8 Supercar GP2 Series Diesel cycle Cosworth California Speedway Ferrari Formula One racing Alcohol fuel Tony Stewart Solar car Jet engine Formula Three Toyota Corolla Grand Prix Legends Gas turbine Knight Rider Ford FE engine Subaru Impreza Straight-4
