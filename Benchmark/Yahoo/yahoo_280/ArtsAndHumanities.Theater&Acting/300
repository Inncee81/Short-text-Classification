how to balance time between theater and work i have a part time job and now i've become interested in becoming an actor and as i know you have to start in community theater how can i balance time between these two things and how can i deal with it when the new school year starts please help i am going to be taking an acting class in school the main question im asking is how can i do community theatre without missing work i am more than merely interested in acting it is something i feel i have to do i was just wondering what kind of part time job would be best so that i can support myself while doing what i love most depending on where you live and whom you are the problem varies if there are a lot of part time employment opportunities in your area but few acting opportunities you should commit to whatever acting opportunity is available and find the right job to compliment it on the other hand if there are a number of opportunities to act and to work you should find the best mix it takes research to find what the real opportunities are generally people who are interested in becoming actors will never be successful success is generally limited to those who must act Live 8 $ale of the Century ITunes Music Store Shaggy dog story Internet fraud Calvin and Hobbes Public transport Taxation in the United States Surveillance FoxTrot Electronic commerce Jennifer Lopez Grand Central Terminal Filling station Google Microeconomics IPod Advertising The Amazing Race U2 (band) Kylie Minogue Octopus card New England Patriots Textile manufacturing Madonna (entertainer) Supply and demand New York Giants Computer and video games Price discrimination Plame affair Nintendo DS Best Buy Denver, Colorado Wheel of Fortune Microsoft Wedding Crashers Animal Crossing Enron Corporation Neopets Satchel Paige Britney Spears Delta Goodrem Tax Ocean's Twelve Cincinnati Bengals Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dot-com Jayne Mansfield Michael Jackson John Lennon The Phantom Manor Mutual fund Futurama (TV series - season 5) Donald Trump Nintendo Power Day trading In-N-Out Burger Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.
