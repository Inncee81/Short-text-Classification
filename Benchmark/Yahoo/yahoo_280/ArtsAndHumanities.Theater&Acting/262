please answer ok well i want to be an actress and i don't really know how to find auditions real ones that can get you into a tv series or a movie do you have to have an agent to get you to auditions let me know yes training is the key but obviously you don't need to wait until college to go for it if your family supports your goals you can and should start now especially with classes you should keep your grades up and you absolutely should plan on getting a college education because being an actor makes you your own business and being well educated and knowing how to run that business will be key to not getting taken advantage of and making smart business decisions in the future get yourself into classes for acting dance and voice lessons after that audition for local theatre productions then move on to student films and independants info to follow once you have a few roles to put on your resume you can try to get an agent if you want to find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit they absolutely are but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying don't forget that legit agents take of your pay after they help get you a job not one cent before and not one cent more good luck Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Child support Bond Insurance Federal Reserve Food and Drug Administration Minimum wage Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States New Deal Mutual fund Environmental Protection Agency Student loan FairTax Citigroup Credit card Tennessee Valley Authority Real estate broker Debt Flat tax European Space Agency Divorce United States Agency for International Development Defense Logistics Agency Tertiary education fees in Australia Education in the United States Public transport Wal-Mart Economic inequality Credit rating agency Economic rent Financial services Warren Buffett Contract with America Stock Legal aid Copyright law of the United Kingdom Progressive tax Unemployment Bay Area Rapid Transit Economy of the United States Pension Campaign finance reform Social Security debate (United States) Opportunity cost Plame affair Credit score No Child Left Behind Act Reparations for slavery Japan Self-Defense Forces Medicare (Canada) Food Stamp Program Cerritos, California Capitalism Remediation Principal-agent problem Microeconomics Graduate school Airline Deregulation Act Health insurance United Nations Open access Income Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Income tax Micropayment Anarchism and capitalism Defense budget of Japan San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Education United States Marshals Service Reserve clause 401(k) Microcredit National Health Service Agricultural policy Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Rick Santorum Advertising Temasek Holdings Agricultural Adjustment Act Environment Agency Union shop Tom Ridge Adoption H-1B visa Screenplay Municipal bond Tax Efficiency wages Air Force Reserve Command Canadian Space Agency Inflation National Kidney Foundation Singapore Non-governmental organization National Football League Players' Association Emissions trading Prostitution History of the United States (1918-1945) Compensation of employees
