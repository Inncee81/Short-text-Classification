i had an amazing acting experience and i know this isn't really a question but it's for those who really appreciate acting techniques i've written it all out in my previous question so if you're interested please have a look and tell me if you've had a similar experience a couple of times i've been sooooo in character that i have had to take a minute backstage to reel it all back in after a scene one was when i was playing the father leonato in much ado about nothing in the wedding scene he goes from proud father to disowning his child and telling her she would be better off dead he is then somewhat consoled and helped from the stage by the end of the scene but there were times when i was a little verklimt and had to take a minute or two to get back to where i needed to be in order to make my next entrance the same thing happened to me when i was playing john proctor in the crucible in college but this time the overruling emotion was rage another answerer is also correct however don't confuse hyperventilating with good acting The Chemical Brothers Jon Secada Jennifer Lopez Can't Hardly Wait Steve Martin Spice Girls Girls Aloud Hilary Duff Bill Peet Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story The Walt Disney Company Quarashi Walt Disney Major League Baseball television contracts MTV The Emancipation of Mimi Delta Goodrem The Beach Boys Britney Spears Aladdin (1992 film) Buddy Guy World Championship Wrestling Social rule Aaliyah Beatles for Sale New England Patriots Plame affair Great Teacher Onizuka AFI 100 Years series Elton John Sinfest World Class Championship Wrestling Detroit Tigers Good Morning, Vietnam Singlish Academy Award Robbie Williams Sky Digital Vladimir Peter Tytla Karl Rove Saved by the Bell Recess (TV series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Teacher's Pet (Disney) Characters in Bleach series Shit Friends Donovan Brian Griffin Cyndi Lauper Time Out of Mind Roy Orbison Wheel of Fortune Comedy film Genesis (band) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Academy Honorary Award Joan Crawford Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
