about agents okay i've been reading other peoples questions and i see that most of the answers for getting out there in the acting world and gaining auditions so forth and so on call for agents i was wondering what was the price range on agents and such and i know certian commercials or what not hold open casting calls but can you imagine how hard it is when you're not even eighteen yet and you live in north carolina nothing much happens here sorry 'bout useless rambling lol but yeah any comments on average costs for agents and what i should do since i live in a state that barely knows what the word industry means there are no aftra sag franchised or non sag franchised agents in the state of north carolina so now what all i really need to know is how to go about finding a suitable agent or something and so are you saying that if they charge you to represent you it's a scam are you kidding are you anywhere near wilmington one tree hill is filmed there as was dawson's creek according to wikipedia over film tv productions have been shot in the area the largest sound stage outside of hollywood is built there check out the nc film office website i have no idea how big nc is so it may not be possible for you to get to wilmington but if it is then check out agencies there you could probably at lest get some extra work if you're not near there then you're right there probably aren't many agencies in your area b c there's probably not a lot of demand in that case if you want to act check out your local theatres your high school even churches even if you're in a small town there should at least be some opportunities also no you don't pay agents they take a percentage of your earnings so they only get paid when you get paid secondly outside of ny and la you don't necessarily need an agent to get you work in dc we have very few agencies most of the offices are casting directors so you get rid of the middle man essentially they still take a percentage of your earnings though but you don't have to sign an exclusive contract Screen Actors Guild Modelling agency Katie Holmes Microeconomics Film Real estate broker Plame affair Insurance Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Contract Advertising Screenplay Citigroup FairTax Mutual fund National Kidney Foundation Singapore One Tree Hill (TV series) Supply and demand North Carolina Bond Natural monopoly Principal-agent problem Home Box Office Unreformed House of Commons Advance fee fraud Screenwriting Publishing Marlon Brando Public domain Canadian House of Commons RKO Pictures National Football League ITV Taxation in the United States Tax Child support Lawyer Filmmaking Confidence trick CPU cache Boston and Lowell Railroad Xerox Paul Is Dead Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Reparations for slavery November (film) Airline Unemployment Theatre Humphrey Bogart Merit Credit card Karl Rove University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Education in the United States Education Wall Street Public transport Article One of the United States Constitution Raleigh, North Carolina The Apprentice 2 Minimum wage Primerica Financial Services Estoppel Cinema of Canada Trademark Secretar__a de Inteligencia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Paintball Boston Red Sox Casting (performing arts) Inflation Major League Baseball television contracts Altruism Avenue Q Movie studio Dawson Creek, British Columbia Value added tax Poker jargon Kasparov versus The World United States Postal Service The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
