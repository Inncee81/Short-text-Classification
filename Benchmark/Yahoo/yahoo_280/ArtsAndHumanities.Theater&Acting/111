what to wear to community theater auditions i am a teenager and i am trying out for a play on august fourth and i just realized i have no idea what to wear i don't want to look like i know nothing about auditions by dressing up too much but i don't want to seem like i rolled out of bed i probably won't get a role because there are very few parts for my age so i wonder if that plays a part in the desicion also if the audition description says cuttings from the play should i have memorized a monolougue too because i didn't just dress comfortably don't let your clothing distract from what you are doing the more you can be at ease the better you'll be able to perform as a director if i see that an actor is too concerned with how he she looks i'm less likely to cast him her because he she may be more difficult to work with wear something that doesn't inhibit movement and isn't necessarily attention getting Hilary Duff Theatre Little Britain History of the Beatles Theater terms My Life as a Teenage Robot American Idol Humphrey Bogart Elijah Wood Marlon Brando The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) EastEnders Batman Forever The Wall Autism Gender role The Shining (film) Procrastination Saturday Night Live Shaggy dog story Blonde on Blonde Drag (clothing) Clothing Plame affair History of SNL:1980-1985 Aida (musical) Cross-dressing The Star Wars Holiday Special Skirt and dress Strap-on dildo Street-Legal Brave New World Equine conformation Alias (TV series) Bon Jovi Katie Holmes Marching band Saved by the Bell Monty Python Milton H.
