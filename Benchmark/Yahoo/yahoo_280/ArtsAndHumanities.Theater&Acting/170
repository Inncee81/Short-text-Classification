i'd would like actors' opinions on why you got into acting in the first place i've been an actor for a long time and i've talked to many professional actors both famous and not so famous about this very few say they're in show business for the fun of it perhaps this is idealistic on my part but i only do it because i enjoy it i've made some money acting and that's always nice but if i didn't like it i wouldn't do it professionals talk about the 'work' of acting and getting the next 'job' which is fine but nobody every says something like this is the funnest job i've ever had yes acting is hard work and it takes comittment and dedication and it must be taken seriously which i totally agree with i'm very professional when i'm working on a show i'm just curious as to what others have to say about this in my mind it is possible to do this as a profession and have fun at it too like my grandmother always said find something that you love to do and make that your career and you'll never have to work a day in your life so i did i got into acting without the decision to make it a career i have seen what a career in acting can do to a family and i decided it wasn't for me but i love performing i perform i teach and i learn if i were in it for the money i'd be very bitter by now but i kept that part out of it and just worked hard got involved in as many shows as possible kept my work hours as flexible as i could and just went out and did it years later i settled down and now i have a family but i still perform and i still teach i think my experience as a kid helped me set my goals differently than most i didn't want to be famous or be rich from acting i just wanted to perform and some applause would be nice i love watching my students as much as performing i got to see things from a wow this is neat perspective rather than how can i get ahead i learned to be competitive without being too cut throat i hope i imagine doing this as a job would have its rewards but it comes at such a cost that i admire those who can balance it i was fortunate to know what i wanted from life and from acting and i'm glad to say i have them both good for you for finding your balance too W.
