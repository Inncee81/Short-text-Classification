is west side story completely based on romeo and juliet i don't think it completely is i think it has to do a lot with the gang warfare at the time btw facts help more than opinion in this question yes west side story is based on romeo and juliet with the jets representing the montagues the sharks ad the capulets riff is mercutio bernardo is tybalt chino is paris and anita could be friar lawrence butit's more than that it's also about racism and even more about love because of anita's love for bernardo being placed aside for her love nd understanding of maria and her love for tony and then there is that amazing last scene where maria doesn't actually die but it is her living influence and the compassion they all feel for her that trully unites the jets and the sharks and i think the ending in west side story is lmost more powerful with chino realizing what he has done and handing the gun meekly to maria maria staring up at them all while crouched over the body of her beloved as if to ask 'why ' and then threatening them all with a death by hate before collapsing in tears both of them are inccredible plays Hangul Drama Irony Object-oriented programming Writing system Theatre Musical analysis Postmodernism Unicode Social psychology CPU cache Python programming language Cognitive science Deconstruction Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Play Second language acquisition Chinese character Database Meaning Storytelling Simplified Chinese character Film director Improvisational theatre Socrates Stanislavski System Asperger syndrome Leet Marching band Logic Arabic alphabet Writing Religious Society of Friends XML Semiotics Lisp programming language Philosophy of language A Course In Miracles Philosophy Goodness and value theory Propaganda Music Sign (semiotics) Arabic language Chinese language American and British English differences Theatre director Quentin Tarantino Metaphor Standard Cantonese Speech synthesis Burroughs B5000 Structuralism RISC Actor model Meme Current teachings of Prem Rawat AppleScript Robert Altman Screenplay Cuneiform script Scientology beliefs and practices Past teachings of Prem Rawat Franz Boas Power (sociology) Lighting designer Sociology Aphasia Friends Transactional analysis Donald Davidson (philosopher) Compiler optimization Filmmaking Internet slang Kanji Software engineering Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Consciousness Discordianism Chinese grammar Perl Modem Computer program Infantilism UTF-8 African American Vernacular English Visual Basic Literature Autism English grammar Biology Daredevil Tom Stoppard Gerome Ragni AmigaOS
