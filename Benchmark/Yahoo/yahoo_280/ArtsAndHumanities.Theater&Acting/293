should technical theatre resumes have years on them i have heard both sides of the argument should i include the years of the shows or not and why thanks in general theatre resumes don't need to have years on them some one looking at your resume is more interested in your range of experience and possibly the companies you've worked with and isn't too concerned with when you did each job if you are submitting your resume for something other than a tech job say for admission to college or grad school then you might want to include dates in case they want to verify the facts or if you want to highlight the number of years of experience you have i'm a director and when i see dates on a resume it's usually a person who is fairly green you might want to consider which choice would make your resume seem more impressive if you've been doing theatre for many years and you want to show that off you could include them or if you want to show that you were a part of some now well known company early on sure you could include dates but if you just started this work recently you would probably want to direct attention to the type range of experience and not necessarily showcase how long or not long you've been doing it Wicked (musical) Broadway theatre University of Denver Blue Man Group Theatre Sally Ann Howes King Crimson Bee Gees The Waterboys The Jackson 5 Sonic Youth Jerry Springer - The Opera The Supremes The Monkees The Jam The Jazz Singer Lindy Hop Before the Flood The Yardbirds Madonna (entertainer) Alain Boublil David Bowie Chicago theatre Fargo, North Dakota Rock and roll The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue New York City Subway Hair (musical) M__tley Cr__e Music genre Improvisational comedy Eddie Kramer Mississippi John Hurt The Doors Nirvana (band) Les Mis__rables (musical) Jerry Herman Disc jockey Gerome Ragni Dream Theater Rammstein New Order Porgy and Bess Jesus Christ Superstar Journey (band) The Beatles Ben Elton Movie theater Jandek Ethel Merman New York Giants Jelly Roll Morton Super Bowl Warren Haynes Led Zeppelin Adore Santa Rosa, California Oasis (band) Spamalot Miles Davis Ian McKellen Fleetwood Mac African American music Edinburgh Fringe Tony Bennett Bo Diddley Circus Actor The Band Sun Ra Deep Purple Nat King Cole Pink Floyd Blonde on Blonde Styx (band) Music history of the United States Stand-up comedy Art Ensemble of Chicago Eric Clapton Louis Armstrong Chicago (band) Johnnie Ray Rhythm and blues The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical) Ramones Clear Channel Communications Pow-wow Ritchie Blackmore Grateful Dead Christian Death Bruce Springsteen Billy Joel Mot__rhead Beastie Boys James Taylor Roxy Music New York City Fred Ebb Marching band History of the Beatles
