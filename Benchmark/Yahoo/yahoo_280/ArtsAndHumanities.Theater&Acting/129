is this childrens tv audition spot a scam at the mall i got signed up to audition for acting and they called me a few days ago and now i have a spot to audition this saturday some people on yahoo answers have told me to watch out and thats its probbaly a scam but i saw the same audition advertisment on tv as well so im not sure if its real or not here is the ad i saw on tv http youtube com watch v vm qjac pjw is this a scam or not this looks like a common scam a company who really sells high priced classes advertises auditions for a disney show but in the end they give you the hard sell on their classes for somewhere between they have you audition by reading a short scene or commercial often from a well known product or even a disney show these pages are very easy to obtain or type up yourself watch the show copy the dialogue that's all there is to it they film you on camera and have you go to the next person who will either tell you that you have potential but you need to take their classes or tell you someone will call you if they're interested and they'll always call because they want your money i've heard that they put on the hard sell meaning that often they try to pressure you into paying for several months of these classes by saying that they are only offering this opportunity to so many kids and you're really lucky to be getting this deal and it's only available now blah blah blah if they're so reputable then why do they need you to pay now because they just care about getting your money they prey on kids and parents with stars in their eyes please don't fall for it don't give them any money they don't even say who they are i'll bet it's john robert powers or another company just like them who have been sued over and over again for ripping people off reputable agents do not hunt down new talent at the mall nor do they advertise for them on tv they don't need to because actors are banging down their doors by the thousands every day what you need is to do things the right way not look for ashort cut get sold training at a reputable acting school or theatre make sure your family supports your decision all the way get into theatrical productions work your way up to student films and independents then try to find an agent without handing thousands of dollars over to people who really aren't going to do anything for you and could care less about your dreams and your career if you want to find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying
