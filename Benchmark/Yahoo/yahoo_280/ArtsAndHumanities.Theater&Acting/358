what do i need to watch out for with my child i posted a question earlier about how to get my month old daughter into advertising auditions modeling etc to help provide money for her future is there anything in particular that i need to watch out for as far as scams for example i read somewhere that there are no fees associated with the business only a percentage taken upon payment of an awarded job or that with an infant we do not need to pay for an expensive photo shoot because they change so often that they generally only require casual snapshots taken by family or friends they recommended that if they try to tell you otherwise than it is not a safe place to go are these things true is there anything else that i need to look for or any tips that experienced people can offer me i really appreciate any help out there i think this would be a great opportunity for my daughter and would ease the stress on us trying to save up money for college for her there was an answer posted a while back for a similar question so i will repost it here in regards to having to pay money up front to an agent no you shouldn't have to managers on the other hand work a little differently for the photos well you have to understand that the photo that someone looks at has literally to seconds to catch someones eye this is sometimes the first and last best chance to make an impression if you want to be taken as a professional you need to have professional items to work with they will cost money up front and they will need to be retaken every few months or so i know some parents who get their kids shots retaken every four months usually costs about for the session plus reproduction fees but they are working contantly and make that all back plus more after the childs first booking but in response to your question here is the previous answer pick up a ross report or backstage paper at a newsstand both of them list agents and managers from there you begin the process of mailing pictures and letters expressing your interest the pictures should be an accurate representation of your child and they should be flattering no messy face crazy hair or other weirdness parents often send pictures they think are cute but are very unflattering to their child have someone not related look at them and tell you what they think you can also look for open casting calls many managers and print agents do these to find new talent there are various schools and talent searches competitions out there but at that is a waste of your money while many of these places do what they say and introduce you to agents and managers it is a hefty fee they charge there are also websites that for a fee will post your child s picture in the five years i worked as an agent i never met anybody who ever got any work this way they wasted their money and were put off by the whole business be sure this is something your child can do many kids are hams at home and around people they know put them in a strangers office and ask them to perform and they freeze up be prepared explain to your child what is expected of them nine times out of ten a small child becomes mute in my office and i am amazing with kids and very approachable most casting directors are not so your child has to be able to turn it on without any warming up otherwise it's see ya and as a last and most important piece of advice never pay money to get your kid in the business anybody who says you have to pay them to represent you is running a scam agents and managers get a percentage of what you are paid from jobs they book you on they only get paid if they find you work you should never give anything upfront if you don't work they don't get paid that's how the system works look for union approved agencies and you should be safe good luck and happy hunting Drama The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Parsifal EastEnders Whose Line Is It Anyway?
