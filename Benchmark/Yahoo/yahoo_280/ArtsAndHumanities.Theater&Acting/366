what can i do to improve auditions for plays i am really into acting and have been a part of a few plays i took years of a high school drama class but it really only offered instruction for short skits speech and placement and i've been taking singing lessons so to the problem i try out for community theatre and don't make it you are probably thinking if she can't make it into community theatre then she should just give up or something along those lines better or worse who knows but i was just so nervous and apparently didn't fit the part and it was a moderately sized community so i tell myself i am looking for tips from people who know what they are talking about what can i do i'm and alto and must really suck help please i've gone through the same thing one good thing is to be confident at the audition even if you have to just pretend that you are confident then it will help your audition begins the moment that you step out of your car they watch everything you do not just your reading or whatever you are doing for an audition you do not suck don't even think about telling yourself that just show up early and make sure that the directors know that you are there look right into their eyes and introduce yourself proudly if someone else needs a reading partner be one of the first to volunteer well that's most of all that i can think of best of luck to you on your next audition i hope to see you in a movie someday d The Walt Disney Company Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Happiest Homecoming on Earth Walt Disney World Resort Walt Disney Imagineering Hong Kong Disneyland Resort Disneyland Amusement park Hong Kong Disneyland Disneyland Hotel Main Street Electrical Parade Carolwood Pacific Railroad DisneySpeak Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room Disney-MGM Studios Walt Disney anthology series Disneyland Resort Paris Disneyland Resort Tokyo Disney Resort Fantasyland Disney's Animal Kingdom Disneyland Resort Line (MTR) Adventureland Jungle Cruise Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Cinderella Castle American Broadcasting Company Disneyland Park (Paris) Walt Disney World College Program MTR Disney's California Adventure Audio-Animatronics Sleeping Beauty Castle Pirates of the Caribbean Disney Channel Space Mountain Mickey Mouse Walt Disney Studios Park The Haunted Mansion Magic Kingdom Minnie Mouse Carousel of Progress Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh "it's a small world" Monorail Disneyland Monorail System The Standard Splash Mountain Frontierland Disneyland Railroad The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror Epcot Transport in Hong Kong Rapid transit Donald Duck KCAL-TV Hong Kong Police Force Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters Japan Airlines Reedy Creek Improvement District People mover American Dragon: Jake Long Tourism in Hong Kong Star Tours Hilary Duff Walt Disney World Railroad MediaCorp Pixar Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Innoventions Peter Pan's Flight Television network Disney Store Clay Aiken American Idol Fantasmic!
