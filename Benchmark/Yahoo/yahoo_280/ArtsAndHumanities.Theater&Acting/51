i have read and seen much ado about nothing its theme is more complex than love lies and denial any ideas i saw the play tonight tomorrow at two p m is the final performance at csueastbay in hayward and it was so real i have read the play previous to this in a shakespeare class so i know the storyline and characters well what i need help with is the theme not the story what is it really about it is more than denial andfinding true love it is more than plotting against purity isn't it what do you think that the underlying theme is of this play i read a comment which was posted monthes ago that mentioned the idea of nothingness hence the title what do you think thanks for considering this and responding the title of 'much ado' is interesting because it seems to work as a pun on several levels firstly the play is itself 'a lot of fuss about nothing' hero wasn't unfaithful beatrice and benedick don't really hate each other all the characters' problems could be resolved really simply it's just that human beings are complicated and perverse and never want what's best for them another meaning is based on the fact that at the time when shakespeare was writing the word 'nothing' was pronounced a lot like the word 'noting' so the play is much ado about noting about people listening in on each other's conversations spying and overhearing stuff that they shouldn't the third meaning is then based on the fact that a woman's vagina was often referred to as 'nothing' at the time because it couldn't be seen easily and so 'didn't exist' unlike the male penis therefore the play is also 'a lot of fuss about women's private parts' another theme is control of women and possession of them the power struggle between what men want and what women want and the role of human sexuality in all this in terms of themes in general there are therefore lots of things to talk about the battle between the sexes the way in which love and desire is irrational with people not wanting what is best for them the fact that love and hatred are often very closely connected etc etc there isn't just one thing that the play is about it's a complex work of art which raises numerous different issues and ideas Much Ado About Nothing Human sexual behavior Deconstruction Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Plame affair Homophobia EastEnders Shaggy dog story Sex Iago George Costanza Theory of conduct Theodicy Isaac Asimov Androgen insensitivity syndrome Shakespeare on screen Fight Club Extreme Programming Free will Oral sex Infidels Gender-neutral language Avenue Q Objectivist philosophy Human Brave New World Goodness and value theory Drama Hiberno-English Sexual intercourse Tl__n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius Christopher Marlowe Predestination Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Effeminacy Sex and the City God Emperor of Dune Sant Thakar Singh Charmed The Catcher in the Rye Sharon Tate Zoophilia Capitalism Days of our Lives Meaning of life Sexual orientation Social rule Transsexuality Philosophy of language YuYu Hakusho Drawn Together Intersex surgery The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Penis envy The nature of God in Western theology Tao Te Ching Abortion debate The Merchant of Venice Gender role Sodom and Gomorrah Shakespeare's reputation Blackadder Shakespearean authorship Empire Burlesque Sigmund Freud Ten Commandments Carlos Castaneda Homosexuality and transgender Gender Nihilism Something Positive Identity Crisis (comics) Atheism Bat Lash The Apprentice 2 David Hume I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Daredevil Epistemology FLCL Homosexuality and Christianity Friends Culture of Lithuania Humphrey Bogart The Chronicles of Narnia Summa Theologiae House of Leaves XML Yoko Ono Paradox Three Laws of Robotics Storytelling Ex-gay
