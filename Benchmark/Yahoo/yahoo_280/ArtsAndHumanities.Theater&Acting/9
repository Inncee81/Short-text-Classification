why is that sometimes you look wierd while acting on camera sometimes in my on camera acting class they playback the scenes and sometimes i look and sound really weird it doesn't even look like me or sound like me does this happen to you i noticed that i don't have that much stage presence it been bothering me and i want to work on it for the voice you always sound different to others than you do to yourself because you're hearing your voice through your own head as well as with your ears just ask your friends do i really sound like that and they'll always say yes after a while you'll get used to hearing it that way and the ten pounds thing really is true too i'm usually unhappy when i see myself on tape the only thing to do is practice in front of a video camera preferably one you can play back immediately tape yourself doing a monologue or something then watch it anything that you don't like attempt to change next time around as you practice you'll learn how to project the character the way you want i know it's hard but keep your confidence up and good luck The Ashlee Simpson Show Time Out of Mind "Weird Al" Yankovic Reservoir Dogs Whose Line Is It Anyway? 8 mm video format Shaggy dog story Sound recording Highway 61 Revisited Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Digital cinematography Avenue Q Microphone Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind MP3 The Price Is Right Blood on the Tracks Theatre The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Futurama (TV series - season 2) Pitaten Sant Mat Social rule 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sharon Tate Taxi Driver The Star Wars Holiday Special Camera The Beatles bootlegs United Airlines Flight 93 The Inside God Emperor of Dune Bohemian Rhapsody Little Britain Sound effect Hearing impairment Dog training Saturday Night Live The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blonde on Blonde Pet Sounds Music The Basement Tapes Dubbing (filmmaking) Infidels Late Night with Conan O'Brien Copy protection Videocassette recorder Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Non-native pronunciations of English Split Enz True Crime: Streets of LA Peter Gabriel Stuttering Surveillance Columbine High School massacre Piccolo Junior Saga VHS The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Ren and Stimpy Movie projector Royal Assent The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Anamorphic widescreen Irony IBM PC compatible Audiophile Film The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Machinima Singlish Stereoscopy Floppy disk Stereophonic sound Milton H.
