i have a question for people skilled in theatre and concert lighting i went to a concert for the first time since i was last night and was really intrigued by the lighting i am the tech director in my highschool's drama club so i recognized most of the lights used as pars but they were using another type of light that i did not recognize they were hanging moving lights that shot out focused beams there were also some on the floor of the stage that had less focused beams i don't think that they are really used in theatre lighting probably just in concerts i was just wondering if anyone knew what these were called i'm a complete techie and i like to know as much as possible thanks they are no doubt various kinds of ellipsoidal and fresnel spotlights in today's lighting the spotlights have remotely controlled motors which allow them to be refocused in use some also have color changing ability they are used both in concerts and theatrical productions but few schools have them due to the great expense Stage lighting Lighting Theatre Film Ellipsoidal Solar power Carnegie Mellon University Headlight Speed of light Lens (optics) Theater (structure) Lighting designer Drama Irish theatre Traffic light Fresnel lens Universal Century Technology Cliff Richard Super Metroid King George V School Sydney Opera House Puppet Light Milton H.
