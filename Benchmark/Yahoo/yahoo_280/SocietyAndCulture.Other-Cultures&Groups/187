why do white americans always say they're irish italian german etc but have never even been to those countries you people obviously misunderstood me what i'm saying is that white people should say that their ancestry is irish italian or german instead of sayinfg that they are that i mean none of you white americans even know the culture of your ancestry so why say thats what you are boneless chickn please you're not pissing me off i dont give a crap what you say i'm just saying people who ask what you're mixed with are racist i mean who cares where you are from is more important i think your issue here is really more about phrasing than about actual origin but as for you saying that people are racist for asking about a persons mix i don't see any reason or logic in that statement i mean it might be a bit rude to ask hey what are you mixed with but i've wanted to know if a person was korean japanese etc and i've politely asked them because i was curious not racist if you say that shouldn't matter perhaps you're right but it really makes no difference it all blends together with how we identify with ourselves and each other our racial and cultural divisions didn't come about so we could bitch about our differences but so that we could celebrate our uniqueness and find things in common with one another that goes past the superficial Racism Black (people) African American White (people) Nationalism Profanity Nigger Family name Palestinian Multiracial Hispanic Ethnic issues in Japan Creole Philosophy of language Theory of conduct New York-New Jersey English White nationalism Shit Blacks and Mormonism Anglosphere Plame affair Colonial mentality Caucasian race Germanic peoples Social rule Avenue Q Zionism and racism Reparations for slavery Atheism The Marshall Mathers LP Euphemism Lie Grammatical gender Mestizo Pre-Adamite Joke Multilingual Afro-Latin American Mongoloid Japanese name Chinese character Al Sharpton Korean adoptee Culture of Korea Esperanto as an international language Japanese American internment Who is a Jew?
