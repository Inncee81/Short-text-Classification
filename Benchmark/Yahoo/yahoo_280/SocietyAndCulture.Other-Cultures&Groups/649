what can you tell me about the inuits today i realised today that i know nothing about the inuits how much of their inuit traditions do they follow to this day do some of them still live their traditional lifestyle i mean what's their culture now do any of them marry outside of their inuit heritage i know that sounds odd but i have never met anyone who's just like a half inuit on the other hand i've never met an inuit what are their modern lifestyles like i'm sorry if any of this question came accross as racist it wasn't meant to it's just extremely difficult to ask about something like this when you're as ignorant as i am thank you very much yv and my thoughts btw i had a look at wp but they weren't very clear they maintain some traditions but for the most part they have modern lifestyles like everyone else the reason why you don't see a lot of inuit or half inuit people is because there aren't many inuit people in the world i think their worldwide population in alaska canada greenland russia etc is only about if that and they all mostly live in the same place so unless you live there you won't meet many inuit people Inuit language Inuit Inuktitut Eskimo Inuit music Native American music Inuit mythology Greenland History of Greenland Marriage Dorset culture Indigenous peoples of the Americas Thule people Kayak Transcontinental nation Native American name controversy Iditarod Native Americans in the United States 1925 serum run to Nome Mongoloid Reindeer Canadian nationalism Nunavut Hans Island Totem pole Who is a Jew?
