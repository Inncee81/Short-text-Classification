how do you raise kids to see both parents as the same dispite the parents being different ethnicities i want my kids to see myself and my girl as white i think that kids do see parents as the same until outside influences contribute their opinions kids don't see a color until other people make an issue about color i understand because my spouse and i are raising kids my girls are white and he is black however they don't make it an issue yet anyways my son and his daughter are both mixed and they really don't see a difference its all about you not making colors different you contribute alot to the way your children view the world and the people in it if you don't make it an issue they usually won't either Black (people) White (people) Family Who is a Jew?
