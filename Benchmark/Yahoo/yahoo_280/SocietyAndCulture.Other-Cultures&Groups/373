why do black people like tyler perry seriously is he funny what the hell am i missing responses to questions and comments white people who like jeff foxworthy are idiots is that also true with black people that like tyler perry and i dont have color issues i read an article that said african americans love tyler perry and i just wanted to know why i haven't watched it but it looks stupid to me like mama's family but with a drag queen okay again i didn't bring race into this i read an article about how he was popular with black people it is not racist to say one particular demographic is a fan of something i realize different people have different tastes but believe it or not groups of similar people sometimes have the same taste the point that most of you are missing is that a certain demographic happens to be more inclined to like a style of humor over another group this does not mean that people from a different group don't or can't like that style of comedy it just means that the majority by proof of survey is of one race culture Joke Fight Club African American Vernacular English EastEnders Pantera "Weird Al" Yankovic Nigger The Mary Tyler Moore Show The dozens Family Feud SpongeBob SquarePants Redneck Aerosmith White (people) Paul Is Dead Shaggy dog story Minstrel show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In African American music Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Comedy Whose Line Is It Anyway?
