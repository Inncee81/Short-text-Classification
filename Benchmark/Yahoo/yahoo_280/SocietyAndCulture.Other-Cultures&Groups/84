clowning krumping hip hop tworkin' why is it that some people really don't respect those types of dancing i've heard people who twork be called strippers with clothes and people who clown and krump called idiots hip hop dancing is getting a little more respectable but no one really respects the people who do these things i feel sometimes that if the same person was dancing ballet instead of the hip hop arts it would be a whole different story why do you think that is is it because it's different do you think that the people who dance these styles from other races get treated any differently if you do any type of hip hop art do you get treated differently i don't know what clowning or tworkin' are but i do know what krumping and hip hop and i think hip hop is cool i personally don't like krumping it looks strange to me like someone is having seizure but that is just my opinion i have respect for people who do it because everyone deserves respect i used to dance ballet and it takes alot of skill and talent but people don't view hip hop that way for whatever reason is club dancing considered hip hop because if it is then maybe that is why i don't think people dislike it becuase it is different but maybe it is because they just don't like it i like to belly dance and i'm sure there are people out there that don't like it because it is different or because they don't like that kind of dance Hip hop culture Krumping Lindy Hop Music genre Breakdancing Alternative hip hop Glossary of partner dance terms American hip hop Selling out Freestyle music Hip hop rivalries Hip hop music Reggaeton Comedy British hip hop Arts in Birmingham Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Swing (dance) Martial art Theory of conduct Sampling (music) Beastie Boys House music Rapping West Coast Swing Jay-Z Disc jockey Music of Hawaii Trip hop 2Step Black (people) Music Music history of the United States Aerosmith Cuban hip hop Hip hop fashion Usher (entertainer) Hip hop collaborations Marvin Gaye History of subcultures in the 20th century Music of Ireland Bemani 3 Feet High and Rising The Chemical Brothers Roots of hip hop music Music of Puerto Rico Ballroom dance KRS One Save the Last Dance Ol' Dirty Bastard Tupac Shakur Belly dance Timeline of hip hop Serbian and Montenegrin hip hop Music of France Rhythm and blues Latin American music The Emancipation of Mimi Shaggy dog story Postmodern music MTV2 Music of California East Coast hip hop Licensed to Ill Insane Clown Posse Music of Namibia En Vogue Gangsta rap Public Enemy Timeline of trends in music (1980-1989) Dance Dance music Drum and bass Missy Elliott Striptease Jennifer Lopez Circle (dance move) Done by the Forces of Nature American popular music Tony Hawk's Underground Polyamory Asperger syndrome Social rule 3 Years, 5 Months & 2 Days in the Life Of...
