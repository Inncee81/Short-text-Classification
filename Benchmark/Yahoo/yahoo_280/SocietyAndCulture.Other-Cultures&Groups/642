most agree that vincent price was a better actor than spencer tracy why no oscars for him why was hollywood biased against vincent price hollywood was biased against vincent price because he was well known for his hatred of the hollywood sign he said that it never made sense to have a sign like that on the hill and that it only caused confusion as people would think that hollywood was located at the very top of the hill next to the sign price was asked numerous times to take back the disparaging marks he made against the sign they warned him if he never took it back that he would be in b movies forever i hope this helps Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Vincent Price Katharine Hepburn Humphrey Bogart Henry Fonda Hollywood Squares San Fernando Valley Casablanca (film) Robert Altman Entourage (TV series) George Cukor Martin Scorsese Titanic (1997 film) George M.
