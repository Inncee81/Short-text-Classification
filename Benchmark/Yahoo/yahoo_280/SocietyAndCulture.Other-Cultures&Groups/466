could you update me in current politically correct names i don't mean to offend on the contrary for instance people with different capacities african americans etc thanks in advance thanks for current responses the thing is that mexican idisyoncrasy is different to the american one we tend to be more direct because people not necessarily find it offensive to call someone for what they are for instance we call deafs as deafs blinds as blinds blondes as blondes blacks as blacks fats as fats and so on and i understand this is not seen correctly in america and actually may offend several people and i wan't to avoid it for instance i just found out that it is no longer correct to call black people as color people again no offense and i felt bad because i think i used it in my last trip to usa also for instance in brittain you call blacks as blacks and not as african americans so well i guess you get the point many thanks for your help a politically correct lexicon your how to guide to avoid offending anyone by joel bleifuss i think this is helpful for knowing what to call different kinds of people for example asian the correct term to use for anyone of asian ancestry when accuracy is desired nationality of origin is appended to american as in korean american sen who describes herself as south asian or indian american says that there is some push around not conflating everybody into asian this is mostly an issue among new immigrants if there hasn t been time for a generation it seems to be hard to move those folks to the asian category chicano correct term for people of mexican ancestry popularized during the civil rights movement we use it to refer to u s born people of mexican descent says sen mexican american is the more distant politer thing to say hir hirs gender neutral for him and her at wesleyan university incoming freshmen are instructed to use gender neutral pronouns in campus correspondence as one person wrote on the university s online anonymous confession board i am usually attracted only to people of hir original gender rather than hir intended gender as such i m afraid that i m like viewing hir wrong or not respecting hir wishes or something hispanic we never use hispanic says sen it privileges the european roots of the identity of mexicans born in the united states hispanic however is the preferred term of people in the southwest whose families are descendents of spanish colonists indian the preferred term for native americans indians either use their specific tribal name or use indian says sen you use the qualifier american when you need to distinguish from indian indians latino capital l with a or o at the end used to connote gender politically correct term for those from spanish or portuguese speaking cultures we use it instead of hispanic when we want to refer to many different national groups where there has been an indigenous european mix says sen native american some indians object to the term seeing it as a way to linguistically eradicate indian and thus the history of their oppression by whites i almost always hear native american and in the more enlightened conversations there is usually indigenous thrown in there somewhere says lott sen says native american seems to be a more distant construction developed by academics Gender-neutral language Mestizo Indigenous peoples of the Americas Native Americans in the United States Race (U.S. Census) Native American name controversy United States Chicano Chinese language T-V distinction Languages in the United States Indigenous peoples Creole Non-native pronunciations of English Sexual orientation Mexico Affirmative action Asian American Family name Democracy Transgender Pedophilia Colonial mentality Culture Nationalism Spanish language Filipino people Gender Race Multiracial Evangelicalism New Mexico Homosexuality Anthropology Media and ethnicity Second language acquisition Portuguese Creole Ethnic group South Africa Transsexuality Spanish pronouns Africa Anti-Americanism Color Racism Colonisation Music genre Martial art Autism rights movement Afro-Latin American Latino Afrocentrism Jew God and gender Black nationalism Nigger South America American Sign Language Vietnamese language Palestinian Esperanto as an international language Goodness and value theory Liberalism Mission (Christian) Quebec French A Course In Miracles Euphemism California Queer Spanish verbs Immigration to the United States Southeast Asia Bosniaks Joke Magic (paranormal) Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Music of the United States Mulatto Demographics of Brazil Zambo Arab Celt Separation of church and state White nationalism Education in the United States Theology Cross-dressing Latin America Gender role
