why are women pro sports such a joke why do all of them fail i mean no offense to them all of them fall flat on their faces the one some what successful one is the wnba but that will sink in a couple of years why do all of them fail so miserably i don't care to watch women's basketball or softball but i am glad that they are there for female athletes to shine and those who do i think the reason i don't enjoy them is because they try to live up to men's standards too much at least in women's basketball why is the goal so high if women are generally shorter than men what are they trying to prove here that means they can't dunk and that is 's of the entertainment in basketball to me lower the goal and make the game more exciting and i loathe that windup underhanded pitching in softball just throw the damn ball normally love women's tennis and gymnastics and volleyball Volleyball Softball Basketball Water polo Women's National Basketball Association Texas Longhorn Athletics American football Southeastern Conference Sport Sports timeline Syracuse University Orange Playoff format Louisiana State University Baseball National Collegiate Athletic Association August 2004 in sports Sports in Puerto Rico Indiana State University Minnesota Golden Gophers Big East Conference University of Texas at Austin Big 12 Conference University of Houston Tennis National Basketball Association China at the 2004 Summer Olympics New York Giants Illinois Fighting Illini University of Kentucky West Virginia University University of California, Los Angeles Lebanon Valley College Texas A&M University Michigan Wolverines Atlantic Coast Conference Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Ultimate (sport) Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Ruth Riley Women's sports Georgia Institute of Technology Big Ten Conference Football (soccer) September 2004 in sports Cornell Big Red University of San Diego Julius Erving Associated Press Athlete of the Year Utah State University Lisa Leslie United States Air Force Academy Sonoma State University Youngstown State University Arizona State University North Carolina State University United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Ball State University London 2012 Olympic bid Middle Tennessee State University Gymnastics The George Washington University 2002 Commonwealth Games Sheryl Swoopes University of the Pacific Badminton Major professional sports league California State University, Fresno University of Arizona Mid-American Conference Arkansas Razorbacks University of California, Santa Barbara Chicago Bulls Belmont Abbey College Lacrosse National Football League Lore Commonwealth Games Sandy Koufax University Athletics Association of the Philippines University of Missouri - Columbia Japan at the 2004 Summer Olympics Creighton University 2004 Summer Paralympics Toronto Raptors Illinois High School Association Kobe Bryant Ty Cobb Yao Ming Larry Bird Shaggy dog story University of Alabama at Birmingham Physical education Tulane University Human height College basketball October 2004 in sports Heidelberg College Indian sport
