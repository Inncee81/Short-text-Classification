are white women threatened by women of other races i'm white but i'm often mistaken for hispanic or told that i look like i'm mixed with another race i have dark brown hair and dark features i take it as a compliment because i think women of other races are usually more attractive than white women i've had people basically tell me that i'm too pretty to be just white it's true that most of the attractive celebs i know of are either non white or look like they're non white i often wonder if the average white woman feels threatened by non white women white men are starting to date asian women more and commonly favor their thinner smaller body types i've heard that in heavily populated asian areas there is a lot of resentment toward asian women by white women latina women are stereotyped as hot and sensual historically when black men dated interracially they dated white women but that's changing i'm not bugged because i don't feel i look like a typical white woman i almost feel like i'm another race how about you p s this is an observation i personally am not threatened by non white women it just seems that some white women are as i have heard them make negative comments about asian women for example people can be and threatened by a race of people for various reasons and it's true that many white men are attracted to asian women because of certain characteristics it's not just shallow men either there are differences among the races and it's not racist to acknowledge that and have preferences i like black men because they tend to be more open and straightforward and i'm just attracted to them doesn't mean i don't like white men or could never be interested in a white man but a lot of white men are threatened by my liking black men i can't even say i find a black man attractive in the presence of a white man don't act like it's not common for people to be threatened by people of another race just look at how many white people are bothered by the growing of latinos welll im not white im white and black and i would nevert want to be just white or be just black cuz i like the way i am no but i hate to say it what u say is kinda true white women are nt seen as exotic in this country theres lots of white people here so no one sees them as special and i just thought about it most of the celebrities that i see as pretty are either mixed with white or non white at all im not being racist just telling the truth as for white women being jealous or feeling threatened uhm i dont know about that Black (people) Interracial couple Asian fetish Social rule Physical attractiveness Racism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an African American EastEnders Hispanic Avenue Q Joke Theory of conduct Human sexual behavior Affirmative action Sexual orientation Sento Race (U.S. Census) Race and intelligence Ranma __ characters Race of Jesus Maison Ikkoku Multiracial Tenchi Muyo!
