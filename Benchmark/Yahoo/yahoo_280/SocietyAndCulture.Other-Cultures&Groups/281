why do small people get offended by the word midget i'm not a small person and the phrase small people makes me want to laugh and seems to be more offensive than midget this is a real question because i really don't get it and i don't like using the phrase small people maybe its just because i don't like politically correct phrases in general for instance i'm black and i don't really like the term african american or colored people i did noticed the first sentence isn't in correct english probably because many people use the word in an offensive way like when someone sees a person who is short for their age and they call them a midget and start making fun of them Political correctness Joke Whose Line Is It Anyway?
