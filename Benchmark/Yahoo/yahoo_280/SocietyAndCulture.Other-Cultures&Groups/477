if you are asian did you find your parents to be stricter and harsher than other parents or do you know any asian kids whose parents were total dictators i was reading a message board devoted to disgruntled asian children whose parents were totally abusive and apparently it's common just wondering your thoughts excuse me timatcrosby but just who the hell are you asking you a smutty question i can only assume you came across a question you didn't agree with as nobody specifically asked you a smutty question if you don't like all the material presented to you then i suggest you move on i'm not about to be lectured or censored or made self conscious by some faceless person named timcrosby basically what this means is you are are delusional and you need to stop following me some parents are abusive but its not always because of grades it could be something like not listening to what they tell you to study or something worse and they still wanna beat you up this is mostly from asian fathers though some asian people i now say their fathers are very abusive Sant Thakar Singh Infantilism Milton H.
