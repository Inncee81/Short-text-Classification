i'm so sick of the race card i'm moving from tx back home to va and the racial issues were part of the reason i left to begin with i'm trying to prepare for it and trying to remain positive for now here's the way i see it i'm white many black friends never racial probs the city is full of crime and stating that where you live is dangerous is a fact not racist pit bull fighting is a horibble crime and noone should downplay it's severity the naacp is a worthless group of racist hypocrites another well known fact i'm not out to ruin the black race i'm not racist at all and i'm sick of idiots like jackson and sharpton spreading hatred and using their own race as a means to gain power maybe if we approach it like we do in our personal relationships the race card would rarely be used it's never come between my friendships and try to laugh about our differences it feels good re ashley actually my friend was raped robbed and thrown in a dumpster by a black man so i don't need to understand anything that doesn't mean i hate black people it was one person who did it that's the one to blame i'd like to hug you girl political correctness dictates that we must quiver in our boots at the mere mention of the word racist i don't and apparently you don't good for you i've been called a racist for asking a black guy to turn down his stereo the word has devolved into a simple non offensive insult hurled by hate filled people who have only that word as a weapon while i agree strongly with you upon each point you mentioned there is one upon which i wish were not true you are leaving texas don't go you have the type of common sense that fits in very well in the lone star state best of life to you in going home Racism Joke American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Nigger Vernon Schillinger Theory of conduct Al Sharpton Anti-Defamation League Sin City Hate speech Rape Nicomachean Ethics Avenue Q Nation of Islam Mojave people Poker jargon Hate group Nadir of American race relations Philosophy of language Domestic violence Yu-Gi-Oh!
