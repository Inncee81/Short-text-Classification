the real american black experience as a black american which singers would you want to be looked at as representing the true heart of the black american experience and aspirations leadbelly jellyroll morton billy holliday b b king temptations aretha franklin platters supremes snoop dogg li'l missy beyonce tupac b i g and why did you make that choice o k let me explain where i'm going here and what i'm trying to understand first with leadbelly jellyroll morton billy holliday b b king they all lived just a couple of generations removed from slavery they lived through the darkest era of segregation but still kept their dignity and sense of humor their lives were pure hell but they persevered and overcame all the obstacles in their paths to become icons of american music and among many others of their era left an indelible influence on american music they were personalities that young blacks could look up to because they symbolized strength and triumph in the face of evil second the temptations aretha franklin platters supremes all covered the turbulent era of the civil rights movement and all of them even the early platters used their songs to address the serious problems of the black community papa was a rolling stone love child r e s p e c t etc they made good livings but they returned a hell of a lot more to the community than they received financially they tried to make a positive change in a community that was being torn apart during the ' s and ' s when the civil rights movement left a lot of blacks wondering who to follow m l k malcolm x the black panthers etc these groups were talking straight and hard to the kids then and trying to guide them or at least get them to ask the right questions for their futures now we've got snoop dogg the late tupac the late b i g li'l missy and beyonce all covered in bling and using derogatory terms for black women and girls that would have had their grandmothers' slippers off and smacking their butts before they knew what happened black women who fought for the past hundred and fifty years to be free and proud are now being degraded by not just the black male rappers but the females as well it's like the farther ahead the black entertainment community gets financially the farther back they're falling in self respect and dignity i mean i can't see aretha taking the sh t from any of the gangsta rappers that young black girls are soaking up just to be fly today can anybody explain this it's like in the depths of the era of slavery and segregation the black community turned out w e b dubois booker t washington fredrick douglass harriet tubman and on and on and on the civil rights era gave the world m l k malcolm x muhammad ali jackie robinson ralph bunche sports heros without steroids proud dignified and dedicated leaders whether or not you agreed with their particular direction but now who the hell do the black youth have as role models eddie murphy can yell out let the nigger talk in the nutty professor the n word's used more now by blacks than by crackers in the ' s that's why i asked about the music difficult to answer each person you have named has contributed their talent in different 'era's' i sincerely feel where you are coming from agree with you it seems that some african americans have found a 'niche' to which they are singing rapping about 'what is' in so far as their this present time not having the experiences had by those in less humane times i dare say that those that stood against oppression did not come that far to hear a brother call someones daughter ho a sign of self oppression the blame i feel cannot fall on politics race or disrimination as single entities but as a joint effort even then it is for each individual to take responsibility for their actions blame no one i personally refuse to call anyone 'n' or 'ho' hold dearly my culture so much so that it is on my face peace love respect to you African American American Civil Rights
