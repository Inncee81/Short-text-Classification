a what if question what if hitler had taken over the world i believe he is the muggle version of voldemort i read some stuff here and there about the bastard what do you think woulda happened if he won how different would the world be today i'll start i would have never been born because both my parents are immigrants mom dominican late father puerto rican they most likely would have been forced to stay in their old countries and my late father's mother had depression she would've been killed for being that way there'd be no america or usa the majority would be the 'aryan' race blond white people with blue or gray eyes after europe he would have tried to take the world i mentioned voldemort because they are both bastards and voldemort was the entity i could compare the other one to but the muggle is worse because he lived and was real voldemort was not then there would hve been more than a holocaust of jews other races would be almost unknown or heard off but mostly he probaly would have got killed in a driveby trying to take over a black neighborhood he would have failed miserably Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Severus Snape Dates in Harry Potter Hispanic Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire White (people) Puerto Rican R.A.B.
