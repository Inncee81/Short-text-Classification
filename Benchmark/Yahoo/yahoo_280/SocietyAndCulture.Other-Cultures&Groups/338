why is it racist when a white guy says the n word but not when i black guy says it ex when that seinfeld michael richards a k a kramer lost his temper and yelled get thoes n's out of here everyone said he is a racist but if a black comedian would have said it nobody wouldnt have made such a big deal about it it's basically the whole the pot shouldn't call the kettle black thing if i'm ' and your ' and i teased you about being tall you'd probably take it as a joke this is because for me to tease you about being tall that would mean that i'm also teasing myself and generally people do that in humor also kramer said alot more than the n word things like years ago you would have been hanging from a tree i think that's why people made such a big deal about it i personally don't say it and i try not to surround myself with people that do that word has too much negative history for it to be taken so lightly Seinfeld Tea Cosmo Kramer Avenue Q Japanese tea ceremony Nigger Jewish humour Michael Richards Bart chalkboard gags Saturday Night Live Eric Cartman Ku Klux Klan Joke Have I Got News For You George Costanza Black (people) Friends Redneck Fictional crossover Fujian tea ceremony Stand-up comedy Lie Fridays Extras (sitcom) The Wack Pack Eddie Kramer Hong Kong-style milk tea Singlish Richard Rahl I Want to Hold Your Hand Situation comedy Negro Professional wrestling slang Larry the Cable Guy The Fairly OddParents Minor characters in Seinfeld Chinglish Oolong The nature of God in Western theology Fictional character Shit Dragon Booster Chinese tea culture Spidey Super Stories Mancow Theory of conduct Ojibwe language Blackface Social rule Comedy Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
