why is the white house white instead of black is for some racist reason let me start by giving you a warning this is a very complicated and delicate matter as it concerns the white house the very building which rules america the west i would not think of criticising the white house for a second if not for reading what you lot alledge it is of being racist this is all rubbish firstly back in the th th century the building had already started to get dirty and the colour changed to a greyish texture which was miserable in tone they then decided to make it more appealing for various reasons like national interests and the media which came much afterwards that the colour chosen was white to make it look not only attractive but also stand out from other buildings and the surrounding environment thus getting its name as the white house never mind black not even blue beige or yellow paint will ever be painted on this sacred building because of the name and the white colour which has become part of its tradition now by the way i don t know whether it should have been black or not but it has nothing to do with people s colour white people as you say it are not white in colour they do have some pigementation to remain healthy people vitamin d in this case is important i am shocked that you blame white people for having painted it white who s being racist now this is all wrong i think you should consider your country s sacred building once more and respect it for all it has done for you instead of criticising it and defaming it on yahoo answers it is quite sad actually i hope people will understand one day that without politics we ll never be able to stand tall it s just a shame get your facts right or do not talk about politics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule Black (people) Plame affair Anti-Defamation League Color Flag of South Africa Slander and libel The Adventures of Tintin Pauline Hanson Palace of Westminster Snooker Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nation of Islam Canadian House of Commons Hair color Taxicab Political colour Skinhead EastEnders Falsifiability O.
