when you hear the term i like a girl with some meat on her bones what comes to mind first when you hear that phase some meat on the bones do you think of a slim and curvy girl or do you think of a really fat girl well obviously there's a broad range of body types and fat percentages but it seems like everyone has an idea of what's considered too skinny just right or too fat i once heard a skinny girl say another one was too skinny i've heard people say that fashion models are too skinny but to me most of them aren't at least not the really famous ones paris hilton to me isn't too skinny nicole was getting too skinny at lbs but when she hit lbs that was too much i'm on the fence about lindsay on one hand i thought she was beautiful but on another hand i thought she was obviously too skinny when she got to lbs and lower the first thing i think about is chicken like he is comparing a woman to some type of meat like chicken then i think maybe he is talking about a curvy lady but some guys are talking about fat women i know this one guy who said that he liked his women w a little meat on her bones and his girlfriend was very overweight not just curvy so i think it depends on the person i don't think that i am skinny because i have hips and butt but i have still been told that i am skinny by people that are bigger than me even though i am the normal size for my height i weigh b w and i am ' and that is right in the range of where i should be but it is all a matter of opinion Atkins Nutritional Approach Sin City Gisele B__ndchen Garfield Body mass index Equine conformation Skinny Puppy Physical attractiveness Buttocks Obesity Phoebe Buffay's songs Friends Humphrey Bogart Tyra Banks Elvis Presley Milk Mixed martial arts Little Britain Aerial (dance move) Prostate cancer Jennifer Lopez Anorexia nervosa The Chemical Brothers Nicole Richie Lauren Bacall The Critic Hip hop rivalries Corset Weight Growth hormone treatment Milton H.
