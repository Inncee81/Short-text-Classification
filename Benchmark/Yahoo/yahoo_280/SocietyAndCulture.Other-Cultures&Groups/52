do you think people using the term 'n word' minimizes the effect rather than saying the word nigger i say the media and those who opt not to 'offend' others should just say what they mean and use the word iteself we all know what is trying to be said anyone take the venom out of the snake what say you i say we eliminate the actual use of the word for the same reason almost that we don't really want to be surroinded by curse words i don't know about you but i think that there need to be standards for our speech in an intellectual use sure the word should not be 'bleeped' out of our history it is there and is a part of some things important things that need to be discussed about our past but the word should not be de venomized words have meaning for example aren't you tired of ppl saying i swear on my mother's grave life soul and lying anyway once upon a time swearing was a huge unspeakable deal now a man's word is as good as just getting by with the last sticky situation he set himself up for and some ppl think that it is an exaggeration to say that words like n r won't ever become that common but i assure you that these ppl underestimate the power of day to day practice dumbing down the word is a small task for society but by no means an honorable one others who say that words shouldn't have power over you are right and in denial no one should be able to control you but no oneshould deny the power that words do have in fact they are up there with the most powerful weapons any body can hurt another person with brute force and spit it takes someone who matters the use of someone's brain to hurt a person with words words simply have meaning Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deconstruction Simone Weil Profanity Soul Nigger Philosophy of language Utilitarianism Ten Commandments The Marshall Mathers LP Property (ownership right) Aikido The nature of God in Western theology Pedophilia Euphemism Sin Evil Jewish bereavement Constitution of Ireland Thomas Carlyle Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Inflation Socrates Joke Holocaust denial Contract Christian eschatology Sola fide Meaning Scientology beliefs and practices The Death Gate Cycle Human Microeconomics Plame affair Democracy Goodness and value theory Characters in Guilty Gear Fathers' rights Lie Confucius Mao (game) Power Rangers Michel Henry Legacy of Kain Religion Anarchism and society Polyamory Rape Spanking Domestic violence Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Censorship Kain (Legacy of Kain) Religious Society of Friends Shit Hulk (comics) British House of Commons Drag racing Gender-neutral language Homophobia Republic (dialogue) Sant Thakar Singh Ownership Friedrich Schleiermacher Phoebe Buffay's songs Computer numbering formats Classified information Philosophical Investigations Martial art A Course In Miracles Supply and demand God and gender The Shining (film) Intelligence quotient Value system Coercion Tai Chi Chuan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Merit Psychosis Postmodernism Escape from New York Epistemology Ethics Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gross domestic product Mary, the mother of Jesus Left-handed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind RISC
