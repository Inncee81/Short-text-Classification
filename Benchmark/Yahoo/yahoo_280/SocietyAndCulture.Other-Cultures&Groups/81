why do some of you hate us i have realized that not all blacks and whites and other racist hate each other but there are still some ignorant people out there that do some dont even know why they hate but for the ones that do why why do you hate blacks whites asians hispanics etc people who are racist sexist or homophobic tend to be of low intelligence either they come from an un educated family who has taught them their ignorant and backward ways or they're scared of what is different which is still stupid i don't mean to cause offense if you're religious but i've done research in to this since i also don't understand why someone can hate others for no reason and i've so far found that this hatred actually came from the bible the bible says slavery is okay because whites are superior it also says that gays are sinners and women are inferior it happens to be the root of this evil which makes sense because if you saw a green skin coloured man walking across the street you're instant reaction would not be oh i hate that guy you would most probably be curious as to why he is green and where he is from you would be more interested than anything else no matter what nobody's instant reaction would to discriminated against the green people so why do some people do it against blacks whites asians hispanics etc because the bible says so again i'm not trying to offend religion but that's a fact Homophobia Racism Nation of Islam Nigger Sin Sexism Religion White (people) Rastafari movement Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Religion and sexual orientation Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Hate speech Criticisms of Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Race and intelligence Avenue Q Sexual orientation Anti-Defamation League Blacks and Mormonism Affirmative action Opus Dei Hate group Human Neofascism and religion Jews as a chosen people Evangelicalism African American Ethnic issues in Japan Atheism Feminism Profanity Discrimination Creationism Homosexuality John Howard Yoder Recurring South Park characters Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religion and sexuality Nazism Intelligent design Anti-Semitism Polygamy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Little Britain Anti-Mormonism White supremacy Uncle Tom's Cabin Self-hatred Gay Propaganda Colonial mentality Nadir of American race relations Homosexuality and Christianity Psychology of religion Afrocentrism Capital punishment Gay rights Original sin Neopaganism Eric Cartman Evil Creation science Cult Equal Protection Clause Curse and mark of Cain Joke The Smoking Room Evolutionary creationism Christian-Jewish reconciliation Theology Pre-Adamite Societal attitudes towards homosexuality LaVeyan Satanism Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Religious conversion Philo Persecution of Christians Interracial couple Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Chosen people A Course In Miracles Skinhead Witch-hunt Fundamentalism Media and ethnicity Jewish views of religious pluralism Islamophobia Socrates Stupidity White separatism Idolatry Abington School District v.
