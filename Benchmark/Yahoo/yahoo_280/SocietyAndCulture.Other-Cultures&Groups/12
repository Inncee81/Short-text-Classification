my year old joined a christian play group and we are not christian this is not meant to be a racist question by any means but is there anything i should know if making friends with christians i'm sure this is a silly question and they are probably just like everyone else but just asking no offense intended honestly actually i'm also wondering will they look down on me because i'm not christian i will probably be making friends with the mothers also the reason we joined the group is for the kids to have someone for them to play with it's like blocks from my home where they meet each tuesday at the park so it's very convenient and just trying to make friends i do believe in god i was just raised as lutheran labeling your religion doesn't make much sense to me i guess i'm not as religious as a lot of people but i do believe in god girl i am a baptist christian and i have lots of friends who aren't the same religion as me and it's not promblem we believe in god as well so there is really not much you need to know we are all human no matter what we believe in so relax the fact that you and these people all belive in god is great and they should not we are not to judge so tell them what religion you are and if they are true christians it won't matter to them it's great your children have joined a play group and it's for the kids so don't let adult religious matters get in the way Religious conversion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion Infant baptism Atheism The nature of God in Western theology Theory of conduct Rich Mullins Predestination Baptist Prophet Supernatural Nation of Islam Church of Christ Roman Catholic Church Evangelicalism Who is a Jew?
