why do many people claim others to be of certain races according to the convenience of their discussion i'll give a couple of examples to illustrate these are from my experience while discussing the enslavement of africans many blacks refer to the arab slave traders as white or white arabs on the other hand some of these same people claim that arabs and other middle easterners are actually black or ''closer to black than white'' while discussing criminal activities many whites claim that certain criminals are black regardless of their physical features such as how lightly complected they are on the other hand while discussing accomplished folks people are suddenly referred to as white light skinned or just part black or a little black why do people do this deeds don't change a person's lineage i know that some of you may think i've answered my own question that people do this for their own convenience to reflect positively or negatively upon people according to the impression that they want to give but what i really want to know is what i really want to know is what's the point like i said lineage can't be changed i just don't get it no i'm not saying that some people think only certain races can be responsible for certain things although there are people who do feel that way i'm talking about people who refer to folks as particular races according to what they're talking about use me as an example let's say that while people refer to me as white i would suddenly be called black if i robbed a bank understand what i'm saying why do people do this what's the point someone's blood isn't going to change just because people want it to martha plimpton ummm no what does my appearance have to do with anything yes you are right humans are feeble minded and your question is great i guess people need to justify their position continuously and changing facts is one easy way to do it truth is probably very subjective which explains why there is so much misunderstanding Theory of conduct Black (people) White (people) African American Vernacular English The nature of God in Western theology Scientology beliefs and practices Nation of Islam Blacks and Mormonism Have I Got News For You Abortion debate Epistemology Agnosticism Determinism Reparations for slavery Free will Religion Human Science Supernatural English grammar African American Arab Slander and libel Philosophy of language Sant Thakar Singh Bayesian inference Computer numbering formats Curse and mark of Cain Milton H.
