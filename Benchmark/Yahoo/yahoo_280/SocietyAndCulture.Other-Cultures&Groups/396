why the whining about asians not dating other races i am tired of seeing questions like why are whites dating mostly asians now or why asians refuse dating other races what do you expect when they are most likely to meet each other during college years or at professional jobs the monority with the biggest representation in top prestigious colleges and professional jobs are asians leading to frequet contact with the white population last month my cousin got married to a black guy she meet while working at microsoft this shows that if other monorities were more represented in schools and professional jobs the marriage or dating disparity wont be so obvious i think its cool i really like couples of different races it to me shows the world changing in a good way Interracial couple Affirmative action NWo Race (U.S. Census) Friends Jennifer Lopez 2000 Australian Grand Prix Carl Barks John Forsythe Snooker Race and intelligence Jumping the shark University of Houston Humphrey Bogart White (people) Multiracial Baseball Tiger Woods ABBA Equal Protection Clause White flight Economic inequality National Football League Makati City 2005 United States Grand Prix The Dukes of Hazzard George W.
