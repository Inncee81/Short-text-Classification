do you think i'm wrong for disowning much of my family for being prejudiced my husband has done the same we have several family members who are awful towards others his family believes disgusting stereotypes about non blacks my family believes disgusting stereotypes about non whites both of our families hate non christians and they think homosexuals and bi sexuals are either sick or demon possessed i could go on but i'm sure you get the point anyway there are very few with whom we have any kind of relationship we are close with my parents and one of his grandfathers and we are somewhat close with one of my grandmothers and one of his uncles my little cousin is also a part of our lives she is i guess you could say sort of like my little sister although my husband looks upon her like a daughter however our relationship with her is quite difficult until she turns of legal age since her mother my aunt is the epitome of whatever comes to mind when you think of the word b tch anyway we've been told that we're wrong why people tell us that we should try harder because according to them family means everything but we have tried tried and tried again with no luck my husband especially catches a lot of flack since he has nothing to do with his mother folks tell him that there's no one who's more important than your mother but what's he supposed to do continue to tolerate his mother talking about non blacks as though they are the sum of the earth keep listening to her rantings about homosexuals as though they were put on this planet to lead people's souls to hell i don't understand the logic of those who say that we're supposed to maintain contact with family members who are completely unwilling to bend a little so to speak we've tried everything what do you think the family members who we are close to are the few who are nice and not prejudiced at all just thought i'd throw that in so no one thinks we're making any exceptions i'll never be grandma lol i don't want children never have but i get the point it could be possible that they really don't know how it is to have that kind of family they never had to deal with a family member who was so strongly prejudiced nor racist i have an uncle and an aunt who both are deeply prejudiced against whites my aunt refers to white women as snow bunnies and my uncle is just plain distrustful towards whites he won't even allow a white person be his waiter at a restaurant i'm thankful that the majority of my family is able to see pass the color of someones skin i love them and i always will but that doesn't mean i can't disown them or at least not consider them to be any use in my life it's sort of hard to cut ties with the ones whom are supposed to have loved you since birth but even blood relation can be cut by the stupidity of prejudice Family EastEnders Theory of conduct Little Britain The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Homophobia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Incest Blood purity (Harry Potter) Uncle Tom's Cabin Wolfrider Marriage The Marshall Mathers LP Maison Ikkoku Recurring South Park characters Pitaten Calvin and Hobbes Brian Griffin Love Rocko's Modern Life Knots Landing Polyamory Social rule Bene Gesserit Friends Miss Saigon Kodocha Pride and Prejudice Ten Commandments Urantia Charmed Fiddler on the Roof Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Time Out of Mind Ellen Foster Human sexual behavior Infantilism Days of our Lives Philosophy of language Earth Girl Arjuna Fancy Crane W.I.T.C.H.
