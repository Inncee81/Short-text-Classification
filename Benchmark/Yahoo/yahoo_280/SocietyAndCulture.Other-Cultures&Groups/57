utah miner are they alive has anybody been following the story about those miners is there a good posibility that they could still be alive i don't know life how deep they are or any of the variables just wanted to see what others felt they drilled a hole into the mine early this morning lowered a microphone through the hole but did not detect any sounds a larger hole is being drilled and should reach the mine later tonight or early tomorrow morning they will then be able to lower a special camera through the hole to get video of the area however unfortunately it does not look good for the miners as there has been no contact from them if the initial collapse did not bury them it is highly likely that they did not survive the concussion from the fall our hopes and prayers are with them and their families Coal mining Naval mine Oil well Floppy disk Drill bit STS-51-L Ocean's Twelve Black hole Opportunity rover Mining Microphone Drill Clarinet Super Mario 64 AFI 100 Years series Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Diamond Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Shaggy dog story Seismic retrofit Eagles The Chemical Brothers Escape from New York Jon Secada Jennifer Lopez Scientology beliefs and practices The Ashlee Simpson Show Nintendo DS 9/11 conspiracy theories The Emancipation of Mimi Ice core Oak Island Rod Stewart Land mine USS Whale (SS-239) USS Yorktown (CV-5) Innocence: Ghost in the Shell USS Tunny (SS-282) USS Wickes (DD-578) Equine conformation The Dalek Invasion of Earth Diana Ross USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Stellar evolution Scientific drilling Mount Unzen Continuation War Gramophone record Stargate (device) Diamond enhancement Trench warfare Luminoth Descent (computer game) Alta Ski Area Norwegian Campaign Copper extraction Mineral HIM (band) Compact disc Digital camera Transformer Death The Day After Tomorrow Open-pit mining Mineral County, West Virginia Desert Energy development Ozone depletion Oasis (band) Timeline of the Universe Worms weapons and tools Genesis (band) San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Virginian Railway Space colonization X-ray astronomy Kryptonite Gamma ray burst Mount St. Helens Harmonica Infidels Turquoise Night (book) Geyser Death Valley National Park Ozone hole Attack on Pearl Harbor Mudvayne Good Morning America Printed circuit board Piezoelectricity Glen Jacobs Sound effect Economy of Africa Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Inuit Mars Polar Lander Decompression sickness
