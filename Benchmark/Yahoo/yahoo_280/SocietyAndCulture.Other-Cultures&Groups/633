to all vietnamese do you find it offending that parts of the u s hang the communist flag of vietnam well my junior high had a variety of flags hanging from the ceiling in the cafeteria and they had hung the vietnamese communist flag a few other vietnamese students and i complained to the principal and they just completely took it down and replaced it with another flag of another country we tried discussing it with the school staff but they would refuse to listen and change the subject is it just a few of us or do most of the vietnamese vietnamese americans get bothered by the communist flag because i sure do oh and scroll down to the bottom of this page guess what the vietnam yahoo page uses an icon of none other than the communist flag well there are only two flags of vietnam the communist the one with the red field and yellow star in the middle the original the one with the yellow field and three red horizontal stripes in the middle eh i was born in america so i don't really know that much i just find it offending that they still use it you can tell your vietnamese classmates that they re misinformed and ignorant of their own culture from what you ve described the flag that was hanging from the ceiling of your cafeteria is the vietnam country flag and not the communist flag the communist flag has a yellow hammer sickle moon of yellow stars at the top corner closest to the flagpole on a red background the vietnam country flag has a yellow star on a red background the vietnam country flag originates from the north vietnam flag during the separation of north and south vietnam between and the north vietnam flag was a red top half blue bottom half with a yellow star in the middle when vietnam was reunited the blue bottom half was replaced with a complete red background with a yellow star in the middle many have a misconception of relating the red and yellow colors of the vietnam flag to communism most non asians don t realize that red and yellow are positive colors of strength luck or good fortune in asian cultures this is why the flags of both china and vietnam have red backgrounds and yellow foregrounds such colors also represent communism but for slightly different reasons a communist flag is represented in vietnam by flying at the same height side by side with the vietnam country flag which represents communism as being just as important as country this was widely seen in north vietnam until last year but rarely seen in south vietnam except on government buildings now you will be hard pressed to find a communist flag flying anywhere in vietnam except on government buildings what does that tell you something you can tell your vietnamese classmates is their parent s grudge against the vietnamese government or communism in vietnam is not your classmate s grudge your vietnamese classmates don t realize that they are in a position to build a bridge of friendship between two former enemies for them to continue their ignorance would be foolish your classmates are fortunate to live in a country that allows them free access to information allowing them to discover the truth about modern vietnam themselves instead of the decades old information that their parents are telling them Colours, standards and guidons Flag Flag of India Flag of the Republic of China Flag of the United States Flag of South Africa Flag of Hong Kong Flag of the People's Republic of China Flag of Belarus Flag of the Republic of Vietnam Royal Standard Southeast Asia Vietnam EIA-708 South Vietnam Lynbrook High School Flag of Denmark Maritime flags Color Bubble Bobble Pikmin Hangul Asian American The Amazing Race Rainbow flag Houston Astros Chinese character Democracy Heraldry Flag of Iraq Formula One regulations Sento Racing flags Logo Volleyball Flags of the Confederate States of America Yellow Poker jargon Flag terminology Beatmania IIDX National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam Wrigley Field PNG Union Jack Buckingham Palace Xiangqi Bosniaks Flag of the Netherlands Columbine High School massacre Yu-Gi-Oh!
