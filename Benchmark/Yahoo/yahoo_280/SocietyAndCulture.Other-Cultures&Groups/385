why is hispanic a race in america and why do people refer to themselves as irish etc not just white ok well i live in the uk and i don't want to sound ignorant but we just have white not generally hispanic latino etc i have friends who are originally spanish but view themselves as white why is it diffret on the other side of the pond and on yahoo answers when people mighjt be asking what colours suit to them they will refer to themselves as irish not just white it's very confusing and i don't understand why in america more emphasis is put on race etc especially in films etc i am doing american history this year and was wondering is it because of immigration etc i don't want to offend anyoen i'm just curious lol i posted a badly worded question i don't mean that we don't have discrimination we certainly do but it seems like it is more diverse over there and in popular culture race is referered to more lol pasty white people i'm a pasty white person especially as we are only just starting to get some sunshine over here i can see that some people have read into your question and found it to be offensive i don't see it that way i believe you are inquiring about differences that we seem to have in the way we view certain cultural issues you could be right we are of many places and to some degree it gives us a comfort level to be able to define our roots it may be exactly as you describe it may be an attitude that is present because we are all from somewhere else and not have the ancient ties to the soil that one might find in britain judging by the mix that i have seen there in recent trips you too may find yourself asking the same questions in the near future there is pride involved in it but there is also a defining of our heritage and perhaps a short hand for our beliefs and attitudes ie irish would likely be raised catholic with all typical stereotypes we understand and german is bound to be entirely different possibly in appearance not necessarily but in cultural bias good luck with your course when you get to the part about the revolutionary war you might also understand that those that chose to leave or were driven out to a great extent defined who we became in canada history lives with us and defines who we become btw if someone asks me i say i am canadian fifth generation as canadian as anyone gets but to tell you that would not tell you much about my appearance but if i said i have english irish scottish roots you might be able to see me better Black (people) Hispanic White (people) Nationalism Sexual orientation Philosophy Racism Same-sex marriage Same-sex marriage in Canada Political correctness Socrates Asperger syndrome Goodness and value theory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Hiberno-English Patriotism Irish language Theory of conduct Homophobia Liberalism Funeral Evangelicalism Psychology African American England Roman Catholic Church English language Multilingual Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Christianity Intelligent design Franz Boas Infant baptism New York-New Jersey English Trinity Multiculturalism Supernatural Predestination College Race (U.S. Census) Coercion Plame affair Canadian literature Atheism Ireland Court system of Canada Polyamory Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses English grammar Bosniaks Race of Jesus Infantilism Feminism Fundamentalism Skinhead Southern United States Parliament of the United Kingdom Postmodernism Modern Celts Species Monarchy in Canada Celt Esperanto as an international language Nicomachean Ethics Jacob Neusner Democracy Witchcraft Who is a Jew?
