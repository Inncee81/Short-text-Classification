have little or no pigment in their eyes skin or hair they have inherited genes that do not make the usual amounts of a pigment called melanin a common myth is that by definition people with albinism have red eyes in fact there are different types of albinism and the amount of pigment in the eyes varies although some individuals with albinism have reddish or violet eyes most have blue eyes some have hazel or brown eyes while most people with albinism have very light skin and hair not all do oculocutaneous pronounced ock you low kew tain ee us albinism involves the eyes hair and skin ocular albinism involves primarily the eyes while skin and hair may appear similar or slightly lighter than that of other family members continued from the noah website over the years researchers have used

protection may develop life threatening skin cancers that is true that all races can be albino including white people the website says there are various degrees of albinism from no melanin production to some melanin production its recessive but so is white skin if a white person marries a black person the skin is usally dark unless the black person has white ancestry where else could white skin have originated isn't the answer right here in front of us asians can be albino as well they have the capacity to develop white skin as do africans i dont know it just seems interesting where else did blonde hair and blue eyes come from i'm just analyzing i did say maybe it seems like it could be true though and that the darker skinned whites of the mediterranean and iberian peninsula have black ancestry after all the north african moors did invade in ad and stayed for several hundred years just thinking about the possiblity robert shelton probably works at yahoo spookyjimjams did you read my post first and have you read on the subject of albinism this is on the noah website i am just using context clues here me myself i when you do your own research then maybe you can call me stupid but how do you explain white skin and blonde hair black people can be born with white skin blonde hair and blue eyes its called albinism just because you are content with your public school education does not mean that there is more to the story of humanity than was placed in your government backed history book i don't even know why you are calling me racist did i even say anything that was racist does me asking questions make me a racist if you don't like my question then keep it moving i'm not the only person who thinks this alot of people support this theory you are such a dumb sellout you are acting like a guard dog for your master blindly loving your master even so you can eat his table scraps still on the plantation i see so i guess the national website for albinism is not enough how
