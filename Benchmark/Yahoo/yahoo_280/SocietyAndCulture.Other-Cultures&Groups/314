in america do you have to be blonde thin or lightskinned to be beautiful thats all i see in the islands is blonde skinny women on tv and perceived as beautiful if you looked at america on tv from another standpoint like mines in the islands you would think that all black women are lightskinned and freaky videos that all black men that are succesful are rappers and athletes that black beauty is only the light ones hardly and brown or dark women except in bad lookin parts of the states i just visited the states and it shocked me to find that ethnic women are actually very beautiful especially women of darker color i am surprised not many are seen or appraised though preferably i like brown to darker women not off brands do you have to be blonde or lightskinned to be considered beautiful there in the states where are the brown darker women no they just give you what the world wants to see i have noticed that not alot of darker women get appraised too which dissapoints me because i'm brown and i could beat out any light skinned or white girl anyday skin tone has nothing to do with it beauty lies every race in every tone White (people) Black (people) Human skin color Colonial mentality Race of Jesus Melanin Laser hair removal Blond Lamanite Dragon Booster Color theory The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Skinhead Blacks and Mormonism Cutey Honey African American Rum Skin Static Shock Double Dragon Pysanka Legally Blonde Blonde on Blonde Sega Saturn Polar Bear AVN Awards Color Black Beauty contest America's Next Top Model The Emancipation of Mimi Hair W.I.T.C.H.
