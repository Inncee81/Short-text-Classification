why do people keep saying that their race is smarter than another race fine then bl dsuckr give me a violation for just asking a freakin question because they doesn't realise that every human being on this planet is related to every other human being on the planet they also don't account for god and the intelligence that is distributed to each person regardless of genetics and how our soul and intelligence is a blessing from a god who is for every person racists don't allow for the fact that we're all genetically and spiritually linked basically i tend to think that evolution opens the doors for racists due to the fact that a racist individual could assert that their race was evolved from insert species here and that another race evolved from insert species here and then make arguments such as the one you've described it's all utter nonsense ignore it and be content knowing that you're more intelligent when bickering with a foolish man it only serves to make us both look foolish he for his argument and ourselves for attempting to make a fool understand a concept above his comprehension pepper Intelligent design God Creationism Meaning of life Soul Evolutionary creationism Creation-evolution controversy Free will Bah__'__ Faith and Science Atheism History of creationism Validity of human races Species The nature of God in Western theology Race and intelligence Race Urantia Supernatural Eugenics Animism Religion Psychology of religion Guns, Germs, and Steel Philosophy of mathematics Summa Theologiae Eastern Orthodox Church Sola fide Reincarnation Teleological argument Agnosticism Human nature Intelligent design movement Sociocultural evolution Meme Person Immortality David Hume Jews as a chosen people Racism Biodiversity Spiritual evolution Goodness and value theory Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Ontological argument Presuppositional apologetics Existence Wealth Theory of conduct The Origin of Species Predestination Scopes Trial Postmodernism Sexual orientation Extraterrestrial life Existence of God Economics John Howard Yoder Infant baptism Trinity Origin belief Creation biology Aristotle Cosmological argument Teach the Controversy Abortion debate Evolution Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Same-sex marriage The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Black (people) Race and intelligence (Public controversy) Joke Fundamentalism Transhumanism Theodicy Flood geology Sociobiology Brahman Original sin Specified complexity Intelligence (trait) Psychology Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Age of Enlightenment Culture Internet troll Karl Popper Religion and sexual orientation Deconstruction Horus Neuro-linguistic programming Extinction
