defending yourself and family i can't help but think about defending ones self when i read articles from people that preach about peace and love etc let me clarify here i am all for love peace being kind to others but when i hear mainly from liberals and this includes some of my own siblings that they could never hurt or kill anyone regardless of the reason and that is why they hate our troops our president then what would they do if someone came in and threatened their children their family yeah i know that is a little different here but not really because once again isn't that a double standard would you be able to defend your family if it meant killing another human being oh my good lord mohammd my husband came back from nam after two tours and he is the kindest most gentle man to me and all around him that i know avie i don't say this often because it usually doesn't ring true for a liberal i am impressed thank you but i still don't dis like bush i completely agree with you i would rather live in peace and harmony but our world isn't like that do whatever is needed to protect my family in a heartbeat my husband is a vet i lost my brother while he was in the army and many other family members have gone off to fight various wars all for our freedom yep in a heartbeat True Crime: Streets of LA 2004 Republican National Convention Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Plame affair The Amber Spyglass Cindy Sheehan Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Poker jargon Pitaten Amnesty International Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Clarence Thomas Zhao Yun The Death Gate Cycle Karen Horney Philosophical skepticism John Wesley Infidels A Course In Miracles Women in Islam Avatar: The Last Airbender Modoc War Objectivist philosophy Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Militia YuYu Hakusho StarCraft Episode VI John Howard Yoder Theodicy Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Hiberno-English Rich Mullins Alignment (role-playing games) Sharia Vietnam War Alien races from the Godzilla films Cliff Richard Veterans for Peace Escape from New York Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Knots Landing Plame affair timeline Darfur conflict Jacob Philipp Melanchthon Sly & the Family Stone Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Contributions to liberal theory Donald Rumsfeld Melanie Wilkes Clown Philosophy of language Yoko Ono Ann Coulter U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Time Crisis 3 Shaggy dog story History of the British constitution Family Stoicism Phoebe Halliwell Friendly Persuasion (1956 film) Bob Marley Ranma __ characters Road map for peace The Invisibles Kurt Angle Participants in World War II History of Lithuania Ragnarok The Animation Soul The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Salvation Honey and Clover Capitalism Titokowaru's War Quest for Glory Polyamory Sicilian Expedition Damn Yankees Radio Yerevan Second Congo War Guns N' Roses Epistemology Kyle Broflovski Pok__mon Live!
