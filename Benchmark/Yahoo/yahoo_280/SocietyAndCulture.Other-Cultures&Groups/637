why do so many people make excuses for all of the problems that the black community has as frederick douglass said in what i ask for the negro is not benevolence not pity not sympathy but simply justice the american people have always been anxious to know what they shall do with us i have had but one answer from the beginning do nothing with us your doing with us has already played the mischief with us do nothing with us if the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength if they are worm eaten at the core if they are early ripe and disposed to fall let them fall and if the negro cannot stand on his own legs let him fall also all i ask is give him a chance to stand on his own legs let him alone y our interference is doing him positive injury http www allheadlinenews com articles making excuses for problems doesn't make the problems go a way because they are so dependent on people to always help them and the people that dont help them they blame those people for not helping example welfare the government helps them because they're poor and supposedly can't work or find work a lot of blacks dont want to help themselves they always feel like they are owed something by everybody i saw a question on here the other day that had the answer that black people do not have education because of the white people but it's like how long ago did the whites tell blacks that no you can't go to school also a lot of whites dont want to deny blacks help because the first second they say no we're not helping you they cry you're racist like a big baby why do so many people make excuses because the blacks will always make you seem like the bad person for not helping them when they wont even help themselves Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Negro Booker T.
