what would a racist do if he she died and god looked just like someone they hated tom t i understand what you're saying clearly and i agree yet as a christian i would find it hard to face the lord knowing that i didn't speak out against racism if you know god then you know that he knows your heart no matter what someone does on this earth there is going to be a point when they have to face god to be judged and they are going to have to face all the things they did on earth good and bad want to know what i think people who are racist are going to have a real wake up call what are they going to do when their soul moves on from their body and race will no longer matter anymore what kind of excuse will they have to justify their actions i believe that when that time comes from that point forward they will only care about what god thinks about them and that is all they will have to face what they have done when god asks them why they have not loved others who are all of the same blood for once in their existence they will finally be able to reflect on what they did in this world they will have to look at what they did and will finally feel humiliation for making the hateful decisions they have made in life here just like anyone else i think racism makes god sad because he loves all of us and wants us to love each other just like he love us he loves all of us the same no matter what we look like in the end no matter what others have done or how they live we all make our own choices and we will all reap what we sow not for what others did but for what we do that's one of the reasons why people say it doesn't matter how you died but how you lived Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theory of conduct Pitaten Predestination Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Merit God Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Rich Mullins Duties of the Heart The nature of God in Western theology Incarnations of Immortality Philipp Melanchthon Theodicy Meaning of life Socrates Original sin Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Summa Theologiae John Howard Yoder Ten Commandments Racism Qiyamah The Subtle Knife Karma in Hinduism Soul Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Rei Ayanami Moral objectivism Infant baptism Jews as a chosen people Dead Like Me Yusuf al-Qaradawi Philosophical skepticism Reincarnation Hades Alan Campbell (pastor) Shaggy dog story Anti-Defamation League Sola fide Friedrich Schleiermacher Bible and reincarnation Salvation Phaedo Origin belief Book of Isaiah Sant Thakar Singh Resurrection of Jesus Kodocha Christian eschatology Atomism Free will Piccolo Junior Saga Edgar Cayce Blacks and Mormonism Abortion debate Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Past teachings of Prem Rawat Biblical inerrancy Human Church of Christ, Scientist Simone Weil Eastern Orthodox Church Determinism Scenes from a Memory Jewish principles of faith Urantia The Death Gate Cycle Religion Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eucharist EastEnders Evolutionary creationism Patriotism Too Short a Season (TNG episode) David Hume Amidah Bertrand Russell Immortality Perseverance of the saints Current teachings of Prem Rawat One Tree Hill (TV series) Taxi Driver Death (personification)
