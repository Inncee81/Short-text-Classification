do any of you see a problem with this racism from black people i'm black duh buti was raised around white people and im pretty much a product of my enviroment i've been told before that i act white but to me that confuses me because i wasn't aware that you could act a color i don't understand why i can't just be me without people trying to tell me i want to be white i have no desire to be white just be myself why should i have to dress gangsta and talk with a hood accent just to fit in with other black people and please dont tell me i'm generalizing because i realize not all black people are gangsta and when i say that i dont mean with drugs and guns i shit i just mean the mentality but its funny white people never judge me so why does my own race i e most white people expect black people to be hood i speak proper english i get good grades i listen to mostly rap but i listen to rock too i refuse to not like something just because the majority of my race doesnt omg we could be bestfriends it's exactly the same for me my ghetto friends make fun of my white girl accent and the'll ask me what's wrong with you just because i like this white guy but i also like this black boy and i listen to hip hop and rap so i'd say i'm pretty much in touch with the black culture but they don't think so oh well they can like my white girlness Hip hop music Gangsta rap Hip hop collaborations The Marshall Mathers LP Hip hop rivalries Hip hop culture Timeline of hip hop Milton H.
