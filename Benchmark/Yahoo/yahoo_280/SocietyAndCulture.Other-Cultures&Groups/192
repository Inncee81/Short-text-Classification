where do these mexican women on here get off putting down the whites if it wasn' t for us you wouldn't be in our country why don't you at least act like you appreciate us letting you come here when most americans would rather send you back and i am speaking to christien and spicy latina who can't wait to answer a question putting down white people defend everyone else why are you living in our country then go back to where you came from or is it to messed up over there to live as well as you do here well i figured i'd get more negative than positive but like the one person said i pay taxes speak english and don't disrespect anyone til they do me and these women have been disrespectin white people on here since they joined do your homework people that's why our country is as f'd up as it is peoples ignorance if you can't conform get out we've helped enough of these people who laugh in our faces wake up people or continue living in your rose colored glasses world i was referring to these two individuals if you read more into it that's your choice it reads pretty simple and easy hi beachy it's pathetic that anyone has to place racist remarks against any individual in the first place i don't care if a person is bi racial african american native american caucasian or mexican we are all god's children no matter what nationality we are when an individual has degrated another person's heritage or ethnic background it's usually for a reason it may not be a good reason in the eye's of the other but there is a reason for everything that is said or for a behavior or action now i'm not condoning what these two individuals have said because i haven't been familiar with the questions they have answered but don't lower yourself to their level by doing the same exact thing that they have done believe it or not they have the same freedom of speech as you do and they have the right to voice their own opinion whether we like their opinion or not now let me add that they may be acting very immature and not acting their age when voicing their own opinion but that's where we are 'smarter' than they are or at least more mature than they seem to be in our actions and reactions our country was suppose to be 'the land of the free' to everyone who wanted to make this country their home this country was for all nationalities not just for a selected few the europeans came to this continent to find a better place to live and to get rid of the rules of a monarchy ruled country if one wants to get technical about this issue it was the europeans that took this land away from the native american indians they were the first settlers here so with this is mind and to be realsitic about things and history only the native american indians have the right so do speak to tell anyone to get out of the us but the government is to 'thank' for that realization but that's a different topic all together so what i'm trying to say is that these two individuals must have a reason for their racist remarks maybe they have been exploited with their nationality or someone has hurt them by making snide remarks one must consider the 'source' when one makes a statement such as what you were referring to in their answers it's a shame that some individuals have to 'hurt' people due to their heritage but unfortunately society in a lot of cases have caused such turmoil racism has been around for decades and will remain for years to come it's a shame that 'we' can't all live together in peace without all this racism underneath god's umbrella but don't place yourself on their level of ignorance have a blessed day Black (people) Plame affair African American Democracy Social rule Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Nigger Patriotism
