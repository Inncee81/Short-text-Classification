crypto orchid blood test i recently bought what i thought was a year old quarter horse gelding turns out he's mounting every mare thats in season so i'm starting to have serious doubts on his gelding status as visually he does not appear to be a stallion i needed to know if there is a blood test to find out for sure if he is fertile or not preferably before the mares come up pregnant you can certainly have a blood test done to check his testosterone levels plenty of properly castrated geldings will breed mares the fact that you mention he only mounts mares in heat and that you say nothing of the fact that he acts studdy any other time is a good indicator he had both his testicles removed i do not know a vet alive who will castrate a monorchid in the field it is considered unethical it is also unetchical to only take off one testical meaning if only one is present certainly in a case of cancer of a testicle on a stallion it would certainly be all right in that case therefore anytime two testicals are not visible the vets refer horses to the equine hospitals so that the castration can be completed there in other words they go inside and find the undescended testicle even if your horse really was left with an undescended testicle he could never get a mare pregnant from the testicle being kept inside the body all sperm would be dead from overheating Castration Horse Cryptorchidism Prostate cancer Testicular cancer Testicle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sterilization (surgical procedure) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Horus Puberty Pregnancy Endocrinology Equine conformation Arabian horse Human chorionic gonadotropin Code 46 Strap-on dildo Chicken Acne Hinny Thoroughbred Days of our Lives Sperm Whale Menstrual cycle Selective breeding Infantilism Prolactinoma Endometriosis International Phonetic Alphabet Charisma (horse) Docking Oral contraceptive Colorectal cancer Stem cell Intersex surgery Abortion debate Penis removal Earthworm Autism Ferret Donkey Cytomegalovirus Breaker Morant Cancer Sin City Pony Welsh Cob (Section D) Smarty Jones Roan (color) Morgan horse Poker jargon Lung cancer Sex assignment Eventing Endometrium Whaling Mule Vitamin C Captain Thunderbolt Baldness treatments Polycystic ovary syndrome First aid Birth control Transsexuality Horses of Middle-earth Pony of the Americas Thermal power station Cybele Alcoholism Zoophilia Apollo 8 Dressage Death Pornographic movie Dialysis Baldness Folic acid Hormone replacement therapy Vampire Connemara pony Intersexuality Embalming Fugu Mobile phone radiation and health Seabiscuit Epistemology Taboo food and drink Left-handed Snake In vitro fertilisation Sunday Silence Trakehner Biology and sexual orientation Ethics Livestock Japan Cup Punishment
