hot thoroughbred i have an y o ex racer thoroughbred who is really hot strong every time i ride him what are some things i can do to blow off some of his unwanted energy i have tryed lounging walk trot and cantering on a foot line before i ride for a whole hour but that only works to a point because after he catches his breath he starts acting up again i need help maybe part of the problem is because he gets flakes of alfalfa and lbs of sweet feed a day to keep his weight up he is turned out on a acre pasture all day long it has good grass do yall' think that could be why he is like this maybe it's just cause he's a thoroughbred holy cow i would be running up mountains if i was getting all the sugars carbs and fat that that horse is getting lol it is not unheard of to feed a horse of feed a day two feedings a day but there are specific feeds to give inthis amount sweet feeds are predominately just what the name implies sweet i e sugar alfalfa i like to think of as hay on steroids it's a great tasty treat that is nice to offer a flake or of a day to your horse but as a sole source of hay they're going to get hyper in no time there are plenty o' plenty o'plenty of other options for keeping weight on your tb that will not make him high change that give him days on the new feed hay and you will see his behaviour change Equine conformation Horse Horse gait Alfalfa Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Low-carbohydrate diet Agriculture Milk Seabiscuit Hay Horse racing Glossary of climbing terms Eventing Mountain bike Chicken Butter Poker jargon Laminitis Dressage Diabetes mellitus Thoroughbred Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Weight training Atkins Nutritional Approach South Beach diet Vermicompost Harness racing Tour de France Sorghum Belmont Park Social rule Breakfast Standardbred horse Akhal-Teke Blue Whale Horseshoe Turkoman Horse Cuisine of Denmark Drag racing High-heeled shoe Brown Bear Sugar substitute Carburetor Insulin Sugar beet Tennessee Walker Cattle Silage Sugar Land, Texas Peanut Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Paintball Maize Chocolate Cantonese cuisine Show hunter Alcohol fuel Dairy farming Welding FoxTrot Bird migration Mixed martial arts Aspartame The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Jet engine Fancy rat Emu Taikyoku shogi John Forrest, 1st Baron Forrest of Bunbury Hackney (horse) Bong Kangaroo Paragliding Acne Hay fever Billboard Hot 100 Santa Claus Thermal power station Charisma (horse) Illegal drug trade Space Shuttle external tank Motorcycle Mountain Dew Mattress Fire fighting Tai shogi Compost Renewable energy Bicycle 1957 World Series Lithic flake Microeconomics Kentucky Derby
