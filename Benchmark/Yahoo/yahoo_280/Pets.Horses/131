warmbloods someone was bragging about having a warmblood to me earlier today and i don't completely know what that is i don't think she knew either from what i know or think i know correct me if wrong a warmblood is any horse that is not a draft coldbloods thoroughbred or arabian hotbloods they include horses that are mix of a bunch of different breeds as well as purebreds if this is correct then what is the point of having a warmblood and what are the benefits and do people really register them what is the point if almost everything is a warmblood so can you have a registered qh who is also a registered warmblood my the definition of warmblood varies but the one thing that rings true is that they are good competition horses on the note of a qh being registered as a warmblood they are called an appendix bred i have an appendix paint he is recently crossed tb is fresh in his pedigree qh and tb and is an amazing performer in western pleasure dressage and games i did not pay thousands of dollars for him actually i didn't even pay the appendix breeds typically tend to be cheaper then the european bred warmbloods however regardless of breed a horse is just a horse until it has established pedigree and training if you seek out an own foal of an olympian expect to pay thousands that's a high buck baby if you just buy a foal or a two year old even that has not much really for pedigree and little training but has the conformation you will pay far less with a decent trainer and persistence that foal could be your farlap the thing to remember when seeking out a horse that you intend to show for anything is that breed is a starting point and the pedigree is an enhancer bragging about having a simple warmblood is just silly unless it has skills that warmblood may decide that he doesn't want to compete at all and end up being a trail horse that is how i ended up with my remington so cheap his previous owners were not able to tap into his hidden potential i bought him as a trail horse and in the first few weeks of getting to know him i learned he was capable of more than trails when he put his mind to it we're still working on his ideas that he wears the pants in the relationship for example my mother breeds working cow horses she stands a proven champion sire own son of kaliman and she bred him to a mare that was out of a champion sire the foal grew up to do hunt seat the moral to the story is that a two hundred dollar grade horse from an auction can a top competitor it happens every year this person may have a warmblood but it's just that a warmblooded horse Thoroughbred Equine conformation Arabian horse Selle Fran__ais Warmblood Dog agility Trakehner Dog show Lipizzan Dressage Horse racing Connemara pony Sunday Silence Eventing Thoroughbred horse race Mixed-breed dog Seabiscuit Hanoverian (horse) Obedience training Appaloosa Cattle Theory of conduct Tennessee Walker Smarty Jones Milton H.
