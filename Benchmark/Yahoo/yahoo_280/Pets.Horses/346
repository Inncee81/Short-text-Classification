reminder in the posting trot in my posting trot i go upwards instead of forwards for four years now that is how long i have been riding i can see my toes and i know that is bad do you know of any excerises i can do at home or reminders i can think when i am riding i really do want to become a better rider and i know it is an upward forward rolling motion and that keeps your leg back and quiet how should i feel once i get it right tilted forward or straight backed here are some pictures http i photobucket com albums aa jazzy horse chance gable post jpg http i photobucket com albums aa jazzy horse chance gable may trot jpg http i photobucket com albums aa jazzy horse chance rio trot jpg http i photobucket com albums aa jazzy horse chance rio trot jpg http i photobucket com albums aa jazzy horse chance gable trotting jpg continued in the pictures with the bay it was from lasyt year and yearly this year and some of them are with long stirrups i think since then on my new horse the paint rio i have tried to keep my toes in the pictures with the paint are from two weeks ago i had just got him so my leg is waay too forward but now they are getting back but i still see my toe videos with correct posting trot will help bunches thanks the paint with his old owners used to do speed events and barrel racing and he wasn't fast enough so they spurred him and so he doesn't like your leg behind him and he is a little fast about my saddle a riser pad fixed the problem my trainer let me borrow one and it works she would have told me and let me borrow a lesson saddle if not thank you for your concern though and i have since then shortened my stirrups and tried to turn in my toes not degrees any more more like so i still need a little work sorry i don't have any updated pictures but i just wanted to show you that i was making the common mistake of posting up instead of posting with the horse and posting forward and a little up also it makes no difference weather you are in dressage or hunters the way you post should be the same not straight up and now and slapping your butt into the saddle when you come down dressage riders should have that rolling with the horse movement also ok one shorten your stirrups they are too long second try bending more at your hips almost like a two point and try bringing your shoulders a bit more forward which once you shorten your stirrups alot of this will be where you need to be anyways ride with no stirrups posting trot this will kill you so dont' do alot to start with and also try two point no stirrups you'll be surprised how fast you get it right good luck and hope this helps Horse gait Dressage Horse tack High-heeled shoe Cowboy Show jumping Aerial (dance move) Backstroke Professional wrestling holds Equitation Boxing Show hunter Stirrup Skateboarding trick Hunt seat Swingout Cowboy boot Comanche Glossary of ballet terms Marching band Recumbent bicycle Drill bit Standardbred horse Parade (military) Oasis (band) The Amazing Race Ayrton Senna Three Stooges Lindy Basic Butterfly stroke Poker jargon Eventing Breaststroke Diving Jazz Bicycle Double bass Professional wrestling attacks Captain Thunderbolt Kitesurfing Front crawl The Ashlee Simpson Show B-47 Stratojet Hey Jude Glossary of climbing terms Tennessee Walker Obedience training Harness racing Horizontal bar EastEnders FoxTrot Mouse (computing) Battles of Lexington and Concord Knife Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Archery Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bicycle brake systems Snowboarding Red Hot Chili Peppers Cross-country equestrianism Rod Stewart Ice hockey Might and Power American Quarter Horse Snowboard American Saddlebred Traveller (horse) Mountain bike Fell pony John Wayne Charleston (dance move) Helicopter Pole vault Shaggy dog story New York Knicks Frankie Laine Guilty Gear Weight training Hip hop music Jennifer Lopez American Pie (song) Wassily Kandinsky Softball Swimming Piccolo Junior Saga Strap-on dildo Sport rowing Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Trot (horse gait) Lipizzan Side pass (dance move)
