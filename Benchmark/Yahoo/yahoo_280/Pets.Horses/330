i cannot feel safe on a lunge line is there a way to make me feel safe on one when someone else is in control of the horse i'm riding i just cannot make myself feel safe comfortable so whenever the trainer tries to put me on one to help with something i freeze up i think part of it is that i have always ridden horses who like to run and therefore i don't feel like i can be alright unless i have the reins in my hands and i'm in control of everything does anyone have any idea how i could become more comfortable riding on a lunge line i don't even do work on a lunge line that often it's just that when something comes up that i need to be on a lunge line to help me learn i freeze up and can't learn it which is a problem have you addressed this with your instructor really talked about how afraid you are feeling in that situation if you have and your instructor has not offered you help then i would ask your instructor if you could start with that extra rein as described before keep hold of a rein not taunt enough to interfere with the the instructors queues but enough to where you feel you can take control if something were to happen have your instructor work with you this way until you feel confident enough to release that rein you have to be willing to push yourself though don't take the lesson and refuse to let go of it if you have been going around for minutes this way you need to tell yourself that you are safe and can push through the fear so that you can progress forward good luck Milton H.
