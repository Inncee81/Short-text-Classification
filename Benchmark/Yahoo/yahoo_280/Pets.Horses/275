rear cannons hey i have a project question and it is name one type of horse that selects horses with their rear cannons close together a friend says it is a quarter horse but i was curious i can't find it anywhere on the web and i need an answer before tomorrow we have judging shire horses and clysdales are bred to have 'cow hocks' which also brings their hind cannons closer together there is much debate regarding this trait and the fact that it is encouraged in the show ring such horses are now being bred with cow hocks to such a degree that the horse can injure itself the reason they were originally bred to have close hind legs was to enable them to walk comfortably in the furrow when ploughing a field the argument from the heavy horse society says good draft horse conformation in general including set set is having angle to the hind legs for leverage this is not to be confused with being cow hocked cow hocks are when the actual leg joints are not in alignment and are angled a horse with good set has a perfectly straight leg as is important in any breed and that whole leg is put onto the horse at a slight angle with hocks together this is what a pulling horse of any type needs to do his job properly an old saying goes that a good draft horse will expletives removed at a walk poop on one hock and knock it off with the other as it goes by another thing that is very important to look for is sufficient bone to support that big horse without being coarse but he should still have good clean limbs a horse that has a huge body on top of little spindly legs will not hold up for a useful life in practice most highly placed horses have very poor hind leg conformation Horse Horse gait Dressage Professional wrestling holds Evolution of the Horse Plough Gray Wolf Species Show jumping Domestic rabbit Boxing Cattle Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dog Diving Hemp Spanking Appaloosa German Shepherd Dog Professional wrestling throws Fast bowling The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Skateboarding trick Anatomical terms of location Strap-on dildo Tetrapod Arabian horse Bigfoot Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Table saw Professional wrestling slang Poker jargon Socrates Sailing New York Giants Capital punishment Archery Show hunter Consensus decision-making Combine (Half-Life 2) Sin City Kurt Angle Seabiscuit M16 (rifle) Unreal Guns, Germs, and Steel Tennessee Walker Toilet humour Thoroughbred Dog show Virginia Opossum Docking Eddie Guerrero Professional wrestling attacks Coercion Democracy GED Glossary of climbing terms Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.
