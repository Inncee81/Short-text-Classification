bitless bridle i'm considering buying this http www bitlessbridle com dbid html for my horse laredo what do you think of it thanks i'm getting it because maybe laredo is pulling my arms outta my sockets because he doesn't like bits and i know he won't be able to show in it thanks for you input i am getting it and i'll start a topic when i do with m comments his teeth are fine he rides in a snaffle an extremely light bit trust me i've used different bits but i think personally changing bits won't solve anything i've used kimberwics happy mouth snaffles etc and he anything but a wild horse he's lazy laid back but usually when i go around courses jumping he lands on the wrong lead usually he likes to pull because he's unbalanced before i get to do a simple lead change i have control he's obedient i just have to hold my leg up on him actually i really shouldn't have said that because he is truly an angel on show day schooling days is when he pushy just because he gets excited over horses http www youtube com watch v a rmhoc kxm see lol just wanted to say he isn't not a crazy horse hot or anything if i yes me if i get lazy after a fence so will he he is an amazing horse yes he listens to half halts if your just wanting to pleasure ride around and your horse is well broke i don't see a problem with it that wouldn't be allowed in a show ring and i would never drive my animals with something like that i don't know the reasons why your wanting to ride your horse like that but if it goes good in it and isn't broncy or a testing sort of horse i think it would be fine my biggest problem with it is i don't see the ability to one rein a horse in a panic situation theres really nothing to help bring their head around like a bosal thats working off nerves etc i could be wrong but thats my take on it i haven't seen it up close if you get it i would be interested to hear your comments on it unknown you can continue to harrass me through email and your little stints on here doesn't matter when you decide that you want to act older than your age and stop posting comments that are derogatory only to remove them let us know because you have no credibility and we seriously doubt you own a horse stick with your lamborghini dreams they will get you farther than your horse knowledge Horse tack Theory of conduct Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Bridle Horse Milton H.
