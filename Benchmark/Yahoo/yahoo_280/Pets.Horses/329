bucked off the other day i was working with my green broke gelding the past few weeks he has been going great he is fairly quiet he spooks occasionally but it is always been controllable he has great ground manners but is very high energy and kind of high strung i got on him like always he stood quietly while i mounted he took a few steps at the walk then took off trying to bolt on me i pulled him into a circle to get him to stop and he started to bronco buck on me he was running and bucking about half the length of the arena feet before i bailed fell i was too scared to get back on him but i lunged him for about an hour after he dumped me i have not taken a bad fall from a horse in forever and now i'm older it isn't like it used to be i used to 'bounce' i would fall off and be able to jump back on with no problems well now that isn't the case i can hardly get out of bed i am so bruised up and sore continued any thoughts on why my horse who has never bucked before would go off like this i broke him out and have done all his training so far and i have always felt he is unpredictable but never really dangerous i now feel like unpredictable bucking me going to end up in a coma soon he is naturally very athletic when he is good he is like a dream to work with but he will randomly spaz out and now that he is bucking i am scared of his spaz moments i originally thought he was going to be an amazing dressage horse now i feel like if he will be so incredibly spooky at home he will never be a decent show horse when he flipped out on me i was riding in the same tack as always in the same arena as always there was nothing caught under his saddle and there were no bugs out really he does things when i was cantering him a week ago and he spooked so bad at a shadow on the ground he almost fell over no one at my barn will get on him they all consider him psychotic i like high strung horses but not unpredictable horses he is unpredictable but i wouldn't call him psycho a trainer is not an option i ride as well as the only trainer in my area that will take arabs sending him to a farther away barn is not an option i know for a fact they will never ride him and will screw me out of my money he hasn't been ridden since my fall on saturday as much as it upsets me to sell him i think that is going to be my only option my husband is having major issues with me riding this horse he thinks i am going to end up paralyzed b c of this horse and he wont let it drop would you deal with a horse like this or get rid of it i am so down right now i was so optomistic for a while thinking he was doing so well and proving people wrong then he just flips out the scary thing is he showed no warning he was going to take off bucking he was perfectly happy the entire time i was tacking him up lunging him before and getting on hi now bucking it is a fun thing for a horse to do as long as you aren't on him my question to you is how often does this horse get to play free time how many days do you ride how many days had it been since you had ridden him how old is he arabs are late bloomers slow to mature and it would be a shame to give up a potentially nice horse when a young horse bucks after being basically trained it is usually because he just want to have fun it was very wise of you to round pen him hard after that episode i suggest since you do not feel confident to get back on him that you round pen him everyday to a sweat give him some free time but not in the arena where you plan to ride you don't want him to think it is ahis playground a round pen or paddock is better for playtime when you are feeling better and you will round pen him to a sweat under saddle before you ride to get the jiggys out of him that way you don't go for a play time bucking session with him eventually he will stop when he is good reward him with a nice rub down grooming or treat not by hand he will remember this when he is bad mannered tie him some place safe and let him stand alone for an hour or so hope this helps sorry for your bad luck it sucks being dumped i know from exp Poker jargon Horse tack Shaggy dog story Social rule Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dressage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Seabiscuit Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
