what do you think about splitting the yahoo horse catagory after reading and posting here on yahoo i think we need to have two separate catagories one for real horse people who want to ask real questions and get good sound advice from knowledgeable horse people and one for all of the my friend flicka set that way they can ask and tell each other about how horses are abused and trainers cheat at shows and because of it their horse got the gate how all the halter horses that beat their horse is on steriods how they are going to the olympics in on their ponies and can post endless questions about what color their horse is and how great the conformation is what perfect riders they are how they sit around every night on the porch and sing kumbya with their horses while they plan their next million dollar foal from the stallion who was a rescue from the killer house that they helped close down the street that they got a free breeding to cannot wait to see these answers as far as year old posting on here from the yahoo terms of service age restriction children under the age of are not permitted to ask or answer questions on yahoo answers nor establish communication with other yahoo answers users to learn more about using yahoo answers safely please visit http help yahoo com l us yahoo answers safety and this is my point exactly there are a lot of us who have worked hard and been there done that we have shed the blood sweat and tears and when we tell someone how it works in the real horse world we get accused of being cruel and heartless i have answered questions about conformation and gotten told by people who cannot judge a horse by anything but color tell me i am stupid and mean because i stated that their horse was less than perfect i saw someone tell another that her horse got beat in halter because all halter people give their horses massive amounts of steriods did they ever think that maybe their horse is just not halter horse material some of my best friends are halter horse people they like seeing me enter my roping horses in their classes does it bother me to get beat because i live in the real world as lisa m stated i to have gotten emails from people who have told me that i was a b t who should have my horses taken away because i stated that you needed to pop a horse in the nose for biting instead they suggested let the horse continue to bite until he worked out his anger issues kind and gentle words should be used never agression and they even suggested anger mangement for me now why did i not think of that rockerchis i do see your point but the my friend flicka bunch is just as bad about thinking that they are far more superior to the rest of us since they have been to all of the clinics and bought all of the videos then they post a questions and go off on you when you tell them something they do not want to hear because in their mind they already know the answer they just want everyone to agree with them i have seen the kids post questions about how to improve their riding and they are good questions and usually get good answers but there is also a bunch of them who carry around a bratty attitude that they don't mind jumping down your throat when you say they are wrong or their horse is just like everyone else's average do you not agree that they need to get off their high horses also this is my definition of a real horse person someone who is willing to learn something new everyday that they own a horse people who never stop trying to better themselves and the breed people who are willing to learn from mistakes and accept criticism from those who have been there before them who are willing to ask questions and accept all answers on their merit whether they agree with them or not and not jump down someone's throat because they answer is not what you want to hear case in point i always wanted a top halter horse a top halter man told me the horse who i loved was a pos as a halter horse so i had to accept the fact that she would never win and pursue another event or sell her and find one that would work but i did not tell him he was a lying cruel sob and go look for someone to tell me what i wanted to hear monty roberts was told the same thing by don dodge that two of his training horses were crap and he dumped them and look where he is today to finish the thought good horse people listen to each other and learn forever i have learned things that i did not know from here others just want quick fixes free training sugar coating and justification on everything they do or say and then want to blame everyone when they hear the truth or things do not go their way and what happens is you see them telling someone something that could get them and a horse injured or killed and when a knowledge horse person speaks up they get blasted the whole point of this question was to make everyone think about some of the answers that they post and the attitudes that we all have myself included about being right or wrong maybe yahoo should get rid of the tumbs up down and letting people vote of best answers lisa my black beauty breyer soooo stomped all over yours ok lisa you made me feel like a ravenous wolf now heres duct tape camo of course for ken's demise i think that these people should specialize in breyers if they already haven't if you want a trainer the bratz girls are spetacular i hear that way if you need a vet its right there barbie vet if you need a farrier why theres farrier ken if you want babies well by golly you just go to walmart or local feed store and buy them then there won't be any worries about overpopulation and unwanted horses because instead of slaughterhouses you just sell them at garage sales that way we won't be ravenous wolves to those that
