any ideas on how to load my difficult mare my mare is terrible to load into horseboxes and trailers her previous owners said she had an accident in one she can be incredibly stubborn and on some occasions will load fine and others panic and fret we have tried a few techniques the problem is she gets too dangerous to handle and has a tendency to get carried away and rear any tips or ideas all my others load fine but to my horror food doesnt work we own a two horse trailer it takes two hh horses my mare is in the past when we have successfully loaded her not often it has been without a partition and she hs been cross tied once in the box and travelling she is fine you need to spend a lot of time working with her when your only goal for that session is to get her to load not get her into the trailer so you can go somewhere for an event and you have to be there at a certain time this needs time put a halter with a long lead rope on your horse lead him up to the open door of the trailer if it is a step up trailer get it parked so that the step isn't very high such as backed up to a slight hill so the ground is only a few inches from the step if at all possible your horse will probably stop and balk at the door leave the halter rope as slack as possible to let him sniff and breathe and lower his head to check out the trailer floor he needs to test it to see if it is safe pet him just a little then ask him to go forward by popping him lightly on his back which is beside you don't stand behind him or in front of him you are not pulling him or driving him into the trailer pop him consistently until you get a response from him you may have to pop a little harder for a desensitized horse a sensitive horse you will hardly need to even touch with the rope and they will jump forward if he pulls back or tries to go around the trailer door give him trouble either jerk down hard on the halter rope straight toward the ground holding the rope just under his chin or if he really wants to back up make him back up quickly with short jerks backward on the rope and immediately get him up to the door of the trailer again before you let him stand perfectly still and relax the main idea here is to make the trailer the safe place for the horse to be start with the safe place being the open door later the safe place will be inside the trailer your goal is to get the horse to want to stand at the door then encourage him to take a step forward what you must do to accomplish this is reward him for any forward movement to the trailer this includes just barely inching one foot forward the second he lifts a foot to move forward your consistent popping with the halter rope stops immediately and you praise the horse pet him talk to him and let him stand a moment then ask him to take one more step by starting the popping again this is how you move his safe place forward into the trailer any backward or sideways movement results in his getting jerked backed up or if he is moving wildly run him in circles around you to take out some of the energy he has he should learn that it's a lot of hard work for him to disobey use his lazy nature to get your desired result standing in the trailer if you get him right to the trailer door and he won't step up you can pick up a front hoof and place it in the trailer he may take it back but continue the popping then eventually he will learn to step in at first only let him put his front feet in and then stop him and after a moment ask him to step back out you can pet him praise him and then ask for forward movement again remember to always reward his forward movement once he is completely inside the trailer try to back him out again it is scary for a horse to get out and you don't want him to freeze up once he gets inside repeat the whole process a few times and only when he is loading smoothly would i give him any treats or grain inside the trailer let him stand for awhile just petting him and standing near him in the trailer the more this is repeated such as the next day and the day after that the better your horse will get remember you are not pulling or driving the horse into the trailer your desired result is that he sees the open gate of the trailer and thinks oh that's my comfortable safe place i'm gonna go jump in there the horse should walk right in comfortably hope this works for you if your horse is really wild you might have a little more trouble and need to do more groundwork before you try loading him but i guarantee you this is the best way to put a horse in a trailer the other methods coaxing in with treats or putting a rope on his hind end or hitting the horse to drive it in to the trailer aren't good for you or your horse and though this way takes longer
