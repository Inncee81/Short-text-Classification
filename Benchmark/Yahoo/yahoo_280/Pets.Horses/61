any training ideas to get a yr old twh past being herd bound we made a major mistake in never taking this horse away from his mom except for a brief month period with a trainer when he was yrs old while at the trainers he didn't have a problem leaving other horses and while still very green he was ok on the trail when under saddle he will not walk away from mom more than a few yards he does not buck rear or jump around he just puts on the breaks and tries to turn around and go back to her side we took him completely away from his mom and off our property and placed him with his half sister sure enough they immediately bonded and again he would not walk away under saddle what can we do he is very herd bound which is obvious you need to become his herd work with him in a round pen if you have one seperate him from other horses and deal with the weaning process when you start taking him out under saddle do it in baby steps at side with saddle walk him when he gets upset stop and talk to him to settle him when he settles even for seconds take him home take it farther each day when he is good about a hand walk trail ride then do the same with you in the saddle the worst thing you can do is give him what he wants another horse and when he is fussing you have to win so have a stud chain handy so if you need a bit more control you can put them on so he can't walk on you don't let him misbehave into getting back to his comfort zone end your sessions on a good note and always give him a good grooming or rub down after all of this its a treat he will remember when he is bad tie him to a post and let him stand for a while as long as it is a safe tie post hope this helps Horse Equine conformation Horse tack 1957 World Series Dog training Captain Thunderbolt Comanche Social rule The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Poker jargon Milton H.
