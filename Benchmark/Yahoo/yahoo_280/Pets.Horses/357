i have two yr old percheron mares that are months pregnant is it safe to induce both mares were bred early july of last year we checked breeding dates with the vet both were bred a i this is their first pregnancy one of the mares is completely ready to foal and has been for about a week and she's starting to lose weight i think we should induce labor for both but i've never experienced anything like this so wasn't sure if anyone has had a similar situation before okay guess i wasn't clear with the details i mispoke and said they were yrs old i mean they were bred when they were three also i have had the vet out last week and he says that the foals are fine both are alive and kicking one of the foals has even moved into the birth canal also we've had a bit of a drought here and lately it's been really stormy so i was thinking that could affect them also they were bred to and oldenberg stallion if that helps thanks for all the help we're inducing one of the mares tonight we have a baby turned out the mare wouldn't deliver because the colt had gotten his legs all twisted and what not took the vet twenty minutes to straighten him out anywho we have a baby thank you for all of the help by now it would be a miracle that the foals would be alive were the mares positively identified as being infoal by a vet if the mares are truely in foal then you have to worry about septicemia systemic infection from the dead foals yup get them into the vet have them induced and you may have some hefty medical bills on your hand for post treatment Horse Childbirth Pregnancy Guinea pig Breastfeeding Equine conformation Abortion Thoroughbred Intact dilation and extraction Welsh Cob (Section D) Friends Sunday Silence Dog Obstetrics Abortion debate Neighbours Breech birth Domestication of the horse Miscarriage Pet skunk Welsh pony of cob type (Section C) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clydesdale (breed) Days of our Lives Acne Fancy rat New York Giants Psoriasis Avvakum Knots Landing Heinkel He 112 Premature birth Multiple sclerosis Elephant Arabian horse Menstrual cycle AIDS Birth weight Seabiscuit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Asthma Killian documents Charmed Charisma (horse) Clinical depression Chlorpromazine Coeliac disease Kakapo Autism Herpes simplex virus Drowning Androgen insensitivity syndrome Aerial (dance move) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Prenatal diagnosis Milton H.
