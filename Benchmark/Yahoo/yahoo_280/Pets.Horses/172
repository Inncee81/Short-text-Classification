something is wrong with his eye okay so my horse has had this eye problem for a year now at first i thought something got in it like sawdust or something then it started to have those eye booger things like we get but there was a lot of it and liquid would come out with it even some blood so the vet flushes it out every weeks it has gotten better now it still has the eye boogers but doesnt bleed it is very cloudy we have him on steroids and some other stuff we put in his food he cant see well out of it either it isnt the thing when his nose is clogged up and it comes out his eye b c we have seen atleast vets we may remove it if it gets worse so any suggestions on what it is would be great right now we use clean paper towels to wipe his eye everyday his right eye only have you considered moon blindness eru we had a mare come to us that suffered from it and it too got so bad that we nearly had her eye removed her symptoms sound the same the most common signs are puffy watering eyes squinting and red blood vessels at the sides of the eye and in the lids horses will often be photophobic very sensitive to the sun and often to any light in some eyes you can notice a white cloudiness or a blue or green tint another major sign to look for is a pupil that is constricted when the horse is in the barn or a darkened stall a constricted pupil indicates that it is in spasm and is very painful immediate treatment is needed to alleviate the spasm other signs may include head shaking a runny nose white spots or bleeding in the eye matter or pus collecting loss of balance tripping running into things or rubbing the eye in some cases if you look across the surface of the eye you may even see ulcers they look like little declivities but usually you will need to stain the eye to see them and the untrained eye can still miss them we used atropine to keep the eye dilated and prevent the spasms and banamine for pain when it got severe she had a catheter inserted into her eye for drops and other meds to be applied which made life easier there are various causes from flu and herpes to allergies i strongly suggest you get someone out there that has dealt with eru before and get her on appropriate treatment Asthma Diabetic retinopathy Traumatic brain injury Common cold Dialysis Chronic fatigue syndrome Stroke Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eye Cephalic disorder Migraine Allergy Intracranial pressure Acne Mouth ulcer Urinary incontinence Multiple sclerosis First aid Conjunctivitis Pneumonia Rosacea Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Narcotic Bleeding Sewage treatment Sun Tattoo Cat Diarrhea Myocardial infarction Stomach cancer Herpes simplex virus Gonorrhoea Pupil Guinea pig Charles Darwin's illness Red eye (medicine) Milton H.
