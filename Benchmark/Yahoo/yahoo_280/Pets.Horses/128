growing grass okay so i have a wheat feild but we're getting rid of it and growing grass on it to make a horse pasture the wheat has already been harvested and it's plowed under but how do we get grass to grow thankiez plow it under and then plant the grass seed put some nitrogen on it and it will shoot up quickly keep the horses off it though for a while so that the nitrogen has dispersed and so that the seed takes root you will need to water it though if it's dry where you are we used to take all our mares off the pastures in the winter re seed and then fertilize with nitrogen and in a couple of weeks we had nice lush pastures again there were over mares on the back pasture Wheat Alfalfa Sorghum Hemp Weed control Green Revolution Hay Tillage Seed Cereal Comfrey Oat Maize Sugar beet Carnivorous plant Drooping Brome Compost Lawn Buckwheat Weed Flax Flowering plant Norman Borlaug Herbicide Peanut Organic farming Barley Agricultural machinery Neolithic Revolution Plough Alcohol fuel Rice Bamboo Prosopis cineraria Dune Winter wheat Fruit tree propagation Fruit Textile manufacturing Illegal drug trade Manure Wisteria Turnip (brassica rapa) Fertilizer Potato Poaceae Legume Desertification Alberta Peach Global warming and agriculture Ice cream Tobacco Crop rotation Bonsai Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan Flour Agronomy Pollination Brewery Bread Crop circle Deforestation Irrigation Anchor Soil life Masanobu Fukuoka Hamster Boise, Idaho Plant Livestock Nitrogen Eutrophication Jute Ergot Green manure Tamarix Orchidaceae Pine Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir British Agricultural Revolution Biological dispersal Monsanto Coconut Renewable energy Flower Geography of Brazil Bird migration Cannabis cultivation Houseplant Conifer cones Sugarcane Winkler, Manitoba Bacteria Soils retrogression and degradation Sowing Burdock Biogeochemical cycle
