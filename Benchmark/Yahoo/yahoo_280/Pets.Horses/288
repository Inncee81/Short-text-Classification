what type of bit is most recommended for hunter under saddle shows hi i am starting to show at aqha approved shows with my mare and i was curious to see what bit most hunter under saddle competitiors use in their classes thanks i know there are very many forms of dee rings what type would be best to show in the aqha rule book shows very clearly what type of snaffle bits and other bits are allowed in your hus classes i would read the book to be certain that your bit will conform to rules a simple d snaffle is probably the most common snaffle an o ring is also very very common i don't see many egg butts but they certainly are allowed kimberwicks of both sorts are allowed but fairly unpopular at this time with most trainers as the feeling is a hus horse should move on light contact and be forward and the leverage action of a kimberwick can stop that for many horses as for the type of bit with a d or o ring once again that is very specifically shown in the rule book plain smooth slow twist french link all are listed and state whether they can or cannot be used in junior or senior horse classes i no longer have a current aqha book but i do have a current apha book and it will not allow certain snaffle bits to be used on junior horses and it clearly says how big the o is allowed etc and i'm certain aqha is the same as for which is more popular in your area i would recommend you watch some shows and see for yourself i'm certain that it varies slightly from your home to where i live in canada but one thing hasn't changed use the bit that your horse moves best in my trainer is a big fan of o rings and feels there is more feel and play which makes it better for your horse than a d ring good luck and have fun Horse tack Equine conformation Hunt seat Horse Drill bit Bridle Glossary of partner dance terms XML Show hunter Dog agility Manual transmission Central processing unit The Amazing Race Show jumping Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Hash table Milton H.
