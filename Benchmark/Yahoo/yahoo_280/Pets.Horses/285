my horse has a swollen joint my horses back right leg is a little just a little swollen the fetlock on her right leg is just a little bit bigger than her left fetlock it does not hinder her in any way whatsoever i just noticed it today when i was grooming her she trotted happily out of her stall into her bigger pasture when i let her out so she can walk and trot on it fine what could it be like a sprain or something she doesn't have any wounds or scrapes on that leg and it doesn't feel hot at all she is completely normal except for the swollen fetlock i am going to put ice on it to see if the swelling will go down but any other ideas if it isn't better tom i will call the vet and she is in no pain whatsoever my horse rosie is yrs old and has never shown signs of arthritis or anything i ran some cold water on her leg for about min i will do it again before i put her away she has plenty of room to run around but most of the time she just grazes she is out all the time because she has a shelter in her pasture i just let her out into our fenced in yard every day because it is bigger than her could be a whole load of things from arthritic changes inside the joint suspensory ligaments that have been pulled mud fever or even a reaction to a bug bit i would cold hose it x today for mins at a time and give her a couple of bute tonight the fact that she isn't lame and it's just a bit puffy would say to me a suspensory ligament issue might have just torqued it in the pasture if she's running around outside i'd get her in and have her take it easy for a couple of days the bute and the hosing will take down the inflammation more than using it as pain relief Horse Tennessee Walker Carpal tunnel syndrome Seabiscuit Gout Show hunter Osteoarthritis Phenylbutazone Arthritis Milton H.
