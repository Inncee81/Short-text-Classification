how do i fit my hackamore i've worked as a groom and owned horses all my life ridden plenty in a hackamore but never had to fit one for some reason have just been given a mare that is terribly unhappy in her mouth and outrageously strong had her fully checked out teeth back legs etc and happy mouth bits burn her so i've bought a hackamore i just need to know exactly how high it should be up her nose ps if you are going to give me abuse then don't bother answering i will get my instructors advice but she's on holiday i know roughly how to fit them as i had one on my last horse but he was used to it my new mare has never had one on before so want to put it on in exactly the right place i have tried her in various bits straight bars and jointed but she is so strong and i don't want to go down the route of a very severe bit thanks but i do not haul on my horses mouth and she doesn't like the bit even when she's tied up on the yard i've worked on many top yards and ridden many horses still have regular lessons i think my instructor and i know whats best for her the noseband should fit two fingers' width below the prominent cheek bones at the side of the face the under part is padded and acts above the curb groove the longer the shanks the more poll pressure there will be a horse cannot breathe through its mouth so careful use of gentle giving hands is a necessity with a hackamore it should fit just like a bridle or a little bit higher if it is too high it becomes useless Horse tack Bridle Noseband Drill bit Horse Gag (BDSM) Skateboarding trick Diving Professional wrestling holds Embouchure Internal ballistics Strap-on dildo Shaggy dog story Cat Theory of conduct Tire Salad Fingers Evolution of the Horse Breastfeeding Dog training Backstroke Dressage Butterfly stroke Characters of Naruto Milton H.
