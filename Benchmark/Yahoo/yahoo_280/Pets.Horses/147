are these horse any good ok so i am getting a horse maybe in sep and i have found some horses but i do not know witch one i like more i would just ride my horse english and jumps and some shows but i do not have a trailer so anyway i will get to the point i do not know witch horse i like more so i need help here they are http horsetopia horse for sale org classifieds ad http www equine com horses ad details aspx lid search id eff ff e a d b b http www horseville com php view php id http www equinehits com horses for sale horse http www equinehits com horses for sale horse http www equinehits com horses for sale horse so i really do not know witch one p s don't get any ideas about these horses they are mine jk i have been riding for years and i have i know what green and project is i am not dumb i know a ton about horses first horse she looks really behind the bit in one of the pics looks like the owner hauls on her face alot so she might have a strong mouth it looks like she would need some retraining to get her out of the habit of going behind the bit second horse this mare looks nice but really sounds like she has some major issues i dont understand why the buyers would back out after the vet check unless something came up or they found something out about the horse people usually wont waste money on a vet check like that she also is pretty cheap for having been shown and everything i have to wonder if this mare is off the track if so she may have some issuses related to that third horse i like the look of this one he sounds quiet and nice i like that he has been trail ridden but he is kind of short i dont know how competitive he would be for hunters at only unless he had amazing movement if all the tack is good quality he could be a really good deal fourth horse i dont think this horse has actually done anything he looks nice and is prob really quiet but as far as actual training i would say he is green considering they dont have any pictures of him being ridden and they dont say if he has any show experiance or even training he is also really short to be competitive i would say this one is a no if you want to jump and ride english too small and too green if you want a cute little all around horse maybe i see him being way more western esp because they mention him being ridden in a bosal fifth horse she looks really nice why so cheap if she is sound and sane she might be a really good deal i have to wonder if she is difficult to handle though considering they say intermediate to experianced rider go try her out and see if you can handle her i think she might be hot though sixth horse i would say dont bother with this one i gaurentee he is not hands like the ad claims it also says he is green at the canter still which will take you awhile to get him solid at it he will need a ton of work before you can start jumping him the one picture of him trotting makes him look like he has way too much knee action he isn't even registered the owner also sounds like they will be difficult to work with it doesn't sound like they really want him sold but just a lease insted just go try the horses you like it wil be a lot easier to make a decision plus if you try out a ton of horses you will get a better idea of exactly what you want Horse Dressage Horse tack Horse gait Eventing Cross-country equestrianism Show hunter Theory of conduct World Wide Web Microeconomics PHP Equitation Singlish The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Trademark Milton H.
