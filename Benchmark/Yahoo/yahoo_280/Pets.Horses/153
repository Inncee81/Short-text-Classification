ugh horse problemss i just bought my very own horse and the first few times i rode her she was wonderful she did every thing i asked and was very slow and patient now every time she can't go foward and i make her stand she rears on me and she much too fast for my riding disiplin western now before you say it's a health problem it's not i had vets come out and check her got her teeth done had a full vet check done the vet said it might be her back so i had the chiropracter come and see if any thing was wrong and he said she was fine and so did the farrier so i know now its just her giving me attitude i love my horse so much i just could really use some help on how to slow her down and how to make her stop rearing and stop when i say to stop plz read this info will solve your problem ok well firstly ignore the ppl who are saying that its just a bonding issue and the person who said to hit your horse that could make her head shy and expecially ignore the person who said to use a tie down for several reasons if your horse is a gaited horse the tie down will mess up its gait say your horse does manage to get the strength to rear up with the the tie down on then if she flips over which is dangerous enough shes not going to be able to position her neck correctly and could end up breaking her neck if u plan on trail riding her then i would never use a tie down because i know that wayyyyyy too many trail horses die each year because of tie downs there are lots of different horse parks and ones with rivers are often the most fun but those are the ones that the most horses die at and they die because some of the rivers they have to go against the current or its deep and they have to swim and they cant get their heads up and out of the water far enough to breath and so they end up drowning what i think that your horse needs is an additude adjustment i think that the first few times that u rode her she knew that u were really paying attention and then as u rode it more you became more relaxed and didnt pay attention near as much and i think horses can sense that so now she is pushing u around and testing you and seeing how much she can get away with if i were i would start riding her alot and give her lots of commands and be a very strict or even bossy rider and sort of let her know that your the boss then when she rears up you cant just get off and put her away i cannot stress that enough that is the worst possible thing to do because the last thing u want to do is let your horse get away with murder what you have to do is put both your reins into hand and on side of the reins or on rein slid your hand up it and pull it out and make her do tight circles in direction and circles in the other direction then make her take steps back and just keep doing this every time she rears and eventually she will realize hey this is hard work i better start behaving and then she wont rear because shell know that if she rears or disobeys you that she is gonna have to work and the same thing goes for slowing her down make her do circles and make her back up the only big thing that i want to tell you is for you to make sure that you arent constantly keeping pressure on the reins because then your horse will become accustume to that and then she will be even harder to stop plus i have seen ppl do this and then say oh well this bit isnt giving me enough contact with my horses mouth and then they get a harsher bit and just keep repeating that cycle and they just end up ruining their horse and tearing up his mouth so instead of constant pressure try to use pulses oh and before i forget the tight circles that i told you about they are actually called a reined stop and if your horse ever tries to runaway with you use the reined stop because a horse cant go straight and turn in circles at the same time so do all fo this and that should take care of your problems oh and by the way the person who mentioned perrelli is right about perrilli he is great with horses but hes not going to help you at all with behavior problems Horse tack Aerial (dance move) Diving Professional wrestling holds Milton H.
