are miniature horses good pets and are they all mean i have plenty of space and already own two large ponies is it ok to put a mini horse with horses and i have herd that they can be mean are they and if i decide to buy one what web sites could i go to look for one i agree with barbara s any horse of any size becomes mean because of how it is treated many minis get the stigma of mean devil ponies because people coddle them since their cute and then they get away with murder they can also get defensive in a herd or larger horses as they are small and some times are bullied and feel inferior b c of their size others have no idea they are small and will dominate your entire herd they are perfectly suited companions to large horses and make great pets but they do need trained and disciplined like all pets you would not let your dog potty in the house or the cat ruin the furniture so the mini horse should not be allowed to bite push people or get away with misbehaving because he's cute if you train your mini and treat him like a horse should be treated loved like a pet and respected like a barnyard animal then you should have no problems you can try dreamhorse com and equine com to search for minis i have a colt for sale and also advertise my stallion there and i get lots of calls so you are bound to find something there good luck Horse Domestication of the horse Hamster Dog Equine conformation Pony Zoophilia Marguerite Henry My Little Pony Cat Horseshoe Ferret Working dog Spanking Neopets Kodocha Mini Pet Shetland Sheepdog Petplay The Red Pony Fancy rat Dairy Working animal Domestic rabbit Housebreaking Pet skunk Border Collie Livestock MapleStory Arabian horse Upholstery M16 (rifle) Dog training Guinea pig RISC Evolution of the Horse American Bison Brown Bear Donkey Social rule Friends German Shepherd Dog Horse breaking Internet phenomenon Betting (poker) Dressage Selective breeding Sinfest Companion dog Poodle The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Thoroughbred Ranma __ characters IPod nano Cowboy Przewalski's Horse The Pet Sounds Sessions Azumanga Daioh Domestication Roan (color) Care Bears Pekingese Advertising Daredevil Pitaten Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Okashina Okashi Microchip implant (animal) Garfield Connemara pony Wombat Kylie Minogue W.I.T.C.H.
