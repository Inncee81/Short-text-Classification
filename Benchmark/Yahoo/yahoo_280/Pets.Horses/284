hoof supplements have any of you used hoof supplements to help grow out the horse's feet okay following my saga of the too short trim by the farrier i can't shod my horse because he had white line disease when i bought him which severely weakend the wall of the hoof its getting better but still i thought about adhesive shoes but so many said the adhesive could do more damage and well it seems none of the farriers in my area have experience with this the soles of my horses feet are not toughening up due to absurd amounts of rain i've been treating them with iodine and venice turpentine every other day and tuff stuff once a week still to no avail i'm thinking of trying hoof supplements have any of you used any in particular that seemed to help the hoof grow out obviously the toughening will happen over time but i want to help him grow as much as possible to there is not pressure on the sole i was thinking of adding shoer's friend to my smartpak has anyone tried this one i know a common response is just proper nutrition to start well just added details he is on acco safe and sound which is nutritionally comparable to strategy he currently gets moormons minerals grostrong which is just a general nutritional supplement with electrolytes i know you suggested that before lisa where do you buy order copper sulphate crystals and formaldehyde i'm afraid we're in the middle of nowhere with the military so we've got to get everything off the internet also just added his feet were trimmed short two weeks ago thereabouts so i've just been waiting in the hopes things will get better they have slightly but not enough to put him back into work can you feed pure msm does it require lysine or anything for it to metabolize and become effective in building up the keratin msm speeds growth of any form of keratin such as hair and hooves the best thing for hardening feet is copper sulphate crystals and formaldehyde mix them together and apply to the foot with a paint brush x per day wear gloves and avoid the hair it works very quickly all our tb weanlings and yearlings had their feet treated that way as part of sales prep makes the feet hard as nails so that all that walking up and showing doesn't make them foot sore glue on shoes are awful it's not so much the adhesive it's the solvent that they use to remove them it just corrodes the feet Horseshoe Equine conformation Nutrition Aluminium Prostate cancer Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Glass Laminitis Veganism Herpes simplex virus Explosive material Adhesive Sulfuric acid Nail (anatomy) Seismic retrofit Protein Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Shoe Horse Osteoarthritis Urinary incontinence Water purification Hamster Breastfeeding Atkins Nutritional Approach Brush Irish dance Methamphetamine Shaggy dog story Bodybuilding Stomach cancer Keratin Protein-energy malnutrition Alzheimer's disease Paint Claw Aspartame Car handling Tire Acetic acid Ammonia Water Drill bit Guinea pig Volleyball Massage Dragon Booster Acne Chronic fatigue syndrome Domestic rabbit Omega-3 fatty acid Milton H.
