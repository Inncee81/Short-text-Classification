what are the legal requirements for a vehicle being used to pull a trailer carrying horses i remember it used to be that as long as the vehicle was powerful enough it could be anything i e a family saloon could be used but a few years ago i remember this changed can anyone clarify please sorry i should have said that i'm in the uk i remember something happening a few years back regarding a change because i remember people complaining that they would not be able to use their saloon cars any longer to take their horses to shows in a trailer that they would have to get a x or a lorry and you never see saloons and trailers at shows anymore simply you can't tow a load that is heavier than the towing vehicle unless you have wheel drive it's a bit more complex than that but in effect that means no saloons because any trailer with a horse in it weighs more than any wheel drive vehicle i know unless you have a transit van maybe remember that it's not pulling it thats the problem it's stopping it Semi-trailer Driver's license Pickup truck Truck Rear wheel drive Tractor Van (road vehicle) Sport utility vehicle German car number plates Trailer (vehicle) Autorack Recreational vehicle Peugeot Train Tire Steering Road Tank classification Manual transmission British Carriage and Wagon Numbering and Classification Vehicular cycling Travel trailer Four wheel drive Front wheel drive Axle Battery electric vehicle Car handling Automobile Land Rover (Series/Defender) Gliding Mobile home T-34 Traffic light Spacecraft propulsion Transportation of Los Angeles Tram Transmission (mechanics) Horsepower Personal rapid transit Firearm Toronto Streetcar System Horse tack Dump truck Car body style Ferry Speed limit Hybrid vehicle Electronic toll collection Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority Freeway Road traffic accident Wayne Corporation Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Honda Pilot MIM-23 Hawk Stryker Cable car (railway) Tamiya Corporation Motorcycle Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping 88 mm gun Intermodal freight transport Car safety Volkswagen Type 2 Cart Rules of the road All-terrain vehicle Armoured warfare Locomotive Passenger car Iowa class battleship Wheel of Fortune Auto Train (Amtrak) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas British Rail Derby Lightweight M4 Sherman Toyota Celica Equine conformation Station wagon Manifold vacuum Vauxhall Viva Peugeot 405 Bicycle Straight-6 Recumbent bicycle Minnesota Transportation Museum Drag racing Disneyland School bus Formula One regulations Cowboy Dredge Light rail Car classification Supercharger Channel Tunnel US and Canadian license plates Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends
