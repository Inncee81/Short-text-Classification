are ionized air purifiers safe for my birds i have noticed that when i put my air purifier on for long periods of use with the ionizer on in the same room where my birds are my bird starts to act strange he suddenly has a night fright type reactions and also chirps differently runs in a circle on the floor like in a panic or something he is a year old lovebird and have never seen him react like this before until i got a new air purifier called sharp plasmacluster ionizer my question is is my bird being affected by this air cleaner somehow hi patrj by what you describe your love bird is indeed been affected by the ionizer air cleaner it may not the ionizer that is causing any harm to your pet but he is reacting to some thing strange that bothers him your best bet to try to identify what is causing him distress is to analise his reaction during the day when he is distracted with his daily routine and at night when he is looking at the ceiling trying to count the sheep before he goes to sleep you need to understand the your year old lovebird is a senior citizen so try to cover his cage at night and than start the ionizer if the ionizer has any kind a blue or red light try to tape that with black electrical tape so the reflection of light does not show and scares your feathered friend to death you will see how the ionizer works as the air feels fresher and clean when you breath in and also the amount of white dust caused by your birds feather dust will be reduced to almost nothing hope this has helped you understand why your pet is scared and i commend you by trying to make it's life more enjoyable best to you and keep the faith the canaryman Mattress Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Ionizing radiation Book of Isaiah Hamster Air purifier Vacuum Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Color Mass spectrometry Nuclear explosion Milton H.
