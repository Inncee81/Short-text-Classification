what if i found a bird outside an dit was hurt and i take it inside well i was wondering if i toke a bird inside that was like gonna be eaten by a cat and was scared and couldn't fly yet cause it was a baby and i put it in my house and i raised it and when it gets older or after i take care of it and stuff should i keep it or is it not a house bird should i put it back outside cause i want a bird and i am thinking of catching one outside but i don t know if i should and plus i do have that bird still i don't know what i should do i want to keep it but i got it from the wild is it better if i buy one what if i do keep the bird both you and the bird can be severely hurt unless you are very aware of what you are doing if you attempt to help a wild bird you must keep in mind that it is meant to be wild you could quietly watch from a distance of at least feet to see if the mother is nearby look around for a nest that may have fallen from a tree sometimes older birds watch the young while they forage on the ground and check on them periodically it is very difficult to help a wild bird especially if it is injured you would have to find someone near you who has tried this hopefully a wildlife professional or an academic and consult with them before you even think of approaching the bird birds can die of fright the bird is probably frightened already and there is a chane you could tip the balance in the wrong direction whatever you do it is a very bad idea to think of taking it in as a pet although a wild bird may become tame if taken in it will not be domesticated like the birds you can buy in a pet shop if you want a bird as a pet you should go to a pet store the best discussion i've seen about this on the web is at a site about european starlings one of the people at the site was trained as a federal wildlife rehabber in the us and she discusses the real life problems of taking a bird inside and later trying to release it so it can survive or the alternatives although it can be rewarding it requires constant attention and carries a risk of heartbreaking failure the one experience i had although initially sucessful was emotionally draining and the long term survival of the bird i rescued is still in doubt like all birds in the wild it is always at risk here are some statistics only one robin in lives to be a year old although their lifespan can excede years and only of grackles live to be adults Domestic rabbit Hamster Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kakapo Dog Feral cat The Inside Cat Introduced species Neopets Fancy rat Shaggy dog story Domestic violence Surveillance Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hunting Guinea pig Wind power Platypus Piccolo Junior Saga Jon Secada Seabird Archery Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
