i want a boy and girl parakeet help i want both genders but i want to know if it will be to much of a responsibility if they have babies if they have babies what should i do i've only had my hamsters who had babies but im sure its way different with birds if they have babies you'll be way over your head unless you stay a home with no children everyday budgies shouldn't have babies unless they have a nesting box and are over months old though you have to hand feed the babies every few hours if you go to school they'll starve to death and if you've never taken care of baby birds they're more likely to die than to survive you could just let their parents take care of them though but then there's the question of what to do with the babies if you desperatley want a boy and a girl get two seperate cages but keep your eye on when they're together good luck p s if a female lays eggs she'll need more nutrients like calcium in order to stay healthy Hamster Budgerigar Breastfeeding Platypus Infantilism Bird Albatross Egg (food) Chicken Domestic rabbit Childbirth Sex assignment Kodocha Child abuse The Family from One End Street Girl Monogamy Infant Abortion debate Jon Secada Ostrich Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milk Guinea pig Burrhus Frederic Skinner Grumpy's Three Wishes Gender role Pitaten Care Bears Feral child Egg (biology) Generation Y Transsexuality Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Sexual reproduction Hummingbird Hollyoaks Rocko's Modern Life Dog Situation comedy Ivory-billed Woodpecker EastEnders Pregnancy Kyle Broflovski Emu Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars Sudden infant death syndrome Kakapo Leatherback Sea Turtle Nile crocodile Sharon Tate Pysanka Premature birth Seabird Pet skunk Adoption Androgen insensitivity syndrome Beetle Gypsy moth Urinary incontinence Hikikomori Dinosaur Animal communication Order of succession History of intersex surgery Poverty Frankie Laine Parenting Postpartum depression Sesame Street About a Boy Characters of Lost Multiple birth Boarding school The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Ron and Fez Scouting Charmed Primogeniture Social rule Comanche The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Parrot Puberty Independent school (UK) The Beatles discography Diseases of the honeybee Big Bird Humphrey Bogart Coeliac disease Anorexia nervosa Peter Pan Infanticide Boy Alois Hitler Toxoplasmosis Cuttlefish Veganism Pet Melanie Wilkes
