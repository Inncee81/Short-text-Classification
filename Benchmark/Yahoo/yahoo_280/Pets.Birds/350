i think my baby chicken may have broken its leg how can i tell what's wrong and what to do everything seems to be fine with it its right leg is what seems to hurt it peeps very loudly when i try to put it down the little chick won't stand and just sits there with its eyes closed trying to sleep i had to carry it over to the water and dip its beak in to make it drink while the others were already up and running around oh yah and they are about days old don't know if that helps yes your bird sounds like he has a broken leg if you want to give him a chance to live separate him from the other chicks they are just going to be stepping on him and most likely pecking at him to put him in a small cage that prevents him from moving much keep him at the proper temperature put some sugar into his water to give him a boost wet down his chick starter and gently pry open his beak then put the food in his mouth then dip his beak into the sugar water and lift up his neck so that he can swallow it also remember to hold your chick touch is important touch is important and without it the chick will die the other chicks would touch your chick and if it were in a natural situation it would be tucked under its mothers wing tips to prevent this from happening again make sure that your floor isn t a slippery surface newspaper for example is the worst flooring possible for chicks they can slip on it and get straddle legs straddle legs is when a chick does a split and then can t walk any longer this is possible to fix with a splint us flooring such as rutted paper towels cloth towels if you are going to use newspaper make sure there is straw on the bottom to help then get traction make sure that your brooder is chick proof is there anything your chick could have gotten caught on broken legs don t just occur something happened to your chick make sure that there is enough room around the feeder and waterier if there isn t the chicks will peck at one another and sometimes a chick can get hurt when a chick gets to the sleepy point like you described he she usually doesn t make it i wish you luck with your chicks Aerial (dance move) Chicken Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Diving Kakapo Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Japanese tea ceremony Capercaillie Shaggy dog story Seabird The Shining (film) Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling match types Fire fighting Customs and etiquette of Japan Hiking Breastfeeding Milton H.
