how should parakeets act when u first bring them home i just bought a parakeet home on the way over it was really chirpy but now it hardly even chirps it sits on the perch mostly all the time i am not sure if it has eaten or drank any of the water since being home should i be concerened my parakeet took weeks before it started chirping then another only took a day so it varies it is normal for them to be quiet at first they are getting used to their surroundings they look like they're not doing anything but in actual fact they are paying attention to everything that is going on it is good to have them in a social part of your house be patient i found music would get my new parakeets chirping check your seed tray for empty seed husks then you'll know if it has been eating and of course pooping new parakeets often have watery stools to start with that's a stress reaction keep talking to it and soon it will loosen up and you won't be able to shut it up have fun and good luck Urinary incontinence Chirp Fecal incontinence Dietary fiber Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Diarrhea Poker jargon Dialysis Pikmin Social rule Japanese tea ceremony Betting (poker) Irritable bowel syndrome Marathon (sport) Animal Crossing Cricket (insect) Dairy The Amazing Race National Football League Customs and etiquette of Japan Certified Nursing Assistant Sonar Feces Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
