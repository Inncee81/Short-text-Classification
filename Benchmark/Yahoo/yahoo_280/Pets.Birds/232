what do i say when i'm talking to my parakeets i don't know what to say when i'm talking to my three parakeets all i say is hi how are you guys today their names are shorty sunny and sky i never know what to say other the phrase i always say what should i say to last an hour talking to my parakeets i mean i don't want my parakeets to talk yet i just don't know what to say to them i researched and they said to talk to them one hour everyday first off the advice about separate cages is inaccurate birds can become and remain bonded with people even if they are with other birds they should have avian as well as human companionship if at all possible to say otherwise is a very silly old wives' tale and it's kind of embarrassing to see somebody still saying it also the talk about saying one thing over and over again is horrible advice you're trying to be friends with your birds and give them something interesting to listen to you don't want to bore them to death just talk conversationally with a little bit of animation in your voice stuff like you are so good generally works pretty well for starters tell them when you're taking them out feeding them etc and they will remember what the words mean even if they don't talk don't worry about confusing them they love the sound of their human companions' voices whatever you say to them parrots and yes parakeets are a species of parrot also like to be in the same room with human conversation it makes them feel like they're involved in the discussion i keep my birds nearby when i'm talking on the phone and look at them once in a while they figure i'm talking to them now when the phone rings they get all excited Social rule Parrot Shaggy dog story Rich Mullins Monk Parakeet Little Britain Rose-ringed Parakeet The Ashlee Simpson Show Pet Conure Stuttering Bird The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Euphemism Animal cognition Theory of conduct Hearing impairment Friends Hey Jude Storytelling Budgerigar H5N1 Jon Secada Zoophilia John Cage The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Carolina Parakeet The Shining (film) Cliff Richard Saruman Bird species new to science described in the 2000s Gerald Durrell Sant Thakar Singh The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan English grammar Ron and Fez Cyberspace Written Cantonese The McGuire Sisters Philosophy of language Piccolo Junior Saga Empire Burlesque Avian influenza Laura Schlessinger Late Night with Conan O'Brien Psittaciformes Shark The nature of God in Western theology Plum-headed Parakeet The Amber Spyglass Alexandrine Parakeet Dog Singlish Witches (Discworld) Sinfest The Emancipation of Mimi Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Aladdin (1992 film) Taxi Driver Avenue Q Inception of Darwin's theory Speech synthesis Chicken RuneScape quests Gerund Kender Goodness and value theory Episodes of Lost (Season 1) German grammar The Fairly OddParents The Catcher in the Rye I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Love Hina main characters Totally Spies!
