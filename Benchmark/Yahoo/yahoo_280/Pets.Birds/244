parakeetsss when i let my parakeets play in my living room it just trys to go back into the cage also it hates taking showers cause when i go to my sink it goes crazy and how do i make it stop liking its cage i only put them back in when its time to go to sleep and when it has to eat and is it ok for them to eat grapes thanks first of all his cage is like his home try leaving the door open and letting him come out on his own at his own pace if he doesn't want to come out don't force him you can put a treat on the outside of the cage if you want like millet avicakes nutriberries etc you should have your bird on a pelleted diet supplemented by many fruits including grapes and veggies but no avacado onion alcohol sugar caffiene and little dairy if he doesn't want to go in the sink don't force him you need to be gentle and patient with your bird instead you can try spritzing him with a water bottle or leave a shallow dish of water that can't be tipped over in his cage or putting some wet greens in his cage like lettuce so he can shower on his own i suggest you take him to an avian certified vet find one near you here www aav org vet lookup to get some more information and have your bird get a check up i also suggest you subscribe to bird talk a great magazine about the care of pet birds and do a little bit more researching on bird care hope this helps and good luck Hamster Guinea pig Chicken Domestic rabbit Little Britain Pet skunk Crohn's disease Bird One Piece minor characters Champagne (beverage) Fecal incontinence Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Canary Chile pepper Ferret Wine Prostate cancer Fancy rat First aid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence The Birds (film) Vegetarianism Friends Dog The Penultimate Peril Breath of Fire III RuneScape quests Jewish cuisine Ron Weasley The Shining (film) Folic acid Korean cuisine Breastfeeding Sin City Grape Piccolo Junior Saga Wine making Tooth enamel Onion The Catcher in the Rye Fanta Customs and etiquette of Japan Domain Name System Shark Phoebe Buffay's songs Cuisine of Denmark Milton H.
