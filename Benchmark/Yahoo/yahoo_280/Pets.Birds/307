how do i get my green cheeked connor to stop biting hi i have a year old green cheeked conure myself i even bred her when she hit she started getting nippy and going for my face she'd attack my partner as was a right terror screaching as she was biting gee why is it they know how to bite so they dont break the skin but it hurts like hell i found by holding her when she was biting with fingers either side of her beak would stop her being sturn and telling her no yes she'd try to take chunks out of me but i wouldnt re act the more she done it the longer i'd hold her with my fingers either side of her beak only when she stopped would i stop during this time i would talk to her carmly even if she was biting me raising your voice or reacting to them biting gives them more insentive to carry on doing it because to them it will become a game not just that but they try to be the boss they try to rule you by doing this you have to just ignore the bad behaviour and stay focused you be the boss you dont want him her to bite you make them know it they give up in end as they aint getting a reaction from you also another thing people do which i never needed to do is as soon as they bite stick them in the cage ignore them leave it ten minutes then go back and try again and keep repeating the process also one thing to consider is not to let him her on your shoulder while trying to stop the biting as they then see you as an equal instead of the dominant one good luck Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blood (computer game) Aerial (dance move) Pok__mon Live!
