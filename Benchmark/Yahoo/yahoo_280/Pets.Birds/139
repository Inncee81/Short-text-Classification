how do i stop my senegal parrot from shrieking i took her to a boarder with other birds and she came home with a shriek that drives me crazy i try to ignore it but she feels that i dont like it and she knows i am paying attention so she keeps doing it i have tried ignoring it and i have tried to tell her no when she does it neither seems to work how long has it been since she came home she's either just showing you that she's angry with you for leaving her or you didn't ignore her for long enough it takes a few days and you have to actively ignore birds do not cover the cage this doesn't show them that they're in trouble it just makes them think you're mean for putting them to bed early when she screams leave the room shut off the lights and don't come back until she's been silent for a full minutes it can take a while then come back and give her lots of attention and treats the screaming should go away or at least greatly decrease in a couple days if after this you're still having trouble please feel free to let me know i work a lot with cockatoos who are real screaming birds so i know lots of tricks Shaggy dog story Real Love (song) Eddie Guerrero Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ron Weasley The Shining (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Equine conformation Pok__mon Live!
