i found a baby bird help we are remodeling our back porch and while we were cleaning it off we found a nest w baby birds in our bird house we already moved the bird house to a different location will they survive will their mom find them if their mom does not find them how can i keep them from not dying so far i put in bird seed just so they have the option to eat something but they keep on tweeting i can not open the bird house in any way to get the bird more food plz help me any ideas or options i will take i really want the birds to survive help yes it is a wild bird i did not touch them only the bird house first if the parents can hear the babies they can find them second it does not matter if you touched the birdhouse or the babies birds do not have an acute sense of smell and the parent birds will not detect your scent on the babies wildlife biologists and bird banders handle baby birds all the time with their bare hands and the parent birds do not reject the babies third the parents see people as predators they will not come back to their babies as long as there are people in the area fourth never place bird seed in an active birdhouse or nest baby birds do not eat seed and it can attract predators that can harm or kill the babies fifth with all the commotion created by the work you are doing on your porch and a lot of people around the parent birds might have fled the area abandoning their babies you need to watch the birdhouse for at least hours after everyone is out of sight you need to watch it from a spot where you can see it clearly but the parent birds can not see you do not stop watching it the parent birds could flit in feed the babies and flit out again in a matter of seconds if after hours you have not seen the parent birds come back contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the baby birds yourself there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species Hamster Kakapo Breastfeeding Chicken Pet skunk Falconry Seabird Albatross Cat Hunting Bird migration Bird Domestic rabbit Extinction Capercaillie Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Terri Schiavo H5N1 Species Mealy Parrot 613 mitzvot Bat Acorn Gray Wolf Ferret Mosquito Fox hunting Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Dinosaur Tasmanian Devil Fancy rat Dodo Livestock Dog Orca Kashrut Elephant Genetically modified food Trapping Hedgehog Peafowl Vegetarianism Shark Foie gras Red Squirrel American Black Bear Poker jargon Bird ringing Airport Animal communication Insulin Peanut Saruman Hemp Public domain Agriculture Condor Ant Sewage treatment Gliding Vermicompost Scientology beliefs and practices Mid-levels Egg (food) Fire fighting Insect Spider Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Tetrapod RuneScape quests Diabetes mellitus Nile crocodile Tyrannosaurus rex Gypsy moth Skunk Adoption Psychiatric hospital Ostrich Shrimp farm Beetle Animal rights Salad Fingers Tenshinhan International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Foodborne illness Insurance Charmed Dog agility Blue Whale Canary Hummingbird Abortion debate
