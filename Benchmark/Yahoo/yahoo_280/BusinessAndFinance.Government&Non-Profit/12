my husband was unofficially hired as a firefighter emt at a va medical center he has completed his physical and background check both he passed with flying colors but now we are waiting for fingerprints to come back they say they are back logged weeks waiting and because he is accepting this job from out of state that they have to have the fingerprints completed before he can start does this sound normal how long do the fingerprints usually take the chief keeps telling him to hang in their but our lives are on hold are we moving and when help i doubt the feds will offer him the position and have him start contingent upon the successful completion of the fingerprint background check so you will probably just have to wait it out he may want to suggest this option to them though if they are paying for relocation i doubt they will do it though if you know your husband will pass the check then relax and pack slowly good luck Social rule Community emergency response team The Amazing Race Ambulance Surveillance Emergency Medical Services Poker jargon Schapelle Corby Ariel (Firefly episode) Parachuting Prostate cancer Out-of-body experience Demographics of Japan Cincinnati Bengals Halo 2 New York Giants Pilot certification in the United States Paramedic Reservoir Dogs Biometrics Cleveland Browns Teacher Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Philmont Scout Ranch Master Control Program James Hanratty Emergency medical technician Detective Education in Germany Pitaten New York Jets Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Chess Freeters Betting (poker) Gun politics Japanese American internment Triage British national identity card Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina USS Yorktown (CV-10) Plame affair Good Times Leo Frank Urinary incontinence Apollo 8 D.
