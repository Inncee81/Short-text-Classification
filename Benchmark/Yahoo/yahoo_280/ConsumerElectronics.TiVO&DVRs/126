i have diredt tv hd with tivo question whenever i try to change the channel from something i want to tivo it says i have to be on that channel how do i fix this onyx dracona has a really good answer and a way to get it working most likely now i am guessing that you are using the hr directv tivo which is a dual tuner model so first i would check to make sure that both of the coaxial cables coming from the directv dish are connected to both the input and input locations on the back of your directivo if you do not have both coaxial lines connected you will need to connect both if this is not the case then are two channels being recorded at the same time if so then you would either have to watch one of the shows movies being recorded or record both channels and watch something you already have saved on the directivo's now playing list now if neither of hte two issues above are the problem then you need to look at your satellite settings to make sure the directivo is set up to use both tuners i am not in front of my directivo right now so i might miss a page but hopefuly you will get the idea hit the directv button go to messages and setup now go to guided setup go through the guiided setup and make sure that the directivo is set up for two tuners if none of these help please feel free to send me an email with what is going on exactly and i can trouble shoot it better or give you info on what to do next to get it fixed TiVo Cable television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting High-definition television DirecTV Set-top box Satellite television Digital video recorder Coaxial cable Ethernet Direct broadcast satellite Pirate decryption GSM services Modem Oscilloscope Home cinema System/36 Television in the United States IPod MythTV E-mail CPU cache MDAC GameFAQs System/34 SCART Gmail Poker jargon Public Broadcasting Service Federal Communications Commission Loudspeaker TV Guide Pretty Good Privacy ZX Spectrum Debugging Voice over IP News Corporation TurboGrafx 16 PlayStation Portable Halting problem Composite monitor ATI Technologies Satellite radio Nintendo DS DVD Game Boy Advance Internet fraud Whose Line Is It Anyway?
