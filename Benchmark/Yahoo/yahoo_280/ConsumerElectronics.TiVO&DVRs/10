how can i transfer tv recordings from my dvr to my pc hard drive i have a scientific altantic explorer hd and cant figure out how to transfer the video to my laptop i heard somewhere that one way is that you must stream the recording through a vcr but i wish not to waste my time is there a specific cable i need which hooks up to the laptop's usb cord i don't know of any software cable combination that will allow the transfer of video directly to a pc from the hopefully cablevision for me scientific atlanta will make a hardware software package that works more like the tivo and their tivo to go where you can use ethernet or wifi networking to transfer video to any of you're authorized pcs you could take a look at the slingbox as an addition but of course that means more money and equipment or you can look at the new tivo hd which had a price drop to replace the but again additional dollars TiVo IBM PC compatible Universal Serial Bus Bluetooth FireWire Xbox 360 Microsoft Xbox IPod Computer bus PlayStation 3 Videocassette recorder High-definition television PlayStation Portable PlayStation 2 Windows XP Personal computer Floppy disk DVD Computer Desktop computer IMac Linux IBook USB flash drive Atari ST Secure Digital card Apple Macintosh IBM PC PC Engine Voice over IP Computer hardware Commodore 64 PCI Express Hard disk Mouse (computing) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Wireless LAN Copy protection Video on demand Dongle Television PowerBook Laserdisc Mac OS X Embedded system PowerPC Creative Zen History of Microsoft Windows Commodore International Broadband Internet access Timeline of computing 1990-forward Amiga Digital Equipment Corporation Ethernet Atari 8-bit family Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis ITunes Camcorder Supercomputer IBM Sound card ATI Technologies Nintendo GameCube Port (computing) 8 mm video format ReplayTV SCSI Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo Revolution Atari 2600 Archos Cable television Disc jockey Windows Vista Digital camera Redundant array of independent disks VHS History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Apple Computer Modchip Serial ATA Sharp Zaurus Oscilloscope Computer virus Computer forensics TRS-80 Pocket PC Sound recording Digital photography Nielsen Ratings Computer and video games Game Boy Advance Booting Hotspot (wifi) MicroATX
