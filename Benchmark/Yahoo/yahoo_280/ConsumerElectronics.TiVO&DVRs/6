is it possible i have a digital video recorder dvr with a usb port on it the port is referenced in the instuction manual as being there for future use and what i'm wondering is if there is a way that i can connect a usb cable from the dvr to my pc and transfer the video files from hard drive to hard drive can anyone recommend a good freeware shareware program for attemptin this i've already tried connecting the pc and the dvr but my pc can't recognize the hard drive in the dvr because i do not have a device driver for it the usb ports are for future use unless you have a directv tivo then it can be modified very easily to enable the usb ports the usb ports are not for connecting a usb cable which will attach directly to your pc's usb ports the usb ports are for connectiing a usb ethernet adapter like the linksys usb m or netgear fa these will allow tivo and modified directv tivo to be connected to your homes wired wireless network via an ethernet cable now your pc will not even recognoze anything on the dvr's hard drive most likely because the dvr's software is differetn than your pc's operating system for example tivo's and directv tivo's operating system is a linux version so windows based pc will not even connect to the hard drive at all even if you had removed the drive and plugged it in directly to your pc if by chance you have a directv tivo not a directv dvr then send me an email and i can forward you ifo links how to's to get networking on your unit if by chance you have a comcast dvr made by motorola then please send me an email and i can give you a link that shows how to modify it so you can connect it to your pc via firewire ports if you do not have one of the above mentioned dvr's then your only way to transfer the shows movies would be either to a dvd recorder or to your pc after a tv tuner capture card has been installed with a tv tuner capture card you can coonect a coaxial cable ro s video cable and rca audio cables from the dvr to the pc's capture card hit play on the dvr and record on the capture cards software this will record the shows movies to your pc's hard drive so that you can edit them and burn them to dvd i hope this helps give you some ideas if you have any further questions please feel free to send me an email Xbox Musical Instrument Digital Interface Xbox 360 Windows XP Secure Digital card FireWire Apple Macintosh Ethernet PlayStation 2 IMac Microsoft Linux PowerPC Digital photography PlayStation 3 Computer bus DVD Linux kernel Digital audio player Modchip Creative Zen Voice over IP PlayStation Portable AirPort Atari ST Commodore 64 Knoppix IBook Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Modem Floppy disk MicroATX Computer hardware Computer Nintendo Revolution AmigaOS Mac mini Sound card Creative Nomad Port (computing) Timeline of computing 1990-forward Serial ATA Computer forensics Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Router DirecTV Architecture of Windows 2000 Mac OS X Digital rights management Sharp Zaurus Embedded system Common Unix Printing System SCSI Camcorder X Window System Videocassette recorder Dongle Archos Wi-Fi Digital camera History of Microsoft Windows Apple Computer Flash memory IBM PC compatible Pretty Good Privacy TRS-80 Copy protection D-subminiature Sound recording Windows 2000 Device driver Btrieve Power Macintosh G3 Symbian OS Disk cloning Nintendo DS MAC address Advanced Technology Attachment LiveCD Personal computer
