pros and cons of dvr vs tivo and associated companies i m new to this subject and am looking for some wisened guidance we do not have high def or anything too fancy in our system just interrested in finding out which way to go and avoiding any common mistakes people make thanks in advance i prefer tivo's too but i prefer a dvr that i can personalize can save the movies shows i have saved on the tivo to a dvd after i transfer it to my pc i will put a short list of pro's and con's for each tivo pro's able to transfer shows movies i have saved to a pc for editing burning to dvd i am able to watch my shows over the internet from any location with a fast internet connection i can be at work and connect to my tivo over the internet to schedule a show movie that is coming on while i am still at work it get accurate tv guides since it is updated daily movies can be purchased via amazon and be automatically downloaded to your tivo once you have it connected to the internet you can purchase or create with the right software a upgraded larger hard drive to increase your recording time available from hours up to hours of recording time i can modify the way the shows movies are recorded easier with the tivo remote and user interface if the tivo breaks i can upgrade and or fix the tivo myself with replacement hard drives motherboards power supplies case fan etc the price may be expensive but tivo offers many plans and with each plan the price per month actually goes down dramatically for example the offer a year subscription where you pay each month or they offer a year subscription where you pay the years total which is a lot cheaper than if you paying month by month this is just their lesser subscription timeframes tivo con's you have to pay a monthly fee that is not part of your cable or satellite providers monthly fees and it is a seperate contract if it breaks and is not under warranty any longer you will need to have it fixed for it to work again from a tivo repair upgrade person the price can be expensive for a year contract cable satellite dvr pro's usually just another a month for the dvr service and a month for renting the dvr dvr's able to record your shows pretty easily with the user interface if it breaks the cable satellite provider usually will provide a new dvr all your programming is still lost cable satellite dvr con's you do not own the dvr and will have to turn it in when you stop your contract with the cable satellite provider you cannot easily or quickly transfer shows movies from the dvr to a pc cannot transfer via a networked connection which is very fast has to be by a real time transfer which means a hour movie would take hours to transfer you cannot just purchase a upgraded larger hard drive to put into the dvr so that you have more recording time available they usually only offer hours or hours of recording time on their dvr's which does actually fill up pretty quickly if you like keeping shows movies stored on the dvr you cannot schedule recodings over the internet for your dvr to record when you are not at home you cannot connect it to a wireless or wired home network so that you can watch view the shows movies on your pc or edit the shows movies or record the shows movies easily and quickly if it breaks you are out all the time and recordings you have on it i am sure i can keep going but i hope you can see why i like tivo's better than a standard dvr i like to make them work how i like i do not want or need just a digital tape recorder like a vhs recorder i hope this helps you in your search if you have any questions please feel free to send me an email Microsoft IPod Windows XP PlayStation Portable DVD IMac Enterprise content management Home Box Office Floppy disk Commodore 64 Windows Vista BitTorrent America Online Videocassette recorder Xbox Digital photography Modem IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 VHS Computer Telegraphy Universal Serial Bus Mac OS X Pretty Good Privacy Xbox 360 Television Bluetooth Embedded system Telephone Apple Computer Linux PlayStation 3 Laserdisc Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting E-mail Apple Macintosh Podcasting Direct broadcast satellite Password BBC Web crawler Internet service provider Hard disk Object Desktop File system Atari ST Spyware Digital rights management Television in the United States ReplayTV Copyleft GSM services Microsoft Office Microeconomics Pirate decryption Internet fraud Wi-Fi Personal computer Solar power Atari 8-bit family Opera (web browser) Mattress System 7 (Macintosh) System/36 Visual Basic AmigaOS Btrieve Windows Server 2003 Sound Blaster Energy development Communications satellite E-mail spam MDAC Redundant array of independent disks Usenet Octopus card Personal rapid transit Online music store Modchip Surveillance Musical Instrument Digital Interface Steam (content delivery) Global Positioning System Nintendo WiMAX
