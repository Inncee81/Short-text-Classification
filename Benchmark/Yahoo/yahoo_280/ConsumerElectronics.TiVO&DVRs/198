i need some advice concerning guitar tuners i've decided to take up guitar and i was wondering does it matter which kind of tuner would tune your guitar well or would just any tuner work thanks i really appreciate it you'd likely get more answers if you posted this question in the performing arts category but i'll give it my best shot any tuner will give you decent results but as a beginner you should learn to tune your guitar by ear first because you won't always have a tuner available or may be tuning to another instrument that is not in tune with the tuner second because it will help you train your ear which is always a good thing Violin Tuning Guitar Harp Fermi problem Piano Electric guitar Eddie Van Halen Experimental music Edward Elgar Floyd Rose Blind musicians I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Berimbau Banjo Tuning fork Steinberger Pet Sounds Sport compact Music of Ireland Sitar The Joker's Wild Old-time music Sonic Youth Chess strategy and tactics Pat Metheny Harmonic series (music) Timpani Need for Speed Queen (band) Folk music Chicago (band) The Star-Spangled Banner Sampling (music) Charango Ethics Analog-to-digital converter Authentic performance Cello Merle Travis Music Ukulele Donald Rumsfeld Acoustic guitar King Crimson Wangan Midnight Cliff Richard Blood on the Tracks Music of Hawaii Diving Lute Charles Ives TiVo Martial art Pedal steel guitar Music theory ATI Technologies Mason Williams Mike Watt Miles Davis Songwriter Slide guitar The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Just intonation Mandolin Goodness and value theory Bass guitar The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Green Day Ford Mustang Viola Video game music Antenna (radio) Absolute pitch Steel guitar Fairport Convention Slack tuning Engine tuning I Love Lucy Weezer The Who Good Times Initial D Big band Joy Division (band) Fiddler on the Roof Hearing impairment John Kerr Double bass Game show Jennifer Lopez Leo Kottke AFI (band) Harry Partch Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Sly & the Family Stone Pitch (music) Overkill (band) God Emperor of Dune
