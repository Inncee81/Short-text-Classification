trypsin and insulin are the same thing please give me the detail i am a medical school student thanks trypsin is a serine protease found in the digestive system where it breaks down proteins it is used for numerous biotechnological processes trypsin is secreted into the intestine where it acts to hydrolyse proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids this is necessary for the uptake of protein in the food trypsin catalyses the hydrolysis of peptide bonds the enzymatic mechanism is like all other serine proteases a catalytic triad serves to make the active site serine nucleophilic this is achieved by modifying the electrostatic environment of the serine the enzymatic reaction that trypsins catalyze is thermodynamically favorable but requires significant activation energy it is kinetically unfavorable trypsins have an optimal operating ph of about and optimal operating temperature of about c insulin from latin insula island as it is produced in the islets of langerhans in the pancreas is an anabolic polypeptide hormone that regulates carbohydrate metabolism apart from being the primary agent in carbohydrate homeostasis it has effects on fat metabolism and it changes the liver's activity in storing or releasing glucose and in processing blood lipids and in other tissues such as fat and muscle the amount of insulin in circulation has extremely widespread effects throughout the body please note that i am not a medical professional please see the web pages for more details on trypsin and insulin Protease Glucose Signal transduction Whole proteome analysis Glucocorticoid Fat Coagulation Dieting Cell (biology) Puberty Diabetic ketoacidosis Liver Protein sequencing Hormone Gastric acid Glycogen storage disease type I Origin of life Bodybuilding Lipase Mass spectrometry Aspartame Glycogen Chymotrypsin Atkins Nutritional Approach Endocrinology Protein-energy malnutrition Amino acid Peptide Serine Citric acid cycle Neurotransmitter Cholesterol Metabolism Growth hormone treatment Glycemic index Glycosylation Cancer Photosynthesis Brewery Digestion Cholecystokinin Cysteine Cirrhosis Vitamin C Carbohydrate Apoptosis Blood sugar Adrenal gland Anabolism Blood Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Atherosclerosis Cellular respiration Anabolic steroid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Epinephrine Hydrolysis Glucagon Low-carbohydrate diet Gelatin Sugar DNA repair Antibody Alcohol Hemoglobin Peptide mass fingerprinting Thyroid hormone Francis Crick Insulin resistance Milk Folic acid Sleep Ketoacidosis RNA world hypothesis
