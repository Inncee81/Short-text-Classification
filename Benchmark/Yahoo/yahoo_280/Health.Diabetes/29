is it right for a doctor to treat me for gestational diabetes just because i couldnt keep the drink down i took my one hour gb test and failed i threw up shortly after i left the doc's office i went back for my hour gb test but couldnt hold the drink down long enough for them to take my next blood sample i know that this still doesnt mean that i have gb my doctor claimed that there is no other method for them to find out if i have gb so she'll have to treat me like i do by putting me on a diet and having me test my blood sugar i dont mind all of the dieting and testing but is this right for her just to say that i must be treated for it since i couldnt hold the drink down i did an internship with a midwife who used jelly beans for the ogtt i found a research article in my medical library which backs it up maybe you could print this and show it to your doctor american journal of obstetrics gynecology pt nov abstract objective this study tested the hypothesis that a standardized dose of jelly beans could be used as an alternative sugar source to the g glucose beverage to screen for gestational diabetes mellitus study design one hundred sixty pregnant women at to weeks' gestation were recruited for a prospective study to compare sugar sources for serum glucose response side effects preference and ability to detect gestational diabetes mellitus patients were randomly assigned to consume g glucose beverage or jelly beans g simple carbohydrate serum glucose values were determined hour later the test was later repeated with the other sugar source finally a g hour oral glucose tolerance test was performed participants completed a questionnaire recording subjective outcome variables american diabetes association criteria were used to interpret all test results results among participants completing the study no significant differences were found between hour serum glucose values mg dl with g glucose beverage mg dl with jelly beans p frequency of discrepant results p sensitivity specificity or predictive value jelly beans yielded fewer side effects with g glucose beverage with jelly beans p and were preferred by of participants p five cases incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus were diagnosed with g glucose beverage alone with jelly beans alone and with both sugar sources conclusions jelly beans may be used as an alternative to the g glucose beverage as a sugar source for gestational diabetes mellitus screening the sources provoke similar serum glucose responses patients report fewer side effects after a jelly bean challenge than after a g glucose beverage challenge Glucose tolerance test Glycemic index Polycystic ovary syndrome Hypertension Cancer Hyperglycemia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Caffeine Nutrition Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vitamin C Migraine Schizophrenia Medical analysis of circumcision Androgen insensitivity syndrome HIV test Medicine Tocopherol Glycogen storage disease type I Homeopathy Dieting Alcoholism Coeliac disease Glucose meter Diabetic retinopathy Coffee Anti-diabetic drug Quantitative marketing research Abortion Hypercholesterolemia Physician Biochemistry Turner syndrome Diabetic nephropathy Chlorpromazine Experiment Gastroparesis Breast cancer Breastfeeding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Allergy Blood type Multiple sclerosis Growth hormone treatment Acne Obesity Sugar Aspartame Glycemia Clozapine Sleep Diabetes mellitus type 2 Diabetic coma Atherosclerosis Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Haemochromatosis Glucose Psychology Controversies in autism Vegetarianism Diabetes insipidus Pharmaceutical company Dietary fiber Psoriasis Insulinoma Hypnosis Pregnancy Lumbar puncture Antidepressant Glucocorticoid Stomach cancer Prolactinoma Childbirth Diabetic neuropathy Normal distribution Asthma Acupuncture Congenital hyperinsulinism Microeconomics Soft drink Anemia
