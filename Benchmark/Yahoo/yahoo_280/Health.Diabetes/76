months pregnant and gestational diabetes where can i find a good meal plan i'm allergic to dairy also i'm years old allergic to dairy products and have had a nasty case of morning sickness wondering what in god's name i will be able to keep down crackers and breads have been about all i can stomach i can't solely eat those any suggestions been there been that done that too you can and you will get through this can you drink soy milk i think it's delicious there are also almond and oatmilks available at healthfood stores and many many grocery stores now too let me see if i remember what i did as my daughter's now i kept crackers by my bed so that before i moved around very much in the morning or if i got hungry at night i could eat something little i found the nausea and morning sickness was much much worse if i let my stomach get too empty in another month or so many many women but not all begin to feel much better some even find the morning sickness nausea completely disappears in the second trimester i found the nausea was far far worse than the actual throwing up so sometimes rather than feel ill all day or all morning i'd make myself throw up get it over with and then go about my business that seemed to work well for me water and cups of tea were my best friends and helped to settle my stummy too especially chamomile i found foods anything that had garlic in it made me violently ill for a long time so avoid that if it's getting to you i ate bananas turkey sandwiches w lettuce and tomato on ww bread no cheese since you're allergic i also found that nut butters like cashew and almond helped to settle my stomach and combined w the crackers made a small meal that held my blood sugar much better than the crackers alone have you consulted w a diabetic nutritionist most insurances will cover this and most ob gyns automatically send their patients w gestational diabetes to a diabetic educator as a matter of course i ate a lot of grains beans salads fruits and veggies when i was pregnant and seaweed and sushi too i also ate chicken and fish i found i absolutely needed to eat some animal food to keep from bottoming out while on insulin had some really really low blood sugars and that was immensely painful and scary for me as it made me feel desperately ill make sure whatever else you do that you eat enough for dinner and don't skip meals this will wreak havoc w your blood sugars i also want to say these last things to you something like of women who have gestational diabetes go on to become type ii's yes the stats are that bad so get used to taking blood sugars exercising eating really really well and taking care of yourself b c that will go a long way towards making sure you're here to see your children's children diabetes is actually a very powerful gift b c it makes us do exactly what we should have been doing in the first place eating well and exercising and taking the immensely good care of ourselves that we take of the other members of our family don't worry about missed treats you will find you lose your taste for sugar and things sweet as you go further down this road i let myself have one small cookie or piece of chocolate a day so that i don't feel deprived i don't even want them every day now doctors can be terrorists they tell you every bloody thing that can go wrong might go wrong went wrong three hundred years ago they're actually required to do this but it is extremely difficult and abusive in my opinion to subject a pregnant woman to scare tactics and full disclosure if you find they're trying to terrorize you into submission and into being medically compliant call them on it insist that they stop it at once make friends w the pa or the nurse write a pregnancy plan not just a delivery plan insist upon a midwife tell them that you will deal w any and all complications as they arise and if they arise and not until i found the obsession w what could go wrong extremely misplaced get your husband or lover to act as your cheerleader mentor not as your enforcer or further terrifier being newly diagnosed a diabetic is extremely difficult and rather terrifying for most women to say nothing about just hard going they don't need it to be made worse the most important thing you could possibly do is exercise and talk to your baby and tell him or her that you are doing everything in your power to take care of yourself and her him think positively everything will be alright and if it's not you'll deal with it as soon as you know i took shots a month that's three a day of insulin and three a day of heparin plus five twelve finger sticks plus blood tests to have my daughter i have a genetic blood clotting disorder that has almost killed me twice now i am happy to say that i the most needle phobic of all humans can now give myself shots and it doesn't faze me a bit you'll get used to it and you need to b c unless you lose lots of weight and it works for you to do so you'll be diabetic w all subsequent pregnancies as well i wish you the absolute best don't hesitate to e mail me if you need a cheering squad blessings upon you woman eat lots of little meals rather than large ones and try to put protein and fats into each meal like soy cheese nuts and nut butters seeds gorp and trail mix hard boiled eggs tofu tempeh and seitan tunafish salmon sardines mackeral etc turkey jerky etc i even ate hamburgers if i craved one which is completely out of character for me i loved peanutbutter sandwiches and tuna sandwiches for example my current favorite sam is fresh mozzarella and it's from buffaloes not cows so you might be able to eat this fresh tomato w a bit of freshly ground black pepper and some seasalt fresh lettuce from my garden pesto from my garden a bit of mayo and mustard and some cucumber and roasted red peppers i've been known to add a grilled chicken breast to this too the less cooking inside the better in this heat romano and feta are from sheeps and or goat's milks too can you eat other cheeses that are not from cows' milk this post is already too long just know there's folks out here sending you tons of love and light you can
