i just found out i'm hypoglycemic what do i do i'm too young don't panic this isn't that bad hypoglycemia is when your blood sugar falls too low this doesn't necessarily have a connection with diabetes which is where you can't keep your blood sugar low enough all it means is that you need to be sure to eat small meals very often eat lots of whole grains complex carbohydrates fruit and veggies lean protein etc to keep your blood sugars at an even level avoid processed and refined foods as a general rule if it's 'white' don't eat it as these cause a very quick rise in blood sugar but then drops it just as quickly you need to have a diet very high in fibre with a moderate amount of the right kinds of carbs i would definitely recommend going back to see your doctor and a visit to the dietitian and nutritionist would be really helpful for you good luck and don't panic this is totally treatable and won't cause you any permanent harm Hypoglycemia Atkins Nutritional Approach Vegetarianism Nutrition Diabetes mellitus Dieting Insulin Veganism South Beach diet Hyperglycemia Food Dietary fiber Glycogen storage disease type I Stomach cancer Glucokinase Glycemic index Hamster Tooth Bread Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Raw food diet Carbohydrate Blood sugar Aspartame Omega-3 fatty acid Healthy eating Milk Coronary heart disease Binge eating disorder Crohn's disease Sugar substitute Breastfeeding Diabetic hypoglycemia Weight training Sugar Alcoholic beverage Gastroparesis Alzheimer's disease Insulin resistance Colorectal cancer Adjustable gastric band Hypertension Biotin Nutrient Domestic rabbit Obesity Egg (food) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sulfonylurea Soft drink Hypercholesterolemia Glucose meter Food guide pyramid Tocopherol Fecal incontinence Ramen Anorexia nervosa Carburetor Chocolate Protein Calorie restriction Famine Ferret Corn syrup Glucose Shit Urinary incontinence Sleep Coffee Dietitian Fruitarianism Biochemistry Carbon dioxide Kit Kat Stroke Calorie Food preservation Genetically modified food Brain Kashrut Chinese cuisine MyPyramid Alcohol fuel Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Soy protein Hamburger Glycemia
