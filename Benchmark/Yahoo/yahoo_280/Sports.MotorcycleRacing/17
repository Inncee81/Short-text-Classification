foggy mv augusta in wsbk's but with who it seems to be almost old hat that karl fogarty will be running a team of mv's in confirmed back in may but when interviewed on the grid yesterday he still played it coy he said things were almost in place and that he had no riders in mind whaaaat he must have his eye on a couple of likely lads who do you think he'd like and who would you like to see on the motocicletta bella yeah i'd like to see capirossi on the mv too so that's one seat taken haven't come up with a second rider yet though foggy seemed to go with fairly young guys on the petrona's bikes maybe he'd take one experienced rider and one young gun well caparossi would go well on that bike and maybe tamada he did very well in wsbk i do not think niel hodgson has signed with any one yet he has been testing and riding a honda here in the states i don't think he and foggy get along well this just came to me though ruben xaus was foggy's protoge' so maybe rubino would get a real ride next season but i know those bikes are expensive to fix Valentino Rossi Troy Bayliss Mountain bike Superbike racing Motorcycle 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2004 Formula One season Tour de France Recumbent bicycle Bicycle Ed, Edd n Eddy Jenson Button Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Ghost Rider Cycling Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Honda CX series Team CSC Bicycle brake systems Track cycling Bicycle lighting Grand Prix motorcycle racing WSBK-TV Jordan Grand Prix Lance Armstrong Aprilia Jak II Dressage Transportation of Los Angeles Mountain biking Cyclo-cross Jon Secada 2002 Tour de France The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bull riding Chris Amon Tom Simpson Bike lane debate Bicycle frame Horse All-terrain vehicle Triumph Motorcycles Individual time trial Mountain bike racing Liberty Seguros-W__rth team BMX Racing bicycle Jennifer Lopez Rubens Barrichello Snowboarding Motorcycle speedway Formula One Washington State University U.S. Highway 1 Switzerland at the 2004 Summer Olympics Netherlands at the 2004 Summer Olympics Single-speed bicycle Hey Arnold!
