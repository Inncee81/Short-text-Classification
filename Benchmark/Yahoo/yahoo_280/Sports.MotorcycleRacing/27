what is the difference between a stroke and a stroke dirt bike what's the difference between a stroke engine and a stroke engine gasoline and diesel engines are both available in either stroke or stroke versions in a stroke engine the sequence can be written compression stroke the piston goes up and compresses a fuel air mixture in a gas engine or just air in a diesel power stroke the fuel is ignited by a spark in a gas engine by being injected into high temperature air in a diesel the energy released drives the piston down this provides the momentum necessary to keep the crankshaft turning and make the other three strokes happen exhaust stroke the piston goes up and pushes the burned gases out the exhaust valve intake stroke the piston goes down and draws in new air or fuel air mixture ready for the next compression stroke in a stroke engine the last three strokes are combined into one compression stroke the piston goes up and compresses a fuel air mixture in a gas engine or just air in a diesel power stroke the fuel is ignited and drives the piston down as the piston goes down it not only turns the crankshaft but also pressurizes the fuel air mixture in the crankcase which is about to be admitted to the piston for the next cycle near the bottom of the stroke an outlet opens and the exhaust gases are released even nearer the bottom of the stroke an inlet opens and new fuel air which was just pressurized by the piston rushes in ready for compression because a stroke engine gets a power stroke twice as often as a four stroke engine it puts out about twice as much power and makes twice as much noise as a four stroke engine of the same size the downside is that because the stroke engine is sloppier about how it expels exhaust and takes in fuel doing them almost at the same time it is more polluting also the stroke engine lets fuel into the crankcase where the piston can pressurize it prior to intake in order to keep the crankcase lubricated you have to add expensive lubricants to the fuel and even so stroke engines don't last very long so stroke engines are used in chainsaws and lawnmowers where power weight is important but the engine isn't used for long periods so pollution and engine life are less of a concern the continuously used engines in cars and trucks are stroke engines Turbojet Jet engine Opposed piston engine Motorcycle Wankel engine Gasoline Engine tuning E85 Gas turbine Supercharger Motor oil Aircraft engine Chevrolet Corvair engine Spark plug Manifold (automotive engineering) Model aircraft Engine Gas compressor Napier Deltic Engine displacement Catalytic converter Internal ballistics Mazda Wankel engine Rotary engine Ford FE engine Turbofan Pulse jet engine Variable valve timing Stationary engine Automobile Automobile emissions control Ford Windsor engine Stratified charge engine Thermal power station Dodge Neon Hybrid Synergy Drive Aircraft engine controls Hydrogen economy Oldsmobile V8 engine Axial compressor Explosive material Compression ratio Brayton cycle Displacement on Demand Hybrid vehicle Hydrogen vehicle Harley-Davidson Suzuki Swift Atkinson cycle Miller cycle Engine cooling Torpedo Junkers Jumo 205 Alcohol fuel Energy development Pebble bed reactor Air gun Petroleum Diesel Radio controlled airplane Camshaft Fuel efficiency Scramjet Biodiesel Connecting rod VTEC Space shuttle main engine Engine knocking V8 Power station GM 3800 engine Alternative fuel Rocket fuel Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Expansion chamber Ford 335 engine Engine braking Glossary of firefighting equipment Toyota S engine AMC V8 engine Carbon dioxide
