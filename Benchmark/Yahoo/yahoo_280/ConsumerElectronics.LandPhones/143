is it true people with scanners can hear you on a cordless phone someone told me that cordless phones aren't good to talk on because people with scanners can hear your private conversations is this true are there any cordless phones that are safe what about cell phones can a scanner hear you on your cell phone too i will expand on the answer given by silence above early cordless phones used analog signals on the mhz band and could easily be intercepted by most scanning receivers and by some baby monitors that shared the same frequencies a little later cordless phones came out that were on the mhz band but still used analog signals a more expensive type of scanning receiver was required to listen to this band but it could still be done most newer cordless phones use digital signals and operate on much higher freqency bands the digital signal must be decoded in order to be listened to and this is beyond the capabilities of the average person while it would be possible for a highly skilled person to intercept your call the chances of this happening are remote early cellular phones were also analog and could also be listened to using a scanning receiver but it was much more difficult as cell signals are constantly switching between towers you could listen to pieces of different conversations but it was difficult to stay with any one conversation and trying to listen to a specific person was nearly impossible to prevent people from listening to cell phones congress passed a law saying that scanning receivers had to be blocked so that they couldn't listen to cell frequencies the problem with this law was that thousands of unblocked receivers were already in use and that most blocked receivers could easily be unblocked by simply changing some wiring the good news is that all of the newer cell phones are now digital and like digital cordless phones can't be listened to by the average person there are still some analog cell phones in use mostly in very rural areas but effective february of these will be discontinued so in the case of both the cordless phone and the cell phone unless you are using very old equipment you can be fairly sure that it cannot be listened to by the average person with a scanner Cellular network Mobile phone Cordless telephone Scanner (radio) Bluetooth Radio Telephone tapping Voice over IP Modem Wi-Fi Digital photography Ultra high frequency Television Covert listening device Computer virus Nordic Mobile Telephone Code division multiple access Telephone numbering plan Surveillance Amateur radio Telephone exchange Hearing aid Global Positioning System Loudspeaker Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Oscilloscope Phreaking Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting IEEE 802.11 Call for help MP3 North American Numbering Plan Digital audio broadcasting Shortwave Digital Subscriber Line Digital circuit AM broadcasting Global System for Mobile Communications Central processing unit Citizens' band radio Audiophile Digital Digital Visual Interface Gramophone record Radar RFID NTSC Cable television Social rule Broadband Internet access S__CAM Analog-to-digital converter Mobile phone radiation and health Barcode reader Electronic amplifier Advanced Mobile Phone System Circuit design Software-defined radio Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Musical Instrument Digital Interface Phase-locked loop Air traffic control IS-95 Integrated Services Digital Network Communications satellite National Weather Service High-definition television Nickel-cadmium battery Radio clock Password BlackBerry Digital television Transistor Avalanche Computed tomography VHF omnidirectional range Compact disc Walkman Advanced Audio Coding Secure Digital card Diode Low-pass filter Movie projector Federal Standard 1037C Sudoku Morse Code Digital AMPS Headphones Digital-to-analog converter SETI Solar cell
