why do people like magicmarker and holla m and brock l and mr magic always come here to rag on wwe fans it seems kinda childish to me i'm and still like wwe also would like to mention that mr magic is and he still does it i also like how they say that its fake of course its fake everyone knows that evidently they have no idea that ufc is fake as well the matches are pre determined just like wrestling what does everyone think of what i said you want to know what i think about what you said well i'll tell you i think you are absolutely right they were the ones who deleted my account so they should just get lost and go and watch ufc i like ufc but wwe is waaaaaaaay better x magicfarker holla m mr magic and brock l all suck if they like ufc so much then why do they always come to the wrestling section they should be in the martial arts section and stay there but i bet you the people in the ma section don't even want them either lol he maybe but he has the brain of a year old actually that's kind on generous to say that to them so i'll say they have the brain of a year old but again that still maybe too generous aswell it really pisses me off when they keep on saying it's fake yeah we all know that and who cares if it's fake it's entertainment they just can't get it through their thick heads that even though it's scripted the pain that the wrestler's go through is real starred well done brandon you tell them magicfarker lol holla m brock l and mr magic get lost and that's the bottom line coz the wwe tna fans said so Professional wrestling Ultimate Fighting Championship Brock Lesnar Kurt Angle Paul Levesque World Wrestling Entertainment Vince McMahon Professional wrestling slang Mark Calaway Peter Senerca Chris Benoit Shawn Michaels Ken Shamrock Professional wrestling holds Scott Levy Mixed martial arts NWA World Heavyweight Championship Eddie Guerrero Chris Jericho Bob Holly John Cena Theodore Long Hulk Hogan Tito Ortiz Total Nonstop Action Wrestling WWE Championship Paul Wight WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
