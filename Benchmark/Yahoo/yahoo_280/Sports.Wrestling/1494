tna's relationship to the nwa i understand the nwa from was where it was at in wrestling i get that i understand it gave birth to the awa wwwf ecw and wcw and world class it has legend its emorsed in wrestling tradition thats the reason tna chose tousis titles in its orginization but my questio is with tna no longer seeing eye to eye with the nwa why did it not just choose the uswa title as is predcessor orginization and lineage why not restart what legally remained of ecw why not do something that would last the uswa title has had a rich history and was unified with the awa and wccw titles at one point now tna has some cheap new title that isnt even as old as the x division title maybe that should had beeen made the tna heavyweight title yea a main prob is the nwa corperate entity doesnt own the thngs made famous under its name you had nwa starcade but wcw owned the lbrary of that and name things like that but the uswa would had been better for the jarrets to persue but i think lawler sold it to mcmahon to the first to questionairs your idiots who didddnt get my q right now the tna name has more meaning than the nwa name the fact of the matter is that the nwa is an empty shell of its former self the powerhouse company that really took the letters nwa to all time heights in the s and s became wcw and left the nwa letters to small independant companies Scott Levy Total Nonstop Action Wrestling NWA World Heavyweight Championship World Championship Wrestling Tag team Professional wrestling promotion Terry Gerin Scott Hall World Class Championship Wrestling Tommy Rich WCW World Heavyweight Championship Mark Calaway Chris Candito Pro Wrestling USA Extreme Championship Wrestling Virgil Runnels, Jr. United States Wrestling Association Page Falkenberg Randy Savage Sting (wrestler) Shane Douglas Ricky Morton Vince McMahon Elix Skipper Lawrence Whistler Jerry Lynn Richard Vigneault Terry Brunk A.J.
