to the true historian's of wrestling what was so wonderful yet tragic about the ultimate warrior thank you to the god of narnia so i will defeat the powers of the non believers and only then will the stars alline and i will be the true warrior so that my warrioirs can be warriors and then they will eat the life which is mine and ours and i will surviveeee these are the words of the warrior he had a great look a great gimmick and he was comfortable in front of a camera and the mike those were his good points his bad points he had some of the strangest interviews i've heard talking about taking planes down in a nosedive and some supreme warrior god and other weirdness it's like he took a few hits of acid every time he did an interview or something he also wasn't the world's best wrestler he had a lot of energy in his matches but his move set pretty much came down to punches the clothesline the press slam the body slam and the splash which aren't that hard to do he also held up the wwf for more money before a major ppv or he wasn't going to perform i mean who does that to me there was nothing tragic about the ultimate warrior it was just stupid decisions that he decided to make with his own life he made his own bed and now he has to sleep in it Warrior (wrestler) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Shawn Michaels World Championship Wrestling Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling match types Mark Calaway Extreme Championship Wrestling Kurt Angle Professional wrestling holds John Layfield Ric Flair NWo Four Horsemen (professional wrestling) Professional wrestling attacks Vince McMahon Professional wrestling slang Chris Benoit John Cena Paul Levesque Jeff Hardy Leon White Andr__ the Giant Glen Jacobs Hulk Hogan Montreal Screwjob A.J.
