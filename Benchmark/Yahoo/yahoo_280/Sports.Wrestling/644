what is the best wwe fued so far in here some i fink were good taker vs batista nitro vs jeff hardy mvp vs benoit edge vs batista khali vs cena hbk vs cena dx vs rated rko taker vs batista was good yeah beacuse they are both well batista isn't really face it's usually face vs heel at wrestlemainia so i was amazed to find out they'd done this match and what matches they had an gobsmacking last man standing match a classic caeg match and that great wrestlemania win for taker what a feud nitro vs hardy i agree this was a good feud because they couldn't be sperated in normal singles matches the wwe had to resort to tlc's and ladder matches for the intercontinental i thought it was a good feud for both superstars to show off their ability mvp vs benoit this was an alright feud but i guess it just never really caught my eye in thge same ways the others did edge vs batista no this feud was purely about batista it was predictable evry time a non title match came up batista wins every time a ppv came up edge won feuds are good when they are predictable khali vs cena this was before my belief in randy winning the wwe title and at that time i thought there was simply no point in anyone feuding with cena this was because all cena did was win and this was exactly the same in this feud but the bit where khlai knocked out hbk randy and edge was cool not knowing who it was until the end hbk vs cena what a feud hbk should be champion but of course wwe wouldn't let him cena was beaten at evry point by hbk until wrestlemania where the wwe scripters gave him a win but it was like another undertaker batista feud not knowing who wqs going to win at wrestlemania dx vs rated rko this feud was going really well until unfortunately the game got injured great q have a star WrestleMania XX John Layfield Randy Orton Professional wrestling match types WWE Vengeance Evolution (professional wrestling) Ric Flair WWE Judgment Day Paul Wight Taboo Tuesday World Wrestling Entertainment Hulk Hogan WWE Championship Carly Colon SummerSlam WWE Unforgiven Matt Hardy Chris Jericho Royal Rumble WrestleMania 21 Booker Huffman Bret Hart Chris Benoit The Rock (entertainer) Stone Cold Steve Austin World Championship Wrestling WWE Backlash Survivor Series Mick Foley Page Falkenberg WrestleMania X-Seven Professional wrestling throws Amy Dumas World Heavyweight Championship Mark Copani WWE RAW The Great American Bash WrestleMania Randy Savage Warrior (wrestler) WrestleMania X8 Roddy Piper Montreal Screwjob WCW Monday Nitro WWE No Way Out WWE Homecoming King of the Ring Virgil Runnels III WWE Intercontinental Championship Greg Valentine Solofa Fatu La R__sistance Jeff Hardy Brock Lesnar WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
