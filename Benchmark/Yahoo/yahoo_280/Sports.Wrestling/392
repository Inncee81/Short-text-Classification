how can you get batista's attention dont be stupid and say something about steroids im serious about this one so like if you are at a wrestling show and before it starts and you are at the back of the arena where the wrestlers show up how can you meet batista for that to happen you have to get there early just hope that you are one of the first fans on the line b c i'm sure they will be many others who will be there to see if they can do the same thing u are going to try to do sometimes what i used to do was go down the parking lot garage across the street from the arena to see some of the wrestlers i liked hope they are nice enough to give u a pic or autograph good luck in meeting batista Mick Foley David Bautista Paul Levesque Virgil Runnels III John Layfield Warrior (wrestler) Eddie Guerrero NWo Pro Wrestling Illustrated Ric Flair Extreme Championship Wrestling Shawn Michaels Mark Calaway Heat (professional wrestling) Stone Cold Steve Austin Matt Hardy Professional wrestling slang WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
