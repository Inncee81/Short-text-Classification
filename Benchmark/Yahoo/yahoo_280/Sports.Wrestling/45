percent of the questions here i am looking through the questions here today and i would say percent of the questions being asked are either degrading or inflammatory i am sure that if yahoo answers really cared about what its members were typing in and submitting they would shut down the entire yahoo answers forum because it seems that a few people feel the need to be ignorant and inconsiderate to others i am pretty sure that those typing in questions are adults or are teenagers who need a foot to the ss i cannot believe that the world we live in has no idea what common decency or common courtesy are sharing my thoughts again more of a rant than a question i am sure that this will be met with some negative comments and to those that feel the need to put those kinds of comments in it is you that i have directed this rant at so just remember that and have a nice day mr hickenbottom you have been reported i do not tolerate that language the entire yahoo answers forum needs shut down and restarted under different guidelines don't say i didn't warn everyone when i say i can see yahoo answers being shut down anyway because yahoo is going to get sued over something that was allowed to be said in here i agree with you i try to ask wrestling questions and answer wrestling questions only but those are few and far between very far between the who think's cena is hot and who hates who in this section i honestly try to help people know more about the history of wrestling the old school wrestling but most in this section don't care i'm not that old and i'm not on here constantly but when i am most of the things on here are ridiculous Theory of conduct Internet troll Have I Got News For You The Apprentice 2 Plame affair Professional wrestling Social rule Major League Baseball television contracts SMTV Live Rick Santorum Socrates Philosophy of language Kurt Angle U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Polyamory The Star Wars Holiday Special World Championship Wrestling The nature of God in Western theology Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Originalism Extreme Championship Wrestling Kill Bill Fan fiction Ranma __ characters Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2005 trial of Michael Jackson 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Freedom of speech Sampling (music) Shaggy dog story Landmark Education EastEnders Transactional analysis Advocacy journalism Jeff Gannon Nation of Islam Something Awful National Kidney Foundation Singapore Asperger syndrome Past teachings of Prem Rawat Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Singapore gay equality movement Sharon Tate Pro Wrestling Illustrated Monday Night Football Borderline personality disorder Mojave people British House of Commons Scopes Trial Philosophical skepticism Chris Jericho Wealth LiveJournal MLB on FOX Hulk Hogan Sex education Blog Hate speech The Marshall Mathers LP Leviathan (book) Bad Wolf Taxi Driver Survivor (novel) Internet phenomenon Peer review Abortion debate The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Reconciliation and Unity Commission (Fiji) Singlish God Emperor of Dune H2G2 Something Awful Forums Negima Paul W.
