how can i put music on svr there really is not a way to add music to a video game you can rip music to the xbox although i do not believe you can play said music while playing a game xbox and possibly the ps the ps you cannot rip music because it does not support that option as far as playing ripped music on the xbox and ps while playing a game at the same time i really do not know as i do not own or have really played either the thing with putting music onto a game is this you would have to re write the game code and this you cannot do for the console games pc games on the other hand is hit or miss and you have to know what you are doing so you dont screw up the game and have to reinstall it on your computer hope that helps PlayStation 2 Video game music Xbox Live Xbox 360 Video game console Computer and video games Dance Dance Revolution Xbox Dead or Alive (video game) Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Nintendo GameCube Computer role-playing game Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Karaoke Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto III Game programming Game controller Pump It Up Counter-Strike Rare (video game company) Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Game programmer Halo 2 Halo: Combat Evolved Mortal Kombat Bubble Bobble Modchip Console game Sega Video game developer Handheld game console Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Gradius The Sims 2 Need for Speed Console wars Sega Dreamcast MobyGames FIFA Series Action Replay Atari 8-bit family First-person shooter Nintendo Video game controversy Snooker Madden NFL Ninja Gaiden Square Enix Light gun Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Universal Serial Bus History of video games (Sixth generation era) Spider-Man (games) Final Fantasy The Sims Defender (game) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Game development Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Massively multiplayer online game GameFAQs Space Quest Electronic Arts Computer and video game packaging History of computer and video games Poker jargon PC Engine Amstrad CPC Bungie Studios PlayStation Portable Ubisoft Intellivision DirectX Sonic the Hedgehog Warez LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game Guilty Gear Star Wars computer and video games Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Puyo Pop Fever Sony Computer Entertainment Gothic metal Crash Bandicoot Minesweeper (computer game) Multiplayer Goatse.cx Armored Core ATI Technologies Microsoft WWE RAW (video game) Pinball BloodRayne Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Konami Code Pop'n Music Resident Evil King of Fighters History of operating systems
