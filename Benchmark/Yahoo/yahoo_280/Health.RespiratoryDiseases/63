what are the medical tests for ms multiple sclerosis ms is a disease that is extremely difficult to diagnose the reasons for this include more than symptoms are linked to ms and each person develops symptoms differently many of the symptoms mimic problems that occur with other diseases there is no blood test for ms yet symptoms usually come and go many symptoms are vague and hard to quantify such as fatigue sexual dysfunction depression and cognitive difficulties these often get attributed to stress by general practitioners and patients may never referred to a neurologist in my case the neurologist that finally diagnosed me estimated that i had ms for at least years before my diagnosis based on things that he saw on an mri sure enough i could think back that many years to a series of tremors sensory symptoms and cognitive clues which took me to many doctors including some neurologists but never resulted in a diagnosis things are improving on this front because of the increased use of mris which allow neurologists and radiologists to actually take a look at the brain and spinal cord for characteristic ms lesions however ms is still a very tricky disease to definitively diagnose and the process may require patience it is important to find a neurologist that you feel comfortable with and have confidence in to work on your diagnosis after all if you do have ms this person will likely be your partner in health for a long time diagnostic tests and procedures magnetic resonance imaging mri scan mris use magnetic waves to produce images of the brain and spinal cord a special contrast material gadolinium is usually injected for the scan when ms is suspected as it reacts to areas of inflammation and will light up when a lesion is active indicating demyelination is occurring the mri does not hurt but can be a strange experience it helps if you know what to expect during this test there are also some things you can do to make your experience better as mentioned this is considered the best test for diagnosing ms as abnormal lesions appear on mris in over of people with ms however of people with ms do not have abnormalities that can be detected on an mri producing a false negative and some age related damage looks like ms lesions producing a false positive medical history the doctor will ask a number of questions about the symptoms that you are currently experiencing and any that you have experienced in the past it is a good idea to make a symptom log before you see the doctor listing any sort of symptom that you have had in the past how long it lasted and other information about it list all symptoms even if other doctors told you there was nothing wrong in addition take all other medical information along including which prescription drugs you are on any medical test results you may have and other doctors findings you will also be asked several questions about medical history of relatives drug and alcohol use as well as other health issues that you may have had in the past all of this information will help a neurologist piece together a picture to help determine if ms is a likely diagnosis neurologic exam the doctor will be testing for the following functioning of the cranial nerves these control the senses as well as how you talk and swallow coordination strength reflexes sensation he will do this by having you perform tasks like touching your nose then his finger in succession touching you with various instruments and having you report a sensation or looking for a response himself and doing an examination of your eyes these tests do not hurt the entire test will probably last about minutes but may be as long as two hours evoked potential testing three main types of evoked potential tests are used in the diagnosis of ms each of these tests requires that electrodes are attached to your scalp and connected to an electroencephalograph eeg to record brainwaves in response to different stimuli the different tests are brainstem auditory evoked potentials baep a series of clicks are played in each ear through headphones visual evoked potentials vep a series of checkerboard patterns are displayed on a screen sensory evoked potentials sep mild electrical shocks are administered to an arm or leg the doctor is looking for both the size of the response and the speed in which the brain receives the signal weaker or slow signals may indicate that demyelination has occurred and that ms is a possibility however this test is also not specific to ms and abnormalities could indicate another problem a series of all three tests could take up to two hours to complete
