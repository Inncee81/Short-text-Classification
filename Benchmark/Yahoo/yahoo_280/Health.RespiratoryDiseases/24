could i have asthma or am i out of shape im average in weight ' and pounds but did not get much exercise when i was younger and would run out of breath doing simple things like walking up the stairs i used to think it was because i was out of shape but i am always out of breath i sat down to read for two hours the other day and could not stop breathing heavily sometimes i wake up to my alarm with a constricted feeling in my chest that doesn't go away during the day it has become a very annoying fixture in my life i have anxiety issues and the breathing gets worse when i am anxious but my symptoms are not exclusive to anxiety producing situations it might also be important to note that a parent is a chain smoker and smoked around me as a child i am now and do not smoke well it is best if you consult with your doctor first but on my opinion it could be either reason your body may not be used to exercising and you may not have a long endurance status and you just have to work up to it since you mentioned that you never got exercise when you were younger then again i wouldnt doubt the asthma part of it since i used to have asthma as well inhalers really do help since you have a constricted feeling in your chest as if you arent feeling that your getting as much air as your should be your lungs may very well be damaged from the second hand smoke you always breathed when you were younger thankfully you dont smoke now a sport that does help in both you situations is swimming first of all you said u didnt get alot of excercise and swimming is great for your body also it is great for treating asthma since it plays a role in breathing because you have to hold your breath as you keep practicing swimming then you will be able to breath longer and deeper and thats how i got rid of my asthma still an inhaler is great to have on handy Asthma Drowning Tobacco smoking Bong Anxiety Diving Pneumonia Lung cancer Urinary incontinence Rebreather Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cannabis (drug) Bronchoconstriction Fire fighting Breastfeeding Angina Exercise Emphysema Hyperventilation Cocaine Shock Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Methamphetamine Allergy Sauna Hand grenade Lung Hypertension Diazepam Panic attack Transsexuality Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Chronic fatigue syndrome Opioid Equine conformation Mojave people Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder First aid Cancer of the larynx Blood (computer game) Muscle Tai Chi Chuan Breaststroke Cigarette Smoking Man Milton H.
