how is asthma diagnosed what kind of test do they do asthma is in fact a clinical diagnosis based more on symptoms than tests it is characterised by a triad of cough wheeze and breathlessness sometimes accompanied by mucous production it is sometimes loosely defined as reversible airways disease pulmonary function tests are often used to quantify and check the progress of the disease but they do not define it and can often be normal the nearest to a specific test is perhaps the histamine challenge test where patients are subjected to a combination of histamine and exertion in order to produce wheeze again though this test can be useful it is potentially dangerous and always unpleasant additionally if an asthmatic is particularly stable at the time the test is carried out it may give a false negative finally asthma is much more a disease of young children than older children or adults the largest group of significant asthmatics are years old within these ages neither pulmonary function tests nor histamine challenge can be performed anyway Allergy Hypoglycemia Atrial septal defect HIV test Cancer Gastroesophageal reflux disease Myocardial infarction Wheeze Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Diabetes mellitus Myasthenia gravis Pneumonia Lung cancer Aspergillosis Sleep apnea Hay fever Traumatic brain injury Atherosclerosis Emphysema Homeopathy Coeliac disease Food allergy Pulmonary hypertension Autism Bronchiolitis Cystic fibrosis Prostate cancer Sickle-cell disease Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Medicine Bipolar disorder Cardiac stress test Ataxia telangiectasia Physical therapy Propranolol Goodpasture's syndrome Aspartame Stroke Psychosis Duchenne muscular dystrophy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pulmonary embolism Diagnosis Anemia Breast cancer Tuberculosis AIDS AIDS reappraisal Rheumatoid arthritis Pulmonary alveolus Anxiety Growth hormone treatment Dementia Prenatal diagnosis Controversies in autism Asperger syndrome Mental retardation Mesothelioma Duesberg hypothesis Alzheimer's disease Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Turner syndrome Immunoglobulin E IgA nephropathy Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Aortic dissection Histamine Angina Stomach cancer Psychiatry Syphilis Mastocytosis Autism rights movement Erectile dysfunction Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Dissociative identity disorder Fluticasone Group A streptococcal infection Chest pain Tocopherol Heartburn Motor neurone disease Medical analysis of circumcision Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Narcolepsy Leukemia Schizophrenia
