career as a respiratory therapist i'm currently taking prerequisite courses for the respiratory therapy program i wanted to know the pros and cons of the career to those of you that are respiratory therapist do you find your job as stressful or equal to a rn respiratory therapy is good because you don't have to deal with feces and urine you do have to work with sputum and blood if you don't like operating needles then you might have trouble performing arterial blood gases rts have more patients than nurses do you would have less one on one patient contact than as a nurse some nurses only have a few patients an rt might have or that's a lot of chest x rays blood gases and treatment information to remember i think the best thing for you to do is shadow an rt and a nurse chances are that your rt program prerequisites can be used to get you into a nursing program also from my experience my rt program didn't have a cut off there was not a problem getting clinical placements and i went straight through the nursing program at my college was bad for benching people on waiting lists because they had so many people wanting to become nurses it was very hard work and at times seemed impossible however i made it through with a lot of studying and determination compared to how my mom is when she comes home from work i think that rts are not as attached to their patients and therefore less likely to 'bring their work home' with them an rt program would be less difficult to get into less difficult to stay in and would get you a very good job when you graduated i would talk to nursing and rt students who are nearing the end of their programs to gauge how it was for them Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Physical therapy Prostate cancer Pneumonia Nurse Medicine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Stomach cancer Transsexuality Stroke Lung cancer Aortic dissection Dialysis Psychoanalysis Acute respiratory distress syndrome Asthma Medical record Insulin Reparative therapy Occupational Therapy Cancer Urinary incontinence Childbirth Bronchitis Alternative medicine Traumatic brain injury Paralegal Myocardial infarction Hypertension Dissociative identity disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Paramedic Migraine Intravenous therapy Multiple sclerosis Breast cancer Cognitive therapy Pulmonology Palliative care Social rule Emergency department Diabetes mellitus Cytomegalovirus Chiropractic Reflexology Education in Portugal Legionellosis Hypoglycemia Borderline personality disorder Folic acid Tocopherol Psoriasis Obstetrics Graduate school Rocky Mountain spotted fever Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chlorpromazine Addiction AIDS Tai Chi Chuan Traumatic incident reduction Post-traumatic stress disorder Aspergillosis Electroconvulsive therapy Group A streptococcal infection Milton H.
