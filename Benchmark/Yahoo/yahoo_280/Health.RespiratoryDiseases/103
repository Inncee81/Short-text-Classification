recovery time from pulmonary embolism does anyone have any ideas on how long the recovery time is i had a pulmonary embolism blood clots in lungs about month ago i'm fatigued but no chest or breathing problems there is no recovery time for the pulmonary embolism what you need to remember is the condition which you have recently suffered is potentially fatal i am not threatening you but it is true as per the study half the people who suffer pulmonary embolism would not show any symptoms at all if you have had an episode of pulmonary embolism you are always at the risk of developing another episode sooner or later i would recommend you need to discuss with your doctor about the options that are available to prevent further occurrence of this condition the preventive measures range from weight reduction reduction of smoking mobility using stockings and regular anti coagulant blood thinning drugs mean time if you experience sudden onset of breathlessness and chest pain seek medical attention asap please do not underestimate this condition hope this helps regards Pulmonary embolism Myocardial infarction Stroke Traumatic brain injury Pulmonary hypertension Asthma Decompression sickness Multiple sclerosis Atrial fibrillation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Air embolism Lung cancer Deep vein thrombosis Acute respiratory distress syndrome Atrial septal defect Pneumonia Hip fracture Tobacco smoking Intravenous therapy Emphysema Chest pain Apoplexy Oral contraceptive Coeliac disease Mesothelioma Panic attack Tuberculosis Hypertension Gastroesophageal reflux disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Childbirth Folic acid Paracetamol First aid Anticoagulant Equine conformation Medicine Sickle-cell disease Aspartame Anorexia nervosa Narcolepsy Diabetes mellitus Aneurysm Atherosclerosis Psoriasis Osteoporosis Lung Obstetrics Migraine Shock Miscarriage Stomach cancer Respiratory system Aortic dissection Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pulmonology Breastfeeding Repetitive strain injury Aspergillosis Obesity Medical cannabis Cannabis (drug) Anxiety Acupuncture Angina Abortion Physical therapy Urinary incontinence Malaria Sleeping sickness Cystic fibrosis Bipolar disorder AIDS Amiodarone Myasthenia gravis Mitral regurgitation Pope John Paul I Lupus erythematosus Psychosis Crohn's disease Turner syndrome Drowning Radiation poisoning Growth hormone treatment Parkinson's disease Electrocardiogram Schizophrenia
