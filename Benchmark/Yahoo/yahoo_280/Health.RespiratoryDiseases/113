anyone use the inhaler albuterol this is the nd time my doctor has prescribed me this inhaler i had congestion in my chest and weezing i have never used this inhaler because one of the major side effects is increased heart rate and it makes you anxious i am afraid to use the inhaler b c i have anxiety problems panic attacks i feel that if i use the inhaler and feel my heart beat faster it will cause me to panic to all those who have used this please let me know how you feel when you use it i have been using salbutamol albuterol since january and only once has my heart rate increased noticeably when it did it was because i was under a ton of stress and i used inhalations in about an hour to stop my coughing it worked alright but i was shaking and heart rate was in the 's in a few hours it wore off and i was fine what i did is not recommended and that's why i had a side effect taking more than your doctor prescribes can cause an increased incidence of side effects since you get anxious easily then you might benefit from xopenex xopenex is stronger than albuterol more expensive and is used for heart patients commonly because of the reduced incidence of increased heart rate i recommend that you talk to your doctor about your medication if you are prescribed something and you don't use it then you don't have any benefit from it albuterol is one of the most benign medications i know of it's the respiratory equivalent of tylenol for problems that it causes some patients do have trouble with it because of heart problems allergy and unknown reason for increased incidence of side effects they go on xopenex when this is known most people do well on albuterol Asthma Pneumonia Cystic fibrosis Myocardial infarction Prostate cancer Cannabis (drug) Drowning Clomipramine Panic attack Salbutamol Tobacco smoking Paracetamol Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Urinary incontinence Cocaine Lung cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Clinical depression Stomach cancer Childbirth Sleep apnea Hypertension Parkinson's disease Bipolar disorder Maprotiline Psoriasis Allergy 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Folic acid Tocopherol Insomnia Transsexuality Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Traumatic brain injury Hay fever Mesothelioma Medical cannabis Obesity Acute respiratory distress syndrome Hypoglycemia Anorexia nervosa Propranolol Medicine Antidepressant Tai Chi Chuan Haloperidol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eczema Gastroesophageal reflux disease COX-2 inhibitor Rebreather Bong Diabetes mellitus Migraine Growth hormone treatment Breastfeeding Meditation Asbestos Chlorpromazine Amphetamine Isotretinoin Cardiac arrhythmia Stroke Angina Medical prescription Shock Arguments for and against drug prohibition Atherosclerosis Insulin Amiodarone Diazepam Cardiovascular disease Coronary heart disease Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Multiple sclerosis Reflexology Health insurance Obsessive-compulsive disorder Multiple chemical sensitivity Alcoholism Physical examination Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Weight training Buprenorphine Aortic dissection Tianeptine Triage Baldness
