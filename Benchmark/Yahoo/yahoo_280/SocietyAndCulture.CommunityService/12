read the question and then answer don't bs i ask this question in many forums so here goes again and again and again i have my own beliefs and i keep them to myself they are not extraordinary by any means however i often wonder why so many folks feel the need to go to such extremes one way or the other this is not meant to discount anyone's personal beliefs i find it funny that i have to state that as a disclaimer hypothetical holy sh t please observe the word hypothetical examples you are uber religious and you believe strongly in something why do you feel the need to go with gusto and attempt to force others to conform to your beliefs if you're christian and you think that is a sin won't god judge that sinner in the end who are you to judge them in this life and why how do you feel yourself qualified to deliver judgment if you are an atheist why do you feel it necessary to belittle the belief of others you have your beliefs you are secure in them why antagonize please don't respond with yah i'm a and everyone i mean really an answer would be stellar let's go well i cant answer within your guidelines but i will say that i am a wiccan and we do not actively recruit new members rather we feel that people will be led to the path when and if the time is right for the individual also we believe that all paths lead to deity and each is as valuable as the next so we do not belittle anyone another reason we don't do this is because we believe that deity is part of every living thing on this planet there fore we treat people with the respect they deserve blessed be ariel Religion Atheism Goodness and value theory Salvation Strong atheism Charles Grandison Finney A Course In Miracles Magic (paranormal) Religious conversion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity God Theory of conduct Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sola fide Prayer Theodicy Predestination Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Supernatural Judaism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theology Witchcraft Ten Commandments Hinduism Evil Socrates Intelligent design Apostasy Sin Summa Theologiae Free will Creationism Angel Repentance Scientology beliefs and practices Reincarnation Jewish principles of faith Roman Catholic Church Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Meaning of life Transactional analysis Wicca Afterlife Homophobia Messianic Judaism Justification (theology) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Halakha Existence of God God and gender Infant baptism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Intelligent design movement The nature of God in Western theology Names of God in Judaism Religious Society of Friends Deity Eastern Orthodox Church Merit Prophet Philosophy Creation-evolution controversy Soul Origin belief Coercion Zohar Abortion debate Catholicism Devil Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sexual orientation Immanuel Kant Shinto Gospel of Barnabas Separation of church and state Neopaganism Historical persecution by Christians Alignment (role-playing games) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Monotheism Conscience Scientology Cult Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Polyamory Homosexuality and Christianity Gender-neutral language Catechism
