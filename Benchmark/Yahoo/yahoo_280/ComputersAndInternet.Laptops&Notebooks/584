can intel graphics media accelerator run these my dad is getting me a hp pavillion dv and it has the intel graphics media accelerator i know its not a dedicated graphic card and its okay with me i don't intend to play games on my laptop anyway i've got my desktop for that still i'm curious if it can run warcraft iii photoshop and adobe flash i've got gig of ram and it runs on vista would upgrading it to gigs help for those program and last would you guys happen to know if i can upgrade the graphic card on my laptop or am i stuck with it thanks in advance my laptop has the exact same graphics card as far as programs like photoshop flash it can handle anything like that fine but it certainly is not a gaming card it'll crash playing new d games beyond the lowest graphics settings i havn't tried warcraft iii but it's a few years old and i've gotten newer games to work alright set to graphics to low and should be decent but again don't plan on doing any serious gaming and down the line upgrading a graphics card on a laptop usually isn't worth it personally i use my desktop for gaming i've never found laptops very comfortable to play seriously with anyways btw more ram never hurts i'm not a vista fan myself check out ubuntu linux but if you must use vista with this graphics card i strongly recommend setting windows decoration to classic IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh Windows Vista Windows XP Personal computer Mac OS X Linux Laptop Computer and video games ATI Technologies Microsoft Windows OpenGL History of Microsoft Windows Atari ST PowerPC Radeon Microprocessor Windows 3.x PowerBook Flash memory Knoppix Microsoft Office X86 Bluetooth Amiga Xbox IPAQ IMac Commodore 64 Operating system ZX Spectrum X Window System World of Warcraft History of the graphical user interface Screenshot Macromedia Flash Hard disk Apple II family OS/2 Computer role-playing game Graphic design PlayStation 3 Java programming language Embedded system Pentium 4 Counter-Strike Doom 3 History of computer and video games 64-bit Linux distribution Graphics processing unit Computer workstation Ubuntu Linux Wi-Fi Apple IIGS CompactFlash Acorn Electron ThinkPad Redundant array of independent disks Read-only memory PC Engine Linux kernel MIPS architecture Adobe Photoshop CPU design Wintel RISC TRS-80 USB flash drive Windows Server 2003 Object Desktop Cyrix Universal Serial Bus Mouse (computing) Pocket PC IA-32 Game programmer GIMP PlayStation 2 PaX IPod NVIDIA Sound Blaster BIOS Commodore 128 Atari 8-bit family AmigaOS Space Quest OpenDocument Poker jargon Game Boy Windows 95 GeForce 4
