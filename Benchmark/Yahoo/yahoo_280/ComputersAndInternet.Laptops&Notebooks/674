budget and looking for a place to get a good gaming laptop well i have about thousand dollars and i'm looking for a laptop that is capable of playing most modern games i don't know a whole lot about laptops because i normally focus on desktops so i'm not sure what kind of laptops are out and about these days i'm looking for one that can play games without to much of a problem the game i'm really looking forward into playing on the laptop is city of heroes so if anyone can tell me of a good laptop i can get around then that would be awesome thanks city of heros is no longer high up there in demand so most newer laptops should play it but you will need to double check that your laptops video chipset is compatibal even if the video device in the laptop is strong enough it might not be fully supported besides that you normally need to pay two times the amount on a laptop so a laptop is only about as good as a maybe desktop which should be enough for that game anyhow if you really want a gaming system you will want to get a desktop for example very good gaming desktops cost around and if you want a laptop thats about the same your looking at but should get you a laptop that can play city of heros but future games will probably be out of the question because laptops have about half the life as a desktop because of the limited upgrade ability ekee a alienware laptop would be terrible about months ago the cheapest desktop i saw on there site was over and the cheapest laptop was like there very best laptops were around and were only as good as desktops maybe things have changed a lot lately but alien ware stuff is the most expensive you can get unless you look really hard plus most good in store laptops are over so i cannot believe an alien ware laptop being any ware near Laptop Personal computer Windows XP Computer Radeon Floppy disk PowerBook Apple Macintosh Universal Serial Bus Atari ST Mac OS X Windows Vista Wi-Fi ATI Technologies Linux History of Microsoft Windows Desktop computer Steam (content delivery) Computer bus Apple Intel transition Blu-ray Disc Advance fee fraud Atari 2600 IPod AmigaOS Video game music Video on demand Microprocessor Bluetooth Flash memory OpenGL Supercomputer Windows 2000 Redundant array of independent disks Sun Microsystems IBook Musical Instrument Digital Interface Slot machine Pentium 4 Desknote USB flash drive GSM services Inflation Internet Surveillance Oscilloscope Object Desktop Hydrogen economy Pocket PC Commodore 64 Television StarCraft Atari 8-bit family NeXT The Sims Hewlett-Packard INMOS Transputer Game Boy Advance Poker jargon Computer and video game industry Star Trek Customizable Card Game Digital photography Nintendo Mach kernel Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Supply and demand Computer and video games Pretty Good Privacy Broadband Internet access PC Engine 64-bit Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Apple IIGS Amiga CPU cache Overclocking Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Microeconomics Nintendo 64 High-definition television Pump It Up Civilization IV Space Shuttle program PlayStation 3 Stardock Mandriva Linux Neopets Alienware Computer hardware Celeron Digital camera
