what is the difference between sleep and hibernate on laptops what is the difference between sleep and hibernate on laptops sleep turns down hard drive cpu fans and lcd but will use some power to keep all memory in the ram hibernate turns down everything that means no power consumption at all stores memory in the hard drive that said with sleep everything is already loaded in the computer and when you 'wake it up' you just have to wait for the hard drive cpu lcd and fans to turn on usually that happens pretty fast with hibernate you will have to wait for all memory to move from hard drive back to ram and for everything else to start up so sleep is faster than hibernate but sleep uses some electricity hibernate is still way faster than shut down so what's the point of shut down well from time to time the system's memory might get corrupted and sometimes a simple restart won't clear it so you would need to shut it down vt you have the concepts mixed up Windows XP Laptop Central processing unit CPU design RISC IBM PC compatible CPU cache Embedded system Virtual memory Personal computer Booting Computer bus Apple Macintosh PowerBook Acorn Archimedes Overclocking Memory (computers) Random access memory Hard disk IMac Liquid crystal display Computer Atari ST Flash memory Microprogram Redundant array of independent disks Cray-1 Original Amiga chipset Sega Saturn INMOS Transputer Apollo Guidance Computer MRAM ZX Spectrum RAM disk Motorola 68000 PDP-11 PlayStation 2 Dynamic random access memory Commodore International Computer hardware Apple IIGS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Front side bus Sinclair ZX81 Page table Commodore 128 ThinkPad IBook Windows 2000 IBM PC Instruction pipeline Oscilloscope Read-only memory IA-32 TRS-80 Computer storage USB flash drive Atari 8-bit family Cache Sega Dreamcast Thread (computer science) Partition (computing) Advanced Technology Attachment Commodore 64 Acorn Electron Thermal power station Nintendo Entertainment System MIPS architecture Toyota Prius Diesel engine Vector processor Assembly language Canon T90 Static Random Access Memory Acorn Computers Computer multitasking Computer forensics Amstrad CPC PlayStation 3 PowerPC Atari 2600 Pentium 4 Sharp Zaurus Tandem Computers Data General Nova Screensaver Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Desktop computer MOS Technology 6502 Commodore PET Computer architecture TRS-80 Color Computer Hibernation
