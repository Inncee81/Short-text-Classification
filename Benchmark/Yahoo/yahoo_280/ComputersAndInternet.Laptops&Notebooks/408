laptop's keyboard some of the keys on my laptop aren't working properly they type a number instead of a letter does anyone knows how to fix it thanks well i'm not sure if this is what is wrong in your case but on some laptops and on almost all new ones there is a button used to access certain options such as changing the brightness of the screen by just holding this button down and pressing the other button down for example the button on my laptop is labeled as fn and is located between control ctrl and the windows button on the left side of the keyboard when i hold it down and then press the key it mutes the computer anyways what could be happening is that either the button is stuck or you are pressing it and then hitting the u key and it would type a instead of a u if this is true then try to pull the key out and re insert it Mouse (computing) Computer keyboard Laptop Keyboard layout Floppy disk IBM PC keyboard Windows XP Control key Blue screen of death PowerBook Game controller Windows 2000 Modifier key AmigaOS Beatmania IIDX Dance Dance Revolution Common User Access Option key IBM PC compatible WordStar IPod Oscilloscope Universal Serial Bus Unicode System/34 Function key Screenshot Control character Amiga Accordion Emacs Cheating in Counter-Strike Diacritic Visual Basic Mac OS X v10.4 Slot machine Desktop computer Microsoft Windows System/36 TRS-80 Touchpad Atari 8-bit family Control-Alt-Delete Dash Windows Vista Spy Hunter Computer Vim (text editor) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas C64 Direct-to-TV Manual transmission Danger Hiptop Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Sega Saturn QWERTY Control Panel (Windows) Opera (web browser) Resident Evil (video game) Elevator Enigma machine Konami Code Gradius Typewriter Nintendo Entertainment System Poker jargon IBook USB flash drive COMMAND.COM Personal computer IBM PC PlayStation Portable Bluetooth Password Digital Apple typography Liquid crystal display Pop'n Music Nintendo Revolution Apostrophe (mark) Keyboard technology Palm OS Commodore 128 Switch Object Desktop Computer virus Gmail X Window System Musical Instrument Digital Interface AltGr key Bubble Bobble Apple Macintosh HTML element GNU Screen Minesweeper (computer game) Class (computer science) Hard disk 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Perl File system IMac
