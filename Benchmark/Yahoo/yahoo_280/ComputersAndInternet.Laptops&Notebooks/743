toshiba laptop keyboard i had to reformat my toshiba satellite laptop and ever since i have had a jumpy mouse or keyboard it's seems as if the keyboard became super sensitive because as i type an email or letter the keyboard commands sort of take over for instance as i type a long paragraph the curser will jump to the middle of the paragraph or it will highlight automatically and as i type it deletes i am not sure if it is the mouse pad or the keyboard does anyone know what causes this or if there is something i can download to fix this i don't look at the screen as i type so i never notice where the curser jumps thanks there might be keyboard and touchpad drivers for your laptop go to toshiba's website and look for the appropriate drivers and download them Laptop Mouse (computing) Touchpad WordStar Bluetooth ThinkPad Desktop computer Keyboard layout Universal Serial Bus Opera (web browser) Computer keyboard IPod Hard disk Logo programming language IBM PC compatible Tablet PC Game controller Apple Desktop Bus Vim (text editor) Option key Windows 2000 Cascading Style Sheets Emacs Computer and video game genres AmigaOS Toshiba Greeklish Battlefield 2 Windows XP WordPerfect IBM PC keyboard Microsoft Windows Cheating in Counter-Strike Closed-circuit television Brainfuck Digital photography Screensaver Function key Esperanto orthography Computer Gmail Computer virus User interface MDAC Apple Newton System/36 Apple Macintosh Blue screen of death Desknote Dvorak Simplified Keyboard IMac E-mail Mozilla Application Suite Danger Hiptop Advance fee fraud Malware Mac OS X v10.4 DVD Personal computer Portable Document Format Cangjie method TiVo Intellivision Diacritic Atari ST American Beauty (album) Windows Vista Patent Apostrophe (mark) Device driver Musical Instrument Digital Interface Color Halo 2 TeX Flash memory GunBound Pure Pwnage 24 (television) IBM EIA-708 Pump It Up Mozilla Firefox Surveillance Minesweeper (computer game) Japanese copyright law Macintosh Portable PowerBook Stopping e-mail abuse Internet fraud Creative Zen IBM PC StepMania Wi-Fi Forth programming language Screenshot Commodore BASIC Macro Gorillaz Copyright
