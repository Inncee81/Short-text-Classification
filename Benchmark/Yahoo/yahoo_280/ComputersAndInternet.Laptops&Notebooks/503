ok i have two questions about laptops i use my computer every day it is better when i'm done for the day to have it sleep hibernate or shut down and why is it better to use it until the battery needs charging then do so or just keep it plugged in thanks i just want to maximize my laptop life and would like to know what will help ensure this sleep mode or power off sleep mode uses very little power saves the lcd monitor and the system can quickly come back up unlike starting from a power off state power off allows the system to dissipate heat and some laptop motherboards do get pretty hot after hours of usage hibernate is the worst mode attempting to store the complete system state to the hard disk and then restore it just doesn't work properly far too often it's most practical to leave it plugged in however if you disconnect from ac power and allow it run down to the point where the battery needs charging about once every few days you'll keep the battery well conditioned never allowing the battery to discharge eventually reduces your battery's capacity finally if there are electrical or thunderstorms in your area you should always shut the computer off and unplug it Laptop Universal Serial Bus Hard disk Windows XP Battery (electricity) Toyota Prius IPod Atari ST Floppy disk Computer forensics Personal computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Vacuum tube Liquid crystal display IBM PC compatible 2003 North America blackout Lithium ion battery Commodore 64 Solar power Thermal power station USB flash drive Protoss Redundant array of independent disks Capacitor Spark plug Hybrid vehicle Battery electric vehicle Fuel cell Computer STS-61 X86 assembly language Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Hybrid Synergy Drive Bicycle lighting Jack plug Daylight saving time Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Oscilloscope Apple II family PlayStation Portable Computer hardware PowerBook Microprocessor Renewable energy Atari 8-bit family Mouse (computing) Explosive material Circuit design Nickel-cadmium battery Steam (content delivery) Advanced Technology Attachment BS 1363 National Weather Service Apollo Command/Service Module Apple IIGS Windows 2000 Plug-and-play Nuclear reactor Wi-Fi Central processing unit Carburetor Action potential IBM PC Ford Ranger EV Tesla coil Nintendo DS Macintosh Portable Volt Kaypro PowerBook G3 History of Microsoft Windows Air traffic control Solar panel Surveillance Energy development Computer bus Digital photography Computer virus Canon T90 MiniDisc Game Boy Computer multitasking Wind power Solar cell Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Commodore International Thermostat Apple Macintosh AlphaSmart RISC Xbox 360 Plaintext IMac Internal combustion engine Advance Wars: Dual Strike Fusor
