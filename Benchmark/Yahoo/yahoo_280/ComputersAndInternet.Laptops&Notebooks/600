my laptop screen is damaged ideas on cheap replacement also how to measure screen size for replacement my toshiba laptop screen has been damaged i have found screens available on ebay but want to make sure i know the correct screen size do you measure just from corner to corner of the actual screen or do you measure the entire laptop top if that makes any sense because there is a border around the screen know what i mean i'm a poet and didn't know it okay how do i make sure i get the correct make model and everything i need to get the right replacement screen is there something from the laptop i can access that will give me all of that as the paperwork from original purchase is not nearly as accessible thanks for the answer it was helpful as far as laptop screens are concerned if you don't get the exact same model and make then it is possible that it wont work they are very specific with their connection so getting one that's not for the same model and make may not work for you measuring monitors are usually from corner to the opposite corner diagonally across starting from where the screen begins not the case update there should be a model number on your laptop somewhere look for that what brand is it look up those two information and look for a laptop on ebay that doesn't have a broken screen maybe a defective one with a working screen buy it then you'll have to find a way to take it apart and swap it out if you're not comfortable with it take it to a technician it's not easy let me warn you there are lots of small parts and very fragile wires that can easily break off Laptop Oscilloscope Redundant array of independent disks Floppy disk IPod Bluetooth Universal Serial Bus Desktop computer Mattress Surveillance Wi-Fi PowerBook Mouse (computing) Digital photography Computer Windows XP Hewlett-Packard Amstrad CPC Liquid crystal display Cheating in Counter-Strike Prostate cancer 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Hard disk PlayStation 3 Atari ST Violin Theory of conduct Personal computer Television Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Web traffic Rational Unified Process Apple Macintosh Software testing Best Buy PowerBook G4 Rail tracks IMac Lionel Corporation ELO rating system 3D projection Plame affair Windows 2000 Gross domestic product Randomness Commodore International Keyboard layout Microeconomics Light-emitting diode IBook History of Microsoft Windows Telephone tapping B-47 Stratojet Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind National Weather Service Windows Vista Apple IIGS Loudspeaker BlackBerry Handloading Gamut System/36 Halting problem RuneScape cheats DVD Computer security Kasparov versus The World Nine Inch Nails Call centre PlayStation 2 Second language acquisition Flash memory Spark plug Consensus decision-making View camera Collision detection Traffic light Computer hardware ThinkPad Management information system Atari 8-bit family PDP-11 Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Movie theater Electrophysiology GeForce 4 CPU cache AmigaOS Internet protocol suite Internet fraud Tire Gramophone record Ozone layer Pump It Up Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Escape from New York TRS-80 Corporate governance
