intel core duo vs intel core duo what is the difference between these two models of processors in terms of performance speed and quality when used in a notebook computer also when it is called intel centrino core duo is it referring to the earlier or the latter of these two processor models so which do you recommend pete and the rest for an engineering student stop stop stop pete nuwa you are totally misleading intel core duo bit processors t x t x intel core duo bit processors t x t x intel centrino duo this a label dished out by intel indicating use of a combination of intel products viz i processor core duo core duo ii intel chipset above iii intel wifi card bit computing is as yet evolutionary and should take awhile to standardize the core duo is a superior product to the core duo simply put generally speaking supports both bit computing as opposed to the core duo which cannot support bit computing but again that's not important both suit you fine for engineering applications but if it's autocad or similar you'll have to think on different lines check for self the various mobile processors speak for themselves http www notebookcheck net mobile processors benchmarklist html Central processing unit AMD Pentium M Pentium 4 Celeron NVIDIA Apple Macintosh ATI Technologies Centrino Xeon Pentium D CPU cache 64-bit Athlon Laptop Mac OS X CPU design NX bit Windows XP Wi-Fi Pentium Apple Intel transition GeForce 4 IBM PC compatible MIPS architecture Opteron X86 assembly language RISC Personal computer Radeon PC motherboard PDP-11 VIA Technologies Sound Blaster IBM PC Timeline of computing 1990-forward Computer Linux kernel ARM architecture Dual-core Sharp Zaurus Transmeta GeForce 6 Series Mainframe computer AMD64 X86 Wintel Intel iAPX 432 Intel Software engineering Silicon Graphics IA-32 3dfx Word processor Intel i960 Pentium III Embedded system WiMAX Mac OS X v10.4 Intel i860 Ethernet Cyrix PlayStation Portable HyperTransport ThinkPad Clock rate Northbridge (computing) Windows 2000 World Wide Web Benchmark (computing) IMac Intel XScale Apple Computer Digital Equipment Corporation Microsoft Windows Redundant array of independent disks Intel 80486 HTML Novell NetWare DEC Alpha Cisco PIX Pentium Pro OS/2 Modem NForce4 PC Engine Amiga Tungsten Handheld Athlon 64 Unix FireWire Lisp programming language Mach kernel Zilog Z80
