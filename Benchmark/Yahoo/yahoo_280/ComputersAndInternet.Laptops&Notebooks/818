itunes help how do i get my songs from my pc to my laptop my laptop is authorized it is on my network i can listen to the songs on the network at home but i can't get them to stay on the laptop when it is away from home network i'm taking the laptop on a trip i can't figure out how to get my itunes purchased songs onto my laptop ideas thanks if you import the song using itunes it doesn't actually copy the file it just creates a pointer to where it's located on the network itunes sees a network drive the same as local drive you should copy the songs to thumb drive and then copy them onto the laptop copy the itunes folder w subfolders for each artist from my music then drop the whole thing into my music on the laptop the pain is that you then need to go into each song on the laptop itunes and tell it how to find the songs the alternative is to delete the entire library on the laptop then copy the music files into the laptop then import the new itunes folder you have to think like a computer for this to make sense ITunes ITunes Music Store ILife IPod Online music store FairPlay Macintosh Finder Bluetooth Windows XP File system IBM PC compatible Mouse (computing) File sharing Digital audio player Apple Macintosh Windows 2000 Windows Vista Computer virus Digital rights management SonicStage QuickTime Universal Serial Bus Computer Laptop NTFS File Allocation Table We Belong Together Library (computer science) .NET assemblies History of the graphical user interface TLC System/36 Master Control Program Mac OS X Alanis Morissette System 7 (Macintosh) Video game music RealNetworks Podcasting Apple Computer Mac OS X v10.4 MP3 CPU cache Mixtape Disc jockey Copyleft Desktop computer Directory History of Microsoft Windows Hard disk Jimmy Eat World USB flash drive The Emancipation of Mimi IPod shuffle Computer forensics Jon Lech Johansen Partition (computing) Web page Tori Amos Linux PowerBook Mach kernel Rhapsody (online music service) Sun Microsystems Screenshot Backup Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Multitrack recording Btrieve Uploading and downloading Redundant array of independent disks Walkman PNG GNOME C programming language BitTorrent Floppy disk Xerox Star Remix Mac OS history Warez Gmail Bastard pop Marching band Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Vorbis Disk image Billboard Hot 100 Java programming language Copy protection Michael Robertson Plaintext NTFS junction point Shake It Off Copyright infringement of software Surveillance Wi-Fi This Week in Tech File folder Pretty Good Privacy
