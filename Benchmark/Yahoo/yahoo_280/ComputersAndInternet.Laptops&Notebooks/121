will a laptop battery get less powerful if you leave it plugged into an adapter for a long time keeping it plugged in at your desk for a very long time i leave my laptop plugged in except for the times when i unplug it to take it downstairs for a while this doesn't wear out the battery because lithium ion batteries used by all modern laptops don't wear just because you charge them without draining them all the way though some battery types will lose capacity if you charge them before completely draining them like nimh or nicd but li ion doesn't have that problem and your laptop will not overcharge a battery once the battery is full the laptop disconnects the battery from the charger and just uses it to run the computer it only charges the battery when the battery needs charged Battery (electricity) Lithium ion battery Laptop Nickel metal hydride Nickel-cadmium battery Battery electric vehicle Lithium ion polymer battery IPod Game Boy Advance SP PowerBook Ford Ranger EV Jack plug Memory effect Solar car Toyota Prius IBM PC compatible Hard disk BS 1363 Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Hybrid vehicle AlphaSmart Windows XP Thermal power station Personal computer Computer forensics Lead-acid battery Protoss Atari ST Cosmic Era technology USB flash drive Action potential Desktop computer Torpedo Liquid crystal display Bicycle lighting Wind turbine Spark plug Electric boat Macintosh Portable IBM PC Reading spark plugs for racing Lithium Computer bus Bluetooth Electrolysis Radio controlled car Nuclear fusion A4000 Diode Non-volatile memory Flash memory Unterseeboot 505 Plug-and-play Floppy disk Uninterruptible power supply CompactFlash Armored Core Wi-Fi Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Pentium M Second Battle of the Atlantic Membrane potential Game Boy Apple Newton MIM-23 Hawk Watch Galileo spacecraft Hearing aid CMOS Surveillance Apollo Command/Service Module Mass spectrometry Desknote Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Plaintext Game Boy Advance Computer Computer hardware Spacecraft propulsion Crown Court Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Ion thruster Diesel cycle Jump start (vehicle) Fusor Ionic bond Mouse (computing) Telephone exchange Turbocharger STS-106 PowerBook Duo Geomagnetic storm Xbox 360 2003 North America blackout Hydride AC Propulsion tzero Jumpstart 3rd Grade Microprocessor Carburetor
