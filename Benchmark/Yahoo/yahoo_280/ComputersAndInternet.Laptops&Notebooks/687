does windows readyboost actually improve performance i'm planning on getting a laptop for christmas with windows vista home premium installed with gb of memory however i ve read that its better to have at least gigs so i kinda have two questions now actually does using readyboost with a usb flash drive make the os faster and how hard is it to add memory to a laptop oh and this is the laptop i'm planning on buying http www dabs ie productview aspx quicklinx f y categoryselectedid pagemode navigationkey oh and no offense but i would not like any answer with get ubuntu thank alot hello as i can see you pick a nice acer laptop with turion x tl ghz with giga of ram video please read carefully very important that laptop comes with sticks of mb which means if you buy this settings your slots of ram will be full and if you later want to upgrade to more ram you will have to replace the memories already installed lets start now your video is shared video memory mb this amount of memory will be taken from your giga if you use all the of memory then giga mb mb left for windows right now i am using windows vista home premium on my laptop and only using the system resources plus internet explorer is taking mb lets count again mb left for other resources now been realistic i think you wont use all the mb of video but if you use mb will give you mb left for other aplications which is really a small amount of ram and will make your laptop feel like an old pentium iii i had a very similar laptop than the one you are going to buy and i replaced within a week because giga is a nightmare for windows vista home premium after that i replace it for a giga system which runs very good now lets talk about the readyboost the ready boost helps improve speed of windows vista but it wont be a lot more if you have a usb drive of gigas or that you are willing to use for that porpouse you can give it a try and feel the perfomance according to your needs i personally dont use it to be honest the laptop acer is a very good brand i myself have seen how good they are built and i have been in the acer building in taiwan on my vacations d the turion x tl processors is bits which will let you in the future run bits applications in the future it is better than the core duo ghz and is at the same level of core duo ghz in the tests in few words that laptop is a nice system but i really recommend you to use gigas of ram because i have experience the feeling of running giga laptop with windows vista home premium and later gigas my new laptop wish you can make a good decition and pick the best for you Windows Vista Apple Macintosh History of Microsoft Windows PowerPC Xbox 360 Pentium 4 Hard disk AMD Microprocessor RISC USB flash drive PowerBook Timeline of computing 1990-forward PlayStation 3 PlayStation Portable Windows 2000 CPU cache Overclocking Radeon Mac OS X Personal computer Athlon Atari ST PlayStation 2 MIPS architecture IMac Universal Serial Bus IBook IPod Nintendo Revolution Xbox TRS-80 Apple Intel transition Computer bus Mozilla Firefox Atari 8-bit family Amstrad CPC IA-32 Cyrix Computer Apple II family Linux Pentium M Bluetooth Random access memory Extreme Programming Xeon Dynamic random access memory OpenGL X Window System Sound Blaster Flash memory Magnetic core memory Windows Server 2003 Sharp Zaurus PowerBook G4 ThinkPad Mac OS X v10.4 X86 WiMAX ATI Technologies Microsoft Windows Acorn Electron Pentium III Wi-Fi ZX Spectrum Microsoft Office Redundant array of independent disks Floppy disk Embedded system Virtual memory Novell NetWare IBM PC Cell (microprocessor) Microsoft Memory card Mach kernel 64-bit Booting Burroughs B5000 AmigaOS System 7 (Macintosh) Super Nintendo Entertainment System Acorn Archimedes TRS-80 Color Computer Drill bit MAME Apple IIGS GeForce 6 Series PC Engine Supercomputer The Sims 2 Microprogram
