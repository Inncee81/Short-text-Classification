why do some people think hell is simply the separation from god and others think its an actual place that's a pretty big difference which denominations believe what i have no idea but they are both wrong it was an actual place but that place isn't there anymore forgive me for just cutting pasting in this from previous questions i answer very similar questions pretty frequently first of all the torah doesn't mention hell nor is that word in the the rest of the christian bible's old testament not in the original the tanakh it's gehenna or sheol not hell the word gehenna traces to greek ultimately from hebrew g hinn m also guy ben hinnom hebrew meaning the valley of hinnom the valley forms the southern border of ancient jerusalem and stretches from the foot of mt zion eastward to the kidron valley it is first mentioned in joshua originally it referred to a garbage dump in a deep narrow valley right outside the walls of jerusalem in modern day israel where fires were kept burning to consume the refuse and keep down the stench it is also the location where bodies of executed criminals or individuals denied a proper burial would be dumped like sheol gehenna is sometimes translated as hell which is fine but the idea of gehenna sheol in the process of translation and interpretation took on a bizarre eternal burning idea that has no basis in judaism at all it also had no basis in early christianity it was added much later as a threat for backsliders who would return to their familiar pagan practices and polytheistic worship Jerusalem God Bible Judaism Ten Commandments Sheol Biblical canon Jewish principles of faith Tetragrammaton Prophet Sabbath Pharisees Christianity Sin Angel Apocrypha Harrowing of Hell Names of God in Judaism Halakha Rabbi Trinity Baptism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Korban Deuteronomy Moses Yeshu Temple Mount Soul New Testament Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Great Apostasy Biblical inerrancy Talmud Mormonism and Judaism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Idolatry Monotheism Islam Fundamentalism Jesus Creationism Religion History of the English Bible Documentary hypothesis Heresy Henotheism Satan Solomon's Temple God and gender Cultural and historical background of Jesus Capital punishment Karaite Judaism Book of Mormon Eastern Orthodox Church Divine grace Sodom and Gomorrah Jewish Messiah Nontrinitarianism Devil Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Heaven Book of Daniel Genesis Nazarene Reincarnation History of Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mary, the mother of Jesus Historical Jesus Jew Arab A Course In Miracles Witchcraft Ark of the Covenant Holy Spirit Maimonides Samaritan Infant baptism Torah Temple in Jerusalem Prayer Christian Lucifer Serpent Old Testament
