surprise which tv network is the least gay http news yahoo com s nm en nm gays dc ylt apynpqqh dvkvkilq vq f the gay and lesbian alliance against defamation glaad has given the walt disney co owned network the highest marks of any of the five major broadcast networks in the group's first ever report rating depictions of gay lesbian and transgender characters and issues on prime time tv so disney owned abc network was the most gay friendly with of its programming hours to be gay inclusive cbs and nbc were rated fair with and gay programming so which network received the failing score fox at no wonder i like fox so much a funny quote i found interesting was glaad said networks and their advertisers stood to gain from more gay friendly programming as the gay community is generally more affluent highly educated and brand conscious than the population at large do you agree are gays more intelligent than the population at large and do we need more gay tv i'm not sure there is a safe chanel anymore almost all tv networks contain subtle messages to further the agenda of the sodomite lesbian community and why the heck does everybody call them gay gay is an english word for happiness joy and i'm tired of not being able to use that word because it is associated with a perverse lifestyle not long ago i watched law and order and they made a lesbian couple look like saints and the christian couple look like demons and of course the fact that the gay couple were laying around naked and taking naked photos of their yr old daughter well that was explained as therapy for her self esteem well thank you very much i'm done watching that program are gay people more intelligent and more affluent they are certainly more affluent since most of them don't have to raise kids and most of them are single and messing around with lots of people i am willing to bet that there are many gay friendly companies out there that give them priority for employment etc because they don't have to worry about insurance about spouse family taking time off for problems with kids etc i wouldn't say that they're necessarily more intelligent they seem that way because many of them are less stressed than people with families and kids who are barely getting any sleep and who are trudging through life paycheck to paycheck since the business community is no longer family friendly so in a way i say yes they're more knowledgeable about technology science and the things of this world however i feel that knowledge is far less important than wisdom and this is where we should excel maybe i don't know programming languages and i don't remember all the calculus i learned but i have learned quite a few things in life staying up with a crying baby investing in my kids by spending time with them trying to focus more on those things that matter in the long run Friends Ex-gay Gay rights Queer as Folk (U.S.) Laura Schlessinger Anderson Cooper Transsexuality EastEnders American Broadcasting Company Social rule Reparative therapy Fox News The Amber Spyglass Gay Current teachings of Prem Rawat Lesbian Will & Grace CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Television in the United States Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Major League Baseball television contracts The Walt Disney Company Michael Savage (commentator) Avenue Q KCAL-TV Autism rights movement Biology and sexual orientation Gay slang Social Security (United States) Plame affair CBS Intellectual property Graham Kennedy Family Guy Education in the United States Sesame Street Same-sex marriage in the United States Garth Brooks Science fiction on television Infantilism Same-sex marriage in Canada Homosexuality and Christianity Liberal Democrats (UK) The Smoking Room Gay community Past teachings of Prem Rawat Theory of conduct Roswell UFO incident Rush Limbaugh Divorce Homosexuality James T.
