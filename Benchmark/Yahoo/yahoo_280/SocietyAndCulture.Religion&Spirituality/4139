a man keeps coming to my dad's business and witnessing to our customers how can we deal with this my dad has a small business a car lot he has a great reputation and he and my mom run the business and they are both good christians well we got this customer who is a christian but i am afraid he misunderstands the bible on some key issues for example he helps this elderly lady out and openly admits that he does this because the bible says he will reap rewards for doing so that seems selfish to me and the wrong reason for helping someone well anyway the guy wants us to hold a car for him because he says he claimed it in the name of jesus but he doesn't have the money for it and he expects us to just hold it for who knows how long until he gets the money he keeps calling it his car and i'm sure he thinks we're faithless because we refused to hold it for him now the guy is coming at least every other day to our car lot and witnessing to our customers he goes and prays over them and has become a real nuisance how do we deal with this guy i am a christian pastor you said your dad and mom are christians your father needs to sit him down in his office give him a cool soda and explain to him that he can not be coming around bothering or praying for or witnessing to people on the lot it is a business and not a church or his home or as far as that goes it is not even a public place tell him that you do not hold cars for anyone christian or not and if god wants him to have the car god will provide him with the money to buy it before some one else does then ask him to leave and don't come back to the lot unless he is ready to buy a car if your dad is not that straight forward then he needs to get the help of his pastor which would not be a bad idea anyway at least to have him there or get the other man's pastor to explain the situation to him if that does not work then make a report to the police that you have asked him not to return to your property and if he does you have no choice but to have him charged with trespassing Sabbath Grandview, U.S.A.
