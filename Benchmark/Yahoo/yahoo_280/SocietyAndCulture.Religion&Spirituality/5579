this is a question to all my christian friends on r s i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me james my friends what good is it to say you have faith when you don't do anything to show that you really do have faith can that kind of faith save you if you know someone who doesn't have any clothes or food you shouldn't just say i hope all goes well for you i hope you will be warm and have plenty to eat what good is it to say this unless you do something to help faith that doesn't lead us to do good deeds is all alone and dead my questions to my christian friends if the state of mind becomes weak to follow saying no about good deeds does saying no even matter thanks in advance for your answers nd answerer thanks for judging me cj thats is such a fundie thing to say you are one to sit there and tell someone that they are trying to interpret the bible wrongly you are the kind of person that would see a homeless person and tell them that if they had faith in jesus then they wouldnt be homeless and try to convert them instead of give them food i on the other hand dont beleive in the free ticket to paradise you fundies do i beleive that good actions deeds and treating mankind with respect compassion and love will get you rewarded in the afterlife it makes me sick that christians out there say that faith alone in christ will get you to heaven and they dont have to treat others with love and respect and help out there fellow man im sorry but jesus taught love kindness and compassion to everyone and to treat everyone like they themselves would want to be treated someone who goes out there and dedicates thier life to helping others will get much further then just beleiveing in something and ignoring others for all you christians out there you are supposed to live your life like christ did helping others giving to others showing love kindness and compassion another thing people are saying on here that you cant do good deeds without beleiving christ well im sorry but that is just wrong regardless if i beleive in christ as my savior or not i do good deeds because it is the right thing to do not because i am scared of eternal damnation if i dont my parents brought me up that way not the church my parents taught me to respect others not to be ungrateful in life because others out there have it so much worse then i do edit pk no i havent been homeless and come across cj however only a fundie would sit there and respond with an answer such as that to a question like this the person asking the question is trying to make a point that faith without good deeds is nothing obviously by cj's answer he doesnt think that way in fact cj and a couple of others are judging the person asking the question if he was such a good christian then he would know not to judge others as only god can do that i have seen many of people with that mindset treat others in need with disdain and try to preach to them instead of helping them to answer your question more bluntly i was using a generalization which one shouldnt do but unfortunatly is usually the case Sola fide Justification (theology) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Abrahamic religion Christian eschatology Soul Eastern Orthodox Church Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Paul of Tarsus Religious pluralism Sin Merit God A Course In Miracles Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Afterlife Theodicy Theory of conduct Opus Dei John Wesley Resurrection of Jesus Summa Theologiae Holy Spirit Predestination Heaven Hell Baptism Qiyamah Church of Christ, Scientist Urantia Perseverance of the saints Charles Grandison Finney Nation of Islam Roman Catholic Church Mary, the mother of Jesus Christian views of Jesus Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Catechism Jesus Mormonism and Christianity Divine grace Ten Commandments Religious perspectives on Jesus End times Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Mormonism John Howard Yoder Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Alan Campbell (pastor) Maimonides New Testament Original sin Martin Luther Chosen people Gospel of Thomas Church of Christ Christianity and anti-Semitism Buddhism Biblical canon Articles of Religion (Methodist) Free will Atheism Christian anarchism The Pilgrim's Progress John the Baptist Five points of Calvinism The nature of God in Western theology John Wycliffe Unitarian Universalism Bible and reincarnation Calvinism Jehovah's Witnesses Fundamentalism Philipp Melanchthon Legalism (theology) Religious Society of Friends Athanasian Creed Love Criticism of Mormonism Homosexuality and Christianity Eucharist Adam-God theory Theosis
