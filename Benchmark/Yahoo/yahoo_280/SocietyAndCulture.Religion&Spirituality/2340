my teacher talks about christianity in class i mean i understand it is a history class i have no problem with that i understand that religion is a part of history the only problem is he's always crediting god and talking about his faith and how he thinks that catholics and other people are wrong im sick of hearing about it because i am an atheist i dont pay out of county tuition to sit there and hear him talk about what he thinks about jesus or any of the other fictional characters in the bible do you think im wrong in this i would call the cops but i live in south ga they would tell me to shut my mouth im a senior this year so i dont have to worry about taking his class again but i do have to put up with it for quite a while ok sorry i didnt put this but i go to a public school i pay out of county tuition because the school here sucks im and a senior in high school if this is a public school you don't say specifically though i gather it is you are right furthermore this teacher is violating the law he should be reported to the proper authorities probably the state school board in a public school this is absolutely not acceptable however for your own protection i would suggest you not do anything yourself tell your parents and let them handle it from their you will find that challenging people like this teacher will cause them to retaliate and this man is a hypocrite no real christian misuses his her position like this and such hypocrites will not hesitate to lie about you or even give you poor grades simply to get even so again let your parents handle this Intelligent design movement Teach the Controversy Church of Christ, Scientist Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Education in the United States Pledge of Allegiance Separation of church and state Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Ten Commandments Sin Atheism Religious conversion Boston Public Sabbath A Course In Miracles Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Affirmative action God Creationism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sola fide Creation and evolution in public education The nature of God in Western theology Separation of church and state in the United States Christianity The Pilgrim's Progress Opus Dei French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Supernatural S__ren Kierkegaard Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fundamentalism Phillip E.
