is assessing a person or a situation the same thing as judging i think what your problem with the question is is that you do not know what judging is all about everyone says not to judge but they judge what time they will wake up in the morning judge what they will wear during the day judge whether it is coffee or orange juice even both we judge everything whether we should drive or whether to pay the electric or water bill first we all judge but are told by those who do not know what the scriptures are talking about to judge someone is basically being one who thinks evil of your brother but then again christians believe that the old law is impossible to keep so then it must be groovy to think evil of your brothers therefore there is not any need not to judge because that commandment is impossible to keep too pretty confusing to be a christian i might add if you knew the law of yahweh you would not need to judge as when you see one stealing a candy bar you know he or she is a theif no judging there at all you know the truth when you saw someone spill the milk and they tell everyone that they did not do it you have no need to judge you know the truth and the judgment was already made by their breaking of the law they are a liar no judging there whatsoever but when you see spray paint all over your windshield on your car and you ask those around if they know who done it and they all answer no then you start to think in your mind who may dislike you enough or is jealous enough of your new car to spray paint the windshield must be mary or john because he well it could be george because he looked at me funny for wearing my new hat with the feathers and the battery operated lights on the top of it hmmmm it gots to be one of those rotten so and so's then you would be judging and showing your hatred toward your brother when you do this you at least can figure out whom you have problems with and what is keeping you held back from salvation because none who hate their brother can make the kingdom go make amends with them and work things out it is easier to do it while they are living than to try to get things settled after they or you are dead hope this helped some peace aintmyfault Sola fide George Costanza Book of Isaiah Drag racing Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Angel Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theory of conduct Good Morning, Vietnam Eddie Guerrero Justification (theology) Slow Train Coming Social rule Salvation Phaedo Beavis and Butt-head Sermon on the Mount Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Existence of God Devil Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Blood Simple Historical Jesus Ten Commandments Karl Rove Moral objectivism Fred Phelps Leviathan (book) Christian anarchism Friends Theodicy Lord Chancellor Ethics Microeconomics Socrates Knots Landing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus National Kidney Foundation Singapore Roman Catholic Church God RuneScape quests Ragnarok The Animation Paul Is Dead Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Shaggy dog story Christian eschatology Christian views of Jesus 2000 Australian Grand Prix Epistemology Parliament of the United Kingdom John Kerr John Wycliffe Appeal Happy Tree Friends Articles of Religion (Methodist) Biblical inerrancy The Apprentice 2 The Human Stain Bible History of the British constitution Dispensationalism Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Sin City Moral relativism Minor Discworld characters Supporting Characters (Xenogears) GNU General Public License Lie Prophet John Wesley One Tree Hill (TV series) 613 mitzvot Ed, Edd n Eddy The Usual Suspects Ecco the Dolphin AFI 100 Years series De Lorean DMC-12 Philosophy The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Summa Theologiae Blonde on Blonde Resurrection of Jesus Anti-Defamation League Amidah Terri Schiavo Toledo Strip Hearsay Alignment (role-playing games) John Howard Yoder Babe Ruth
