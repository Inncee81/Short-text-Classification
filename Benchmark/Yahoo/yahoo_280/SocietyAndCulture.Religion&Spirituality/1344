what is a scientific theory my understanding is that the theory is about how something works not if it exists no one denies that gravity exists but the theory is our best understanding of how it works no one denies germs exist but the theory is our best explanation of how they work and of course no one with a rudimentary understanding of earth science denies that evolution exists but the theory is our understanding of how it works am i correct that theories change as we learn more about how things work animalmother newton's theory of gravitation is that every mass attracts every other mass by a force pointing along the line combining the two and that the force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the point masses the law to which you refer is used to calculate the gravitational force between the two masses it is a part of what makes up the theory within the theory of evolution a comparable law would be mendel's second law the law of independent assortment that states during gamete formation the segregation of the alleles of one allelic pair is independent of the segregation of the alleles of another allelic pair this fact helps understand how evolution works if you are open minded then as you test your theory you let the evidence data speak for itself which many times means refining the theory Gravity Planetary orbit Evolution Mass Molecular evolution Big Bang Force Modified Newtonian dynamics Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Hardy-Weinberg principle Mendelian inheritance Black hole Kepler's laws of planetary motion Scientific method General relativity Potential energy Gravitational radiation Physics Special relativity Gravitational constant Tide Equivalence principle Theory Supernatural Newton's laws of motion Escape velocity Faster-than-light History of science Electric field Physical cosmology Solar system Spacecraft propulsion Luminiferous aether Philosophy of space and time Philosophy of science Genetic linkage Energy Tests of general relativity Planck units Gene Francis Crick Causality Race Atomism Age of the Earth Isaac Newton Dark matter Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Astronomy Magnet Scientific revolution Sociocultural evolution The writing of Principia Mathematica Non-standard cosmology Supernova Exotic matter Classical mechanics Evolutionism Intelligent design Creationist cosmologies Falsifiability Open cluster Standard Model History of physics Physical law Mathematics of general relativity Two-body problem Time travel Flood geology Weight Trajectory Anti-gravity Johannes Kepler Stellar evolution Celestial mechanics Timeline of the Universe Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace History of evolutionary thought Principle of relativity Origin belief Renormalization The Origin of Species Coulomb's law History of creationism LeSage gravity Particle physics Velocity Occam's Razor Dark energy Planet Gamma ray burst Sun
