oh the irony lorreign's questions about pre marital sex prompted this one when i first met my common law husband years ago we knew there was something there it was unmistakable with every intention of eventually marrying we did indeed have pre marital sex only thing is it ended up being a love hate thing still is i still believed in god for quite a few years after having met my baby and that belief was what caused me to not marry him i just couldn't imagine swearing an oath before god that i would stay with him for the rest of my life i was afraid i would break it it's been years now and kids and we're still together my question is is this worse than getting married a virgin having god sanctioned lol kids and then getting divorced are kids hurt a little less hurt by their parents' break up when there's a piece of paper involved will god forgive me for having stayed with the same man and raised our children together without that piece of paper i couldn't handle birth control pills wuzzle they really screwed me up when i tried using them anyhow i was quite confident that he wasn't going anywhere still am cat eyes jack b love you babe it's the relationship that counts not the piece of paper ask any of the numerous gay couples who have been together for years in loving committed relationships without benefit of legal marriage zilla EastEnders Same-sex marriage Religion and sexuality One Tree Hill (TV series) Days of our Lives Infantilism Knots Landing Polyamory Sex and the City Ten Commandments Polygamy Laura Schlessinger Divorce Human sexual behavior Birth control Jon Secada Another World (TV series) Friends Eastern Orthodox Church Neighbours Fathers' rights Plame affair Common-law marriage Dead Like Me Humphrey Bogart Babe Carey Same-sex marriage in Canada Piccolo Junior Saga Jewish view of marriage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Recurring South Park characters Theodicy Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Sin City 2005 trial of Michael Jackson History of sex Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Adoption Charmed Boston Public Luke and Laura Spencer Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Children of God Homosexuality and Judaism Lawrence v.
