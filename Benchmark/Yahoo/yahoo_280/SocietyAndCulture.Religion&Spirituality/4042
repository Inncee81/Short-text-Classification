i'm confused about my religion so here's the deal i used to be lutheran went to church got confirmed all that stuff then a few months ago i really thought about things i do not believe there is a god that can create all and answer prayers i also do not believe the bible or the acts that jesus did i do think there may be some kind of god though going to heaven or hell when you die just seems so unreal to me i can't even contemplate or think about being in either place 'forever' my grandmother is very religious and has told me stories of the religious like conventions and lands she has gone to where people exclaim they see jesus mary ect this makes me want to change my mind about what i believe in i would say i'm agnostic but i really don't know so any help would be great as long as you don't try to convince me to be something else leave rude answers or tell me i'm wrong all i want is to know what religion best fits me i'm not asking for someone to pick a religion for me i just want to know where i fit in based on the information i gave your story or explanation above could have been written by me i am confused about certain things that the lutheran church has taught me and i went through my confirmation i know this is bad more so for my mom to make her look good then i did because i really wanted to confirm that faith i stood up at the alter and felt like a fraud i was repeating the words supposedly confirming my faith in the lutheran church and i really wasn't sure like you i believe it's possible god exists but i question some of the teachings of the bible the bible has been translated so many times and carried down for many many years how can we know for certain that the stories are accurate i do believe that jesus existed and evidence shows that he did walk the earth what i will suggest to you is what i tell myself do not totally abandon the idea that god exists and do not judge those who identify themselves as christian or any other formal religion keep an open mind and keep searching for the truth it will one day find you God Religion Ten Commandments Book of Mormon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christianity Atheism Fundamentalism Sabbath Sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Roman Catholic Church Church of Christ, Scientist Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Trinity Soul Baptism New Testament Biblical canon Lutheranism Holy Spirit The nature of God in Western theology Biblical inerrancy Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Resurrection of Jesus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abrahamic religion Great Apostasy Spiritism Evil Angel Meaning of life Theology Urantia Religious pluralism Liberal Christianity Charles Darwin's views on religion Young Earth creationism Christian eschatology Divine grace Justification (theology) Apostles' Creed Infant baptism Baptist Gospel of Thomas Separation of church and state Origin belief Nontrinitarianism Mary, the mother of Jesus A Course In Miracles Jesus History of the English Bible Apocrypha Slow Train Coming Evolutionary creationism Historicity of Jesus Agnosticism Sola fide Prophet Theodicy Second Vatican Council Mormonism Immortality Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Church of Christ Jehovah's Witnesses Existence of God Christian-Jewish reconciliation Teach the Controversy Protestantism Predestination Christian views of Jesus Merit Joseph Smith, Jr. Idolatry Calvinism Creation science Mormonism and Christianity Scientology beliefs and practices Prayer Hell George Fox Exorcism John Wycliffe Rapture Creation-evolution controversy Christianity and anti-Semitism Christian apologetics Opus Dei
