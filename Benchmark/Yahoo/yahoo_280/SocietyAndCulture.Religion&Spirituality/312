why should we keep marriage vows that we are blackmailed into making give us an option of getting married hon estly and we will take it but the only course to marriage at the moment is make vows many don't believe in for example you may agree to love your partner for life but that should not imply that you cannot have another partner sexually which is not the same thing as love a physical act to relieve tension or obtain pleasure should be welcomed by the other partner who wants the best for his loved one no one should be getting married if they feel the vows are a form of blackmail vows are made by a persons own free choice they can write or say their own if they wish so if both parties are willing there is nothing to stop them vowing to love each other yet not neccessarily vow to remain faithful physically Infantilism Sexual orientation Sexual abstinence Marriage Same-sex marriage in Canada Clerical celibacy Roman Catholic Church Same-sex marriage Eastern Orthodox Church Interpersonal relationship Homosexuality and Christianity Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Contract Domestic violence Coercion S__ren Kierkegaard Days of our Lives BDSM Royal Assent Sexual intercourse Evil Sharon Tate The Emancipation of Mimi Love Vow Homosexuality Lex Luthor Incarnations of Immortality The O.C.
