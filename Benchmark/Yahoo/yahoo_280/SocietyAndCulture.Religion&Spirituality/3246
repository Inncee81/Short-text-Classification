how is life with belief in god any better than life without belief in god for some of you who sayid hope do you mean atheists do not hope i think hoping good is in human nature personally i am agnostic so basically that means i have not made up mind on the existence of god but from what i can see people who do believe i god do have a somewhat easier of time of dealing with the big tragedies in life whether their faith is blind or real or half hearted they have that faith to turn to in their hour of need for non believers i do be live it is harder for them to accept the painful parts fo life but for non believers they do have more open minds and have learned to think for themselves rather than allowing the church to tell them what they can and can not believe in so it's a toss up as to who has it easier so to speak and neither is better than the other just different with different issues to deal with The nature of God in Western theology Existence of God Alcoholics Anonymous Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Christianity Religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Atheism Agnosticism Supernatural Scientology beliefs and practices Evil Justification (theology) Afterlife God Theodicy Salvation Eastern Orthodox Church Evolutionary creationism Religious conversion Jewish principles of faith Faith Religious Society of Friends The relationship between religion and science Christian eschatology Sola fide Pascal's Wager Origin belief Nihilism Infant baptism InterFaith Problem of Hell Holy Spirit Heaven S__ren Kierkegaard Deism Charles Darwin's views on religion Trinity Reconstructionist Judaism Friedrich Schleiermacher Urantia Philosophy of religion Church of Christ, Scientist Roman Catholic Church Immortality Meaning of life Soul A Course In Miracles Creationism Prophet Predestination Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses John Howard Yoder God and gender Moral objectivism New Testament Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Jewish philosophy Theology Jewish Messiah Sin Scientific skepticism Messianic Judaism Summa Theologiae Separation of church and state Hindu philosophy Protestantism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theory of conduct Simone Weil The Brothers Karamazov Poker jargon Betting (poker) Humanism Abrahamic religion Unitarian Universalism Phillip E.
