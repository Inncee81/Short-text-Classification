christians if the jews are god's chosen people why do you keep following your religion of christianity can't you all convert and become chosen people snowboarder wrong guess i am an atheist lol the jews are god's chosen but they did not see christ as being the messiah if you read the bible you will see that christ will come again at the end of the world and the city of jerusalem will be the site of his throne which also is seen by many as the traditional home of the jews with the great temple of solomon in the end all who have lived a good life mindful of god will be his chosen i do not see any difference in following modern christianity than the judaism that christ and his apostles followed because he updated it to the new traditions followed now by christianity as said above we have our major roots in judaism and our christ was a jew so i find no problem in following the religion of christianity Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Judaism Abrahamic religion Sin Messianic Judaism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Pharisees Bible Jewish Messiah Prophet Christian eschatology Holy Spirit Sabbath Religious conversion Paul of Tarsus Jewish views of religious pluralism Apostle Ten Commandments Historicity of Jesus Temple in Jerusalem Judeo-Christian Book of Mormon Nazarene David End times Jewish principles of faith Messiah Baptism Christian-Jewish reconciliation New Testament view on Jesus' life Christianity and anti-Semitism God Christian God and gender Old Testament Second Coming Chosen people Rastafari movement Supersessionism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Names and titles of Jesus Pauline Christianity Tetragrammaton Religion Jerusalem Jewish eschatology Dispensationalism Cultural and historical background of Jesus Trinity Religious perspectives on Jesus Original sin Predestination Christian denomination Heaven Names of God in Judaism Missionary Acts of the Apostles Apocrypha Judas Iscariot Conservative Judaism Summary of Christian eschatological differences Pilgrimage Resurrection of Jesus Divine grace Hebrew calendar Noahide Laws New Testament Fundamentalism Great Apostasy Halakha Monotheism Eschatology Soul Reform Judaism Christian views of Jesus Mormonism and Judaism Religion in Israel Christian Identity Sanhedrin Tribulation Clergy Israelite Barabbas Reconstructionist Judaism Persecution of Christians Mary, the mother of Jesus Book of Revelation Gospel of Matthew Second Vatican Council Icon
